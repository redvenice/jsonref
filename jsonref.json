Narendra Modi taking part in a yoga session to mark International Yoga Day in DehradunNarendra joined the BJP in 1987 and soon became the General Secretary of the Gujarat branch, influential in ensuring that the party’s presence was strong in the following years. Three years after joining, he participated in a coalition government and helped to achieve success in the 1995 state legislative assembly elections.Despite the BJP’s control over the Indian government being short-lived, only lasting a few months in 1996, Modi was made the secretary of the BJP’s national organisation in New Delhi and three years later, appointed the General Secretary.However, because of fellow BJP member and Gujarat Chief Minister Keshubhai Patel’s poor response to the Bhuj earthquake in 2000, that killed more than 20,000 people, Modi replaced him and went on to enter his first-ever electoral contest in February 2002, which he went on to win and take a seat in the state assembly.Modi’s political career was then marred with controversy and scandal: his role during the Gujarat riots in 2002 were questioned and he was accused of condoning violence, or at least, not doing enough to stop the killing of over 1,000 people, mostly Muslims.          Theresa May and Narendra Modi arrive for a photograph ahead of the India-U.K. Tech SummitIn 2005, the US declined to issue him a diplomatic visa on the grounds that he was responsible for these riots and the UK also criticised him for this. While Modi escaped without any indictment, his close associates were found guilty of complicity and were jailed.His government has also been accused of extrajudicial killings: one case resulting the deaths of a woman and three men, members of the Pakistan-based terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba, involved in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, were alleged to have been plotting to assassinate Modi.Modi was soon indispensable to the BJP and under his leadership, the party secured victory in 2002 after winning 127 of the 182 seats in the chamber and again in 2007 before prevailing again in 2012. Both times he won his contests and returned as Chief Minister.          Justin Trudeau, Bill Gates, Barack Obama, Francois Hollande and Narendra Modi poseModi speechIn Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech, he hailed India’s rise under his government and said that ‘policy paralysis’ during the UPA rule was over, according to The Times of India. From the Red Fort, Modi spent 88 minutes addressing his nation and explored burning issues.‘When 125 crore people move towards achieving a goal, there is nothing that cannot happen. In 2014, the people of the country did not just stop at forming the government. They moved together towards nation-building and are contributing to do so.’After showcasing his achievements, he stated that ‘India was earlier a sleeping elephant which has woken up now and started running’ and went on to quote Tamil nationalist icon Subramania Bharti to say in Tamil, ‘India will show the path to the world.‘I am restless, I am agitated and I am also impatient for my country to lead the fourth industrial revolution, the revolution that is based on knowledge, the revolution which will be led by those who have IT skills. I am impatient for my county to lead it.’          Former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, former Deputy L.K. Advani and Narendra Modi picturedHe also announced the rollout of the Ayushman Bharat-National Health Protection Scheme, which has been described as the world’s largest healthcare measure and will cover 500 million people, providing a cover of 500,000 rupees (£5,600) per family a year.In addition to discussing the commissioning of women in the armed forces, he spoke about the recent incidents of rape, but made no mention of the hot topic being debated in this country at the moment of lynching.Modi also promised that he would send a manned flight into space by 2022 and become the fourth country to achieve this. India is currently the sixth-largest economy in the world and Modi said that international institutions will see the subcontinent as as engine to strengthen the world economy for the next three decades.He will seek another five-year term for his party at elections due by March-April next year.Narendra Modi net worthWhile Narendra Modi may be the leader of the sixth-largest economy in the world, he only keeps a measly Rs 4,700 (£55) as cash in hand.His total assets are worth Rs 14 million (£16,000) because of a property he owns in Gandhinagar, the value of which has increased by more than 25 times since it was purchased 13 years ago, according to Mashable.He does not own any vehicles, aircrafts, yachts or ships and while he has no loans, Modi owns four gold rings, which are worth Rs 1,19,000 (£1380). It was also revealed that he was one of the most modestly-paid world leaders and earned a salary of Rs 1.9 million (£24,000).Madonna music: Like A Virgin singer\u0027s best songs revealed on her 60th birthdayPornhub gives Indian users a week\u0026#8217s free membership on Independence DayFortnite update 1.72: Epic Games launch new PS4 and Android patch for v5.21 releaseAsian Games 2018: All you need to knowDele Alli celebration: How to do it and what does it mean?Guava Island: Are Rihanna and Childish Gambino starring in a film together?Who is Aishwarya Rai Bachchan?

CIA Director John Brennan testifying before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearingJohn Brennan CIABrennan served with the Directorate of Intelligence (DI) before working for the State Department as a Political Officer at the US Embassy in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and went on to direct terrorism analysis at the Director of Central Intelligence’s Counterterrorism Center in the 1990s.According to Britannica, he then acted as the CIA’s daily intelligence briefer under former President Bill Clinton before serving as the agency’s chief of station in Saudi Arabia, as Chief of Staff to CIA Director George Tenet and the CIA’s Deputy Executive Director.Before retiring from the CIA in 2005, he led efforts for the formation of an organisation that would become the National Counterterrorism Centre and was an interim director. Brennan then took on a role as President and CEO of the Analysis Corporation and Chairman of the Board at the Intelligence and National Security Alliance, but this was short-lived.Following this, while former President Barack Obama found that he shared similar philosophies when it came to the CIA, Brennan’s involvement in enhanced interrogation techniques working under President George W. Bush, he was not appointed as head of the agency.          President Barack Obama and former Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel, listen to John BrennanInstead, Brennan was made Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism and Cyberattacks for around four years and in this role, helped to share US policy in response to a number of different events.He also oversaw the CIA’s use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, that were used to target terrorists in Pakistan and Yemen. However, this and his involvement in methods such as waterboarding during the Bush era were called into question with Obama nominated him to lead the CIA in 2013.Brennan said that he was against waterboarding and despite this, his appointment was approved by the Senate 63-34. As reported by Reuters, during his tenure, Brennan created ten new mission centres so that the CIA could focus on cyberthreats.In 2017, he also briefed Trump, along with James Comey, Mike Rogers and James Clapper, on the findings in regards to Russian election interference and the allegations contained in the Steele dossier, as reported by CBS News.Before he left office, Brennan was open about how he felt about the current US President and said: ‘I don\u0027t think he has a full appreciation of Russian capabilities, Russia\u0027s intentions and actions that they are undertaking in many parts of the world. Brennan stated that it was outrageous that Trump was equating the intelligence community with Nazi Germany”.’John Brennan is married to Kathy Pokluda Brennan, also of North Bergen and is the father of a son and twin daughters.John Brennan on TrumpJohn Brennan hit back at Trump after he ordered that his security clearance should be revoked and wrote that the President’s campaign had colluded with Moscow to win in the 2016 election. Trump said that this decision was made because of Brennan’s ‘erratic conduct’ and ‘outrageous allegations’, according to the BBC. Trump cited that the Department of Justice’s inquiry into Russia’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 US election was the reason why Brennan’s clearance was revoked.However, in the NYT piece that Brennan wrote, he said that his clearance was a politically motivated ‘attempt to scare into silence’ other critics of the President. He continued: ‘Mr Trump’s claims of no collusion are, in a word, hogwash.’Madonna music: Like A Virgin singer\u0027s best songs revealed on her 60th birthdayPornhub gives Indian users a week\u0026#8217s free membership on Independence DayFortnite update 1.72: Epic Games launch new PS4 and Android patch for v5.21 releaseAsian Games 2018: All you need to knowDele Alli celebration: How to do it and what does it mean?Guava Island: Are Rihanna and Childish Gambino starring in a film together?Who is Aishwarya Rai Bachchan?

Salman Abedi killed 22 at Manchester Arena when he detonated a suicide bomb in the foyer as happy families left an Ariana Grande concert            Islamic scholars believe the sermon, if heard by Abedi, may have inspired him to commit the act of terrorIn another passage he says \u0027now it is time to act and do something\u0027.\u0027Brothers and sisters, it is time to act, not only to talk...

An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed Kamel had met with Netanyahu in Israel this week, but gave no details.Corbyn says he was \u0027standing up for democracy\u0027 by making...Share this articleA Palestinian source in Ramallah said Kamel has left without seeing Abbas, who had been preoccupied with a Palestinian leadership conference. But the source said Abbas had informed Egypt that Fatah representatives would join the Cairo talks later this week or next week.Apart from the opening of its Kerem Shalom commercial crossing into Gaza, Israel also expanded the enclave\u0027s fishing zone, in waters under Israeli naval blockade, from three to nine nautical miles off the southern coast and to six nautical miles in the north, according to the head of Gaza\u0027s fishermen\u0027s union.The Egyptian security source said the extended truce would also include opening a sea lane from Gaza to Cyprus under Israeli supervision.A Palestinian official in Gaza familiar with the talks said Palestinian factions were demanding a \u0027total lifting of the blockade on Gaza, opening all crossings with Israel and Egypt and a water corridor\u0027.Israel says its blockade is a self-defence measure against Hamas, a group that has called for its destruction.Israel\u0027s security cabinet, a forum of senior ministers headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, discussed the Gaza situation on Wednesday and an Israeli \u0027diplomatic official\u0027 said Hamas would have to prove its commitment to the truce.          Hamas representaive in Lebanon Oussama Hamdan (R) listens to Abbas Zaki, representative of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO)in LebanonAs well as wanting calm along the border, Israel has said Hamas must return the remains of two soldiers killed in the 2014 Gaza war and release two civilians whose fate is unknown. It says they are being held by Hamas in Gaza.\u0027That\u0027s the only way,\u0027 Israeli Regional Cooperation Minister Tzachi Hanegbi, a member of Netanyahu´s security cabinet, said on Thursday when asked if a broad arrangement depended on the return of the soldiers\u0027 bodies.\u0027Nothing will be done to enable (Gaza\u0027s) significant rehabilitation and the improvement of infrastructure and ports and other such fantasies, unless they release the bodies and the two Israeli captives,\u0027 he told Israel radio.The Egyptian security source said the long-term truce would also envisage Israel freeing hundreds of detained Palestinians in a prisoner swap.However, the Palestinian official denied any talks were taking place on a swap, saying Hamas opposed mixing the issues.Egypt has brokered a Palestinian reconciliation agreement that provides for Hamas to cede control of Gaza to Abbas\u0027s Palestinian Authority. A dispute over power-sharing has hindered implementation of the deal, but the Egyptian source said Cairo was still seeking progress on the issue.

Around 2.9million in the UK are currently using the devices, with around 470,000 using them to stop smoking.Last month, anti-tobacco campaigners called on the Government to act to prevent a new kind of e-cigarette from taking off among children, as it has done already in America. The Juul vape pens offer flavours such as mango and glacier mint.In March this year, NICE said the long-term health impact of e-cigarettes ‘was still developing’ and there was ‘little evidence’ of their effectiveness or safety as medicinal products. A series of reports have highlighted how e-cigarettes still have many negative health effects. These include increasing the risk of the lung condition chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung damage and infection. Nicotine – which is contained in e-cigarettes – is itself an addictive substance that increases heart rate and blood pressure.The World Health Organisation is among bodies to call for stiff regulation of e-cigarettes and bans on their indoor use.However, Public Health England claimed recently that e-cigarettes are ‘95 per cent safer’ than conventional smoking.That claim is repeated in today’s report which said: ‘Regulations should be relaxed relating to e-cigarettes licensing, prescribing and advertising of their health benefits.’Chairman Norman Lamb added: ‘If used correctly, e-cigarettes could be a key weapon in the NHS stop-smoking arsenal.’The committee said that while ‘uncertainties’ remained about the long-term health impact of the devices, they presented ‘an opportunity to significantly accelerate already declining smoking rates’.          Scientists are warning that e-cigarette vapour as well as tobacco can cause lung damageThe MPs also called for ‘wider debate’ on vaping in public spaces. While vaping is not illegal inside pubs or restaurants, many major pub and restaurant chains such as Wetherspoons have imposed bans indoors as it is difficult from a distance to tell whether someone is smoking or vaping.The MPs urged that a tobacco product called ‘snus’ – which is taken in the mouth – is made legal in the UK, despite the fact it has previously been linked to oral cancer.Cancer Research UK said any changes to current e-cigarette regulations should be aimed at helping smokers to quit while preventing young people from starting to use e-cigarettes.The science and technology committee said it has considered evidence from more than 90 organisations including a range of academics, NHS professionals, NICE, and Government departments to inform its recommendations. John Dunne, for the UK Vaping Industry Association said the report was a ‘ringing endorsement of vaping’s public health potential’.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/17/01/4F25F87700000578-6069301-Presenter_and_Strictly_Come_Dancing_star_Katie_Derham_right_said-a-3_1534465120470.jpg","title":"MAC sport","story":"    \u0027Our sport badly needs some publicity.

Former Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee is pictured above, in this May 2, 2004 file photo, greeting the audience at a ceremony at the Presidential Palace in New DelhiThe ex-PM was a lifelong poet who revered nature but who oversaw India\u0027s growth into a swaggering regional economic power. He was also the prime minister who ordered nuclear tests in 1998, stoking fears of atomic war between India and Pakistan. Then, a few years later, it was Vajpayee who made the first moves toward peace.Vajpayee\u0027s supporters saw him as a skilled politician who managed to avoid fanaticism a man who refused to see the world in black and white.But his critics considered him the leader of a fanatic movement - a movement partially rooted in European fascism – that sought power by stoking public fears of India\u0027s large Muslim minority.The one thing both sides could agree on was his honesty. Vajpayee was that rare person in Indian politics: untainted by corruption scandals.  Vajpayee\u0027s body was to be taken to his New Delhi home and then to the BJP\u0027s office on Friday for people to pay their last respects, ahead of his cremation this afternoon          This handout photograph released by India\u0027s Press Information Bureau on August 16 shows Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (right) laying a wreath next to the body of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vaajpayee in New DelhiOne of seven children of a schoolteacher in central India, Vajpayee joined India\u0027s Hindu revivalist political movement in his late 20s. Elected to Parliament in 1957, he became the best-known figure in its moderate wing, and helped the Bharatiya Janata Party become one of India\u0027s few national political parties.One of India\u0027s longest-serving lawmakers, Vajpayee was elected nine times to the powerful Lok Sabha, or lower house of Parliament. He also served two terms in the Rajya Sabha, or upper house.  A woman and a child watch as a man waits with a wreath to offer his respects to former Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee outside Bharatiya Janata party in New Delhi, IndiaVajpayee led the party to its first national electoral victory in 1996, but lasted just 13 days as prime minister before he resigned in the face of a no-confidence motion. He returned to power in 1998 for 13 months after forging an alliance of 22 parties, mostly regional power brokers with disparate local appeal, and again served as India\u0027s prime minister from 1999 to 2004.It was in India\u0027s relations with Pakistan where Vajpayee\u0027s influence may last the longest.While India\u0027s nuclear weapons program is believed to date to the 1980s, New Delhi had long insisted its atomic program was purely for peaceful purposes.           Vajpayee, a former journalist and poet turned politician, is credited with helping lay the foundations for the meteoric rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the political powerhouse that rules India today  In 2015, the government honored Vajpayee with the Bharat Ratna, India\u0027s highest civilian award, while his December 25 birthday was declared \u0027Good Governance Day\u0027 in a tribute to his leadership           Vajpayee, 93, died on Thursday in a New Delhi hospital where he was being treated for a kidney infection and chest congestionThat changed within a month of Vajpayee returning to the prime minister\u0027s post in 1998, when he approved a series of nuclear weapons tests that shocked the world and pushed Islamabad to launch its own tests.But the next year, when Islamabad sent fighters across the cease-fire line that ides the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir between the nations, Vajpayee resisted military pressure to launch a broad counter-attack of Indian forces.After 11 weeks and more than 1,000 deaths, Pakistan ordered the fighters to withdraw. India earned international praise for its caution.His peace efforts began with a groundbreaking bus ride to Lahore, Pakistan, in February 1999, where he met with then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. The diplomatic journey inaugurated the first regular bus service between the two nations.  In this April 25, 1996 file photo, the then Hindu nationalist party candidate for Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee greeted supporters and was showered with rose petals at a campaign rally in New Delhi, IndiaThen, just before leaving office in 2004, he launched a peace process that, while often rocky, remains the basis of ongoing negotiations.Vajpayee avoided bedrock nationalist issues, like plans to build a Hindu temple at the site of a demolished north Indian mosque. But critics excoriated him for failing to quickly quell anti-Muslim riots that shook the state of Gujarat in 2002. More than 1,100 people, almost all of them Muslim, were killed in the riots, which began after a train fire killed 60 Hindu pilgrims. Muslims were accused of setting the fire, though the true cause was never known.  The body of former Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, wrapped in the Indian national flag, is taken in full state honor to the Bharatiya Janata party office for people to pay their last tributes in New Delhi          The All India Institute of Medical Sciences, where Vajpayee had been hospitalised for more than two months with a kidney infection and chest congestion, announced his death. Vajpayee, a leader of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, had suffered a stroke in 2009Vajpayee\u0027s public response to the riots reflected his many contradictions.In the days after the pogrom, Vajpayee said he could not understand how Hindus could burn women and children alive, sadly asking a group of Muslim survivors: \u0027Have we lost our way so much that we cease to be humans?\u0027Just a year later, though, he told a mostly Hindu audience, \u0027Wherever there are Muslims in large numbers, they do not want to live in peace.\u0027While known for his poetry and gifted with a politician\u0027s common touch - as a parliamentarian he would take his dogs for walks in public – he was not known for public introspection.

Access to both warehouses continued to be closed on Thursday as the dispute remained unresolved.A source close to Sports Direct said it had been forced to cancel orders as XPO was being “totally unreasonable in terms of their demands” and was “refusing to engage in any process” which would “move the situation forward”.“XPO is trying to hold us to ransom,” the source said.It is understood that XPO has blocked suppliers and Sports Direct from entering the warehouses. XPO was not available for comment.Some fashion suppliers have taken action while negotiations over payments continue. Jigsaw has removed stock from 20 stores, and brands including Karen Millen and Mint Velvet are also understood to have withdrawn some stock. These brands run concessions in House of Fraser store and so own unsold items. Ownership of that stock was not passed to administrators or included in Sports Direct’s purchase.One concession operator said it was continuing to operate as it hoped a deal could be agreed. “We have been getting paid since Friday and are meeting people from House of Fraser next week,” the operator said.Sports Direct has no legal obligation to pay suppliers money owed before its buyout as their debts were part of the administration. No supplier debts are expected to be paid from the administrators as virtually all the proceeds from Sports Direct’s buyout are going to its banks and bondholders. However, new owners often agree to settle at least some of the debts in the interest of good relations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40d81e50e80fe9ac5ca336e3771fd3107d9a16b8/2_131_1536_921/master/1536.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca4d62abbef124811bff1592ddd6a723","title":"can turkey rewrite the rulebook for crises in emerging markets","story":"By rejecting the conventional approach, Erdoğan risks greater trouble – and not just for TurkeyWhether by accident or design, Turkey is trying to rewrite the chapter on crisis management in the emerging-market playbook. Rather than opting for interest-rate hikes and an external funding anchor to support domestic policy adjustments, the government has adopted a mix of less direct and more partial measures – and this at a time when Turkey is in the midst of an escalating tariff tit-for-tat with the US, as well as operating in a more fluid global economy. How all this plays out is important not only for Turkey, but also for other emerging economies that already have had to cope with waves of financial contagion.The initial phases of Turkey’s crisis were a replay of past emerging-market currency crises. A mix of domestic and external events – an over-stretched credit-led growth strategy concerns about the central bank’s policy autonomy and effectiveness and a less hospitable global liquidity environment, owing in part to rising US interest rates – destabilised the foreign-exchange market.A political spat with the US accelerated the run on the Turkish lira by fueling a self-reinforcing dynamic. And all of this occurred in the context of a more uncertain and – aside from the US – weakening global economy.In keeping with the traditional emerging-market-crisis script, Turkey’s currency crisis spilled over on to other emerging economies. As is typically the case, the first wave of contagion was technical in nature, driven mainly by generalised outflows from Turkey’s currency and bond markets. The longer this contagion continues, the greater the concern that it will lead to more disruptive financial and economic outcomes. As such, central banks in several emerging economies – as erse as Argentina, Hong Kong, and Indonesia – felt compelled to take counter-measures.What has followed is what makes this episode of emerging-market crisis different, at least so far. Rather than sticking with the approach taken by numerous other countries – including Argentina earlier this year – by raising interest rates and seeking some form of support from the International Monetary Fund, Turkey has shunned both in a very public manner, including through strident remarks by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.Facing an accelerated exchange-rate depreciation that, at one stage, almost halved the lira’s value, Turkey has taken a variety of measures that attempt to simulate – albeit partially – the traditional approach that emerging economies have tended to follow in the past.Domestically, it tightened funding conditions and, at the same time, provided liquidity to domestic banks, along with regulatory forbearance. It made it harder for foreigners to access lira liquidity, thereby squeezing speculators that had shorted the currency. It promised to deal with credit and fiscal excesses while ruling out capital controls. Externally, the government has mobilized at least $15bn (£11.8bn) from Qatar to be used for direct investment in Turkey. And, in the midst of all this, the government also found time to retaliate against the doubling of tariffs on Turkish metal exports by Donald Trump’s administration.The question is whether this response will be enough to act as a circuit breaker, thus giving the Turkish economy and its financial system time to regain their footing. This is particularly important because continued currency turmoil would tip the economy into recession, raise inflation, stress the banking system and increase corporate bankruptcies.With this comes the toughest question of all for the government: can it bring about recovery without reneging on its pledge not to raise interest rates or approach the IMF? It is possible, but not probable.Absent additional measures, it is unlikely that a critical mass of corrective steps has been attained in Turkey. While the domestic policy adjustments provide short-term relief for the currency, they may be neither comprehensive nor sufficient as yet to return Turkey to a promising path for inclusive economic growth and durable financial stability.On the external side, the funding from Qatar, assuming it materialises fully and in a timely fashion, appears small relative to Turkey’s gross external funding needs. It also doesn’t come with the IMF imprimatur that reassures many investors. And it is far from clear how this money will make its way into the economy to maximise the potential for currency stabilisation.And then there is the trade skirmish with the US.Like other countries, it is only a matter of time until Turkey comes to the same realisation as others about confronting the more protectionist stance adopted by the US. Because of its size and systemic influence, and assuming it remains willing to incur the risk of suffering some damage in the process, the US is destined to win a tit-for-tat tariff escalation. As such, the best approach is what the EU decided to do last month: seek a way to pause the skirmish while working on the longer-term underlying issues.Rather than rewriting the game plan for crisis management in emerging markets, Turkey may well end up confirming it. One hopes this will lead to the restoration of financial stability and growth as the government looks to reverse its stance on central-bank independence, interest-rate policy, and perhaps even the IMF. The alternative – persisting with the current approach and, in the process, running the risk of turning technical dislocations into much more damaging longer-term economic and financial disruptions – would also prove problematic for other emerging economies.• Mohamed El-Erian is chief economic adviser at Allianz and was chairman of Barack Obama’s Global Development Council."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdf44bf802da4c34054c780a86f016923ee1c54c/0_146_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c27964d1f038d49e16aa7515c3f327d9","title":"this summer doesnt belong in scandinavia your stories of heat around the world","story":"From Hawaii to the Netherlands and France to South Korea readers have shared their reactions to recent record temperaturesIn mid-July last year, Haythem Ayari, a 23-year-old engineering student in Nabeul, coastal Tunisia, caught a bus to travel the 10km to university. The vehicle, already overloaded with passengers, was caught in gridlocked traffic and sat static for nearly an hour. There was a heatwave, with a temperature of about 38C (100F) outside inside the bus it was 42C (108F). “At a specific moment, I just snapped,” remembered Ayari. “I got out in the middle of traffic to finally breathe.” Since then, he has been inclined to panic attacks if in confined, crowded spaces during hot weather.A month earlier, approximately 2,000 km (1300 miles) away in Bristol, UK, Adam Corner was on a bus with his partner and their new baby, heading across the city to visit friends. The bus was held up in traffic – not for long, but long enough. “It became a kind of inferno,” said Dr Corner, research director at Climate Outreach their baby, barely a month old, started screaming in a way Corner had never heard before. “We had a little insight into this immediate, visceral risk – you see it through the eyes of your newborn child.” He pulled the bus’s emergency cord and they jumped off into traffic.This tale of two bus journeys tells a story of rising temperatures and the pressure they are putting on cities and the people who live in them. Asked by  Cities to share their experiences for a week-long series on urban heat, readers from countries as disparate as Hawaii, the Netherlands, Australia, Denmark, Japan, France, Malaysia, Romania, South Korea and Canada expressed concern about the impacts already being felt.“When I moved here many years ago, we used to joke: ‘This summer happened on a Wednesday in Paris’,” wrote Mariann Gyorke. “That’s not the case anymore.” In an effort to preserve the cooler temperatures inside her family’s top-floor apartment, she had been cooking only cold dishes and shielding the windows with makeshift shutters made of cardboard.Around the world, people altered their behaviour and adapted their schedules to cope with the heatwave. In order to sleep, Michele Howie of Sydney soaked her nightwear in water and lay on a towel in front of two fans. Anna Mastersson in Mariehamn, of Finland’s Åland Islands, said her relative had been forced to buy a new car with air conditioning and a roof window: “In this weather and having to drive two small kids, she had no choice.” In her neighbourhood, dogs were being taken out later at night, for shorter walks. In Montreal, Frederic Hore had noticed people lingering in pedestrian passageways of the metro station to catch the pulse of cool air created by passing trains.Outside, green spaces dried up, with follow-on effects for agriculture and often the economy. Inge Kersten wrote of Nijmegen, this year’s European Green Capital, “Leaves are falling in our lovely green city”. On her family’s organic farm near Aarhus, Denmark, Jessica Tamminga had watched fields turn from green to brown: “The trees are turning yellow like it’s fall”. But for the impact on her business, she said, the heat was “rather pleasant – except for the disconcerting feeling that this California summer doesn’t belong in Scandinavia.”Britons, in particular, seemed more ready to take the warmer temperatures at face value. “We’re all enjoying a real summer at last,” wrote Regan Armitage. “Everyone seems uncharacteristically happy in Leeds.” Frank Holt in Brighton described the summer as “luxuriating, joyful, a little alcoholic, a summer you don’t need to go away for”. “It’s wonderful not moaning about the weather,” he wrote, adding that the ’s call-out had seem “designed to gain negative replies”.Holt expanded to  Cities by phone that, though he was concerned by climbing temperatures, he felt the onus was on scientists and the media to persuade politicians to act, he said in the meantime, the warmer weather “did have some enjoyable aspects”. “I think things sometimes should be enjoyed for what they are. This summer has been very good for Brighton.”And not all life was suffering in the heat. Jellyfish numbers had increased in the tropical seas around Jeju Island, wrote In-Gyum Kim from Seogwipo, its second-largest city. Helena in Columbia, South Carolina, said that judgin gby how often she was bitten, ticks and mosquitoes seemed to be thriving, as were “our famous Palmetto bugs” – cockroaches. In Kuala Lumpur, a bumper crop of the prized durian fruit saw prices come down to RM5 (£1) per kilo – but that had its own, unusual effect.The fruit is understood to raise the body’s temperature, said Vanessa Ting, a student in the Malaysian capital. “I ate three pieces and spent the rest of the day sweaty and uncomfortable, despite taking six showers.” At the pharmacy where she works part time, more customers had been reporting fevers, sore throats and coughs, attributed variously to the weather and durian. And she’d observed more retirees opting to meet at the McDonald’s where she regularly studied, rather than in more traditional coffee shops without air conditioning.  Cody Winchester had noticed more air conditioners being installed on more buildings in Honolulu. “People used to just open their windows and the fresh tropical breeze would pass through and cool the home. Now it’s unbearable to live in town without AC.” But many could not afford it, he added, as Hawaii has the most expensive electricity in the entire US.Many found their homes simply not built to cope with extreme temperatures. Adina wrote of Timisoara, Romania, that given its reliance on concrete and tarmac “the city becomes a frying pan in the heat”. Clive Warner, in Monterrey in northern Mexico, was opting to move 25km south to Santiago, Nuevo Leon, a greener area that is, on average, 5C cooler. “Having cardiac problems, I can’t tolerate it any longer,” he said of the 34-37C (93-99F) maximum shade temperature in Monterrey. “If it gets much hotter I don’t see how the place will be survivable in summer.”The electricity already sometimes fails in 39C (102F) heat, he added. “If that happens, I get in the car and drive to a shopping mall.”Air conditioning brought relief, but to a point that seemed drastically, even dangerously, at odds with ecology, said Tim Kelly in Naha, Japan. “Stores leave their front doors wide open, people enter and exit rooms without closing the door behind them – all the while blasting their air conditioning.” People even napped in their parked cars with the engines running.Not only was this dependance on air conditioning damaging to the environment, but moving regularly between radically different climes causes temperature shock, said Kelly. “Their bodies lose the ability to cope with the natural environment.” Johanna MacGregor said summer colds were common in Tokyo because shops, restaurants and the subway were often too cool, “while places like schools or community halls often have no aircon whatsoever – it’s one or the other.”It was in stark contrast to the picture painted by Patrycja Lickiewicz of Castalla in Alicante, Spain, as a society “in tacit compliance with nature”. There it is the norm to restrict activities to before 8.30am and after 8pm and to drink water, dress appropriately, and stick to the shade at all other hours. “No matter the temperatures people always behave the same way,” said Lickiewicz. “We do not complain, we just follow the same simple routines. When common sense prevails we keep ourselves and the environment in check.”But adapting is not simply a case of being sun-smart, Lickiewicz conceded, when at least the oldest buildings in Castalla are built of stone, with internal air flow directed through courtyards and shutters – which manages heat without the need for air conditioning.If cities are to cope with more extreme heat more frequently, there needs to be structural change across the board: building codes to ensure future housing stock is not only warm, but cool infrastructure that can cope and regulation to enforce safe behaviours. Harry May, in Fukuoka, Japan, wanted to see work shut down when the mercury climbs past 34C (“Think on that, the UK”) Monica Garcia-Galvan was in favour of introducing a water tax in Montreal to encourage people not to let taps run for minutes at a time (“if English people saw how Canadians wash dishes, they would faint”). Adina, in Timisoara, Romania, said authorities needed to enforce health and safety laws relating to working in unsafe temperatures: “We have them but no one respects them.” Alice Browning of Friedrichshafen, southern Germany, spoke for many with her desperate plea for more trees: “We really don’t want to be cooped up inside all day.”In many cities steps have already been taken. In Nantes, Patrick Brown said, boulevards cleared for cars were being redesigned to include plenty of green space, and art installations with water features had given people places in which to cool off in summer. The De Bastei centre operated a scheme in Nijmegen and elsewhere in the Netherlands where residents could swap tiles or stones from their garden for plants.Others saw opportunities to be grasped by tackling the rising temperatures. David Fraire said nothing could be done to ease the issue of heat in Chandler, Arizona. “This is Phoenix, valley of the sun – it comes with the territory.” But it could be better harnessed: “We should be using this heat to our advantage and convert all our power to solar source.” Frank Holt suggested that Britain could build its new, post-Brexit identity through investment in renewables.But even in amongst optimism there was a feeling of powerlessness, even fatalism. Washington DC residents would cope with the heat as they had done for decades, said Cara – but related issues, for example surrounding health problems and food insecurity, were a bigger unknown. “We’re already putting in more green, solar, or light-coloured roofs. We’re committed to keeping and increasing the tree canopy, too, to help lower temperatures.”But without greater commitment to addressing the root causes from regional authorities – for example, by shutting down the coal-fired power plants along the Potomac – Cara continued: “there is very little we can do”. Charlie in Redding, California, urged that the US “stop with the knuckle dragging” and return to the Paris climate accord and “thinking people” at once – if it was not already too late. The day he wrote, it was nearly 43C (109F): “Think that life as we have known it forever is on a collision course with a destiny that’s not beneficial for mankind!”Dr Adam Corner of Climate Outreach said adapting to climate change meant seeing its influence in every facet of life – not just the environment, and not just in high-profile periods of extreme weather. “It’s a really complex set of questions, but those tangible things are more relatable to people than ‘global temperatures are going to change by 2C’,” he said. “There are so many ways that climate change is with us now. It’s very much not a problem for the next generation – we need to be thinking about how we get to grips with it.”The effects and implications of rising temperatures need to be considered by doctors, urban planners, architects those working in business, transport, agriculture and food security. Yet even news stories about climate change were illustrated with photographs of polar bears and melting ice caps, or renderings of future cities. “It’s the human story of our generation, but you wouldn’t know it, from the way we visualise and present it. Where are the people in this?”In Nabeul, said Ayari, they were mostly indoors, sheltering in the air conditioning. Traffic had become unbearable and it was too hot even to go to the beach. His twin sister has a respiratory condition exacerbated by the heat and had been advised to stay indoors: “The doctors say it’s like an allergy to the weather,” said Ayari. “People are actually getting scared of going out and being confronted by the sun. You have empty streets in the daytime and huge crowds at night.“This heatwave we are witnessing is making me more and more concerned about our future in the city ... We have to talk more about the seriousness of this issue.” Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34b96704e6d9753fd5c4895984f7df772107d377/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b57e32e46e4a227ba2ea0249269d7df9 960w","title":"jeremy corbyn critics speech labour leader","story":"Labour’s leader should own his mistakes – but he has been on the right side of history more often than many of his criticsOn 18 March 2008, during a media feeding frenzy about statements made by his radical Chicago pastor, Jeremiah Wright, presidential hopeful Barack Obama gave a speech in Philadelphia. His aim was to lay out his candidacy and experiences within the context of America’s racial history. Jeremy Corbyn needs to make a similar intervention over accusations of antisemitism. This is the speech he should, and could, give.For as long as I can remember, anti-racism and internationalism have been a central part of my life. My parents met at a rally supporting Spanish Republicans who were fighting General Franco’s fascists – a crucial episode in the spread of fascism across Europe that saw Hitler’s rise and all the carnage that came with it. My politics were shaped by a leftwing tradition that had a clear notion that injustice could not be tolerated – and that principle was as crucial to defend abroad as it was at home.So to be branded an antisemite – and the leader of an antisemitic party – after five decades of political activism is something I have had to take seriously, even as I have found it deeply distressing personally.Antisemitism has a long, vile and violent history, not least in this country and this continent, where Jews were all too recently threatened with being extinguished as a people. Accusations of antisemitism should never be dismissed summarily, cavalierly or defensively – it is far too serious a matter for that. Such accusations should not be made opportunistically, baselessly or for crude political gain, either – it is far too serious a matter for that, too. Antisemitism is an evil in itself. Its gravity does not hinge on whether the accuser or the accused is Labour or Tory, Jew or gentile, Old Labour or New.The left has an impressive history of fighting bigotry and racism in all its forms, and I am proud to have dedicated a significant section of my life to that struggle. I make no apology for that. It has been a struggle conducted both in parliament, where I was one of a handful of MPs who opposed the hostile environment policy that led to the ill-treatment of the Windrush generation, and in the streets, demonstrating with the Anti-Nazi League against the far right and neo-Nazis during the 1970s and beyond.The left has a proud record of internationalism and I am proud to have dedicated a significant part of my political life to that also. I protested against Saddam Hussein’s gassing of the Kurds in 1988 while the Tory government endorsed selling him weapons I marched against the illegal invasion of Iraq in 2003 when the Labour government joined the US. I was arrested for protesting against apartheid in 1984 when the British government still branded Nelson Mandela a terrorist. I supported dialogue between Sinn Féin and the British state, a strategy that led to peace, while our government sought military victory, which escalated the conflict.I make no apology for this either, even when there have been overtures I have made to groups or iniduals that, when orced from their historical context, appear unwise. Politics is about hard choices. You don’t make peace with your friends but with your enemies. I have been on the right side of history far more often than I have not been – and certainly far more often than those who seek to sully my name by distorting my past.There is no contradiction in being a committed anti-racist and an internationalist – indeed they come from exactly the same belief: that everybody should be treated equally, that our human rights are inisible and that discriminating against people is wrong, whoever you are and wherever you are. But there is a specific challenge when it comes to Israel and Palestine as it relates to antisemitism and British Jewry.There is no shortage of people, on every side of the Middle East conflict, who have blood on their hands. But it is my sincere belief that it is not a conflict between equals. Israel is a regional superpower backed by the west and armed to the teeth that occupies the West Bank and is building settlements on Palestinian land, in defiance of international law. It recently passed a law that makes Israeli-Arabs second-class citizens. Like most people in Britain and around the world we support the Palestinian right to create their own state.British Jews are not homogeneous. They have a range of views on everything, including the Middle East. That said – and for understandable reasons, particularly relating to the Holocaust – even though many British Jews are critical of Israeli policies, the vast majority feel a close affinity with the country.So my history of pro-Palestinian activism, which I have always been very open about, is a source of legitimate tension with many British Jews. Reasonable people can disagree on both the origins and the potential solutions to the conflict in the Middle East – that disagreement does not make either me or the Labour party antisemitic.The challenge has come in navigating that tension with sensitivity while establishing a clear, coherent and robust distinction between criticising Israel and criticising Jews. Over the last few years it has become painfully clear to me that some on the left have not always risen to that challenge.The left in general, and Labour in particular, does not have the antisemitism problem that many in the media and the political class accuse us of having. There is no poll or survey that supports the notion that antisemitism is rife on the left or, indeed, any worse than it is among Conservatives.Yet we do have a problem. Antisemitism is a hardy virus and it would be a grave mistake to assume that we are somehow immune from it. There are some on the left who seek to hold Jews accountable for what Israel does. That is wrong. Some believe that because Jews are overwhelmingly white and some are wealthy, antisemitism is somehow less worthy of our concern than other forms of discrimination. They are wrong. Some believe that because so many of the attacks on Labour under my leadership have been baseless that all\u0026nbspof these accusations are baseless. They are wrong. In the words of the great African-American writer and activist WEB Du Bois: “Our worst side has been so shamelessly emphasised that we are denying we have or ever had a worst side. In all sorts of ways we are hemmed in.”I take responsibility for this. When accusations have been made we have, at times, been too slow to respond or have responded evasively. We could have worked harder to engage with Jewish communities. It makes me cringe to know that, on a handful of occasions, I shared platforms with people who have made reprehensible statements and failed to challenge antisemitic remarks others have made in my presence. On at least one occasion I failed to recognise what I now see were clear antisemitic tropes in a mural. I deeply regret the offence this has caused. There are many things I am attacked for having done that I make no apology for. But these apologies I own. They were my mistakes. And the apology comes not from a point of weakness but strength because I can do better.The Labour party isn’t perfect. But it’s still the party of justice, equality and inclusion. It’s the party that has sent more women, black, Asian and Muslim MPs to parliament than any other. It’s the party that introduced the first Race Relations Act, the Sex Discrimination Act, hate crimes legislation and commissioned the Macpherson report. That is our history. That is our tradition. Those are not only our founding principles but our guiding principles. And that will be our future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8952af7309acc6edfa0414f42ff4c44367c2c261/0_234_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c408adf499e7c9c4dfe7862c8455a6cd","title":"stone stacking instagram environment adventure tourism","story":"They stand by the sea at Lindisfarne. You’ll find them in the glens of Skye, in Slovenian gorges, on the peaks of Chamonix, Barbadian beaches, American national parks and Australian creeks. Stacks of stones, miniature monuments made by enraptured visitors and photographed for posterity are tiny tributes to human industry, our desire to make a mark, and our deep love of special places. But what appears a completely benign form of play in the natural world has become a plague.Of course, stone-stacking is an ancient and sometimes religious impulse. A cairn in Scotland is a memorial to someone lost, but also a pile of stones that marks a way through wild country: invaluable when the cloud comes down. Cairns keep us safe.More recently, stone-stacking has become an art form and a competitive sport. Artists say the absorbing process of handling and balancing cool stones is meditative and good for our mental health. Children love it.But what Hourston’s critics don’t seem to grasp is the almost industrial scale of this new age of stone-stacking. Adventure tourism and social media have created a perfect storm of stones. Cruise ships decant hundreds of visitors on to once remote islands such as Orkney, the Faroes or Iceland, each passenger burning with a creative desire to memorialise their sightseeing on Instagram. “Where do you draw the line?” wonders Hourston. “Orkney, Shetland, Iceland, Svalbard, or the Antarctic peninsula? We should start drawing the line now.”Our personal monuments turn empty landscapes into peopled places. When we reach a remote summit or deserted beach, we know people have stepped there before, but for a moment we can enjoy a place where humans do not predominate.No longer. A forest of stacked stones destroys all sense of the wild. Stacks are an intrusion, enforcing our presence on others long after our departure. It’s an offence against the first and most important rule of wild adventuring: leave no trace.Stone-stacking in the wrong place can potentially mislead us on a misty moor. It can also harm wildlife. Birds such as oystercatchers make their nests on stony shores. These superbly camouflaged scrapes are almost impossible to see, and stone-stackers can destroy a nest in the breeding season without even knowing it. On other sites the moving of stones exposes soil and exacerbates erosion, destroying the cool undersides of stones that are sanctuaries for millions of invertebrates.Hourston was particularly struck by the multitude of stacked stones on Skaill beach, immediately below the neolithic village of Skara Brae. It’s not fanciful to fear that ancient ruins may be disturbed. Historic England last year warned that stone-stacking was putting at risk historic monuments such as neolithic Stowe’s Pound in Cornwall. We can be prosecuted for stone-stacking – destroying an ancient monument – in the wrong place.Is there ever a right place? I’d say yes. A stack of stones below the high-tide line on a well-visited beach is as harmless and ephemeral as a sandcastle. Just as there are graffiti walls, we could designate certain beaches or moors as permitted places for stone-stacking. Stone-stacking contests are obviously fun too.Those who find stone-stacking self-absorbed and narcissistic may have a point. But stone-stacking in the wrong place is mostly just thoughtless.Some will rail against more rules, or more self-restraint but we need both, particularly when there are more than 7 billion of us. Sheer quantities of people turn inconsequential behaviour into acts with consequences. If we want to enjoy what’s left of our wild world, we have to be more aware than ever of our impact upon this Earth.• Patrick Barkham writes for the  on natural history"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3be26b87421be458b7d86d5868d813c04a766ed/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c8360fa10af5cba48c049613fd93a7d","title":"why is the far right dominated by men","story":"It is time we take masculinity more seriously in discussions of the far right and rightwing politics What if male identity, rather than racist ideology, is the most important reason why people join far-right groups? That is the central claim made by Michael Kimmel, a US sociologist, in his new book Healing from Hate: How Young Men Get Into – and Out of – Violent Extremism, which studies why young men join (and leave) extreme right groups in Germany, Sweden and the US.While the central thesis is slightly overstated, the book is remarkably well-written and researched. Kimmel, a longtime scholar of men and masculinity, fills the book with quotes from his many interviews with so-called “formers.”Almost everyone will have noted that far-right groups and rallies are predominantly male, from the original, deadly Unite the Right rally last year to the pathetic Unite the Right 2 last weekend, but Kimmel, a longtime scholar of men and masculinity, is one of the few to have made this the focus of his research.From interviews with former activists, Kimmel summarizes that far-right groups use masculinity in three distinct, but related, ways. First, they use it to describe or explain their personal situation – for instance, you are single or unemployed because “Others” took your girljob.Second, masculinity is used to problematize “the other” – they are not real men because either they are too effeminate or too animalistic. Third, and finally, they use it to recruit members – you can regain your masculinity, and thus your girl and job, by fighting the “Others.”While Kimmel’s conclusions are based on interviews with members of a specific subset of the far right universe – mostly small neo-Nazi groups, which more resemble street gangs than political parties – the importance of masculinity has been noted in other far-right groups too. In Bring the War Home: The White Power Movement and Paramilitary America, US historian Kathleen Belew argues that the origins of the contemporary white power movement, and particularly its paramilitary form, militias, are to be found in the trauma of the Vietnam War.Belew shows the importance of Vietnam veterans in the white power movement – most notably Louis R Beam Jr, who popularized the notion of “leaderless resistance” within the far right, inspiring terrorists from Robert Jay Matthews to Timothy McVeigh. He also points out how the defeatist mood in the US led to a push for “remasculinization,” expressed through paramilitarisation far-right subcultures. In other words, weekend warriors joined militias to regain their manhood as they prepared to protect America (especially women and children) from a range of perceived threats from non-white “barbarians” to so-called UN-operated “black helicopters” believed by conspiracy theorists to be plotting a takeover of the United States.It is tricky to translate insights from smaller, more activist and extreme groups to the broader electorate. Still, it is clear that gender, and specifically masculinity, also plays a role in terms of the propaganda and appeal of radical right parties and politicians. Michael Kimmel’s earlier book, Angry White Men, originally published in 2013, noted the importance of masculinity in the broader rightwing subculture of America, ie “the Trump base before Trump”.But just like extreme right groups, many radical right parties espouse a strongly gendered discourse, in which they appeal to a frail masculinity, threatened by emasculating feminists, effeminate liberals, and overly virile “Others.” While women are mainly presented as victims, particularly of the latter – rape of white women by non-white men is age-old favorite of the far right – men are called upon to protect their “nation” or “race”.By defending their nation, and protecting their fragile women and children, men will not only regain their masculinity vis-a-vis “Other” men (eg black men, immigrants, Muslims) but also vis-a-vis their women. It restores the “natural” gender roles that decades of “cultural Marxism” threaten to destroy – which is, for example, why Viktor Orbán’s government is trying to shut down the gender studies departments in Hungary.Obviously, this toxic view of masculinity feeds on a broader resurgence of conservative gender roles, which has given birth to internet phenomena like “incels” and Canadian psychology professor Jordan Peterson. Whether directly linked to the far right or not, threatened male identity has a violent potential that is at least as big as threatened white identity, and possibly even bigger. Just take note how many terrorists (far right or other) are not just men but also have a history of domestic abuse.It is time that we take masculinity more seriously in our discussions of the far right, and right-wing politics. We are seeing “the largest gender gap on record” in recent polls because of decreasing support for Donald Trump among (higher educated) white women. But the real story is that a disproportionate number of white men (not just working class or less educated) support a president who boasts about grabbing women “by the pussy”. Perhaps many men don’t support Trump despite his attacks on prominent women, but because of it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/495be7cc8998840d67fe69cc892f561277a83d84/59_253_3323_1993/master/3323.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fce4ca0e14ccf35ea1a1423a64bf47d","title":"a level results raise policy questions but first lets recognise achievement","story":"Despite the upheaval of the redesigned qualifications, many trends persistWe all know coverage of exam results day is fairly formulaic. Pictures of teenagers jumping up in the air clutching pieces of paper, stories about twins with a string of A*s who are now off to Cambridge, and a parade of people trying to explain all the changes that have happened that year and how it is now all different to before.Students receiving their A-level results on Thursday will be the first to do so in the latest wave of redesigned qualifications in England. The changes, which began during Michael Gove’s tenure at the Department for Education, mean a move away from modular qualifications and coursework towards linear assessment at the end of two years of study – largely through examinations.This year, subjects such as geography, modern foreign languages and music join the likes of English, the sciences, and art and design in being assessed in this way. The new qualifications are designed to better meet the needs of universities and employers.Despite the changes, many of the trends that we have seen in recent years persist. Girls continue to outperform boys in most subjects, the notable exceptions being mathematics and chemistry. There are large disparities in entry rates, around four-fifths of entries to physics are from boys, in English literature just one-fifth are.For many students, results day will be less about reflecting on what they have achieved and more about determining what happens next – whether they go to university, which university they will attend, and which course they will take. But for a growing number of students that uncertainty was removed long before they opened their results.This inevitably raised concerns that without the incentive of meeting a university offer, some students may not strive for the highest grades possible. That may well have happened in some cases, but at a national level the proportion of entrants achieving an A* or A is largely unchanged, although there has been a slight dip in the very highest grade. It does however, raise questions about how our universities admissions system should operate.But overall these are concerns for policymakers.

New temperature records have been set in Africa and cities in Australia, Taiwan, Georgia and the west coast of US. Heat stroke or forest fires have killed at least 119 in Japan, 29 in South Korea, 91 in Greece and nine in California. There have even been freak blazes in Lapland and elsewhere in the Arctic circle, while holidaymakers and locals alike have sweltered in unusually hot weather in southern Europe.Coming amid this climate chaos, the “hothouse Earth” paper by Rockström and his co-authors struck a chord with the public by spelling out the huge and growing risk that emissions are pushing the planet’s climate off the path it has been on for 2.5m years.Rockström, who is based in Potsdam, Germany, said the paper’s release had accidentally been delayed, but the timing proved serendipitous. “It came out at a time when temperatures in Germany reached 38C so people could personally experience a heatwave. But this is just the beginning.”Rockström said he was concerned about the widening gap between scientists’ increasingly alarmed descriptions of climate destruction and leaders’ weak statements of what is politically possible.“Politicians prefer small problems that they can solve and get credit for. They don’t like big problems that, even if they succeed, leave the rewards for their successors,” he said. “But once you pile up public pressure, politicians find it hard to avoid taking responsibility.”The hothouse paper spells out the actions that governments need to take, including carbon laws that aim to halve emissions every decade and stronger safeguards for natural sinks, such as oceans and forests that are currently being lost.“This is very dangerous. We are not just doing wrong ourselves with emissions, we are also killing our best friends – forests and oceans – that might ease the impact,” Rockström says.He and others have drawn up a detailed action plan will be unveiled ahead of the Californian climate summit in September. It will include more ambitious targets than those outlined in the Paris accord, which aims to keep temperature rises below 2C. 49 countries’ emissions have already peaked, but overall government commitments to date are lagging so much that the world is on a course for 3C of warming, at which level the risk of reaching an irreversible tipping point gets higher.The authors say it is economically and technologically feasible to make more drastic emissions cuts that can keep warming at 1.5C.“What is unrealistic is to be on a trajectory towards 3C,” said Johan Falk of Stockholm University. “Solutions exist, but they have to be adopted by the leadership of countries and companies.”With the world now believed to be in an “anomalously warm” phase until at least 2022, Rockström says the global public will increasingly feel the impacts of climate change and, he hopes, demand more urgency from their governments.On 8 September, climate groups are calling for a mass mobilisation ahead of the California summit. Asked if he thinks scientists should attend, Rockström has little hesitation. “There’s a time to sit down and work at your desk and there’s a time to get up and leave the area where you are comfortable. That time is now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff54d0adaa39d0bcce773ffe74befe3cf8f9cd5a/652_277_4972_2984/master/4972.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4de61614e383333a47b4fc73e92d19d","title":"kingdom of the sapeurs inside congo fashion week","story":"The Democratic Republic of the Congo’s misfortunes have often eclipsed its good news, with ongoing armed conflicts and most recently an Ebola outbreak.

Is cinema finally ready to ignore ethnicity in casting?Like most cheap paperbacks of David Copperfield, my battered old copy features a cover illustration of its eponymous hero as a boy: rosy-cheeked and blue-eyed under a nest of golden ringlets. (The artist gets it a bit wrong with the cruel smile, more horror movie kid than darling innocent, but hey ho.)On dustjackets and on screen, David Copperfield has been pale and posh ever since Charles Dickens published the novel he called his “favourite child” in 1850. (The BBC’s 1999 adaptation starred a pre-Harry Potter Daniel Radcliffe.) But, in a landmark instance of “colour-blind” casting, Dev Patel, a Londoner of Indian heritage, is to play Copperfield in a new film by Veep’s Armando Iannucci.On the phone from the Ealing Studios set of The Personal History of David Copperfield (the film is out next year) producer Kevin Loader tells me that Patel was simply the right person for the job. “In all our conversations, we never spoke about another actor to play our lead than Dev,” he explains. “We often have lists for parts, but we never had a list for David Copperfield.”You can see why Patel is perfect. Dickens’s story is the tale of an orphaned boy making his way in the world and finding himself as a man. That is precisely the kind of innocence and experience story in which the Slumdog Millionaire and Lion actor shines – with all that boyish eagerness and puppy dog warmth.But it is not just Patel. The cast of The Personal History of David Copperfield resembles the top deck of a bus in any big British city. Benedict Wong is Mr Wickfield. Rosalind Eleazar plays Copperfield’s true love, saintly Agnes. Dastardly Steerforth is portrayed by a white Welsh actor (Aneurin Barnard) with a Nigerian-born Brit, Nikki Amuka-Bird, as his mother, Mrs Steerforth.“Armando always knew he wanted Dev,” says Loader. “Once you realise that, then you’re making a statement about the fact that you’re going to cast actors who are capable of embodying the character as perfectly as possible, regardless of their ethnicity. I was standing on the side of the set the other day, watching a scene between three of the younger characters. I suddenly realised I was watching three young black British actors in a Dickens adaptation, none of which were written as black characters. And it didn’t seem odd. It’s just another scene in the film.”Loader makes the point that London in the 1840s was more erse than costume dramas tend to depict. “London was the centre of a huge global empire and was full of everybody. Just as it’s a global city now. Traditionally, Dickens adaptations haven’t reflected that.”David Copperfield might be a blip, or perhaps we will look back and say it redefined the casting status quo in British film. Theatre audiences have been happily watching actors who don’t match the ethnicity of their characters for years, although not without controversy. Last week, Beverley Knight defended her right to play Emmeline Pankhurst in a new suffragette musical in London’s West End. Two years ago, JK Rowling called people who criticised the casting of Noma Dumezweni as Hermione in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child “racists” – pointing out that she never specified the ethnicity of Hogwarts’ clever clogs.On stage, “colour blind” has often been used to describe casting that ignores ethnicity. But it is a term that many actors of colour reject, since it is impossible for audiences to suddenly become blind to race, as the Shakespearean actor Debra Ann Byrd explained in a  interview last year. Loader has been using the phrase “colour inclusive”. I ask him why film has lagged behind theatre in erse casting. “I’m sure it’s something to do with that feeling behind it somewhere that photography tells the truth. Film seems a kind of realist medium to lots of people, which is odd, because most films are fantasies these days.”When you stop to think about it, the logic of literal casting quickly comes unstuck. In the upcoming drama Mary Queen of Scots, the Irish actor Saoirse Ronan is playing Mary no one would argue that her Irishness is damaging to authenticity. (To be truly accurate, the role would require the casting of a Scottish actor mostly raised in France). In fact, Mary Queen of Scots is another film with casting that crosses ethnicity lines, with British-Chinese actor Gemma Chan playing Mary’s jailer, the powerful aristocrat Bess of Hardwick.Femi Oguns is an agent who opened the Identity School of Acting in 2003, frustrated at the lack of opportunities for black and ethnic-minority actors its alumni include John Boyega and Chewing Gum’s Michaela Coel. Oguns then set up a talent agency, the Identity Agency Group. He tells me he is seeing “more scripts than ever” being produced with non-traditional casting. “For this to happen in narratives where the race of a character isn’t specific to the plot or pivotal in their portrayal is a wonderful step forward. I believe audiences are far more accepting of this than we perhaps give them credit for. Suspension of disbelief kicks in fairly soon after the opening credits. Some of it still errs on the side of being gimmicky, but we have seen a real appetite for change.” Nevertheless, he adds, scripts featuring black and ethnic-minority characters are often depressingly stereotypical. “We end up with the same old stories over and over. Gang violence in inner-city London, religious extremism, FGM, drug dealing, terrorism. There’s no light and shade in what we are afforded, there’s no space for it, therefore cliches are king. We are starting to see change at the top, we are seeing complexity come through. It’s slow going, but I am hopeful we are moving in the right direction.”Colette, a new biopic of the French writer starring Keira Knightley and directed by Wash Westmoreland, features two actors of colour playing historical figures who were white in real life: Asian-Brit Ray Panthaki and the black actor Johnny K Palmer. Additionally, a trans man, Jake Graf, has been cast in a cisgender role, while the trans actor Rebecca Root plays a cisgender woman. There was also a trans consultant on the film.Colette’s producer, Elizabeth Karlsen, tells me that the casting felt right in the context of the rule-breaking, convention-busting times in which Colette lived. “We just wanted to be outside the box like Colette was as a person. And just trying to change things.” What term has she be using to describe the film’s casting? “What you really want the word to be is ‘casting’,” she says dryly. “But we’re still in a world where you have to define it as something different. Hopefully one day that won’t be the space we’re in.”At the same time, however, Hollywood whitewashing has become toxic. Last year, Ed Skrein pulled out of playing an Asian-American character in the Hellboy reboot. Scarlett Johansson was criticised for playing a character in the Hollywood version of Japanese anime Ghost in the Shell. Double standards? Not when you consider how few opportunities there are for actors of colour without white actors coming along and hoovering up the decent parts.Loader tells me that David Copperfield isn’t about colour-conscious casting he just wants people to accept the actors as playing their characters. “It’s not a book about racial politics and we’re not trying to make a version of it that comments on racial politics. We’re just trying to make a version that comments on the ersity of humanity I suppose.”I ask him if the casting isn’t just a little bit calculated? British film feeds us an endless diet of bonnets and breeches now here comes a headline-grabbing Dickens, making the genre fresh and accessible for a contemporary audience. “No,” he insists. “It wasn’t done cynically in that way. I think we felt this was how you’d get the best cast more than anything else. And suddenly you can have Benedict Wong coming in to play Mr Wickfield, and he’s hilarious. He wouldn’t have been cast in the BBC version of David Copperfield.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0e0271d57ae9456dc90b056a259c91cc7e8ec94/0_301_5352_3211/master/5352.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=485c7a6439221cb639cf647d021d7a0e","title":"super cup reaction and celtics champions league exit football weekly extra","story":"Max Rushden and co on Atlético’s win over Madrid, European woe for Celtic and Bristol Rovers’ dubious half-time entertainmentRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

Both sides are vulnerable in defence and dangerous in attack. Although beaten comfortably in the end, Huddersfield exposed Chelsea’s weakness to attacks down the wings last week and Arsenal may aim to do likewise, while David Luiz, in particular, will likely struggle to keep up with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in the middle. But Chelsea’s midfield thrusters – who could include Eden Hazard from the start as well as N’Golo Kanté in all-new Roving Mode – could wreak havoc at the other end, especially if certain Arsenal midfielders remain dozy when it comes to defensive duties. That is something Unai Emery needs to change and he could start by picking Lucas Torreira instead of Granit Xhaka. Or he might consider deploying both in a midfield trio with Mattéo Guendouzi. But even that would probably not be enough to keep Chelsea at bay so Emery will most likely err on the side of adventure and start Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Mesut Özil and Aaron Ramsey in a difficult away assignment. Petr Cech is likely to start in goal at Stamford Bridge but how long can the manager persevere with a keeper less suited to his approach than the new signing Bernd Leno? PDAway from home against a meticulously well-drilled Crystal Palace side, Liverpool’s pacy forwards are unlikely to be given the freedom of the final third that West Ham so generously bestowed upon them by playing such a high defensive line last Sunday. Touted by many as the only side with enough about them to prevent another Manchester City procession to the title, Liverpool need to avoid stuttering against mid- to lower-end Premier League sides if they are to put any sort of dent in the 25-point gap that separated the sides at the end of least season. Jürgen Klopp’s men dropped 19 points against teams that finished in the bottom six last season, nine of them against the three teams who went on to be relegated. They can ill-afford such profligacy this time round if they are to mount anything resembling a vaguely serious title challenge and the manner of their performance away from home against a Crystal Palace side that made short work of much-vaunted Fulham last weekend could provide a portent of things to come for fans who remember last season. BGTwo months after winning promotion by beating Aston Villa in the Championship play-off final, Fulham return to Wembley with at least half a new team and knowing that their new arrivals must blend in fast. Spurs did not play especially well during their win over Newcastle on the opening day and, let’s be honest, Harry Kane’s World Cup Golden Boot was an anomaly, as the striker has not been on song for a while. But Mauricio Pochettino’s team should still be able to test the solidity of Fulham’s central defensive partnership, which may not be strong even when Callum Chambers and Maxime Le Marchand are fully settled in. PDWith Phil Jagielka beginning a three-match ban, Everton may look to Yerry Mina or Kurt Zouma to line up alongside Michael Keane in central defence when they host Southampton. Much will depend on the duo’s fitness and Mason Holgate could start if Marco Silva decides his new recruits are insufficiently fine-tuned. Despite the preponderance of central defenders at his disposal, Silva has insisted the 21-year-old is very much part of his plans for the coming season. What this means for Keane, rumoured to be surplus to requirements at the club in February, remains unclear but the England international’s days in the starting lineup look numbered. With the arrival of Lucas Digne also ramping up the pressure on Leighton Baines in the left-back position, it seems that Séamus Coleman is now the only Everton defender guaranteed his place in the side. As selection headaches faced by recent Everton managers go, it makes a refreshing change. BGNeil Warnock and Rafael Benítez have a fractious relationship that dates back to 2007, when Warnock’s Sheffield United were relegated from the Premier League and their manager criticised the then Liverpool manager for fielding a below-strength side that lost against the Blades’ fellow relegation strugglers Fulham in their penultimate match of the season, a full 18 days before their Champions League final against Milan. Warnock’s comments about what he perceived to be a lack of sportsmanship prompted a threat of legal action and the Cardiff City manager later said he would “never forgive Benítez for playing what wasn’t even a reserve team”. Three subsequent matches with the pair in adjacent technical areas have passed off without incident, but Warnock has a notoriously long memory. In the event of any perceived injustices being visited upon either Cardiff or Newcastle in south Wales on Saturday, an entertaining feud could be reignited. BGLeicester’s owners’ idea is a fair one – to renew their team so they control matches and cut opponents open surgically rather than try to blow them away with counterattacks. But questions remain about the timing – is that really the way do make the most of Jamie Vardy while he is still in his prime? – and, most of all, about the identity of the manager chosen to usher in the new way. Claude Puel could take encouragement from how his team played at Old Trafford because although they lacked sharpness up front they were far brighter than they had been during most of their matches towards the end of last season. They need to show continued improvement during the first home match of the season, against Wolves, otherwise more fans will start wondering why Puel was kept on over the summer. It would help if he did not make one of the strange selections that he sometimes throws in, like starting Daniel Amartey at right-back while Ricardo Pereira plays in midfield and Marc Albrighton and Rachid Ghezzal sit on the bench. PDThere has been much talk about the possible toll that European exertions could take on Burnley. But Watford’s season will be even more hampered by travel difficulty if they do not improve their abysmal away form. They have scored only one goal in their past 11 away matches, a miserable streak that began under Marco Silva. Javi Gracia has to find a way of getting his players to perform away as well as they did when comfortably beating Brighton at home last week. Burnley is a suitable place to start, with Sean Dyche’s side having demonstrated last season how a club’s position can be transformed by overcoming away sickness. PDThe ease with which Liverpool ran through West Ham’s plodding midfield was hugely concerning for Manuel Pellegrini, who could yet rue failing to buy a top defensive midfielder this summer. The inexperienced Declan Rice was taken off at half-time at Anfield but it could just as easily have been Mark Noble or Jack Wilshere who joined Pellegrini on the bench for the second half. It was a disheartening way to start the season and West Ham will need to improve in the centre of the park when Bournemouth visit the London Stadium on Saturday. Pellegrini wants to play on the front foot and is not short of attacking firepower, but perhaps his first tweak should be to ask Pedro Obiang to sit in front of the defence. JSChris Hughton was at a loss to explain Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion’s lifeless display against Watford last weekend and there will have to be a vast improvement when Manchester United visit the Amex Stadium on Sunday. United will be out for revenge after losing this fixture last season and Hughton is likely to make changes in a bid to get rid of any lingering pre-season rust, which could mean that there will be full debuts for Yves Bissouma and Alireza Jahanbakhsh. Bissouma had an impressive cameo against Watford and could give Brighton’s midfield greater presence, while Jahanbakhsh has the potential to sharpen up Hughton’s misfiring attack.

Andy Carroll, Winston Reid and Manuel Lanzini all continue their rehabilitation from long-term injuries, but otherwise everyone is available. Provisional squad: Fabianski, Adrian, Fredericks, Zabaleta, Ogbonna, Diop, Balbuena, Rice, Cresswell, Masuaku, Noble, Obiang, Wilshere, Sanchez, Antonio, Yarmolenko, Snodgrass, Arnautovic, Perez, Hernandez, Anderson. And some (relatively) good news for Manchester City on Kevin de Bruyne’s injury:Here’s our news story on Gus Poyet and the goings-on at Bordeaux:Meanwhile Sean Dyche says Burnley are really, really fit. “The fitness here is unbelievable,” he said. “The players’ mental and physical fitness is absolutely fantastic. Statistically, it has been very high since I have been here. I’ll be going into Sunday believing these players will go again. They will run hard, they will play hard and they will do what they need to do to try and win a game.” But Robbie Brady, Steven Defour, Nick Pope and Tom Heaton are not fit, and won’t be in the squad to play Watford on Sunday. Neither will £11m striker Matej Vydra, formerly of Watford, who isn’t considered in peak condition. Provisional squad: Hart, Legzdins, Lowton, Taylor, Tarkowski, Mee, Gibson, Ward, Bardsley, Long, Cork, Hendrick, Westwood, Lennon, Gudmundsson, Vokes, Wood, Barnes, Walters. Done deal: Celtic have signed midfielder Daniel Arzani from Manchester City on a two-year loan deal, the Scottish champions have announced. Leicester meanwhile are without Shinji Okazaki and Matty James, while Caglar Soyuncu isn’t in the squad. Jamie Vardy has a “good chance” of starting the game at home to Wolves, according to Claude Puel. Provisional squad: Schmeichel, Ward, Jakupovic, Simpson, Chilwell, Morgan, Evans, Pereira, Maguire, Benkovic, Fuchs, Benalouane, Gray, Maddison, Albrighton, Amartey, Iborra, Silva, Mendy, Ndidi, Ghezzal, Kapustka, King, Choudhury, Iheanacho, Vardy, Diabate. And here’s Southampton’s provisional squad for tomorrow’s trip to Everton. Mohamed Elyounoussi has a hamstring injury and is unlikely to be risked, but otherwise they have a clean bill of health. Provisional squad: McCarthy, Gunn, Forster, Soares, Stephens, Yoshida, Vestergaard, Hoedt, Bertrand, Bednarek, McQueen, Targett, Hojbjerg, Davis, Romeu, Lemina, Ward-Prowse, Armstrong, Elyounoussi, Redmond, Sims, Gallagher, Long, Gabbiadini, Austin, Ings. Mark Hughes has reassured Steven Davis and Shane Long that they have a part to play this season, even though they didn’t feature in the opening weekend:I think players, unfortunately - and it happened in my day - when they are not in the first 11 for the first game of the season all of a sudden they get a little bit anxious and think maybe my future lies elsewhere and agents are telling them they’ve got to move. And that’s not the case with Shane and the likes of Steven Davis. They’re very much part of what we’re going to do this year and I just said to them: ‘At the end of the year, you’ll look back on the season and you’ll find that you’ve played many, many games so bear with me’.L’Equipe has a reporter on the scene. Apparently training has finally got under way, after a lengthy stand-off.Extraordinary goings-on at Bordeaux. First Gus Poyet blasts the board for selling the striker Gaetan Laborde to Montpellier without telling him - “It’s a disgrace what the club has done today. We arrived at the hotel and Laborde was not there. We called him and he was in Montpellier. Nobody told me anything” - then the board sack Poyet for his insolence, and now apparently the players are refusing to train in protest at the decision. Chaos!True fact: today is Black Cat Appreciation Day. So, any favourite Sunderland goals? Or any other black catfootball intersectional stories?Transfer news! Liverpool and Cagliari have agreed a £2m fee for Ragnar Klavan, who has a shade under nine and a half hours to agree personal terms and pass a medical if the move is to happen.And here’s some early Fulham team news for the same game. Tim Ream and Alfie Mawson are injured and Denis Odoi is suspended, but Joe Bryan has recovered from the ankle problem picked up in the defeat by Crystal Palace, and record signing Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa could make his debut. Fulham’s provisional squad: Fabri, Chambers, Le Marchand, Christie, Bryan, Sessegnon, McDonald, Cairney, Schurrle, Seri, Mitrovic, Rico, Fosu-Mensah, Kebano, Johansen, Cisse, Vietto, Kamara, Zambo Anguissa. The Press Association will helpfully send me Premier League team news as they get it. Here’s their provisional Spurs squad for the game against Fulham. Victor Wanyama has a knee injury, Erik Lamela and Harry Winks are in training but not fit, and Son Heung-min is at the Asian Games with South Korea, whose crucial Group E match against Malaysia kicks off at 1pm BST today. So Tottenham’s provisional squad looks like this: Lloris, Vorm, Gazzaniga, Trippier, Walker-Peters, Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Rose, Sanchez, Davies, Dier, Dembele, Eriksen, Sissoko, Alli, Lamela, Winks, Moura, Llorente, Kane.It’s transfer deadline day in Italy, which as we know from England’s experience last week promises all sorts of excitement (and very occasionally also delivers it). So there should be some actual transfers to report on as the day unfolds, but until then there’s the Rumour Mill:And we start with this somewhat mysterious story about the unexpected disappearance of the referee Bobby Madley, who “has decided to relocate due to a change in his personal circumstances”. It all sounds extremely curious, and with nothing further to report on the reasons behind his decision I can only hope that Madley is happy and well.So it is Friday, and that means we enter a world of almost-football we are not yet at that point when talk stops and action starts, but certainly the time for talking is running short. So, we’d better get on with it, then. The week’s last dregs of conversation and conjecture will certainly find a happy home here.The weekend’s significant action starts tonight, with the Spanish top-flight campaign getting off to a somewhat unspectacular start when Real Valladolid visit Girona, with Real Betis hosting Levante a little later. Barcelona’s campaign starts against Alaves tomorrow, with the Madrid sides joining the fray on Sunday.Before then there will be all sorts of press-conferential action to report, any amount of match-previewage, perhaps a sprinkling of transfer-gossipmongering and a seasoning of injury-updaterment. So welcome, let’s get this show on the road."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eabdbdc744f82428945038605759e604c18a4e0/1_0_2282_1370/master/2282.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de47b5d4b8848208b57198840f7cf7c0","title":"far righters james bond not on your team idris elba","story":"Katie Hopkins and Richard Spencer are upset at the idea of Idris Elba as 007. What makes them think the sexy, elitist spy is theirs to claim?Greetings, pop pickers – and you are cordially welcomed to an exciting new Lost in showbiz series. It is entitled You’re Wetting Your Pants About What Now?, and aims to showcase the pettier preoccupations of the far rightradical rightwhatever the free-speech snowflakes are demanding to be called this week. Now, you’d think these guys have a lot of big things to talk about. The clash of civilisations. The White House putsch. The fact you can’t say anything any more, even though they literally just said whatever it was. But it’s amazing how often the leading lights of wingnuttery become obsessed with sensationally trivial things.Only the other week, I saw Infowars starlet Paul Joseph Watson getting really upset about a temporary floating sculpture on the Serpentine in London’s Hyde Park. Poor Prison Plonker! On the one hand, you want to say: Dude, it’s great that you left your flat. It always feels to me like you’re 10 minutes off hiring a chief of staff, and I think that fresh air is a big part of staving off that inevitable moment.On the other hand: I’m sorry the sculpture hurt your feelings. But it’s just art. It can’t harm you. You don’t have to like it – not at all – but it’s going to be gone in a month or so, and you can still use the pedalos while it’s there. (Although, can you not go on them this weekend, because I’m going with my children. And whilst I’m mostly amused at the thought of them shouting: “THAT ISLAND’S LIKE ABNEY AND TEAL’S ISLAND!” while we drift past you shouting into your GoPro camera about men’s rights, it might be a bit worlds-colliding for me to handle while I’m pedalling.)But back to You’re Wetting Your Pants About What Now? Guess what this week’s big-wedge issue on the far right is. Is it some notional attack by “antifa” (ie anyone who disagrees with them)? Is it the hundreds of US news organisations opposing Donald Trump’s attacks on the press? No! It’s who might or might not play a pretend person in a movie. James Bond, to be precise, which in its current iteration is essentially a franchise about a man who has to have sex with as many beautiful women as he can in the world’s leading spa hotels. It’s like the Condé Nast Traveller version of Pokémon Go. But sexy, and with GCHQ top notes. And when the actor gets interviewed about it afterwards, they have to come off like the job’s slightly more gruelling than the Shackleton expedition.Anyway, news that Idris Elba is back in favour for the role is turning out to be one of the major plotlines in the twatosphere this week. Not only has Katie Hopkins made a video about it – more on that later – but American white supremacist Richard Spencer has devoted a lengthy and thundering tweetstorm (tweetsturm?) to it.I know what you’re thinking. Is the Fourth Reich actually here? Are all the institutions of a fully realised neo-Nazi utopia in place? Because if I were a white supremacist, I’d want to know every last person who didn’t seem like me had been rounded up before I saw my thought leader spending ONE SECOND of time having a view on who might play the lead role in a sexy spy movie. If I’ve told them once, I’ve told them a thousand times: it’s Lebensraum first, THEN you get around to having a view on who plays laser iPhones with Q.But we are where we are. For reasons which are really a matter for a trainee psychoanalyst, who plays James Bond is a big thing for Spencer. To this end, he has unleashed a series of thoughts so bovine that I’ll just give you one for a little flavour. “Make no mistake,” begins one of Richard’s mistakes, “a black James Bond would be an act of dispossession far greater than a flotilla of a million refugees.”OK … Aside from everything else – and there is a lot there – I can’t believe I’ve got to explain the absolute basics of the James Bond franchise to Richard Spencer. This thing really couldn’t be simpler or less opaque. It makes Jason Statham movies look like Mulholland Drive.Still, here goes: Richard? Richard??? What do you care what colour James Bond is? James Bond isn’t even on your team! YOU PLAY FOR SPECTRE, YES? If you’re not sure how your values align with those of that organisation, and not with those of say, Judi ruddy Dench, then let me help you. You believe democracy is a “passing fad”. You believe in highly non-mainstream world domination. And here’s the dead giveaway – Spectre is packed with actual Nazis! Blofeld literally sold secrets to the Third Reich. These. Are. Your. People.You know who isn’t your guy? Some elitist one-percenter in an Yves Saint Laurent dinner jacket who can’t go 50 miles in a high-performance sports car without shagging the help. How are you going to sell that to your incels? We all saw the footage from the Charlottesville rally – no sex is absolutely part of your side of the brand.Be honest, Richard. How do you see Bond working as a tiki-torchbearer for you lot? Let’s just stick a pin in the first reel of Skyfall, and try to picture one of your guys in the role. “Oh I’m sorry, I’m going to be unable to have sex with you in the shower of this seven-star Macau casino because a) I don’t like the look of Macau and b) Owing to what I believe to be a gland issue I feel self-conscious when I remove my buttoned-up white polo shirt and outsize pleat-front chinos.”Sorry, Richard, but at that point you’ve just lost the hard drive with the details of MI6’s entire undercover agent programme. Idris would have got the hard drive. He’d have had done what was expected of him in the shower (and done it well), then decoded some complicated cyberterrorism whatnot and relayed the breakdown of it back to London. Then sauntered off to have it out with Javier Bardem on that island that looks a bit like my flat after a Christmas party. I don’t see one of your lot getting it done, Richard. Waa waa waa, people are trying to replace us. Waa waa waa, can we stop for Cheetos.As for Katie Hopkins’s contribution to this absolute keystone of a debate, her video. What to say about this effort? As a filmmaker, she’s very like Leni Riefenstahl, except talentless and presumably filming in her garage. The production values are slightly lower than you might expect if you pressed record while your phone was in your pocket. It opens with Katie declaring: “No, Idris Elba, you cannot be James Bond” – an assertion to which the only response is: pretty sure that’s going to be up to Barbara Broccoli, not someone honking into the void somewhere in Devon.But clearly, there is a much bigger issue here. Namely, what is the point – WHAT IS THE POINT – of making a Bond-related alt-right video if you don’t use this golden opportunity to do a pastiche of Nancy Sinatra’s You Only Live Twice theme? It is the most open of all open goals. Think about it. Soaring strings. Cue titles. And then Katie’s voice warbling: “You own the libs twice …” Fine, I apologise for the fact that you’re going to have that as an earworm for the rest of the day. But honestly.

Rinkēvičs said it was a “very considerable risk” but stressed he remained optimistic an agreement with Britain could be reached.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Jensen was asked about Rinkēvičs’s remarks. He said: “I also believe that 50-50 is a very good assessment because time is running out and we need to move really fast if we’ve got to strike a deal that is positive both for the UK and EU.”He said that everyone who wanted there to be a good deal “needs to put in some effort in the months to come, otherwise I’m afraid that time will run out”. He went on to describe Theresa May’s Chequers plan – which includes a pledge that the UK would apply domestic tariffs on goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs on goods heading into the EU – as a “realistic proposal for good negotiations”.“We need to go into a lot of details but I think it’s a very positive step forward and a necessary step,” he said.The discussion comes after the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, warned that a no-deal Brexit would be “a mistake that we would regret for generations”. Eurosceptics in his party accused him of weakening May’s hand by making such comments.Ministers have spent weeks emphasising that May is “not kidding” when she says she will walk away rather than accept a bad deal, but Hunt sent the opposite message, suggesting that Britain would make concessions.Jensen refused to say whether Hunt would be easier to work with than his predecessor, Boris Johnson, but said: “I do believe that we had a good cooperation with Boris and I’m sure that we will have good cooperation with Jeremy.”In an interview with ITV News, Hunt said the UK would find a way to “prosper and thrive” but a no-deal Brexit would be a “geo-strategic mistake”.He said: “We want a deal with the EU that means we really can have a deep and special partnership, a friendship, going forward, not just in terms of our economic relations but in terms of everything else that happens on the world stage, and it would be a mistake that we would regret for generations if we were to have a messy, ugly orce and that is what we all want to avoid.”Hunt’s comments drew criticism from Brexiter MPs. Conor Burns, a Tory MP, told the : “The thing that we want to avoid for ‘generations to come’ is being locked into a permanent orbit around the EU where we end up with a deal but don’t have a seat around the table.”The foreign secretary said later on Twitter his warning was intended for the EU, saying it would be “a big mistake for Europe because of inevitable impact on long term partnership with UK.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bdd1e9e219d6966ce3e1b5992cd79c012e680fa/248_1306_5685_3412/master/5685.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62b657dbf44f920493589129f9804df8","title":"sadiq khan london resilience forum must prepare no deal brexit food medicine shortages","story":"Mayor instructs resilience forum to assess impact of food and medicine shortagesSadiq Khan is to instruct the body tasked with planning for terrorism attacks and disasters such as the Grenfell Tower fire to start making preparations for a no-deal Brexit, to assess whether London could face potential shortages of medicines and food.The London mayor said the government was dragging its feet and leaving businesses and EU citizens in limbo by refusing to guarantee their rights in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Khan said he would ask the London resilience forum to assess the impact of no deal on the capital’s access to medicines, energy, food and emergency services, as well as on law and order. The forum is made up of 170 organisations including the emergency services, local authorities and the NHS.The mayor said the government was being “held hostage by the hard-Brexit zealots in parliament” that made a no-deal Brexit more likely.“If the government had taken a different approach to the negotiations this would never have been an option, but we are now left with no choice but to plan for a no-deal scenario,” he said.The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, underlined the risks of no deal on Thursday. Speaking to ITV News in The Hague, on the latest leg of his tour of EU countries, he said the implications of no deal would be “profound”.“We have to be prepared for that we don’t want that to happen, though. And it would be a mistake that we would regret for generations if we had a fissure – a messy, ugly orce,” he said.The remarks are very likely to infuriate hardline Tory Brexiters, who have insisted no deal would be manageable. Hunt also struck an upbeat tone about the likelihood of achieving a deal on the basis of the government’s Chequers proposals, saying he was “getting a very strong sense that people want to engage seriously”.Khan’s intervention comes as Whitehall civil servants prepare to publish a slew of technical notes in the coming days on the no-deal preparations being made by a number of departments.Papers slated for publication next week include financial services and life sciences. In some areas, such as ensuring the continuity of subsidy payments to farmers, the government is confident that it could secure continuity even in the event of no deal. But in others, such as the impact of the loss of EU “passporting rights” for British banks, the immediate impact is uncertain.Khan said he would launch a consultation for London businesses to determine areas where City Hall could help them prepare for Brexit eventualities, but added that it was already clear the biggest threat was to the rights of European employees, who have not had their status guaranteed in the event of no deal.“The government’s current offer of settled status relies on a successful outcome of the Brexit negotiations,” Khan said. “If talks were to break down, the three million EU citizens living in the UK, around 1 million of whom are Londoners, would have no guarantee that their rights to stay and work would be protected.“Businesses regularly report the difficulty they face in getting the talented workers they need, and to now threaten the Europeans they currently employ is completely and utterly reckless.”Theresa May has previously pledged that “EU citizens living lawfully in the UK today will be able to stay”, whatever the outcome of the negotiations, and government sources said their right to stay would not be in doubt in the event of no deal, although some reciprocal rights such as access to benefits would need to be negotiated if the December joint agreement with the EU collapsed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e5949c8c2eed1cf93bad32ad1f1b9591701f3c7/274_178_3764_2258/master/3764.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=caef51b1a6579d25a278939fdf01e517","title":"ben stokes australia big bash closed sydney sixers","story":"Ben Stokes could see his return to the Big Bash League blocked, with the Australian team who were leading the chase to sign him ruling out any formal approach until after a cricket disciplinary commission has reached a decision on any punishment.Although Stokes was acquitted of affray after a week-long trial at Bristol crown court, the Sydney Sixers, who have openly expressed interest in the England all-rounder, take a dim view of his role in a Bristol street brawl.Jodie Hawkins, general manager of the Sydney Sixers, one of Australia’s leading T20 sides, said the team had akeen interest in the 27-year-old but evidence from the Bristol trial of Stokes and two other men had caused concern.“I’ve been following it all very closely and I definitely think what’s gone on with Ben would be a consideration in signing him,” Hawkins said. “He’s been acquitted but it’s definitely not a good look. We had been interested in him because a player of Ben’s calibre is always on your radar but until this is all cleared up, and that includes the ECB disciplinary process, we wouldn’t even consider it.”It is thought the Cricket Disciplinary Commission, which acts independently under the auspices of the England and Wales Cricket Board, will convene in the coming days to discuss whether Stokes is guilty of bringing the game into disrepute but it could take months for it to reach a conclusion and decide on any action.The ECB will address winter plans if an official approach is made to Stokes. But the  understands a no objection certificate (NOC) would be issued by his employer to play a short stint in Australian domestic cricket. Stokes, who was born in Christchurch, New Zealand, played for Melbourne Renegades in early 2015. But Cricket Australia may block his return, not least because the success of the Big Bash has been attributed to its appeal to families including young children. In 2016 more than half of the spectators across the tournament were families.The Big Bash is so protective of its “family-friendly” brand that no return has been granted to the West Indies batsman Chris Gayle who caused outrage in 2016 when he made inappropriate comments in a pitchside television interview with Mel McLaughlin, a female broadcaster."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6499e11a3b16ff598e28b49e9379b2a3c0f4b4ac/369_761_4485_2691/master/4485.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4df819e58dc588948f442cecc396bf7","title":"simone biles gymnastics olympics interview","story":"Much has changed since Biles’ history-making coronation at Rio 2016, but one truth remains: her only competition is herselfThe smile that lit up the 2016 Olympics in Rio, where she affirmed her presumptive status as the greatest gymnast ever with four gold medals in seven days, was nowhere to be found during last month’s US Classic in Columbus, which marked Biles’ first meet after nearly two years away from competition.She’d stepped out of bounds on her floor routine. She’d taken a hop back on her vault. She took a rare fall off the uneven bars that left her in an unfamiliar position entering the final rotation: second place.Then Biles, needing at least a 14.0 on the balance beam to avoid her first defeat since 2013, took a deep breath and nailed her routine, making a mockery of the discipline’s inherent unpredictability and that 711-day layoff. Her composite tally of 58.700 was not only enough to win, but marked the highest all-around score in the world since the 62.366 she’d posted in Rio.Much has happened in the two years since Biles took a break from gymnastics. The sport she’s come to define was rocked by the worst sexual abuse scandal in American sports history. Donald Trump was elected president and has since adopted sports as a proxy battle in the culture wars, ushering in an era of athlete activism unprecedented since the 1960s. But the 21-year-old from suburban Houston, who will make the second step of her comeback at this weekend’s US gymnastics championships in Boston, was able to show that one constant remains intact: her only competition is herself. First, the obvious question, given Biles’ body of work and legacy are beyond assail: why even come back?Sure, there’s a chance to make even more history at Tokyo 2020, where she can become the oldest woman in more than five decades to win the Olympic all-around title, the sport’s most coveted prize, and the first repeat champion since Vera Caslavska did it for the former Czechoslovakia in 1968. But Biles, who was born three months short of the age cutoff for the London Games, had already been hailed as the best gymnast in history before she’d even competed in an Olympics.“It just didn’t feel like real life while we were doing it,” she told the  this week. “You think it’s some different world, which it was. I almost think you forget how much work you have to put into it until you’re there.”Biles returned home after the Olympics to the whirlwind, peripatetic existence of a mainstream celebrity, slingshotting around the US for red-carpet walks, promotional appearances and glossy photo shoots when not headlining the 36-city Kellogg’s Tour of Gymnastics Champions or competing on ABC’s Dancing With the Stars. Then came a hard-earned series of vacations with the family and friends she’d sacrificed so much time with during her monastic preparations for Rio.But even after 14 months away from the gym, Biles knew she’d be back, if only, as she puts it, because she didn’t want to look back decades from now and wonder: what if?“I always knew I was probably going to come back,” she said. “It was just a matter of when. And so we kind of just settled down and waited for everything to slow down, and that’s when we decided in October of last year. By December, I had stopped traveling completely and was in the gym full time.”Following an amicable split with longtime personal coach Aimee Boorman, Biles enlisted the husband-and-wife coaching team of Laurent Landi and Cecile Canqueteau-Landi and training partner Ashton Locklear, who was an alternate for the Rio Games. At the World Champions Centre, the sprawling 56,000 sq ft gym built by her parents as their retirement venture, a constant stream of music – Eastside by benny blanco, Halsey \u0026amp Khalid is a current staple – helps Biles power through her famed marathon training sessions.But stepping back into her grueling regimen – six hours a day, six days a week – after so much time away was anything but easy. “We started with a lot of basics and conditioning in the beginning, so that you get back in competitive shape,” Biles said. “Usually for gymnasts the hardest part about returning is losing the weight you gain while you’re off, but I didn’t gain really anything on my time off so I really didn’t have that to worry about. I was just sore a lot. You just have to push through that.”She added: “It’s hard mentally and physically. I remember some of the days I’m like: ‘Why am I here? What am I doing? What did I do?’ But in the end it’s all worth it, so I’m happy with my decision to return.”The scary part for her rivals, as suggested by her US Classic showing, is that Biles may be better than ever. She won by a whopping 1.2 points despite major deductions on three disciplines, underscoring the caliber of difficulty and execution in her routines that few can even approach.The vaults that she performed in Rio are both unchanged. It’s the same for the beam, besides the addition of a front pike instead of a front tuck. But she’s added to her already jaw-dropping floor routine, adding a double-double lay-out to her first pass and a front-full to full-in on her second before punctuating it with the familiar double-double tuck and her signature: the Biles. The biggest improvements have come on the uneven bars, her weakest discipline, where she’s added a shaposh half and a double-double to her dismount under the watch of Laurent, who helped guide Madison Kocian to a silver medal on the apparatus in Rio. Biles has done some growing up since the Olympics, moving from her parents’ house into her own apartment, going public with her boyfriend (former gymnast Stacey Ervin), turning 21 and adding a French bulldog puppy named Lilo into the fold – even if he’s a bit too naughty to travel for now. She remains bemused by the trappings of stardom: “I got my Olympic ring tattoo and it’s on my right hand and everyone tried to tell me it was on my left hand, and I’m like, ‘OK, you guys have my arms on your body, I know that for sure!’”Other changes are less welcome. The specter of politics loomed over this year’s Winter Olympics far more than what Biles and her fellow Team USA members dealt with in Brazil, a snake-pit which she is more than content to avoid completely. Then of course there is the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal, which has prompted seismic changes in the sport. Biles acknowledged in January that she was abused under the guise of medical treatment by the disgraced former USA Gymnastics team doctor, who is serving an effective life sentence for his crimes. But she finds it extremely difficult to discuss what has happened, particularly while trying to balance her healing with the intense demands of the gym, and does not want to talk about the case in our interview.She enters this weekend’s nationals as a big favorite to become the first woman to capture five US all-around titles. At stake are the five places on the United States team that will travel to the world championships in Qatar this fall, which will be finalized at an October selection camp. “This week will be my second competition back, so I’m trying to take it day by day, competition by competition, and see how that goes,” Biles said. “The ultimate goal in the end will be worlds for this year and then in a couple of years the Olympics.”The older, wiser Biles says she feels less pressure now than ever before, measuring success less by victories and defeats. That must be easy when you never lose, but the point stands.“Everybody thinks a champion has to always be the winner, come out on top,” she said. “But I think everybody inside is a champion themselves depending on how you handle your failures and your successes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/931536eddd9d327f9ea723721af78cbc4377e782/0_97_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42c3ad6482a125b7b5dbb6e9b079f746","title":"elon musk says past year has been excruciating and worst is yet to come","story":"In emotional interview, Tesla founder says he has endured ‘the most difficult and painful’ time of his career Elon Musk has said the past year of his professional life has been “excruciating” and that stress over his business had caused his health to deteriorate.In an emotional interview with the New York Times the founder of electric car maker Tesla, also revealed that the pressures of work had caused him to spend his birthday stuck in the Tesla factory and almost miss his brother’s wedding.“This past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career,” he said in the interview.Musk, whose company posted a record $709.6m net loss in the first quarter of this year while struggling to manufacture large numbers of its Model 3 mass-market electric car, said he had been working up to 120 hours a week and as a result his health had been “not great” and his friends had been worried about him.Musk said there were times he didn’t leave the factory for three or four days at a time and days when he didn’t go outside.He added that he spent the entire 24 hours of his 47th birthday in June at work and flew directly to his brother’s wedding, where he was due to be best man, from work, arriving two hours before the ceremony and leaving immediately afterwards.Musk sparked a furore in the markets, the media and among investors earlier this month when he tweeted his intentions to take his publicly-traded company private, with the assurance: “Funding secured”.Lawyers have warned that his tweet may have broken 14e-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which prohibits publicly traded companies from announcing plans to buy or sell securities if executives don’t intend to complete, don’t have the means to complete, or are trying to manipulate the stock price.In the interview with the New York Times, Musk blamed short-sellers, from whom he said he anticipated “a few months of extreme torture”.“I thought the worst of it was over,” he told the New York Times. “But from a personal standpoint, the worst is yet to come.”Musk, who is a controversial figure, has drawn further criticism this year for his tweets. Last month he launched an extraordinary attack on one of the British ers involved in the rescue of 12 boys and their football coach who were trapped in a cave in Thailand, baselessly calling the er a “pedo” on Twitter.In June, Musk caused outrage when he responded to a tweet from a woman who claimed Musk had used her father’s unicorn artwork on Tesla merchandise without compensation or attribution, by telling her “He can sue for money if he wants, but that’s kinda lame”. Musk later settled the dispute with the artist.Musk has also lashed out at both the media and analysts from large Wall Street banks in recent months, calling questions from analysts “boring, bonehead questions” and suggesting he would start a website to rank the credibility of inidual journalists, after Tesla received negative press coverage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12007a9d55bdcabfeff37f687e3bfc6eeb16d4bd/563_536_3287_1973/master/3287.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e83ac4671aeef136d00dfaf9dae145c","title":"the community space bringing scandinavian chic to glasgow","story":"For Fika Sake has become the centre of a thriving community in the heart of Scotland’s largest city, as part cafe, part learning space and lifestyle hubThe idea for an events space centred around coffee and cake was inspired by a place where so many good things originate – Scandinavia. Fika is the most recent Swedish tradition spreading across the globe. “It’s about taking time out of your day to actually sit down and maybe relax with someone or maybe yourself – usually over coffee and cake,” says Simon Forsythe, Glasgow-based owner of For Fika Sake.Forsythe’s space is part cafe, part community hangout and part creative workplace. Covering 185 sq m (2,000 sq ft) in the centre of Glasgow, For Fika Sake is drawing in everyone from students and freelancers to yogis and parenting groups who want to engage with other locals and like-minded people while learning something new.Forsythe brought the idea to life in January 2016, opening the doors after a year of planning. “It started when I was having fika at a cafe in town with a friend,” he says. “I was working a part-time job in a normal cafe and was fed up with that experience. She was running music workshops in Glasgow and wanted to work on a different project.” After bringing in one other partner, they came up with the name: For Fika Sake. “We thought up a funny, controversial title, a play on words and we stuck with that and went with it,” says Forsythe.The sense of community created by the cafe extends beyond its doors – the coffee, tea, and cake that give the space its name are sourced from local suppliers. On any day of the week you can walk into For Fika Sake to find people filling the space with music from an old piano donated by a local social enterprise, in pottery workshops run by local artists up on the mezzanine, discussing their latest reads during a book club, or catching up with friends.“It’s great to have this kind of community coming in and using the space for what it was originally designed for,” says Forsythe. “One in particular that stands out is the community for young parents. The big space means they can come in and store their prams in the corner and hang out with other parents and their babies.”After a challenging start, seeing the space come to life has been the big payoff for Forsythe. In December 2016, he had to take on the business himself after his two partners left to pursue other projects. “It was a bit of a shock,” he says. “But the business seems to have taken off since last January.” While he admits it was tough, particularly with the other stresses that come with starting a new small business – like big overheads – he says one of the perks to come out of it is being able to make decisions quickly and easily. “There was no compromise-with-partners involved, so I was able to get things done and out of the way,” he says.Now word of mouth has spread and the business is growing, and that quick decision-making is allowing Forsythe to try new ideas and systems to keep things running smoothly. He recently switched over to a new platform to help him get on top of his cashflow. He chose Square because he liked the “cool and simple” card machine – but also because he could access his funds the next working day.“It’s made a massive difference,” he says. “With this kind of business the most important thing for survival is cashflow, so being able to access your funds the next working day is a serious win. If it’s over the weekend you get your cash on Monday rather than Wednesday.”It’s also given him the time and freedom to focus on drumming up creative ideas for new workshops and events to help the cafe thrive. But if creating a community hub was the grand idea behind the space, it’s the cafe and fostering the tradition around fika that Forsythe reckons is the powerhouse of the enterprise. “It keeps the business going and it creates that space for people to use the workshop side of things,” he says.Using Square’s app, he can create a product button for a new kind of service on the spot – a convenience he appreciates, given the ever-changing use of the space and the introduction of new workshops and events. “Overall, it’s running nice and smoothly and going with that original plan, which is amazing to see.”Where does he see himself next? Hopefully with a second space, in a few years, although perhaps somewhere sunnier. “I’d love to see it grow and take on another premises in another part of Glasgow or potentially in another city,” he says. “But working on what we have right now and just gearing up more towards the community and growing it within this community is still number one.”Learn more about Square"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c95d7742059bd3f8609504950a88fd397d4fe88/0_354_4724_2834/master/4724.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b352b3e059e6ee16c130814839e432f","title":"holland netherlands zeeland beach holiday with my father","story":"As a child, Caroline van Keeken hated family trips to this sleepy coast. But it’s now a popular holiday destination – and it turns out travelling with her livewire father is terrific funTwelve years ago, my father bought a holiday home in Zeeland, a coastal province in the southwestern Netherlands. Since then he only ever spends time at home – in Amsterdam – when his plants need watering.According to the latest figures, over half of all tourists visiting the coast of Zeeland are Dutch. As a child, I spent many a holiday here. However, during these brief escapes to Zeeland I always longed to escape back to Amsterdam. I did not know what to do with myself amid the endless, deathly quiet fields of maize, and the locals my age whose dialect I could not understand. Besides, I had secret but no less serious plans to launch an international career as the Dutch Britney Spears, so these seaside holidays did not suit me.And then there was my father. I always preferred to walk a few steps ahead of him so as not to get involved in the random conversations he struck up with complete strangers. Or not to be associated with him when he burst into song or dance, or both. But I’m all grown up now. I get this.Time for two days in Zeeland. Destination: the small village of Waterlandkerkje. The train from Amsterdam Central to Vlissingen takes three hours. The connecting boat to Breskens, across the Westerschelde, 30 minutes. Zeeland is an archipelago of peninsulas, all connected by bridges and tunnels. This southernmost part of Zeeland I am going to is known as Zeeuws-Vlaanderen and borders Belgium.I take the boat. On the aft deck I hear mostly German, but also some English and Flemish. Many of my fellow travellers are families with young children. And there are older couples, too. They are visiting Zeeland for its beautiful beaches, bike rides by the water, and fresh fish. For its peace and quiet, more than anything. But right now, in peak season, calm is not immediately apparent. Tourism is growing in Zeeland. Good news for those renting out holiday homes, such as ones directly on the beach for instance, on Noord-Beveland or Walcheren, and for campsite owners. Not so much for those looking for peace and quiet. Unless you know where you are going.My father is waiting for me: large white cap, sunglasses and waving both arms above his head while calling out my name. On our way to the house, he talks animatedly about his neighbour’s horse, which he found grazing in his garden the previous week. And about a nearby farmer who keeps an eye on his stabled cows via webcam. He’s called Frank, and I should definitely meet him.In the garden, we spend a long time watching a blackbird. “Isn’t it beautiful,” my father says. “It’s lording it over all the other birds.” The neighbours opposite are driving a tractor across the land they yell something and my father raises his hand. Other than that it’s quiet. “This is nothing like Amsterdam.”It is Wednesday morning and already quite warm when we drive 20 minutes to the beach at Cadzand. But first we stop off in Oostburg for a Zeeuwse bolus pastry at Bakkerij ‘t Bakkertje (“Bakery the Bakery”). They may have missed out on this year’s Best Bolus award, but their pastries are a household name. Baker Tamara Waebeke explains that they are selling some 200 a day this summer. “And it’s just bread dough with cinnamon and sugar.”Passing vast fields of maize, sugar beet, onions, potatoes and grain on either side, we drive towards the seaside resort. Over the past five years, the locals have witnessed huge changes here. From a sleepy little village by the coast, Cadzand has been transformed into one of the most popular holiday destinations in Zeeuws-Vlaanderen, and now has a few large hotels. The beach is crawling with sandcastle builders, kite flyers, surfers and children covered in ice-cream, straddling the various stages between euphoria and meltdown.“Let’s go.” My father wants to take me to Het Zwin, a nature reserve that crosses into Belgium about a mile down the road. It is a beach plain behind the dunes, and directly connected to the sea. At high tide, sea water enters Het Zwin via a channel. In this secluded spot, nature-lovers armed with binoculars go in search of plants and birds unique to this area. The sandy beach here is in sharp contrast with that of Cadzand. Here there is only a single beach pavilion to be found (De Zeemeeuw, which serves a good lunch) and just a few elderly couples, the odd dog and small groups of friends.Het Zwin is a place where you can find shark’s teeth on the sand as a result of shifting earth plates and beach replenishment. Today we fail to spot any, but we do see a trio behind a metal detector. André van Es hails from the east of the Netherlands and has been holidaying in Zeeland for 20 years. He is looking for ammunition from bunkers in the dunes that were blown up after the second world war. “This is my way of relaxing,” Van Es explains. “Wonderful”, my father says.Back in the car, we listen to the song Zoutelande by Zeeland band Bløf on the radio. Thanks to this summer hit, quite a few Dutch people have descended on the eponymous village this year, in search of seaside romance and the beach house mentioned in the lyrics. My father winds down the car window and treats passing cyclists to a concert.On Thursday we drive to Groede, 15 minutes away. Down narrow country roads we trudge behind slow tractors. The air is thick with the scent of leek. My father thinks he spots Frank, the webcam farmer, in a garage. He parks in front of the door, cups his hands around his mouth and yells into the empty space: “Fraaank!” He keeps this up for several minutes. I nod politely at two passersby. In Groede, we walk around the small village centre, past houses with picturesque facades, and along a street where artisanal workshops from the early 20th century have been renovated.On the square in front of the church we have coffee at De Drie Koningen. Followed not long after by a glass of their celebrated beer, brewed on site. Next stop: nearby Breskens, for fresh fish at fishmonger Erasmus in the port, where they have stretched the definition of “mussel time”. The official Dutch season starts in August and finishes in April.“The Zeeland mussel season will go on a little longer,” the woman at the fishmonger’s smiles mysteriously.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

But there’s a need for mission here in Ireland now, a need for a new evangelisation.”In the four decades since the last papal visit to Ireland, that of John Paul II in 1979, the country has seen a steep decline in the numbers of people attending mass and the moral authority of the church has been shattered by revelations of child sexual abuse and mistreatment of vulnerable women in the Magdalene Laundries.Ireland was a “very different society” today, said Martin. “Actually, to be honest, it’s a much more exciting and challenging place to be a priest and a pastor than to be part of some kind of big systemic culture in Ireland in which everyone does everything because that’s what the church said they have to do. Those days are long gone.”Pope Francis has faced calls to address issues such as the legacy of sexual abuse and its cover-up, LGBT rights and the role of women in the church during his 36-hour visit to the World Meeting of Families.“Sometimes people ask me: ‘Do you think the church can draw a line under the issue?’ I really don’t think we can.“When you meet survivors of abuse, they never draw a line under it. It’s with them for the rest of their lives – the horrific betrayal of trust, the sins and the crimes of the church, our shameful efforts at avoiding scandal which in the end created more scandal … It’s a shadow that’s there all the time.”The “awful, heinous wound on the body of the church” was not just a matter for local parishes or dioceses to deal with. “This is a systemic issue for the whole church. This is not an isolated issue of a bad priest in a particular school or parish. This is an issue where the whole culture of our church wrongly facilitated abuse.“Pope Francis can offer something, speaking on behalf of the church universal, that could be extremely helpful for all of us – survivors and those of us doing our best to deal with the legacy, the awful hurt and trauma that this issue has left.”Although other institutions and organisations in society were also facing up to the legacy of abuse and cover-up, the Catholic church could provide a model of “how a worldwide institution can accept its responsibility and then become, please God, at some stage instrumental in the healing of the terrible hurts that have happened. Pope Francis is the sort of person who can lead us on that journey.”He added: “Francis, ever since he arrived on the scene, has been challenging for all of us. He’s pushed us to consider the marginalised, the disadvantaged, to reach out to migrants, the homeless, to those forgotten in the normal day-to-day discussions in the public square. A lot of what he has said has disturbed our comfort as a church.”The archbishop said there was a “clerical culture” in Ireland, in which leadership was seen to be priests or bishops. “There are a lot of women already playing central leadership roles. We have outstanding women leading up our Catholic schools, for example, but if they do not feel affirmed in their role then we are failing and I’m saddened,” he said.In response to criticism and claims of exclusion from LGBT groups, he said for the first time the World Meeting of Families will host two panel discussions on how the church can “reach out to families struggling with this issue”.“How can we be faithful members of our church and present our teaching in a truthful, yet loving and merciful, way to all our children? That for me is the challenge,” Martin said.“Many groups feel excluded, feel we are insensitive in our language and our approach.

Photograph: Dylan VaughanGirls outperformed boys in the vast majority of higher level subjects, a gender analysis of this year’s Leaving Cert results shows.In all, girls secured a higher proportion of top grades – H1s, H2s and H3s, or 70-100 per cent – in 34 out of 40 subjects at higher level.Maths was one of just seven subjects at higher level where boys fared better than girls.Other higher level subjects where boys were superior included applied maths, chemistry, agricultural economics, engineering and construction studies.Overall, girls dominated the top grades across most other subjects such as languages, sciences and business courses.By contrast, Northern Ireland boys have marginally outperformed girls at the top A-level grade for the first time.They overtook girls by 0.4 per cent at the A* grade, which was first awarded in 2010.The performance gap between the genders also narrowed at the A*-A grade boundary. This follows concerted efforts to address the disparity by education authorities.Around 30,000 pupils in the north received their A-level and AS results on Thursday morning.In the Leaving Cert, meanwhile, stark differences in participation rates across inidual subjects remain, indicating that gender stereotypes are slow to shift.Of almost 4,668 students who took engineering at higher level, some 93 per cent were boys.Similarly, of the just over 7,100 students who sat the construction studies paper, almost 93 per cent were boys.Even though girls were significantly outnumbered in other subjects such as economics, technology and design \u0026amp communications graphics, they still managed to outperform boys.The pattern in participation was reversed in subjects such as home economics, for which the vast majority of candidates were girls (91 per cent).Other subjects where there were large majorities of girls included music (70 per cent) and art (60 per cent).Girls were also more likely to study languages such as Irish, French and Spanish. In all cases, in the region of 60 per cent of candidates in these exams were girls.Biology also attracted more girls. They accounted for 61 per cent of candidates.Despite the performance gap among the genders , boys actually accounted for all seven high achievers who received eight top grades or H1s (90 to 100 per cent).Separately, new research by the Educational Research Centre shows that 10-year-old girls outperformed boys on overall reading skills.The report is based on an analysis of a major new international study – published last year – which examined reading skills among hundreds of thousands of fourth class pupils across 50 countries.The trend of girls outperforming boys on overall reading skills was common across almost all countries.The research also uncovered some gender differences in the type of texts which boys and girls enjoyed.Author Mary Delaney said literary texts were generally less popular with Irish boys than girls. The exception was one text in which the main protagonists were animals, not humans.“Boys were more enthusiastic about informational texts, and this is reflected in much smaller gender gaps on these texts.”The research also found there was an incorrect assumption of maleness by pupils in particular contexts, such as where a scientist or explorer was mentioned.Lead author Dr Eemer Eivers said: “It is somewhat depressing that young children still seem to fall back on gender stereotypes, such as assuming that a science writer is male, even when she is clearly flagged as a woman in the article.”She said there is more work to be done in identifying and addressing the “unconscious gender biases” that permeate everyday life."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.2266695.1534448515!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"and here is our weather for the last 200 years","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWeather matters: A specially formed team at the Central Statistics Office, alongside Met Éireann, has been transferring the daily data to its computer system. A painstaking trawl through two centuries of daily Irish weather reports is expected to deliver new insights into how climate change might be affecting the country.Once complete, the project will open a treasure trove of information that will benefit our understanding of everything from farming practices to the pattern and prediction of major weather events.Daily handwritten records including measurements of sunshine, temperatures, wind, rainfall and humidity from Phoenix Park have been carefully preserved in old leather-bound logbooks at Met Éireann’s Dublin library.However, to date, our understanding of historic pre-1960s weather patterns has been limited to monthly summaries of these, offering a less-than-perfect picture.“Because the weather is so variable, the longer the time series you have the more you will be able to determine whether you think there is something different happening that is arising from human activity,” said Gerry Brady, the CSO senior environmental statistician leading the project.While it will not be finished until the spring, statisticians have so far been able to compile a snapshot of data between 1931 and 1959.Together with existing electronic records from 1960 on, they will begin to give the first clear picture of trends going back through the decades.Once the Phoenix Park project is finished, the CSO team will begin analysing another part of the country, eventually building a national picture.It is taking the team about six hours to input the data of each month – meaning the entire project will take about 9,360 hours to complete.Such complex material is unavailable in most countries and statisticians believe it will be of vital importance given Ireland’s geographical location on the western fringe of Europe in the Atlantic Ocean.Importantly, it will help analysts take a long view of weather before and after the growth of industry and emissions, particularly in terms of increasing motor and air travel from the 1970s.Monthly data summaries had previously been extracted for research. However, while they gave some historical understanding they clouded the specifics of what was happening throughout any given month.For example, if one April recorded a total of 40mm of rain then the average would show 1.3mm per day. However, if there had been only two days of rain with about 20mm per day then the true picture of 28 dry days would be hidden to anyone looking back. The project will expose those blind spots.In the period modelled to date, the CSO found that the only heatwave – five consecutive days of 25 degrees or over – occurred in June, 1949 when temperatures reached a high of 83 degrees Fahrenheit (28.3C). That heat wave was far more humid than the one this summer.It looked at heavy rainfall and found the wettest day of its sample period (71.3mm of rain) was on August 21st, 1955.Changing temperatures in a certain part of the country could have implications for approaches to farming – what crops are planted and when. The data can help to understand the movement of species the arrival of migrating birds and the possibility of mosquitoes.“Opportunities arise and threats arise if there are changes to the climate,” said Mr Brady. “It’s difficult to predict weather and the more data you have the more informed should be the predictions.”Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3598775.1534449802!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dup and sinn f%C3%A9in accused of abdication of responsibility over brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLisa Chambers accused the DUP of willingly ensuring that Stormont institutions are kept suspended because it suits the party’s agenda at Westminster. Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillMs Chambers, the party’s spokeswoman on Brexit, accused both parties of an “abdication of responsibility” in collapsing the Stormont institutions over the past 20 months. Speaking at the Parnell Summer School on the theme of ‘21st Century Democracy: Opportunities and Threats’, she said it was “remarkable” that the voices of Northern Ireland politicians were not being heard on Brexit. She pointed out that the only Northern Ireland representatives in Westminster are the DUP who are pro-Brexit, even though the majority of people in the North voted for the UK to remain in the EU. She accused the DUP of willingly ensuring that Stormont institutions are kept suspended because it suits the party’s agenda at Westminster and she said Sinn Féin was playing into its hands with its abstentionist policy. “These MPs matter all the more because since that disastrous snap election that Theresa May called where she lost her majority, their numbers are currently keeping May’s government in power,” she said. “The collapse of power-sharing in Stormont, with no imminent sign of its return, further adds to the imbalance in Northern Ireland’s democratic voice.” She accused the Government of “megaphone diplomacy” in relation to the backstop agreement that followed in the aftermath of the December agreement between the EU and the UK. There it was agreed that Northern Ireland would retain regulatory alignment with the EU if no deal could be reached between the EU and the UK. She said it created unnecessary tensions in Anglo-Irish relations and among Unionists. Speaking on the same platform at the Parnell School, former Siptu president Jack O’Connor, who will be a Labour party candidate in the forthcoming general election, said he too believed the Government had oversold the backstop arrangement agreed last December. Mr O’Connor said in his experience of 42-years as a union leader, he had learned the dangers of overselling deals. “The more you hype what you have achieved in negotiation, the more difficult it is for the people you negotiate with. The more you jeopardise the potential for the next agreement,” he explained. “This was a time for a more mature approach.” Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Imam, Mustafa Graf, appears to call for military or armed jihad in the recording obtained by BBC News.It is unclear whether Abedi – or any family members - attended the mosque on the day of the audio recording, but he is thought to have bought a ticket for the Ariana Grande concert 10 days later.Mustafa Graf, chief imam at Didsbury Mosque in ManchesterAfter the arena bombing Didsbury Mosque called for anyone with information about the bombing to contact the police and attempted to distance itself from the attacker.According to the BBC News at least five men who have attended prayers at the mosque have either travelled to Syria or have been jailed for terrorism offences.The trustees said none of these men had visited Didsbury Mosque.The sermon by Mustafa Graf, which was delivered at the time of the bombing of Aleppo, includes prayers for “Mujahideen” – a term often used for a group fighting armed jihad abroad.CCTV shows Salman Abedi in the Manchester area in days preceding the attack on the Manchester Arena. Right: Didsbury MosqueWe ask Allah to grant them Mujahideen - our brothers and sisters right now in Aleppo and Syria and Iraq - to grant them victory, he is reported to have said.Elsewhere Graf says, “Jihad for the sake of Allah is the source of pride and dignity for this nation”, it is claimed.In another passage he allegedly says “now it is time to act and do something”.The sermon centres on the suffering in Syria and includes an appeal for donations, with Graf at one point saying “the whole world, including Europe, America, what is the so-called civilised world” is watching what is happening in Aleppo and Syria.“They know that Iran, Russia and the militias are killing humans in Syria and they do nothing. Well in fact they helped Iranian, Russian and others to kill Muslims over there.”BBC News played the audio for two Muslim scholars who said they both believe the language of the sermon represents a call for armed jihad.He\u0027s giving them the narrative of them against us”, says Islamic scholar Shaykh Rehan, “He is psychologically and practically brainwashing young people into either travelling or to do something to take action.The jihad he\u0027s referring to here is actually being on the battlefield, there\u0027s no if\u0027s and no buts in this.He\u0027s giving them the narrative of them against us”, he continues. “He is psychologically and practically brainwashing young people into either travelling or to do something to take action.He goes on to say, “I have known the Islamic discourse for pretty much 40 years, from being a child in this country and worldwide, and the Mujahidin are the group fighting armed jihad”.The  contacted Didsbury Mosque but Imam Mustafa Graf was unavailable for comment.Please review our commenting policyNorth Korean fashion police crack down on banned haircutsItalian government gives Genoa bridge company 15 days to prove it maintained collapsed structureReturn of Monkmania: University Challenge duo Monkman and Seagull given their own BBC showAdmiral who oversaw Bin Laden raid says it would be an \u0026#39honour\u0026#39 if Trump revoked his security clearanceEvan Davis forced to issue response to \u0026#39ridiculous\u0026#39 claims over Britain First photoI\u0026#39ll resign in a year if I fail to cut drugs and violence in Britain\u0026#39s prisons, minister saysBarry Chuckle\u0026#39s funeral to be held in stadium as fans invited to line streetsThe UK\u0026#39s highest paying degrees, according to graduate salarySmoke from fire rises from rubble of collapsed Genoa bridgeCelebrity Big Brother 2018: launch show - Kirstie Ally joins kidnapped model Chloe Ayling but no sign of Stormy DanielsChinese plane skids off Manila runway in downpourComment: New Zealand is turning away apocalypse-fearing billionaires...

She has adopted four Malawian children and was in the country to celebrate the first anniversary of the Mercy James Centre for Pediatric Surgery and Intensive Care, named after one of her adopted daughtersMadonna and Jean Paul Gaultier arrive for the 2018 Met Gala But there is one area where the older woman is suddenly and somewhat unexpectedly thriving – rock music. Madonna celebrates her 60th birthday on Saturday. Kate Bush has just celebrated hers. In fact, they are the spring chickens. Suzi Quatro, 68, and Patti Smith, 71, are not just still rocking, they are still snarling. Cher at 72 pops up with a delightful cameo in the Mamma Mia!\u0026nbspmovie. The queen of soul, Aretha Franklin, is still recording at 76.\u0026nbspWho’d have thought it? Look back to the 1960s and there were precious few women at all in pop music, let alone older ones. In the UK, Sandie Shaw, Dusty Springfield, Marianne Faithfull and a handful of others carried the fight to the mass of male groups (the word boyband had yet to be invented).No one thought then about whether the stars would still be recording and performing in old age. Indeed the concept was unthinkable – for men as well as women, for stars as well as fans. When I put it to Paul McCartney that he must be surprised to be still going, he replied: “I do rub my eyes. I didn’t foresee it. In The Beatles we always said 10 years. But it kept on and kept on and it kept being good and we seemed to be the people who could do it. Now there is a great young generation of people who can also do it, but it tends to be that the people packing them in are the people who have the material, have hits, songs people know, and I think that’s important. I think they have stagecraft, they have an ability with an audience.”There’s no doubting that the likes of Madonna and Kate Bush have stagecraft in spades. Even in an industry that ostensibly prizes youthfulness and a certain amount of athleticism on stage, the female superstars, like the male, are now gliding into pensionable age, with fan bases, voices, charisma and downright sexiness still intact.\u0026nbspThough, when it comes to longevity, the women themselves didn’t always think it would be the case. Joni Mitchell once remarked, all too despondently: “Record companies want the look. And if you’re over 50, however well preserved, you just don’t have the look.”Maybe the look, or audience perception of the look, has changed. No one remotely cared that Kate Bush looked older than they remembered her (quelle surprise) when she made her stage comeback after 35 years in 2014. And tickets were inevitably like gold dust. I was there to note that she sounded the same, and she still exuded charisma and stage presence.She did a staggering run of 22 performances. Two things perhaps attested to the more mature Kate. The show was only part rock concert, it was also part theatre with video and dance, and even the odd comedy sketch starring her son. Also, she gave all her audiences an instruction on her website, which bore witness to the fact that she comes from an earlier generation than today’s performers. She wrote: “I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras.”Suzi, 68,\u0026nbspsays she\u0027ll \u0027retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is\u0026nbspsilence\u0027 (Getty)\u0026nbspEarlier this year I witnessed the return to live performance of Annie Lennox, at the age of 63. To raise funds for her charity she did a one-off show which was largely a chat show, interspersed with the odd song at the piano, going through her life and career. The self-deprecating humour was erting: “When I was studying at the Royal Academy of Music, I lived on £3 a week.” Pause. “Scottish people can do that.” Pause. “And we like it.”Perhaps she had stumbled across the format for the older star, a chat show setting interspersed with the odd song. Except, at the end that she knocked everyone there for six with a breathtaking 30 minute performance of Eurythmics and solo hits that showed she retained all her talent. She was the epitome of soul as she belted out Eurythmics anthems, sometimes crawling sensuously across the floor as she did so. The only surprise was that she had (lamentably) eschewed live performance for 10 years.For some female legends, the routine can be tiring. I was at Marianne Faithfull’s most recent London appearance, an intimate show at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club. Plagued by a variety of physical problems over the years, she had a walking stick and performed most of the show sitting down. It was nevertheless a beguiling evening. But notably at one point she actually pleaded with her fans to allow her to retire. “Please let me go,” she said, “I can’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith,” referring to her long-time friend Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, definitely not one of life’s quitters.Madonna, too, is not one of life’s quitters. Her fitness routine keeps her more than show-ready, even for a show as heavy on breathless choreography as hers. But I think there is another clue to her longevity in what she said to the audience at one of her shows that I attended 15 years ago. Just before her final encore, she said in idiosyncratic style: “When I was a girl I always thought ‘grown-ups can f**k off’. But now I’m 45 years old, I have children of my own, and you know what, grown-ups can still f**k off!”As I say, it was a piece of philosophy delivered in her personal style. But it perhaps partly explains her longevity and continuing appeal. She retains the anarchic spirit she had when she burst on the scene. Female rock stars, just like their male counterparts, and possibly more so, have no intention of growing old gracefully. They haven’t just retained their vocal prowess and stage presence, they have retained the hint of adolescent rebelliousness that has always been an intrinsic part of rock’s appeal. And having met both Madonna and Suzi Quatro, I can attest that in both cases the aggressive, in yer face attitude is not just a stage technique.But rock-star rebelliousness is not the only reason that rock and pop’s biggest female stars go on and on or come back after long absences. Kate Bush was never keen on playing live and before her comeback had only done one tour of the country. But she was persuaded to perform again by her teenage son. As she had a song on one album about watching his clothes go round and round in the washing machine, it was clear that a request from him would, fortunately, carry weight.Victoria Beckham is, of course, far from the vintage of Bush, Madonna and the other older stars. But when the Spice Girls had their reunion tour, it’s interesting that she said the key reason she wanted to do it was that her children had seen Dad play football and knew all about his skills. Now was a chance for them “to see what Mummy did” before they were born.Performing for a global audience is important. But performing for the family clearly also is a factor in keeping the career going.Jonathan Morrish, a long-time senior executive at Sony record company, and now a music industry PR consultant, says: “Women generally live longer than men, so it should come as no surprise that so many as they get older seem to flourish creatively with their music and on stage. None of this is easy. I know from the many artists that I have worked with you need tenacity. So perhaps it’s the staying power they had to show at the beginning of their careers, perhaps a savvy emotional intelligence –\u0026nbspwhatever it is, I admire and welcome it. And applaud them.”\u0026nbspAnd even for those female rock and pop stars who have decided to call it a day, a new avenue has opened up: the stage musical. Right now in London, audiences can see Tina Turner on stage at one theatre, and The Supremes and all the other Motown stars at another. Or at least, one can enjoy their music and life stories, delivered by lookalikes and sound-alikes. It’s possible not just to go on into old age, but literally forever.Faithfull pleaded with a crowd at Ronnie Scotts: \u0027Please let me go. I\u0026nbspcan’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith\u0027 (Alamy)Meanwhile, there is a core of\u0026nbsp 60- and 70- something female rock stars, who thankfully show no signs of even thinking about stopping and relying on musicals to seal their immortality.No one puts it better than Suzi Quatro, celebrating 54 years in the business, who states: “I will retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is silence.”David Lister is the former arts editor of The IndependentEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/10/16/south-africa-school.jpg","title":"south africa corruption president ramaphosa mabuza zuma anc","story":"Created with Sketch.The ruling African National Congress pledges education and opportunity\u0026nbspfor black people\u0026nbsp– but embezzlement in the\u0026nbspdeputy president’s province has left schools so decrepit that children plunge to their death in toiletsClick to followThe Independent OnlineSchool at Orange Farm, near Soweto: one of the ANC’s policies is to improve education for black South African childrenZiyanda\u0026nbspNkosi hated going to the bathroom at school. The pit toilets were so dark, dirty and crumbling. Many children were so afraid of them that they simply relieved themselves in the schoolyard to avoid the ordeal.But as she played with her best friend during recess, the little girl, a six-year-old first-grader, really had to go. She stepped warily inside the closet-like latrine.Even with the gentle pressure of her tiny frame, the floor caved in. Ziyanda flailed wildly, clinging to the edges of the hole, frantically trying to keep herself from falling in and drowning in the fetid pool below.“Mommy! Mommy!” she screamed, managing to hold on long enough for an older boy to run in and save her.Hundreds of parents, enraged that their warnings about the dilapidated school had been ignored for years, burst into protest a couple of days later, upending their quiet rural town for two weeks last August. They burned tires, blocked roads and demanded justice from the provincial government led by David Mabuza, a former maths teacher who had become one of the most powerful figures in the African National Congress (ANC) and was positioning himself to become South Africa’s deputy president.One of the party’s historic promises had been to provide a good education for black people, who had been deliberately denied the opportunity under apartheid. ANC leaders like Nelson Mandela often spoke about freeing black South Africans through school\u0026nbspand Mabuza, whose first big post in the province was education minister, got his political start by promising just that.But under the ANC the education system has been a\u0026nbspshambles, so gutted by corruption that even party officials are dismayed at how little students are learning, in schools so decrepit that children have plunged to their deaths in pit toilets.The rage in Ziyanda’s town grew so intense that protesters hurled stones at a local ANC leader, who narrowly escaped by whipping out his handgun and shooting randomly into the crowd, wounding two children and roiling the community all the more.Mabuza never came to the school or met with the parents –\u0026nbspand for good reason, local officials contend. The dangerous conditions were a clear reflection of his control over the province, where millions of dollars for education have disappeared into a vortex of suspicious spending, shoddy public construction and brazen corruption to fuel his political ambitions, according to government records and officials in his party.But the uprising and allegations against Mabuza did not crimp his political rise. To the contrary, only a few months later, as the ANC tried to quash national outrage over misrule by its leaders, Mabuza scored his biggest triumph by far. He was picked to become second-in-command of the entire ANC, launching him into an even more prominent post\u0026nbspas South Africa’s deputy president, second only to the nation’s leader.Mabuza may seem an odd choice, especially at a time when the ANC is desperate to purge its reputation for graft and restore its image as the rightful heir to Mandela’s legacy. After all, Mabuza’s rural province, Mpumalanga, is fairly small, has little economic clout and is widely regarded as one of the country’s most corrupt.But that is the vexing secret behind Mabuza’s spectacular climb, current and former ANC officials say: he siphoned off money from schools and other public services to buy loyalty and amass enormous power, making him impossible to ignore on the national stage and putting him in position to shape South Africa for years to come.Mabuza (second right) (AFPGetty)“He didn’t become what he is now because of his political capability,” says\u0026nbspFish Mahlalela, a senior ANC figure in the province and a national lawmaker.“No, no, it was out of money and\u0026nbspmanipulation,” he adds. “Nothing else.”Perhaps more than any other member of South Africa’s new government, Mabuza undercuts the promise of a “new dawn” in the country after the removal of President Jacob Zuma this year.Besieged by scandals that have hacked away at the ANC’s legitimacy and electoral prospects, the party installed a new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, in February. From the start, he pledged to root out corruption and finally deliver on the promise of a just South Africa for all of its citizens.But to seal his new post, Ramaphosa first had to secure the backing of Mabuza, 57, who built such a formidable political machine that he became kingmaker in the back-room negotiations to choose South Africa’s new president. After campaigning for a rival, Mabuza abruptly switched sides and joined forces with Ramaphosa, helping the two emerge from a pivotal party conference last December as the country’s undisputed leaders.Then, to the surprise of many in his province, Mabuza gave a speech just weeks after being sworn in as deputy president this year, lamenting the poor state of the schools and the “tragedies that take away the innocence of our children”. He spoke movingly of a kindergartner electrocuted at school. Of a toddler who drowned after falling into a broken pit latrine. And of a five-year-old boy whose body was discovered by his mother at the bottom of another dilapidated pit, his hand sticking out of a pool of faeces.Such deplorable conditions were all too common, he noted, symbolising the failure to provide black South Africans with a decent chance at life.“Where is our care?” Mabuza said in the speech. “What has gone wrong with our nation?”Yet under Mabuza’s leadership, millions of dollars for schools in his province have been misspent year after year, according to the national government. His province routinely spent less on poor students than required\u0026nbspand school construction projects have been riddled with inflated costs, government records show.Nearly a quarter of the primary schools in Mabuza’s province still have only dilapidated pit toilets, despite ample government funds to fix them. And during his tenure, his province was caught fabricating the passing rates on the annual national exam, enabling him to claim big leaps forward that never happened.The schools Mabuza did champion provided an easy way to funnel large amounts of money into politics, according to ANC officials, high-ranking defectors and anti-corruption groups. He pushed to build big boarding schools whose costs tripled\u0026nbspfor unexplained reasons\u0026nbspto $30m (£23m) each, alarming education experts. Some construction was so shoddy that roofs sprouted leaks soon after being finished, toilets barely worked, students lacked water, retaining walls collapsed and dormitories were missing doors, according to a provincial report.Over the years, Mabuza’s province also became known as one of South Africa’s most dangerous. Nearly 20 politicians, most from inside the ANC, were assassinated in the past two decades, some after exposing graft in public works projects.All the while\u0026nbspMabuza’s political career flourished. He attracted legions of new ANC members with government contracts, cash handouts and even KFC meals, according to current and former party officials.His sweeping recruitment drive turned his relatively insignificant province into the ANC’s second biggest voting bloc. Under the party’s delegate system, his territory became more influential than even Gauteng, the province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria\u0026nbspwith a population three times the size and an economy nearly five times as big.Now, critics contend, Mabuza’s role as the country’s second most powerful politician casts doubt on the legitimacy of the new government and its assertions that the ANC is turning the page on corruption.Under the ANC, Mandela’s once-heralded liberation movement, tens of billions of dollars meant to lift poor black South Africans have been stolen by party leaders. Strong institutions like the tax agency have been hollowed out by party officials bent on shielding their illicit activities.But the nation’s poor schools are perhaps the ANC’s greatest betrayal of the dreams of black South Africans – some of whom have turned to burning down such institutions in protest.Mabuza, who declined to be interviewed, built his political career on the schools. Unlike other, more celebrated anti-apartheid leaders, he did not go into exile he was not imprisoned on the infamous Robben Island. Instead, he fought for the right of black South Africans to receive an equal education, a call he echoed in his recent speech.As many South Africans pin their hopes on Ramaphosa’s pledge for a fresh start, analysts say that much of the country is looking past an unpleasant truth: the new president owes his victory in part to corruption, and much of his administration’s future – as well as the country’s – rests in the hands of Mabuza.“If there is any powerful person whom Ramaphosa’s presidency actually relies on, it is Mabuza,” says\u0026nbspRalph Mathekga, the author of Ramaphosa’s Turn: Can Cyril Save South Africa?“We are being reluctant as a nation to face the reality of Mabuza,” he adds. “If Ramaphosa gets hit by a bus, Mabuza is going to be the president.”Scandal from the startThe numbers just didn’t add up, even at the beginning.After apartheid ended in 1994, Mabuza got his first big break: he became Mpumalanga’s education minister, a chance to shape the schools and generations of students attending them.He had the perfect resume. The son of farmers, Mabuza grew up here in the province, walking miles from his village to the only primary school in a nearby town. Though he often had no shoes, he always tucked in his shirt and buttoned it up to the neck, recalls\u0026nbspReginah Mhaule, a childhood peer.“He was never late,” says\u0026nbspMhaule, a longtime ally who recently became one of South Africa’s two deputy foreign ministers.A bright student, Mabuza ultimately took one of the few jobs available to black South Africans back then. He taught maths at the local high school and later became a founding leader of a teachers’ association.Poor schooling was a major spark in the anti-apartheid movement, most notably in Soweto in 1976, when thousands of students protested the introduction of Afrikaans as the language of instruction. In Mabuza’s province, teachers and students began organising against white minority rule in the early 1980s.The teachers were at the centre\u0026nbspof the movement, says\u0026nbspSandile Sukati, a teacher who recruited Mabuza into the main student organisation. Mabuza quickly stood out, he says, travelling far and wide to build ties among anti-apartheid groups.Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)“He was a leader in his own right,” Sukati says.But after apartheid ended, Mabuza quickly ran into trouble, leading to the province’s first big scandal of the democratic era.\u0026nbspIn 1997, three years into his tenure as education minister, the schools were performing poorly, especially on the national obsession: the annual matriculation exams that determine whether students graduate from high school. The passing rate in his province was 46 per cent that year, slightly below the national average.Mabuza was feeling the pressure, particularly as powerful ANC leaders returned from exile, often with military credentials that overshadowed his own, several current and former ANC officials say.Sukati, who worked under Mabuza at the education department, recalls Mabuza\u0026nbsptelling some of the teachers: “I am in a tight situation.”\u0026nbspThe next year brought a stunning improvement. The passing rate inexplicably jumped to 72 per cent – an incredible turnaround that catapulted Mpumalanga to second place\u0026nbspamong the nation’s nine provinces.“I was suspicious,” says\u0026nbspSukati, who is now a senior education official. “It couldn’t just happen like that.”A whistleblower exposed the cheating a few weeks later. The real passing rate, authorities announced, was under 53 per cent. Moreover, the doctoring had taken place inside Mabuza’s residence, where he met with a small circle of bureaucrats, some of whom were later fired.An investigation was never completed. Mabuza never admitted wrongdoing or suffered any significant consequences. Dropped as education minister, he was named head of housing instead.Ever since, Mabuza’s career has been remembered for that scandal, one that helped establish the kind of culture of impunity in his province that has tarnished the ANC across South Africa..“I think\u0026nbspthe man, he had to be charged, but unfortunately I don’t know what went wrong,” says\u0026nbspRonnie Malomane, an ANC official who was taught maths by Mabuza in the early 1980s. “They were just giving him position after position.”Nationally, Mabuza’s standing kept rising, propelled by his success at attracting new party members. In 2009, Zuma appointed him premier of all of Mpumalanga province.But Mabuza raised more red flags, stripping some of the decision-making power over government projects from local officials and concentrating it in his own office. He justified the move – called the “Rapid Implementation Unit” – as a way to act quickly. Others had a different explanation.“That’s how he managed to loot,” says\u0026nbspCollen Sedibe, a former ANC leader who grew up on the same street as Mabuza and worked under him in the provincial housing department.Treasury officials in the province say they are now investigating the irregular expenditures “incurred through the contracts arranged centrally by the Office of the Premier”.But parents, officials and educators had warned about the damage from corruption and neglect for years, pointing to the painfully overcrowded classrooms and decaying, apartheid-era schools.‘They wanted to kill me’It took four days of rage before the local ANC councillor showed up.The councillor, Justice Twelve Siboza, explained that he had been busy the week Ziyanda fell into the toilet, tending to another corner of his ward. Other activities had also drawn his attention: he is a gospel singer with his own radio show, so he crisscrosses the region to perform at weddings and funerals.By the time he got to Ziyanda’s school, hundreds of parents had closed off the unpaved roads, furious that their grievances had been met with near silence from the ANC’s leaders.Siboza made sure to bring a gun. Politics is dangerous in South Africa, sometimes lethal, he says.The ANC has a grip on the area around the school because most residents, aside from the lucky few working at the sugar cane plant, are poor and rely on the party for government jobs, contracts or monthly welfare grants.It is an area Mabuza knows well. He began his ascent inside the ANC as the head of this part of the province. It was once part of a homeland set aside for black people by the apartheid government. To this day, several ANC officials say, Mabuza has kept a hold on it through powerful proxies.Some see a deep cynicism behind the conditions in the schools. When black South Africans become educated and move into the middle class, their loyalty to the party tends to wane, recent elections have shown. So by perpetuating a culture of dependence, critics contend, the ANC ensures its dominance.But Mhaule, the childhood peer of Mabuza, rejects\u0026nbspany suggestion that the ANC had failed to prioritise education.Officials like Mhaule say the rising pass rate on the national high school exam provides clear evidence of progress. But the figures can be misleading. The number of students taking the exam has declined in the past two years. Weaker students who would drag down the rate are being held back, education experts say.About 600 protesters gathered at the school that cold Friday morning when Siboza, the local ANC councillor, arrived with a police escort. As he moved to talk to the parents, demonstrators showered him with rocks.“They wanted to kill me,” the councillor says.Siboza made a run for it, reaching for the hip holster under his brown overcoat. He took out his gun – firing three times and hitting two teenagers, a girl and a boy.Agreement Mashele, the school board chairman, was shocked. “This man is a church member,” he says.A few days later, the ANC councillor visited the children he had wounded.“The councillor said he was very sorry,” says\u0026nbspthe girl, Siphesihle Ngobeni, whose left leg was grazed by a bullet. The councillor pleaded with her not to press charges and gave her about $15, she says. She used the money to buy sanitary pads.The boy’s injury was more severe. His father, Petros Thobela, who had gone to the same primary school and did not have a job, accepted a similar apology and compensation of, according to the councillor, about $150.The boy’s mother, Nobuhle Ndlovu, who does odd jobs, deplores\u0026nbspthe state of education.“They promise,” she says, “and they just disappear.”Still, she would remain loyal to the governing party.“Yes, of course, I vote ANC,” she says. “It’s our freedom.”‘He always had money in his house’The protests spilled into September, but the country’s attention was fixed on another battle: the national push to replace Zuma as South Africa’s president.The all-important ANC party election was only a few months away, and officials in Mabuza’s province were bracing to see whether his years of hard work had paid off.In early October, the ANC released the delegate breakdown, with good news for Mabuza: his previously low-ranking province was now the ANC’s second most powerful.Mabuza owed his outsize influence to a single feat. In the past decade, ANC membership in his province had skyrocketed nearly 190 per cent, eclipsing the national increase of less than 60 per cent. No other province came close to matching Mpumalanga’s explosive growth.But Mabuza’s numbers were as cooked as his high school passing rates, current and former ANC officials contend.In South Africa, taxes are collected by the national government, which distributes the money to provinces. The provinces then use the money – with little oversight from above.Treasury officials in Mpumalanga say that “irregular expenditures” more than doubled in the previous two budget years, particularly in education, housing and health.Wages account for most of the education and health budgets. So money is usually siphoned off by politicians and business allies through contracts for services or construction, ANC officials say. When costs are suspiciously high, schools are poorly built or facilities are badly maintained, they say, it is often a warning that money is being skimmed, at the students’ expense.Thousands in Israel protest draft law that would ‘exclude’ ArabsGrenfell victims were subject to ‘social apartheid’, says Diane AbbottSouth Africa is the most unequal country in the world, says World BankMandela’s letters chart his heartbreaking struggle from behind barsAs premier, Mabuza promoted the construction of big boarding schools, or mega-schools, in farm areas to improve rural education. Since 2012, the province has completed five, with two more in the pipeline.For reasons that have not been explained, the price of each school has ballooned from $11m to around $30m.Asked whether Mabuza wanted the mega-schools to facilitate the theft of public funds, Mhaule, his former education minister, laughs\u0026nbspand says:\u0026nbsp“I don’t know.”But other officials say the mega-schools were overpriced projects to reward Mabuza’s allies and finance his ANC membership drive.Mabuza\u0026nbspwas sworn in as deputy president in February. “His passion,” reads his official biography, “still remains in education.”Minutes after the swearing-in, he faced questions about corruption and political killings in his province. “There’s nothing to set straight,” he told the national public broadcaster.“I’m here to serve South Africans,” he added. “Let’s give this government a chance.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/07/11/fossil.jpg  width= 709  height= 479  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/07/11/fossil.jpg","title":"australia fossils rocks first life forms strelley pool microfossils chemicals mit","story":"Created with Sketch.Scientists say\u0026nbspit is remarkable \u0027echoes of past life\u0027 have lasted\u0026nbsp3.4 billion yearsClick to followThe Independent OnlineAn electron microscope image of a microfossil from Strelley Pool, of the variety analysed in the new studyChemicals found in 3.4 billion-year-old rocks have confirmed them as contenders for the title of oldest evidence of life on Earth.Discovered in Western Australia back in 2013, the Strelley Pool “microfossils” are thought to be all that remains of ancient bacteria.But the passage of time takes its toll on all fossils, especially microscopic ones.This means any remains that are discovered are the subject of enormous debate in the scientific community.In their latest study, a team of scientists used the chemical traces left on the miniscule structures found at Strelley and compared them with the chemical signatures of modern-day bacteria.They also used more recent microfossil evidence from 1.9 billion year-old Canadian rock formations as an additional comparison, and found that the characteristics of each were roughly the same.“We demonstrate that the elemental and molecular characteristics of these 3.4 billion year-old microfossils are consistent with biological remains, slightly degraded by fossilisation processes,” said Dr Julien Alleon, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist who led the study.“This effectively supports the biological origin of the Strelley Pool microfossils.”Dr Alleon said it was remarkable that these “echoes of past life” have survived for so long, especially given the extreme conditions they would have been exposed to over the years.“We know from the molecular structure of the microfossils that they have been exposed to temperatures of up to 300C for long periods. And yet we are still able to see signs of their original chemistry,” he said.Their results were published in the journal Geochemical Perspectives Letters.The tiny structures the researchers examined belong to a limited club of formations touted by different groups as the oldest ever fossils.\u0026nbspEven in the wider Strelley Pool formation, which geologists think was once submerged underneath a shallow ocean, there are other ancient structures called stromatolites thought to be the remains of ancient colonies.Some proposed microfossils discovered in Canada have pushed the origin of life on Earth back even further to over 4 billion years ago.Besides confirming that\u0026nbsplife’s history stretches\u0026nbspback at least 3.4 billion years, the scientists behind the new study – which was presented at the Goldschmidt geochemistry conference in Boston – want to use their methods to investigate specimens with competing claims.“There are competing claims over which microfossils are actually the world\u0027s oldest, this analytical strategy needs to be applied to other ancient samples to help settle the controversy,” said Dr Alleon.Professor Vickie Bennett, a researcher at the Australian National University with expertise in this area who was not involved in the new study, agreed this work provided “compelling evidence” that the Strelley microfossils were evidence of life on ancient Earth.Science news in picturesScientists have witnessed the birth of a planet for the first time ever. 224 New human organ discovered that was previously missed by scientistsLayers long thought to be dense, connective tissue are actually a series of fluid-filled compartments researchers have termed the “interstitium”. 324 Previously unknown society lived in Amazon rainforest before Europeans arrived, say archaeologistsWorking in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, a team led by archaeologists at the University of Exeter unearthed hundreds of villages hidden in the depths of the rainforest. 424 One in 10 people have traces of cocaine or heroin on fingerprints, study findsMore than one in 10 people were found to have traces of class A drugs on their fingers by scientists developing a new fingerprint-based drug test.524 Nasa releases stunning images of Jupiter\u0027s great red spotThe storm bigger than the Earth, has been swhirling for 350 years.

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1824 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain.

Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occur2324 Researchers discover \u0027lost world\u0027 of arctic dinosaursScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”.

Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occur2324 Researchers discover \u0027lost world\u0027 of arctic dinosaursScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”.

That is why my trade union, Community, is backing\u0026nbspThe Independent’s Final Say\u0026nbspcampaign, to secure a people’s vote on the final deal.”Contribute to the march of a generationAt the last People’s Vote March in June, well over 100,000 people marched on parliament.Community’s roots are in textile manufacturing and the steel industry – pushed to the brink of collapse in recent years as much larger economies such as China distort international markets.In 2018 the industry has faced new pressure in particular from steel tariffs imposed by Donald Trump’s US administration, which Brexiteers are relying on for a favourable future trade deal.Community also supports prison and justice workers, logistics, finance, politics and public affairs staff, the charity and freelance sectors and is affiliated to the Labour\u0026nbspParty.Mr Rickhuss highlighted London School of Economics data concluding Brexit was already costing the average UK household more than £404 a year by June 2017.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline

“profoundly different to those presented in 2016”, branding the promise of £350m a week for the NHS “worthless” and the guarantee that European trade would not be harmed as “at best a mistake, and at worst a deliberate lie.”The general secretary added: “When Theresa May believes she has got the best outcome she can, then she must come back and allow us to decide if her best is\u0026nbspgood enough.When Theresa May believes she has got the best outcome she can, then she must come back and allow us to decide if her best is good enough.\u0026nbsp If that outcome is rejected, then all options should be on the table“If that outcome is rejected, then all options should be on the table, including reopening negotiations with Europe and retaining the status quo.“Community would not shy away from asking our members to vote on important or difficult issues in the workplace our politicians must do the right thing and give the people a Final Say on their future.”The People’s Vote launched in April demanding a referendum on the deal agreed with the EU\u0026nbspand has a grassroots network of around 1 million people, holding rallies and action days across the country.The Independent launched its own Final Say campaign three weeks ago,\u0026nbspso far gathering 615,000 names to its petition along with a string of political endorsements.In June this year more than 100,000 people from all walks of life marched on parliament to demand their democratic voice be heard in a new Brexit referendum.But following the newly forged alliance, the People’s Vote and The Independent March for the Future, on Saturday 20 October\u0026nbspin London, is set to be much larger.Ireland is closer than ever to unification because of BrexitWhy hasn’t the NHS been prioritised in

gathering, with young people whose voices were not heard two years ago at its forefront, will constitute one of the most significant demonstrations in British history – just as Ms May returns from Brussels from a critical Brexit summit.Amatey Doku, vice-president of the 7\u0026nbspmillion-strong National Union of Students and a supporter of the For our Future’s Sake group that backs a new referendum, said: “This Tory government, unfortunately assisted by the Labour Party,\u0026nbspthreaten to harm young people’s futures.Rees-Mogg suggests a second Brexit referendum would be acceptable in clip from 2011“That’s why students across the country are coming together for the People’s Vote and The Independent March for the Future. Students and young people can no longer be ignored – and on 20 October, we won’t be.”The prime minister had once aimed to have a deal agreed with Europe earlier this summer, but with negotiations badly stalling and a major cabinet fallout, expectations turned to the October summit.British ministers privately admit it is now unlikely the UK will be able to agree a deal even by October, with a special summit potentially needed before Christmas – leaving just three months in the new year for the UK and the EU to ratify any agreement.It is also unclear if Ms May will be able to navigate any deal across her party’s deep isions, with the European Research Group of backbench Tory MPs drawing up alternative proposals highlighting the benefits of a no-deal Brexit.An exclusive poll carried out by BMG Research this week found that 48 per cent of the public would now back a vote on any deal struck between the UK and the EU – up from 44 per cent just four weeks ago.Just 24 per cent opposed the idea, down three points over the same period. Only 14 per cent of the 1,500 people surveyed supported Ms May’s chequers deal given a choice.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/13/17/10389288-655005147930072-2863546592063103558-n.jpg  width= 885  height= 663  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/13/17/10389288-655005147930072-2863546592063103558-n.jpg","title":"jeremy corbyn wreath laying latest ipso complaint labour party press regulator","story":"Created with Sketch.Stories have misrepresented 2014 event at cemetery, the people buried there, and role of Palestinian leaders, party saysClick to followIndy PoliticsLabour complains to press regulator over coverage of Jeremy Corbyn wreath-layingLabour has complained to\u0026nbspthe press regulator Ipso over coverage of Jeremy Corbyn’s laying of a wreath at a Tunisian cemetery.The party said stories published in the , Daily Mail, Daily ,  , Times\u0026nbspand Sun had misrepresented the 2014 event and who it was intended to commemorate.Lodging a formal complaint with the\u0026nbsppress regulator\u0026nbspis highly unusual for the\u0026nbspleader of a political party.\u0026nbspCoverage in recent days has embroiled the Labour leader in a huge row and led to him being criticised by Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel.It originally erupted after the Daily Mail published pictures of Mr Corbyn holding a wreath at a Tunis cemetery\u0026nbspwhich it claimed were taken in front of a plaque honouring Palestinian leaders allegedly linked to Black\u0026nbspSeptember, the\u0026nbspterrorist group behind the 1972 Munich massacre that\u0026nbspkilled 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team and one police officer.Mr Corbyn has said he only laid a wreath at the cemetery in memory\u0026nbspof victims of a 1985 Israeli air strike on a Palestinian base in Tunisia.

For many women and their partners, a miscarriage means the loss of a baby and the hopes and the dreams for that child,” she told The Independent.\u0026nbsp“It would give people the time out you need when you have been bereaved. It acknowledges a miscarriage is a significant event and this is even true for people who don’t take the leave.”She said the discussion the proposed bill had provoked\u0026nbspwas helping to reduce the taboo which surrounds miscarriages.\u0026nbspSome other countries have provisions for paid leave if a woman miscarries. Indian law instructs that women are eligible to six weeks’ leave if they miscarry a baby. However, the overwhelming majority of employees in the country carry out informal work so not many are entitled to it.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/17/00/italy-earthquake.jpg","title":"italy earthquake latest today magnitude molise montecilfone richter scale","story":"Created with Sketch.A boy was slightly hurt after leaping off a balcony in fear, but no injuries are blamed directly on the quakesClick to followThe Independent OnlineEmergency service personnel arrive in Montecilfone after a 5.1-magnitude earthquake struck the regionAt least nine earthquakes have rocked southern Italy in two hours, prompting frightened residents to sleep outdoors.Italy\u0027s national seismology agency INGV says the strongest quake measured 5.1 and struck at 8:19 p.m. Thursday.

It means young people are missing out on essential skills as they approach adulthood.GRANT ROLLINGS asked five Sun columnists what their first part-time jobs were and the valuable lessons they learned – from being polite to skiving.I ALWAYS had a summer job, usually it meant working full-time hours on my normal Saturday job as holiday cover. This was either in a boutique such as Chelsea Girl or in BHS, where I worked on the sweetie counter.I coped with the boredom by sneakily munching on the best chocolate sweets from the pick-and-mix. I also worked as a waitress in a trendy Glasgow eaterie during the holidays.All of these jobs gave me the most enormous respect for the men and women who toil for long hours, often dealing with unreasonable members of the public for too little pay and not much prospect of promotion.Working in the service industry taught me the power of a disarming smile, and proved that my old granny’s saying that “you get more in life from sugar than vinegar” could not be more true.Grumpy customers demanding refunds and diners moaning that they had been waiting too long for their main course were usually placated with a swift apology and a promise to sort things out.A major restaurant blunder could often be smoothed over with a free coffee or pudding.MY favourite summer job came in 1977. I was a traffic enumerator for Middlesbrough Council. That meant I spent all day counting cars. All the way up one side of Linthorpe Road, all the way back down the other.I had to write down all the number plates. In the end, I got a bit bored and spent the time hanging out at my mate’s T-shirt shop or Fearnley Records and made the numbers up, always remembering to have them end in the local codes of HN or (I think) XG. I hope the council thought it worthwhile.It was better than the glue factory, where I’d been very briefly working on a weighbridge. Foreman pressed a button and this vast door opened and thousands of rotting animal carcasses fell out. I can still smell it now, all these years later. I passed out — soft lad, you see.Or there was working the nightshift pricing cans of food and stuff in Hintons, the local convenience store. Every time I turned up, the manager would say, ‘Here he is, the poor man’s Rod Stewart’.A friend of mine, Mark, had a much better summer job.He was a Club 18-30 holiday rep. He shagged 21 girls in 25 days, which gave me my first story to sell to the national newspapers.MY first holiday job was in the summer of 1985 when I was 16 years old. I had already been turned down from working at Waitrose in Enfield Town on the basis I was “too glamorous”.That just goes to show how far we have come in such a short time. I have never set foot in a Waitrose since that day because I was beyond furious. Anyway, the job I did get was working in a hairdresser’s on Goodge Street in London.My journey involved three changes and about 14 stops every day. The job was meant to be answering the phone, sweeping up and generally helping out, but before the end of the first week I was running the till, the appointment system, cashing up and generally managing the place.The only thing I could not do was cut hair, but that didn’t stop me cutting my friends’ hair — with very mixed results, more bad than good — on the basis I worked in a hairdresser’s so they thought I should. I remember the liberating feeling of earning my own money, it gave me the greatest sense of independence, self-esteem and self-belief.I worked out I was actually good in a work environment, talking to people — for example, talking women into perms they didn’t want — being responsible, handling money and making a difference to my employer.The biggest transition we make in our lives is leaving education to go into the workplace, and summer jobs prepare you for this.I HAD dozens of summer jobs, from working as a scaffolder’s mate with a convicted murderer, who kept a pistol in the glove compartment of his Ford Escort, to donning a white suit and Geiger counter to carry out maintenance on the core of the main reactor at a nuclear power station.I learned a hundred things from each and every job, but it was working as a grocery assistant at my local supermarket that had the most impact.My best friend and I both got jobs there at the same time. He was a star performer at school, a brilliant academic, but he couldn’t take the pace and got fired after a couple of months.It was incredibly hard, repetitive work.The manager was an ex-Army major — very strict on haircuts, discipline and stealing.There was always the prospect of the Tannoy announcement “customer service one hundred”, which was code for a shoplifter having been spotted.All the male floor staff were required to assemble at till number one to tackle the suspect, who would sometimes become violent.I was much happier making the cheese look pretty and eventually became the ruler of the entire soft dairy aisle — a project I’m still working on.I WAS 13 in Brownes Wine bar, Stafford Street, Derby, summer 1987, some years before it burned down in mysterious circumstances (has a bar ever burnt down innocently?). I was chief bottler-up.This involved the soul-sapping exercise of sifting through bins taller than me for all the recyclable bottles from the previous night’s festivities and putting them in their correct crates. This took all morning and you ended up cut to shreds and stinking of Britvic and Schlitz.I was then asked to be the cook — this involved microwaving lasagne for drunk people. I was paid the princely sum of £3 per hour. I realised how crap this was, so one scorching Saturday I nicked the shampoo that came with my dad’s company car and took advantage of the sketchy Eighties attitude to drink-driving and washed all the customers’ cars in the car park for a fiver a pop.I literally cleaned up. It was the greatest Dragons’ Den moment I’ve ever had. I waxed on and off all day, rinsing my dad of his prized BMW product. He arrived to pick me up and I was minted. A 13-year-old with £64 in his pocket. That coveted Swatch would finally be mine.He then told me the dog had been run over, so that’s another memory ruined.Thanks for reminding me.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To say that he was “present but not involved” is an insult to voters’ intelligence when photographs show him holding a wreath and gurning for a nearby camera.To allow his press office to say the widows of those murdered in Munich were being “misled” is, even among the many shameful episodes we’ve seen since he became Labour leader three hate-filled years ago, disgraceful.The most vital qualification for power in this country must be integrity. And Jeremy Corbyn has demonstrated this week that he has absolutely none of it.But for all of the shame that he brings upon Labour, it is nothing compared to the spinelessness of the party’s “moderate” MPs whose opposition to Corbyn extends not much further than wishy-washy tweets.“Present but not involved” isn’t an excuse for Corbyn but nor is it for the cowards on Labour’s backbenches.Corbyn cannot be allowed near government. But the rest of the party has lost the public’s faith too.TOMORROW, official figures are likely to suggest that train fares will go up by another 3.5 per cent in January.If you’re a commuter who has put up with delayed and cancelled trains, you’ll be wondering what you’re paying for.After a disastrous year, there is no other industry that would turn round and ask customers for even more.The failure of the Government to take responsibility, blaming unions or claiming the cash is for “investment”, is simply not good enough. It’s the same as last year’s excuse.It is time for a radical overhaul — but that does not mean nationalisation. Far from it. Our railways need MORE private sector involvement.The hybrid system we have, in which private operators rely on publicly owned tracks and have their fares regulated by government, has led us into the worst of both worlds.Transport supremo Chris Grayling needs to take on the unions once and for all. And he needs to introduce real competition on the railways, giving operators far more freedom.Commuters deserve better than finger-pointing and higher fares.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He says he was told that he couldn’t speak at the wedding and that Harry berated him on the phone for mishandling the Press while he was recovering from a heart attack.The official royal response to these outbursts has been, effectively, to shove their fingers in their ears and shout la-la-la (or lah-lah-lah).The snobby courtiers and hangers-on dismiss Markle père as fame-hungry.That’s not altogether wrong — he is clearly desperate, as he proved by posing for snaps with the paparazzi in the run-up to the wedding.But it’s not good enough to wish he’d just go away.Meghan is now one of the most photographed and sought-after women in the world. Her very well-paid PR flunkies should have seen these familial landmines a mile off and defused them.But they have failed.Thomas Markle is a difficult and proud man, no doubt. But that is why he should have been treated with care, not frozen out.Why did Team Windsor not find him a role and approach him long before the wedding to make sure he didn’t feel excluded.It’s hard not to feel for him.His ex, Meghan’s mother Doria, was hailed as one of the stars of the wedding.Because she’s a black woman, she invited lots of gushing commentary about the monarchy becoming more diverse and modern.Amen to that. But poor old podgy Thomas, an awkward-looking white bloke, has been shunned from his daughter’s nuptials. You can’t blame him for speaking out.The royal courtiers enjoy the adulation the monarchy receives because Prince Harry has been “brave” enough to marry a woman with a complicated background.But the Palace spin machine freaks out when it comes to confronting the reality of Meghan’s parentage.Perhaps they just find it too vulgar.Harry’s PR man is Jason Knauf, an American specialist in “crisis management” having worked for Royal Bank of Scotland. He excels at sending angry letters to journalists he feels have gone too far snooping into Harry and Meghan’s private lives.But he doesn’t seem to have a clue as to how to handle his clients’ grumpy relatives.As a result, the monarchy is facing arguably its worst crisis since the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.We are often told how brilliant the Royal Family’s PR is. Part of the new royal spin, in fact, is about how great the royals now are at spin. They have “rebranded” the monarchy for the 21st century, and so on.Look at the blizzard of positive guff accompanying Prince William, Kate, and Harry’s campaign for mental illness last year.They were, it was said, making the younger Windsors seem more touchy-feely.At the moment, however, they don’t seem sensitive enough to speak to Meghan’s suffering in-laws.That’s not what you’d call a good look.The truth is, royal press officers have long got too much credit.The British admire the Queen because she is admirable.Overall, we prefer monarchy to any other system of government. That’s just common sense. It’s nothing to do with any ingenious branding and media strategy.The public also feels that the younger royals deserve a chance.At a time when our country is consumed by Brexit and political arguments, the wedding of Harry and Meghan came as a blessed relief — something we could all celebrate.The couple both came from broken homes, and nobody cared so long as they were happy. That’s all great.   But it’s obvious that Meghan has, as one royal expert put it, “background baggage that needs unpacking”.Insiders now say the treatment of the Markle family has been a “shambles”.This is before we consider the potential PR bombshells that could erupt if and when Meghan’s ex-husband, Trevor Engelson, decides to grant some interviews.The British don’t want to see the monarchy turned into a reality TV soap, as the Markles and Windsors wage a media war with each other.It’s trashy and embarrassing.But unless the Palace can tackle Meghan’s disgruntled kin, that’s exactly what is happening.Maybe we need a changing of the royal PR guard — before it’s too late.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yesterdays employment figures revealed that the proportion of young people unemployed (and not in full-time education) is now at a record low of 4.7% for our country - and far lower than for many other developed countries.It sends a significant message out about the drive and innovation of our young people, and the opportunities that our economy offers to them and their future.With our welfare changes this country can now be powered forward by this young generation.Since 2010, youth unemployment has fallen by over 45%, giving 130,000 more young people a job, and a future.Add the fact that wages are on the up and there are more than 829,000 vacancies nationwide, it’s clear that young people are entering the best jobs market in a decade.On average, the number of vacancies has increased by 4,280 each month over the last year, and those vacancies span from construction to technology.So when young people this week are deciding on their next steps, they can think big as there are plenty of opportunities out there for them, from a job with career progression, to taking up an apprenticeship.Look at Daisy, who turned down five university offers to work at global engineering firm JCB designing new equipment, and she didn’t have to go to university to get there.I’m forever being told, and intrinsically understand, that people want to study at different times in their lives, often inspired to do so when they see the practical benefits of their studies.That’s why so many people prefer, and do better, getting a job first and then studying for exams while they work.Even over the last few decades, how the world of education and work are linked has shifted dramatically. People no longer have one job for life, and lifelong learning is becoming more and more commonplace as people dip in and out of education.Many more people up-skill and retrain throughout their career – and this is how the future jobs market will remain vibrant and strong.And when I speak to employers up and down the country, from manufacturers to marketers, what they want are young people with the right attitude, prepared to work and learn. As they say, ‘if you’ve the will, we can give you the skill’.So when young people this week are deciding their next steps, the academic route isn’t the only option.You can now become a solicitor, an accountant or even a nuclear engineer through the apprenticeship route, earning as you learn and without the cost of going to University. Studying a Higher Apprenticeship gives an average wage boost of £150,000 over a working life.When I speak to young people around the country, I’m impressed with the confidence and self-assuredness with which they look to the future, and the range of options they consider beyond traditional routes.Im certainly no job snob. Life teaches you its not where you come from, its where you get to, and work is exactly the same.You can start anywhere and get to the top as Im repeatedly being told by our countrys top entrepreneurs.Top performers in their fields such as Debbie Moore, Jean-Christophe Novelli, Deborah Meaden and Jo Malone, did not go to university and are just a handful of the individuals who show that with drive and determination you can succeed by treading your own path.Its all about getting a break and taking the opportunities that come your way.So best of luck to everyone today, but whatever your results, there are many opportunities and pathways into a successful career.    Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s like trying to put up shelves using sellotape.And that matters because Italy’s various mafias – Cosa Nostra (our thing) in Sicily, the ‘Ndrangheta in Calabria and the Camorra in Naples – are all experts at winning building contracts.And their hold doesn’t stop there.Match-fixing and ticket sales in football, waste disposal agreements as well as drug and people smuggling have all been lucrative streams of income for the underworld gangs.The system has been the same for decades: politicians receive votes and kickbacks from criminal gangs who are awarded the contracts from huge construction projects.Many people who have interfered in rigged tender processes, like Vincenzo Passiarello in 1998, have been killed.Long gone are the Hollywood stereotypes of a thug with a tommy gun and a trilby. Nowadays most mafiosi wear suits and are indistinguishable from ordinary businessmen.The only difference is the size of their empires.The scale of the corruption is so great that 281 town or city councils have been dissolved by Italian authorities since 1991 because of Mafia infiltration.Often that infiltration only emerges after years of painstaking surveillance by the the Italian police.Construction appeals to the Mafia because the huge sums involved enable the laundering of dirty drugs money.The many sub-contracts mean that a criminal gang can find itself hugely empowered, responsible for the hiring and firing of thousands of workers at a time when youth unemployment in Italy bounces around 30 per cent.Costs are kept low not just through the use of poor building materials but also through strong-arm management: unions are invariably excluded from work sites, and safety inspectors intimidated or bought off.It takes a brave man or woman to point out the Mafia’s shoddy workmanship.There are, experts say, many more councils where criminal infiltration still hasn’t been discovered.One of the main advantages of infiltrating the construction industry is that it enables the Mafia to disguise itself as a legitimate, respectable business. Since the mid-1990s – when the Mafia planted bombs on the Italian mainland and blew up Sicilian investigators – it has deliberately pursued a strategy of invisibility.As one of Italy’s anti-Mafia priests said recently: “the Mafia is very able to camouflage itself, to infiltrate into legal spaces.”In 2010, anti-Mafia investigators confiscated €1.5billion (around £1.35 billion) from Cosa Nostra’s current “don of dons”, the fugitive Matteo Messina Denaro. Much of that figure was linked to construction firms.Although it’s often the cause of disasters, the Mafia is also the beneficiary of them.Each time a devastating earthquake hits the country, criminal gangs move in on the reconstruction efforts.Franco Roberti, for four years head of Italy’s anti-Mafia directorate, told La Repubblica newspaper this week: “The risk of infiltration is always high. Post-earthquake reconstruction is a tasty morsel for criminal organisations and business interests.”The worry now is that hundreds of structures throughout Italy could be at risk.Legambiente, an anti-Mafia pressure group, has warned that weakened cement has been used at Trapani and Palermo airports in Sicily, as well as in schools, car parks, bridges and motorways throughout the peninsula.Back in 2009, in a situation eerily similar to this week’s bridge collapse, 37 people lost their lives during flash floods in the Sicilian city of Messina. Buildings simply collapsed in the rain because inadequate cement had been used in the construction of houses.Construction is only one of the Mafia’s revenues streams. Drug-dealing still represents a cash-cow, but in recent years criminal gangs have also made huge amounts from the exploitation of migrants: one wiretap from 2014 overheard a Rome mafiosi saying to a colleague: “do you have any idea how much one can earn through immigrants? Drug-trafficking yields less.”Apart from drugs- and people-smuggling, the Mafia is also adept at siphoning off European Union funding. The murder of the Slovakian journalist, Ján Kaliac, earlier this year is believed to have been a professional hit carried out because he was investigating Italian businessmen from Calabria who were embezzling EU funds.The other big-earner for criminal gangs is waste disposal. Here, like construction, it’s easy to make money if corners are cut.And through messing with rubbish collection – leaving it rotting on street corners at the height of the summer heat and the tourist season – organised criminals are able to hold cities hostage, making demands for contracts to be renegotiated.Not even Italy’s favourite sport is immune from the Mafia. Match-fixing in football is frequent in Italy, especially in the lower leagues.Every year or two there’s a scandal when it emerges that betting syndicates have made huge profits after bribing players to chuck games: The most recent case was in 2011, when dozens of teams and players colluded to arrange results, taking money from, and making it for, organised crime.The Mafia has even attempted to muscle in on the huge money to be made from ticket sales.In 2016 investigators in Turin discovered that the Calabrian Mafia, the ‘Ndrangheta, was procuring free tickets from Juventus in order to sell them on at huge profits: ticket-touting was estimated to yield €30,000 on match day.Ciccio Bucci, the man caught in the middle between Juventus and the Calabrian mafia, committed suicide in suspicious circumstances the day after being questioned by investigators.After Tuesday’s tragedy, infrastructure is now at the top of the Italian political agenda. If the taps are turned on again, you can be sure that the people who caused the problems will be offering, once again, to solve them.Tobias Jones lives in Parma.

Saturday will be a drier day for many areas, with just a scattering of showers, these mainly in the west.The best of the widespread sunshine will be during the latter part of the day and winds will tend to ease as the day progresses."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000427108267.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"students a level results day 2018 boozy night out","story":"But after a tense day some went a little too hard as students from across the UK headed out to toast all their efforts.The youngsters had anxiously waited to find out if they had got into their chosen unis before nervously ripping open their results envelope.It was revealed yesterday pass rates today dropped to their lowest level in eight years following a shake-up which made the exams tougher for pupils.But it wasnt all bad news as some of the higher achievers were seen jumping for joy - as more than one in four of yesterdays exam results being an A or A*.Earlier in the day they had been pictured posing with their parents as they proudly revealed their success.And as night fell groups of young and ecstatic revellers poured into the bars and clubs across the country.But many were seen taking things slightly too far in their excitement, with a number seen slumped on the floor or being propped up by their pals.Boys continue to outperform girls at the highest grades, figures show, with 26.6 per cent of boys entries awarded at least an A grade, compared to 26.2 per cent for entries from their female peers.And in total, 26.4 per cent of UK entries were given one of the two top grades - up 0.1 percentage points on 2017.It is the second year in a row that the A*-A pass rate has risen, as the overall A*-E pass rate has also fallen 0.3 percentage points to 97.6 per cent - the lowest level since 2010.The figures come in the wake of a major exams overhaul - with24 A-level subjects now reformed.There have been major changes to A-levels in England, with a move away from coursework and modular exams throughout the course.Students who havent got the results they hoped for can try their luck through clearing.The process works by helping students find out what university courses still have places remaining.Hopefuls are able to search for a course against the subject they are interested in, or the university they want to head to."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT0004264910171-e1534376158392.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"why the time has come for the beeb to stop believing in the cult of jeremy corbyn","story":"No? Well, you must have been getting your news from the BBC, then.This was the latest example of Corbyn simpering around terrorists. Honouring scumbags who massacred 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich.The Black September gangsters castrated their male victims while they were still alive.But then, Corbyn was happy to attend the funerals of dead IRA terrorists. That’s the kind of chap he is. Actually, I say that was the “latest” case of Corbyn simpering around terrorists.Not quite. A day or two later a photo emerged of him giving the salute of the Muslim Brotherhood, a foul organisation proscribed as terrorists in six countries.And it’s all part of the anti-Semitism scandal which is tearing the Labour Party apart. An important story.Good people have left Labour as a consequence. The Jewish community in the UK is in uproar.Frightened of the far Left’s support for vile Islamists and its loathing of Israel and its right to exist.Scared of the morons who now lead Labour and its retinue of lefties who have said the most appalling, racist, stuff about Jews.Jeremy Corbyn, a genuine halfwit, thinks it is all “fake news”.He rolls his eyes when asked about it and gives different answers every time he is questioned.And guess who agrees with him? Yep, the BBC.The corporation refused to touch the story for a whole day, when it was first reported by blogger Guido Fawkes. Ignored it.Everyone else — including the left-wing  — thought it important.Instead, the front page of the BBC’s online news carried no fewer than SIX stories about former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and the allegations of Islamophobia made against him. Six!Boris had likened women who wear the burka to letter boxes or bank robbers.The vast majority of the country agreed that he wasn’t being racist. The vast majority want the burka banned here — as it is in Denmark, France, parts of Germany, Belgium and . . . Morocco.His comments were not much of a story at all. And the moves to sanction him solely a case of his enemies in the Conservative Party gleefully hammering the bloke.But the BBC became obsessed by it. It is always obsessed when the word Islamophobia is mentioned.And it loves to stick the boot into the Tories. Yet was utterly silent on the latest example of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party.It took them a full day to even mention the story.It’s another shocking case of the BBC’s bias. A left-liberal prejudice which runs right through the corporation from top to bottom.The same prejudice you hear whenever it deals with immigration (bloody marvellous!) or Brexit (absolutely ghastly!).Haven’t we had enough of this? Enough of paying £150.50 every year to have these credulous dupes pipe liberal propaganda into our homes every day.Get rid of the licence fee. Let the BBC survive through the subscriptions of those who are willing to pay. And on that deal, I’m out, Evan.Heres a photo of Rhian Sugden dressed as a plum.I’ve included it this week so that Tess Daly can enjoy it.Her husband, the uniquely interesting Vernon Kay, had a long sexting relationship with Rhian, apparently.And Tess was a bit hacked off.So maybe this will cheer her up.I’m on a diet. One of those low-carb things. God it’s boring.My favourite kinds of food are fat and carbohydrates, preferably mixed together.At night I dream of mashed potato and steak and kidney pudding.How can people enjoy life on a diet of bloody stir-fry?And the worst thing is it doesn’t seem to have done much for my weight. I still look like a pregnant middle-aged lesbian in a Boris Johnson wig.If the pounds don’t fall off soon I’m going to give it up. And BINGE.There’s a restaurant round my way that does a chicken parmo with a pizza on top.That’s where I’ll be heading.Freda Jackson, aged 81, did not enjoy her holiday and is demanding that the tour company refund her the full cost.Freda went on holiday to Spain and found herself surrounded by Spaniards...who wouldnt complain?Her complaint? The hotel she was staying in was “full of Spaniards”. Well, fair enough. They can be annoying. They get over-excited and spoil everyone’s fun.Where was Freda on holiday? Spain. Freda thinks she should have been warned about the possibility of being surrounded by Spaniards in Spain.She added that they should go “somewhere else” for their holidays.Brits are flooding to Turkey to take advantage of the crashing lira. You can get a holiday for two-fifths of nowt, apparently.All well and good. But you would have to pay me a lot of money to go anywhere near Turkey.The reason it’s cheap is because the moron who runs the place, Recep Erdogan has wrecked the economy. And there will be big trouble there soon.Fancy a change in your career plans? There’s a new job just come available – head of the Islamic State.The post is open to male psychopaths with very large beards. Must be able to scream “Allahu Akbar” in a very menacing manner. Salary negotiable.Small print at the bottom probably says: “The Islamic State is not an equal opportunities employer. So, no women, gays or Jews, please.”This job has come up because the previous leader, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi (Bob Baghdad to his mates) got hit in a drone strike. According to the Islamic State, he is now brain-dead. Hmmm. How could they tell?A year or so back I was in a minicab at night on my way home when we approached the level crossing near my house.The gates were open and the driver, a foreign bloke, drove into the middle, stopped and said: “Sorry, left or right?” I looked at him to see if he was joking.He wasn’t. I said: “I would go straight on if I were you.“This what we, in this country, call a ‘railway line’.” I assume it’s his wife, then, who was caught driving her car along the Newcastle  this week.And only noticed she was actually on a railway when she pulled up at a station.An art student decided to do something about the bright light coming in through her window.There are a number of solutions, aren’t there?Curtains, for example. Or maybe some nice blinds.But nope, instead she covered her window with a painting. It was called Double Anal Penetration and was quite, um, graphic.The neighbours kicked up a bit of a fuss.There was also the suggestion the police could be called. The student’s name, incidentally?

A key committee has said that relaxing laws that stop people from vaping in offices and on trains could reduce deaths from smoking. The report by the Science and Technology Committee (STC) argues that vaping is less harmful than smoking cigarettes and that they should not be treated the same. They have called for an urgent review to make it easier for e-cigarettes to be made available on prescription, wider debate on vaping in public spaces, and greater freedom for the industry to advertise the devices as a less harmful option for smokers. But some public health experts have challenged the claims with one saying the report relies solely on accounts by e-cig champions. The report\u0027s release comes days after scientists warned that the perception that e-cigarettes are safe should be treated with caution.  Research led by the University of Birmingham found the vapourised e-liquid fluid in e-cigarettes has a similar effect on the lungs and body that is seen in regular cigarette smokers and patients with chronic lung disease. The Government has said it will carefully consider the evidence and recommendations made by the STC. Norman Lamb, the committee\u0027s chairman, told the : “The blunt fact is that 79,000 people in England still die of smoking every year, which is sort of unconscionable, particularly when we know there is the means by which we can reduce the death toll. He said that current policy and regulations do not sufficiently reflect the lesser harm posed by e-cigarettes than their conventional alternatives. Businesses, transport providers and public places should stop viewing conventional and e-cigarettes as one and the same, he said. There is no public health rationale for doing so. Concerns that e-cigarettes could be a gateway to conventional smoking, including for young non-smokers, have not materialised. If used correctly, e-cigarettes could be a key weapon in the NHS stop-smoking arsenal.  Public Health England (PHE) has estimated that e-cigarettes are at least 95% less harmful than smoking.  While uncertainties remain about the long-term health impact of the devices, they present an opportunity to significantly accelerate already declining smoking rates, the committee of MPs said. Mr Lamb said: Medically licensed e-cigarettes would make it easier for doctors to discuss and recommend them as a stop smoking tool to aid those quitting smoking. The approval systems for prescribing these products must be urgently reviewed. The report also called for limits on refill strengths and tank sizes, which may put off heavy smokers looking for a strong nicotine hit, to be reviewed. Meanwhile, NHS England\u0027s default policy should be that e-cigarettes are permitted on mental health units, to address the stubbornly high levels of smoking among people with mental health conditions, the report said. Around 2.9 million people in the UK are currently using e-cigarettes, with an estimated 470,000 using them as an aid to stop smoking, according to the report. Duncan Selbie, chief executive of PHE, said: E-cigarettes are not without harm but are way safer than the harms of tobacco. This is about comparing e-cigarettes to normal cigarettes, not fresh air. The UK leads the world in harm reduction from tobacco and there is no evidence that they are acting as a gateway into smoking for young people. Alison Cook, director of policy at the British Lung Foundation (BLF), said the report provides clarity on the potential of the devices.  The choice to switch to e-cigarettes must be made easier, she added. The report comes days after a Professor David Thickett, of the University of Birmingham\u0027s Institute of Inflammation and Ageing, warned the public must be aware that these devices are not harmless. He led a study published in the journal Thorax on Tuesday that e-cigarette vapour boosts the production of inflammatory chemicals and disables key protective cells in the lungs. He said: It has been suggested electronic cigarettes are safer than traditional cigarettes, and this narrative is increasingly supported by tobacco companies that have established research institutes devoted to generating supportive data. Reacting to the STC\u0027s report Simon Capewell, Professor in Public Health and Policy from Liverpool University, told the Daily Mail: The committee has concentrated solely on experts who are e-cig champions. More balanced reviews of the evidence by the World Health Organisation, (US) Food and Drug Administration have concluded that e-cigs are no better for quitting smoking than things like nicotine gum, patches or tablets. E-cigs in teens are a gateway to subsequent smoking lit cigarettes and e-cig vapour contains a large number of toxins which in time will obviously harm users, and bystanders.

Robert Johnston successfully took a road resurfacing contractor to the small claims court after the firm refused to reimburse him for the damage. Mr Johnston\u0027s A6 was parked outside his business in Silverdale Road, Newcastle , last September when it was chipped by loose stones following the surface dressing of the road, the Stoke Sentinel reports. The 42-year-old repeatedly contacted both Staffordshire County Council, which is responsible for the road, and the firm contracted to carry out the work, Knutsford-based Road Management Services (RMS), with his concerns about the standard and safety of the surface.  RMS eventually wrote to Mr Johnston to say it had inspected the site and found \u0027no signs of loose aggregate\u0027 - and would therefore not offer him any compensation. Mr Johnston then launched a legal battle and, following a hearing at Stoke-on-Trent County Court, a judge ordered RMS to pay him \u0026pound4,211.20 in compensation, plus \u0026pound745 to cover his legal costs. The businessman, who owns Silverdale Motors, said: The court case was a dark cloud hanging over me. I was representing myself and it was quite a daunting experience. When the judge ruled in my favour I was really happy. It has been 10 months of hard work but it paid off. When you are right, you\u0027re right. The company has been negligent. Despite winning his legal battle, Mr Johnston remains concerned about the state of Silverdale Road.  The county council said if work on the road network was not up to standard, the contractor would have to remedy this at their own expense. Helen Fisher, cabinet member for Highways and Transport, said: “We have more than 6,000km of roads and the surface dressing programme plays a key role in reducing the risk of potholes.

Mrs Jackson received a huge backlash after she was quoted saying Spanish people \u0027 should go somewhere else for their holidays \u0027 following her trip with a friend to Poseidon Playa through travel operator Thomas Cook. Her granddaughter, Lyndsey Jackson, 32, has accused people of bullying after thousands slammed her for saying her accommodation was teeming with \u0027rude\u0027 native Spaniards - who nearly knocked her over on one occasion. The retired care assistant told  from her hospital room where she\u0027s recovering from knee surgery: It\u0027s all a pack of lies. I never said the Spanish should go to another hotel, just that the hotel didn\u0027t cater to English people. It\u0027s been totally taken out of context.  Now people who don\u0027t even know me are calling me racist which is just not true. I didn\u0027t slag the Spanish off at all. I had asked for a hotel in Benidorm\u0027s new town, on the flat that was close to shops. But they gave me a hotel on a hill in the old town far from everything. Mrs Jackson, who worked as a carer and auxiliary nurse for most of her life, said the public backlash against her has been disgusting. She suffers from chronic arthritis and went into hospital on Monday for a knee replacement. But as she came out of theatre, in serious pain and confined to hospital, she was met with the news that story had hit the headlines.  Mrs Jackson had booked to stay at the Poseidon Playa, located on the outskirts of Benidorm in south east Spain, with a friend in April 2017. The pensioner says Thomas Cook had even recommended the hotel and despite her request for flat ground access, it was located on a slope instead. Mrs Jackson and her 61-year-old friend paid a total of \u0026pound1,133 for the holiday and have demanded a full refund or a free trip. Ahead of the trip the flights from Manchester to Allicante had been changed but she was not informed until she went to collect her tickets. Added to the that the hotel was not in the location she requested and she found it difficult to get around with her painful knee and mobility issues. She said she had never complained about a holiday before, but added that this one was a disaster from start to finish. She was quoted saying the \u0027hotel was full of rude Spanish holidaymakers\u0027 and that the entertainment in the hotel was all focused and catered for the Spanish adding: Why can\u0027t the Spanish go somewhere else for their holidays?

The Greater Manchester Police van follows, and the officer on foot is hit, the Manchester Evening News reports.

But public loos are being wiped out at a staggering rate as councils struggle with government budget cuts. More than a QUARTER of public toilets have disappeared since the turn of the century, according to data obtained under Freedom of Information laws. According to the new information - supplied by council areas across the UK - the total number of public toilets across the country has dropped from 3,084 in 2000 to 2,290 in 2018. That is a fall of nearly 800. And authorities in Bolsover, North East Derbyshire, and Wokingham admitted they no longer had ANY council-run loos. In London, of the councils that provided information, the number of public loos was down from 197 in 2000 to just 132 today. The rest of England saw a fall from 2,400 to 1,534, while in Wales numbers had more than halved from 504 to 243. Scotland was down from 759 to 421 while Northern Ireland dropped from 95 to 84.  Campaigners say the problem leaves people with nowhere to go when they need to go and it is affecting everyone from outdoor workers such as builders as well as pregnant women and parents with children. Toilets that can be easily found and used are essential for the elderly and disabled. And with one in five people above 40 suffering from an over-active bladder, the lack of public facilities can make some reluctant to leave their homes due to the risk of being caught short. It is not a legal requirement to provide public lavatories and so when councils aren\u0027t feeling flush, toilet blocks are often targeted first when it comes to cuts. A typical toilet block is estimated to cost between \u0026pound12,000 to \u0026pound15,000 a year to maintain. But Domestos believes that clean, safe toilets should be within everyone’s reach. That is why it is launching the nationwide Use Our Loos initiative to tackle the demise and unlock loos in local coffee shops, cafes, restaurants and bars across Britain’s towns, cities and villages.  The scheme is urging local shops and businesses to sign up, throw open their cubicles and make their toilets available to non-customers. As part of the initiative, Domestos is also partnering with The Great British Public Toilet Map – an interactive street map that shows users where their nearest public toilet is and which businesses have signed up to the scheme. The map will be regularly updated as new businesses join. Domestos also plays a role in the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan’s aim to get 25 million people across the world access to a clean and safe toilet by 2020. Domestos has partnered with Unicef, the world’s leading children’s organisa\u0026shytion, since 2012 and has already helped 10 million people around the world get cleaner, safer toilets.  Raymond Martin of the British Toilet Association which campaigns for better public facilities, has praised the initiative, saying it will increase visitors to Britain’s high streets. He says : “As human beings we all have to eat, drink, sleep, breathe and go to the toilet,” he said. “Having access to a clean hygienic toilet is absolutely vital for our everyday life and activity. Rebecca Light, Domestos Senior Brand Manager, says: “In the UK the problem is locating a public toilet. An estimated 2.3 billion people worldwide lack access to clean, safe sanitation. This comes with significant health risks, including diarrhoea, which kills one child every two minutes. It’s vital we change this – and quickly.” "},{"url":null,"title":"horrified dad pulls metal coil","story":"NewsHorrified dad pulls METAL COIL from three-year-old son\u0027s throat - after he chokes on crispsEXCLUSIVE Preston Green was eating cheese and onion Wheat Crunchies when he approached his parents Adam and Chelsea, from Market Harborough in Leicesterhsire, complaining something was trapped in his throatShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByAbigail O\u0027Leary21:02, 16 AUG 2018Updated21:03, 16 AUG 2018NewsPreston approached his parents gagging on the spring which was stuck in his throat (Image: Adam Green)Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA horrified dad pulled a two-inch METAL COIL from his three-year-old son\u0027s throat after he began choking on crisps. Preston Green was eating cheese and onion Wheat Crunchies when he approached his parents Adam and Chelsea, from Market Harborough in Leicestershire, gagging and complaining something was trapped in his throat. In a desperate rush to save his son’s life, panic-stricken Adam, 26, smacked Preston on the back before a silver object, around two inches long, shot out of his mouth. Adam and 24-year-old Chelsea were horrified when they realised their son had been choking on a spring - which they claim came from the crisp packet.

Adam added: “I smacked him on the back and got it out. It was part of a crisp, but wrapped around it was this spring. “It was the size of the Wheat Crunchie - about two inches long I would say.” Adam said Preston went on to complain of pain in his teeth after the traumatic ordeal, likely caused by the spring which he had unknowingly bitten down on. The dad added: It was frightening, but thankfully nothing really serious happened, and Preston is OK, apart from complaining about pain in his teeth. Adam took pictures of the spring and contacted manufacturer KP Snacks, revealing how they had gone through one of every parent\u0027s worst nightmares - witnessing their child choking on a piece of food.

But one person that she may be compared to more often than not is her husband\u0027s late mum, Princess Diana .   The people\u0027s princess remains a firm favourite with fans of the royal family and it is wonderful to see sweet similarities between the two.  Most recently it\u0027s come to light that the pair have shared the same thoughtful hobby.   In a post on her old lifestyle blog, The Tig , Meghan went into detail about her love of throwback things - especially the practice of handwriting letters, something Diana also took the time to do.   The former Suits star wrote: Amongst the throwback things that I love (a ’62 porsche speedster \u0026agrave la Dylan McKay in 90210, a bevy of Vargas girls, a Busby Berkeley film, or cooking over a charcoal grill), what trumps all is my love of writing (and receiving) a handwritten note.  She adds that she absolutely adores getting mail. I absolutely relish it. I know my mailman\u0027s name, I race to the door when the mail comes (usually just fliers or bills), but I always hold out hope there will be a letter. A sweet letter. And that I will have the tactile experience of un-creasing the paper, reciting the words, and holding someone\u0027s thoughts in my hands.   And according to author Andrew Morton , who wrote an authorised biography for Diana, Meghan\u0027s late mother-in-law also got a kick out of handwritten letters and was determined to send thank-you cards to as many people as possible.   He notes in particular, that after her grand wedding to Prince Charles in 1981, Diana sat down to answer many of the 47,000 letters of congratulation and 10,000 gifts which the wedding generated.  Though she did have the help of staff to complete this gigantic task. Personal letters from the princess are considered extremely valuable today, with some selling at auctions for thousands of pounds.

Jordan Holgerson was sent plunging into a river after being shoved off the bridge in Washington state, US, by pal Taylor Smith. Despite suffering serious injuries in the plunge, including six broken ribs, she initially didn\u0027t really want Taylor to get into trouble.  But now, she says she wants the 18-year-old to serve some jail time.   Well at first I didn\u0027t really want Taylor to get in trouble, Jordan, who also sustained two punctured lungs and bruising, told NBC News .   But now that I\u0027ve thought about it more, I\u0027m kind of wanting her to sit in jail and think about at least what she did. She added: I\u0027m in a lot of pain. In the mornings it\u0027s the worst, like it hurts to breathe. My side hurts. My shoulder hurts. I can\u0027t even get up. Dramatic video footage captured Jordan falling dozens of feet from the bridge in Moulton Falls Regional Park, Yacolt, last Tuesday. The teenager could be seen standing nervously at the edge of the structure, before her pal, later identified as Taylor, pushed her from behind. Surrounded by friends, she was reportedly heard saying no twice, before plunging into the Lewis River. She landed with a \u0027belly flop\u0027.  Cops have investigated the incident and have passed the case to Clark County prosecutors, who are said to be considering charges. Taylor has reportedly been co-operating with investigators.  In an earlier text to NBC News, she said she had repeatedly apologised to Jordan and that she feels really bad about what happened.  She also said she had been receiving threats. However, in her latest interview, Jordan said her pal\u0027s apology doesn\u0027t help her \u0027madness\u0027 that she almost died and the rest of her summer is gone. The teenager had gone to the bridge with friends last week. It is thought she had initially wanted to jump off the bridge, but ended up getting scared because of its height and told her pals no.  However, before she could come down, she was shoved into the water.  In a previous interview with Mail Online , Jordan\u0027s aunt Kristie Morgan said her niece was suffering physically and emotionally, having left hospital.  She said she was struggling to breathe and experiencing panic attacks. But despite the pain, she claimed the teenager didn\u0027t want \u0027revenge\u0027. Speaking before Jordan\u0027s comments about jail, she said: Jordan is truly the sweetest girl in the world. She doesn\u0027t wish to seek revenge on her friend. But in my opinion her friend needs to learn a lesson.  Jordan sister, Vanessa, spoke to KOIN in Canada shortly after the incident.   I think she [the friend] tried to do it jokingly and didn\u0027t think what could have happened, Vanessa said. You don\u0027t really play around at 60 feet. The footage of the incident was posted on YouTube last week. As Jordan fell, her arms and legs could be seen flailing helplessly in the air. Ashley Mahree, who recorded the video and posted it on the site, wrote in the description: “This could have easily taken a life, and I think this girl needs to be held accountable in some way. She added: The person that pushed her should go to jail. Although a sign at the site prohibits jumping and diving into the water, the bridge is popular among adrenaline junkies.

The Duchess of Sussex\u0027s relationship with her family has been closely scrutinised in recent months as Buckingham Palace struggles to prevent further embarrassing media interviews by her father Markle and half-sister Samantha. The 37-year-old royal described how she has little tolerance for those she considers \u0027dishonest\u0027 or \u0027disloyal\u0027 in a post shared to her now defunct website, The Tig, in 2014.  The quote is attributed to Portuguese author Jose Micard Tiexera and was recently reshared by Instagram account harry_meghan_updates.   It read: I no longer have patience for certain things, not because I’ve become arrogant, but simply because I reached a point in my life where I do not want to waste more time with what displeases me or hurts me.  I lost the will to please those who do not like me, to love those who do not love me and to smile at those who do not want to smile at me. I no longer spend a single minute on those who lie or want to manipulate. In friendship I dislike the lack of loyalty and betrayal, it continues. I do not get along with those who do not know how to give a compliment or a word of encouragement. The post is believed to have been published shortly after her split from her first husband film producer Trevor Engeleson in 2011. The pair divorced in 2013 - just two years after exchanging vows at their lavish wedding in Jamaica.  The post may also be aimed at her former maid-of-honour whom she is no longer on speaking terms with.  The pair reportedly fell out over Meghan\u0027s treatment of her former spouse and following her relocation to Toronto to take a role in the TV show Suits.

Stefanie Boyce looked on with profound honour as her beautiful nine-year-old daughter, Brooklyn, took her final breath last week after battling a rare condition. Just eight months earlier, she had watched her 11-year-old son, Jayden - Brooklyn\u0027s beloved older brother - pass away peacefully as he lay between her and her husband. The siblings had both lived courageously with the same rare and terminal disorder. And as Brooklyn neared the end of her short life, Stefanie found herself asking an unimaginable question that no mum or dad should ever be faced with. What parent has to think these thoughts, \u0027I wonder if my daughter\u0027s death will be as beautiful as my son\u0027s?\u0027, said the 37-year-old writer, from Illinois, US.  Referring to Brooklyn as \u0027B\u0027 and Jayden as \u0027J\u0027, she added: My greatest fear was B’s passing would be sudden and tragic. A seizure. A morning I’d find her not breathing. Some way that I couldn’t say good-bye. Some way not as holy or sacred as Jayden’s. But since her daughter\u0027s death, Stefanie has experienced a form of peace, knowing her two brave children are together again, playing in Heaven. B is probably dragging him around Heaven giving him the tour even though J knows his way around, she said in an emotional tribute to the pair. And I bet J is chuckling and going along with it as she does. It was on Monday, August 6, that Brooklyn received her crown of life, surrounded by her loved ones, including her dad, Justin, 38, and six-year-old sister, Ellie.  Also known as Beeba, the youngster had a contagious laugh and lit up every room with her personality - which was as big as her beautiful blonde hair. The same day of the week, on November 13 last year, her brother and best pal Jayden had gained his own crown, while lying peacefully between their parents. A gentle little boy who had a vibrant smile for everyone, he had loved dancing with his mum, playing with his dad and holding hands with Brooklyn and Ellie. Brooklyn and Jayden had both been \u0027brave warriors\u0027 against Sanfilippo Syndrome, a regressive metabolic disorder that affects around one in 70,000 children. Youngsters with the condition progress for a couple of years, before slowly losing the ability to walk, talk and eat. They typically pass away before they reach 20.  In Stefanie\u0027s tribute, which she gave  permission to share, she described how her and husband Justin\u0027s routine has all disappeared in one breath. We are no longer a special needs family, said the mum, whose youngest, Ellie, does not have the genetic disease. Our membership to the club got revoked. Expired. And although we never wanted to join, once we did, we didn’t want to leave. Beauty is found in its members. God is found in its meetings. Don’t get me wrong, we will stay connected as honorary members, but honorary none the less. But she added that there’s a peace now that comes as I envision J and B together. Maybe they’re laughing together because B just had to pass on the 6 and J on the 13, so they could share the Monday, she said.  But in true Beeba fashion, her Monday would be first. She concluded: I always wondered why two, but not anymore. Although their lives were short, Brooklyn and Jayden both helped to raise awareness of Sanfilippo Syndrome and the desperate need to find a cure. An obituary for Brooklyn describes how the little girl navigated the condition with strength, grace, and a smile as genuine as they come. She did so while impacting the lives of others. On the day of her daughter\u0027s death, Stefanie said it was her profound honour to have watched the youngster take her first and her last breath. Mourning and sadness feel just as right as joy. Brooklyn, you have brought joy to our life and to every life that has ever been touched by yours, she said.  Even in your last few breaths you made me smile in my tears. May I always strive to live as beautifully as you have. She added that she would be forever looking for her sweet girl. The day after Brooklyn\u0027s passing, Stefanie and Justin marked their 14th wedding anniversary. They spent part of it at a funeral home, planning their daughter\u0027s funeral. Brooklyn\u0027s life will be celebrated at Immanuel Church in Gurnee later this month. Although she and Jayden had suffered from Sanfilippo, the syndrome was not all of them and they didn\u0027t allow it to stop them from smiling and having fun. Their parents say their legacies will last for an eternity.  Stefanie\u0027s full tribute Together. There’s a weird feeling I have that my grief feels complete. There had been an anticipation of having to do this again and fear of what it would be like. My greatest fear was B’s passing would be sudden and tragic. A seizure. A morning I’d find her not breathing. Some way that I couldn’t say good-bye. Some way not as holy or sacred as Jayden’s. What parent has to think these thoughts, “I wonder if my daughter’s death will be as beautiful as my son’s?” I do. But, I’m not the only one. There was an incompleteness to my grief. Maybe that sounds wrong but it isn’t meant to. I certainly would have chosen another day of anticipation if it meant I could have B. It’s just J and B were always, J\u0026ampB. A package deal. It was always hard to separate them, even google photo gets it wrong. Of course they were individuals, too. J was sweet, B was spicy. J was patient, B was ...me. J was a runner, B was a singer.

Esteysi \u0027Stacy\u0027 Sanchez, 31, hit the victim so hard his foot was severed and he ended up in the car with her after smashing through the windshield. Investigators and neighbours were equally horrified when they saw the wrecked car parked near her house, with the mutilated corpse still inside. Sanchez is reported to have drunk-driven the car home for more than a mile after the crash on Oceanside in San Diego. She then walked home and changed her clothes, according to evidence heard in court.  Fox 5 reports Sanchez, who sobbed in the dock as she was jailed for 15 years, had been out boozing all night and was heading home when she hit the man at roughly 6am. As her lawyer begged leniency the judge on Wednesday banged her up for 15 years to life in state prison. Sanchez was convicted in April of second-degree murder, gross vehicular manslaughter and hit-and-run in the death of 69- year-old Jack Tenhulzen, reported Fox 5.  Shortly before sentencing Tenhulzen\u0027s niece, Lisa Francisco, described her loving uncle and told Sanchez that she broke her heart. At one point, the hearing was interrupted because the defendant was close to collapse as she cried and eventually said: “I’m sorry.” Deputy District Attorney Robert Bruce, prosecuting, had told jurors Sanchez displayed a conscious disregard for human life when she drove drunk and ran over Tenhulzen on a pathway near the state Route 76 bridge the morning of June 27, 2016.  He said the victim went through the windshield and into the passenger seat of her car. The court was told part of one of his legs was severed in the accident and found at the back of the car near the rear window. Tenhulzen was hit so hard that he was ripped out of his trousers and shoes, authorities said.  The news station said it happened after a night of drinking when Sanchez left a hotel room the next morning and was told by a male friend that she was too drunk to drive, Mr Bruce told the jury. In turn, Defence attorney Herb Weston argued Sanchez was tired and fell asleep behind the wheel and rode up on the sidewalk, striking Tenhulzen.

Anchor Trish Regan took a shot at the Scandinavian country claiming that there\u0027s something rotten in Denmark and no one wants to work. But her anti-socialist diatribe was dismantled by a Danish politician who blasted her as fake news in this hilarious twitter clip.  Posting a clip of her comments on Twitter, Regan claimed:   Socialism NEVER works! Not in Venezuela, not in Cuba, and not even in DENMARK! These countries have stripped people of their opportunities.  The Dems need to rid their party of socialists for their own good - and the good of our nation.     Dan J\u0026oslashrgensen , of the Socialdemocratic Party of Denmark, wasn\u0027t having any of it.  He offered a savage point-by-point take down of the Fox News host\u0027s claims in a video laden with sass. In his video take-down, J\u0026oslashrgensen said: Denmark ranked 11 places higher than the US on employment rates. The difference of course in Denmark, is that people are paid a decent wage.    Regan had bizarrely claimed that in Denmark, nobody graduates from school and all of those that do, just want to start cupcake caf\u0026eacutes. Not that there\u0027s anything wrong with cupcakes, but in other words, nobody is incentivised to do anything because they\u0027re not going to be rewarded. Denmark, like Venezuela, has stripped people of their opportunities.   But J\u0026oslashrgensen, who joked that he wished that were correct because I love cupcakes threw another statistic at the Fox News host. It could be though, that according to the Forbes list of all the countries with the best opportunities, Denmark rates far better than the US, he said.

Moussa got absolutely battered at times but his hold up play was great. Mendy worked his socks off up there.“But you have to work the keeper and they know that.

I just didn’t get my game-time.“When I did play at Dundee, I think I did well, but I thank Neil McCann for giving me the chance to come out to Dunfermline on loan.“The system we played at Dundee didn’t help me. We were playing just one up front and I was playing as a second striker and on the left and the right wing.“I was happy to play, I was happy to get a game but I don’t think it was my right position.“All my goals I scored with Dundee came when I was in my right position, in the middle, and I’m happy to get the chance to play there with Dunfermline.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b756ff5bfe78-e1534424396159.jpg ","title":"hundreds of pupils start term in new 17m dundee campus","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHundreds of school pupils have started their new term in a new £17 million campus in Whitfield.Youngsters and parents walked through the gates of the North East Campus for the first time today.Roisin Smith, Dundee City Council’s depute convener of children and families services, said the new facilities will help the pupils to meet challenges in the years ahead.This month has seen six city schools moving into new premises in one of the busiest summers for education in Dundee to date.Pupils from Longhaugh and St Francis Primaries and Quarry View Nursery School will be able to enjoy garden and nature areas as well as outdoor classroom facilities at the new North East Campus.The three head teachers are Nicola Jenkin, Longhaugh, Neil Lowden, St Francis, and Susan Krachan, Quarry View Nursery.Mr Lowden said the pupils were delighted with the new facilities.He said: “There has been great anticipation of seeing the reaction of the pupils coming in today.“It has been very positive.“The kids are delighted with the outdoor spaces and classrooms.“It looks fantastic and it will be a great community resource.”Councillor Smith said the new campus – which can accommodate nearly 1,000 youngsters, demonstrated how the city council was investing in the future of Dundee’s youngsters.She said: “Pupils and teachers will be keen to get down to work in their new surroundings.“We are investing in the future of our young people through an ambitious building programme“These are state-of-the-art facilities to meet the challenges that our pupils will face in the years ahead.”A new campus on Coldside is set to open its doors tomorrow to welcome children from Rosebank and Our Lady’s RC Primaries and Frances Wright Pre-school Centre.As part of the ongoing change to the school estates in Dundee, the former Hillside and Gowriehill Primaries are in the process of being demolished.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b36492b901ef.jpg ","title":"more four bedroom houses proposed in dundee development","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOne of the developers behind the new housing being built at Dundee’s Denhead of Gray is looking to change some of the house types it hopes to build.Springfield Properties has applied to Dundee City Council to change the style of 20 of the homes planned for South Gray Village.A spokesman for the company said: “We propose to develop more four-bedroom detached homes at the site than was previously applied for.”He added: “This type of planning application, to change some of the styles of homes at Dykes of Gray village, is quite common, particularly on a development of this scale.“It gives the opportunity to update the house layouts in response to changing demand.“The submitted plans introduce new house designs to this 20-home section of the site, giving our customers more choice.”A total of 67 parking spaces will be provided.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b729b44b349c-463x564.jpg ","title":"new boy safranko hopes debut goal is only the start at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIT’s been a “non-stop” start to life at Dundee United for Pavol Safranko and he’s hoping an impressive debut is just the beginning of a successful spell at Tannadice.The Slovakian international was officially signed on Friday, despite having trained with the Tangerines through the week, and was quickly thrust into the starting XI at Queen of the South.Despite not having much time to settle, the 23-year-old quickly opened his scoring account for United as he looped the ball over Queens keeper Alan Martin for a goal that eventually gave his new side three points.He said: “I arrived five days before the game. It has been non-stop.“It was only five days and my first game so I need to know how my team-mates play.“I had four training sessions so it was a little bit crazy but it was good to help the team to win by scoring.“I’m happy with the start but the three points were the most important thing.“We have to start to win games but when I score it is always nice.“It was a good pass from Frederic Frans and I saw the goalkeeper went down so I just wanted to put it behind him and I think it was a good strike.“I think the first half was a good performance and we need to build on that.“The second half wasn’t perfect so we need to change something there.”Safranko joined the club on a year-long loan deal from Danish side Aalborg last week.He was well-known to manager Csaba Laszlo, though, as they worked together at Dunajska Streda (DAC) in Slovakia.There, Safranko knocked in six goals in 12 games after signing for the second half of the season as DAC went on an extended unbeaten run.And the chance to work with Csaba once more was a big draw for the striker once he heard Aalborg were happy to let him leave.He said: “I played under Csaba Laszlo in Slovakia at Dunajska Streda.“There we were unbeaten for 16 games in a row so I know what I can expect from him and I’m looking forward to playing for him again.“Csaba was the big part of why I joined Dundee United because I had a really good relationship with Csaba. I want to work for him.“I can honestly say that in Denmark there is a bit more combination football but here it is a little bit more fighting which will, hopefully, suit me better.“I can say every player dreams to play football in the United Kingdom so this was also one of the reasons I came here.”Safranko certainly knows the Scottish Championship is about “fighting” as he was given a welcome by the Queens backline.The makings of a black eye was clear in the Slovak’s face during and after the game as he battled with the Palmerston defenders.“I heard the Scottish league is quite hard – now I can feel it!” he added.“It is my style and how I play. We will see, I don’t want to speak too much because it was just my first game.”The Tangerines now have the best part of two weeks before their next Championship fixture – time Safranko thinks they can use to their advantage.“We will have time to train and I’m sure with this squad we can be much better in our next game.“The first half was our good phase because I had Nicky Clark close to me. He is a good player, and we can build on it.“Everyone fought and we have to continue with that because if just one person loses a battle, we will have problems.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b7540a9bb2e3-846x564.jpg ","title":"organisers of scottish independence march give assurances as thousands more set to walk dundee streets than expected","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOrganisers of a Scottish independence march have given assurances that Saturday’s event will go off without a hitch \u0026#8211 despite potentially thousands more people turning up than originally expected.The March for Independence, organised by All Under One Banner, will see protesters take to the streets in support of breaking away from the UK.A list of notifications on Dundee City Council’s website states 1,000 marchers are expected to descend on the city.But organisers now expect anywhere between 10,000 and 20,000 people to show up.

It’s hard for us to gauge how many people will come along on the day.“Provisions are in place to accommodate 10,000 people or more.

Bridge of Don, will attempt to break the world record for the furthest distance travelled on an electric bike in 12 hours, at Grampian Transport Museum’s race track in Alford next Sunday.The environmental campaigner said his adventures aim to encourage drivers to ditch their petrol and diesel-powered cars in favour of electric cars and bikes.He runs Plug In Adventures and had followers gripped with online updates of his drive to Siberia – which relied on the kindness of strangers to charge up the Nissan Leaf car in countries such as Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan.Chris said: “My adventures and challenges are not publicity stunts – they are aimed at helping the public better understand the capabilities of this technology.“I am a passionate advocate of sustainable transport.“I live and breathe it every day myself, having an electric car and solar panels fitted to my home.”The current record is in the hands of Prasad Erande, who cycled 110.6 miles in 12 hours in Maharashtra, India, in 2016.Chris said it will be tough to beat that.“When you start to factor in wind resistance, riding positions and standard grippy tyres, cycling this distance starts to look a lot more challenging,” Chris added.“The team and I have worked hard to put everything in place and I cannot wait to get pedalling.“The popularity of electric bikes has been growing year on year.“They are a good alternative to a push bike, especially if your route includes hills is more than five miles long, or if you would like an extra boost on the road.“By tackling this world record, I am aiming to demonstrate to the public just how capable electric bikes are.“You do not need to be a hardcore cyclist to use one for your daily commute.“Switching your combustion engine vehicle for an ebike to

only done in selected hospitals, as well as tendon lengthening, which was designed to make her more flexible.Mum Senga Brands, 40, was with her all the way, alongside husband Steven, 36.The operations have been successful, though it will take time for the full effects of the procedures to show.The family came home on Saturday to see their front door decorated with balloons.Senga said: “My next-door

Olivia was really chuffed about it.“It did feel a little weird coming home, just because we know that everything is going to be different.”Olivia was reunited with her two sisters, Taylor and Billie, after five weeks apart.Senga said: “My other two girls were at home for five weeks, and we’re just trying to get back into the routine of spending time together as a family.“She’s really loved it, I can’t get peace and quiet now. But it’s been great for her to spend time with her little sister, and she’s happy to have them back.”The youngster was given the prognosis of spastic diplegic cerebral palsy at the age of 14 months – the neurological condition causes constant stiffness and tightness of leg and arm muscles, making mobility difficult.The family had previously thought treatment in the US was the only option and had set about raising £70,000 when they received the good news that Olivia had been deemed an ideal candidate for the operation in Bristol.Olivia is currently gearing up to go back to school next Tuesday.Senga hopes that she’ll be ready to go back with her classmates, and says they’ll “play it by ear” for the first few weeks.She said: “We’ll just need to see how she gets on, and if she needs to reduce her time at school then that’s what we’ll do.”Senga hopes that the surgery will now make Olivia able to do things that her friends and classmates can.She said: “So much has changed for her, she can sit on a bench now, she can sit crossed legged, it doesn’t sound like a big thing, but it is for her.“It’s little steps, and it’s good for her that she can be part of that.“I know that sitting on a bench isn’t a big thing, but her sitting with her classmates is a big thing for her.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen road shut for water works","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPart of an Aberdeen road is to shut while a water service carries out works.Kier Construction will be on site on Anderson Drive on Monday from 7.30pm until 6am on Tuesday, to carry out the work.It will take place just north of the roundabout at Anderson Drive/Queen’s Road.A Scottish Water spokesman said: “On this occasion the location of the manholes needing repaired is such that there is no other way to carry out this work safely than to have a road closure in place.“The work will be carried out in the evening in order to minimise disruption as much as possible.“An on-site representative from our contractors will be available to speak to any customers who are directly affected by this work.“We apologise for any inconvenience while these essential repairs are carried out and thank customers and motorists for their patience and understanding.”There will be a diversion northbound along Queen’s Road while work is taking place.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/5b752334e0906-884x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeen sandwich shop cleans up with glowing report1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen sandwich shop that was criticised by inspectors earlier this year has now been given a glowing report.Aberdeen City Council sent an inspector for a routine check of Deja Vu food shop on Rose Street in March and their report said improvement was needed.The inspector expressed concern about the condition of some of the equipment and cleanliness.Several insects were spotted in the back kitchen area, which is not used for food preparation.The business’s owner, Roy Duncan, said he immediately called in pest controllers and the insects were removed within hours.He added that he spoke with the council inspectors in depth so he was able to attend to their concerns.According to the council, the premises was re-inspected on June 8 and they gave it a pass rating – meaning that all the original concerns had been dealt with.Mr Duncan, who has been in the food trade for 30 years, said: “It was quite a shock because, having been in the trade for so long, I had always passed these inspections and known exactly what gets you a pass and what doesn’t.

The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sands of time are running out","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 02/08/18, 6:33 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAncient sayings relating to sand generally highlight its abundance. In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Fraser Watt gave them the lead on 17 minutes and Lewis Montgomery added a second on 33 minutes.A second from Fraser Watt five minutes later made it 3-0 at the break.James Cameron pulled a goal back for Inverness on 54 minutes but most of the pressure was around the Inverness goal. Inveraray had plenty shots but didn’t hit the target as often as they would have liked.They did get a fourth goal though when Allan MacDonald scored on 64 minutes.Bute 5 Kilmory 0Bute stay in the title race after they beat Kilmory 5-0 on the island.Bute attacked from the start and a combination of dogged Kilmory defending and wastefulness in front of goal meant the hosts only had a good Steven Dunn finish on 30 minutes to show for their first half efforts.When referee Des McNulty pointed to the penalty spot on 54 minutes, Iain McDonald stepped up to slam the ball home.Robert Walker scored on 63 and 85 minutes, either side of a 70th minute Craig MacKay goal, to complete the 5-0 victory.Aberdour 0 Inveraray 1Inveraray\u0026#8217s second team moved off the bottom of the table after a \u0026#8216smash and grab\u0026#8217 job on fourth-placed Aberdour.The Royal Burgh side travelled with only 12 players. Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income. However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"soccer centre scores with support from ardrishaig community trust","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/08/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIn a fantastic boost for youth football in Mid Argyll, the Ardrishaig Community Trust and Lochgilphead Soccer Centre have jointly announce that Ardrishaig Community Trust will be the main sponsor of Lochgilphead Soccer Centre for the next three years.The funding package, worth £5,000 for each of the next three years, will make a huge contribution to the centre’s ambitious development plans – it already has more than 120 members, including around 40 from Ardrishaig.The development plan will see the Soccer Centre invest in new equipment, quality coaching to help the youngsters develop their football skills, participation in football festivals, and attend Scotland games, among other things.The funding will meet the cost of around 100 new football strips, all branded with Ardrishaig Community Trust, and will help ensure all Lochgilphead Red Star YFC teams are kitted out the same, from primary one to sevens (including the girls’ teams).The cost of kit to keep the coaches – who contribute the equivalent of around £15,000 a year in time – warm and dry throughout the year, will be part funded by the sponsorship. The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust.

The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"past times present fun in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/08/18, 11:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOrganisers reckon 450 people came along to enjoy a dip into the past.Lochgilphead Community Council\u0026#8217s annual Celtic and Pictish Festival is gathering momentum year on year as it grows into an event with a character all of its own.Morning shoppers on Argyll Street were treated to the unusual sight of Picts, Vikings and Romans parading to Lochgilphead front green to begin the festivities.

Saints had the majority of possession in the second 20 minutes but the Star back line of Kyle Selfridge, Andy Weir and Luke Naisby remained resolute along with Luke Kalache in goal.The other sides in group two were debutants Port Glasgow who ran out 2-0 winners against Neilston as two first half goals sealed the match in the Inverclyde men’s favour.Red Star’s next game against Neilston was an entertaining affair. After a goalless first half, Star took the lead through Ian McGuinness before an equaliser from Neilston after some sloppy defending. Innes Meikle restored the Red Star advantage with a long range effort which he curled away from the Neilston keeper for 2-1. Star were once again pegged back however as a free kick into the box bamboozled Kalache in the box and ended up in the back of the net. Just as it looked like the points would be shared Gregor Peacock got on the end of a Cammy MacDonald flick on and headed into the net to secure a 3-2 win for the hosts.Oban Saints and Port Glasgow took to the Astro next and the Oban side soon got into their stride and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners to move to the top of the section on goal difference.Saints stayed on to play their final group match against Neilston and they continued to play some excellent attacking football with Donald Campbell scoring the pick of the goals in a 3-0 win to secure top spot.This left Red Star and Port Glasgow to face each other in the final game to determine who would go through as runners up. Both sides were keen to secure the victory but the defences remained on top in a 0-0 draw and the Lochgilphead side made it through after picking up five points from their three matches with Port Glasgow finishing on four.Over at the Ropework, Campbeltown Pupils opened up their campaign with a 1-0 victory over local rivals Tarbert. Kilsyth, making their tournament debut, also got off to an excellent start with a 3-1 victory over Dunoon.Dunoon stayed on to play against old rivals Campbeltown Pupils in what turned out to be a feisty encounter with the Pupils running out 2-1 winners thanks to a Martin McCallum free kick in the final minute.Tarbert then took on Kilsyth in a 1-1 stalemate, with Nikki MacDougall scoring the equaliser, before fighting out another draw with Dunoon to end the campaign with two points.This left Kilsyth and Pupils fighting for the top two spots in the final match of the section and the North Lanarkshire side edged the tie 1-0 to secure top spot and a semi-final against Red Star.The first semi-final saw Oban Saints take on Campbeltown Pupils, with Saints taking the lead in the first half after Fraser McFarlane was felled in the box. Up stepped Lewis Cameron to make no mistake from the spot.Pupils weren’t lying down, however and got back into the game with a penalty of their own to equalise, and will be disappointed not to have forced a winner late on.The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out and Saints eventually came out in top on a contest that swung back and forward, providing some excellent entertainment for the crowd that had gathered.The second semi-final also proved to be an exciting affair as Red Star took on Kilsyth. The hosts fell behind early on when Kilsyth opened the scoring after their midfielder finished well from 20 yards to beat Kalache in the Star goal.Red Star equalised soon after with a Ben Forbes wonder strike from 30 yards which thundered past the Kilsyth keeper. Star took the lead when Gregor Peacock was barged in the box and Andy Weir stepped up to fire the penalty beyond the ‘keeper to give the hosts the lead. Kilsyth were causing Star plenty of problems however and were level again before the half-time whistle when a scramble in the box saw the ball deflect in off the unfortunate Luke Naisby.The winner came for Star early in the second half when Kilsyth couldn’t clear a free kick into the box and the ball broke kindly to John Kennedy, who volleyed home to secure the win and send Red Star into the final where for the second year in a row they would face Oban Saints.Into the final and the Red Star side were clearly feeling the effects of their exertions as they struggled to contain a fluid Oban Saints attack early on. Saints had a couple of good attempts saved by Luke Kalache before Matt Rippon opened the scoring after the ball broke kindly on the edge of the box.The Premier division side put themselves 2-0 up on the stroke of half time when more good play saw the ball fall to Shaun MacIver who bundled home.The second half saw Saints stretch their lead through James Ford before Cammy McDonald pulled a late consolation for Red Star but it was Oban Saints who ran out deserved 3-1 winners and won the tournament for the second year running.Saints also had the Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Lewis Cameron who was excellent throughout the day.Red Star would like to thank all the teams and officials who took part in the competition, as well as the Stag Hotel for their excellent hospitality.Tomorrow Red Star round off their pre-season schedule with a home match against Helensburgh which will take place at the Ropework, with a 2pm kick-off.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK. The competition is free to enter and all shops who enter will also be promoted to consumers through an online Indie Retail Directory.Shopkeepers can nominate their businesses until Sunday September 9 via bestsmallshops. A shortlist of 25 of the most impressive applications will be shortlisted by a panel made up of established representatives from the independent retail industry.The judges will be looking for evidence of a small shops\u0026#8217 entrepreneurial spirit, ways that they have been innovative in their business and what they have done to have a lasting positive impact on their community.The shortlisted small shops will be invited to a parliamentary reception on November 13 to meet their Member of Parliament and find out who will be crowned Best Small Shop 2018.Argyll and Bute has an amazing array of small shops which help support our rural economy and I would love to see them recognised.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,Since when is it okay for a man to stand in a layby and urinate in broad daylight?It has become more noticeable in recent years and is never a pleasant sight.

Builder John MacDonald followed with colourful tales of Archie McVicar, with whom he worked as a young man. Greta Cameron talked about the early years of the Oyster Bar, established on the estate in the late 1970s by Christina\u0026#8217s brother Johnny Noble along with fish farmer Andy Lane.Piecing together records from her father\u0026#8217s journal, estate records and blending these with the recollections of the people of the estate, Christina has created a remarkable piece of work.This book is not just about the Nobles, but the Ardkinglas community, the people who make it and have made it and the story of how they lived and worked.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m very pleased that so many people have come along today for our launch party,\u0026#8217 said Christina.\u0026#8216Ardkinglas is a place that is very dear to me, and the place and the people have contributed to making me who I am today.

We look forward to VisitScotland accepting our proposals and working with us to ensure a smooth transfer of the facility over the coming weeks.\u0026#8216A lot of work will need to be carried out before the transfer and anyone wishing to volunteer should get in touch through our website.\u0026#8217A VisitScotland spokesman said: \u0026#8216We are currently in discussions with Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust about proposals for future use of the property and have the support of the local community.\u0026#8217Tarbert businessman Ian Macintyre believes the transfer of the premises should be a formality. He told the Advertiser: \u0026#8216In the original constitution for the Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islay tourist board, the last paragraph is that in the event of this situation, any assets should transferred to an appropriate local body. I think that should still hold.\u0026#8217The trust\u0026#8217s asset transfer plan is backed by Argyll and Bute MSP Michael Russell, who said: \u0026#8216I made it clear when this plan was first announced that there would have to be alternatives in place before any closure. That remains my position and I am concerned that, for example, there is still no fast mobile phone speeds and broadband in some parts of the area which are necessary to get information from the developing providers.\u0026#8216I have been supporting the proposal from the community trust for the Tarbert premises and I am hopeful that there can be an asset transfer, not least because it seems that the building was only given to VisitScotland on the understanding that if it stopped using it, it would revert to another body doing the same sort of work.\u0026#8217Councillor Alastair Redman added: \u0026#8216I would support the Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust in their talks to ask for an asset handover and take over the tourist centre building.\u0026#8217VisitScotland states that tourist information provision will continue across Argyll and Bute through a network of more than 130 VisitScotland Information Partners (VIPs) primarily based in hotels and guest houses, with three of these in Tarbert, four in Campbeltown and two in Inveraray, alongside \u0026#8216outreach\u0026#8217 staff attending events around the country.\u0026#8216It’s going to be a big miss in the village.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex (number two) from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

The pitch at the school is too small to host even an under-13 game.‘For Mid Argyll Rugby Club to grow, it needs to have a home to create an identity. In recent years, plans and promises to create a rugby facility have always come to nothing and the game in Mid Argyll has suffered for it.\u0026#8216We have a Scottish School cup game on Tuesday August 28 and at the moment we are still looking for a venue. How can we compete with central belt schools, or even our neighbours in Oban, who have facilities provided by the council?’The club has steadily been developing fresh talent for more than five years, but with nowhere to play it cannot field a first 15 despite plenty of willing players.The pitch project, supported by Scottish Rugby and Argyll and Bute Rugby Development Officer Allan Wright, hopes to be open by autumn 2019.Another supporter of the project is Councillor Dougie Philand, who said: ‘I have been involved with senior rugby previously and having our own pitch was always a problem.\u0026#8216I would fully support any development or plans that would promote a permanent pitch and changing areas especially now when there is a resurgence in junior rugby.

Shankland, 22, was named the Ladbrokes League One Player of the Year after scoring 29 goals en route to Ayr winning the title. And his double against Partick Thistle sent Ayr top of the Championship on the opening day of the new campaign. The former Aberdeen striker\u0027s form has now attracted a list of suitors both north and south of the border, with Dundee already enquiring after the hitman\u0027s services.

And he is well aware that Labour must recapture votes in places like the Doon Valley if it is to regain power at Holyrood and Westminster. “This is precisely the kind of constituency we need to win back,” admitted the Scottish Labour Party leader. He made a good impression on a whistle-stop tour of Dalmellington and Bellsbank. But time will tell whether or not this will bring voters back to the fold. Mr Leonard chatted amiably to lady volunteers at the Kirk Shop, in the middle of Dalmellington. There was clearly lots of goodwill for the Yorkshire-born politician. The affable Labour leader then moved on to Dalmellington Care Centre, where he planted a red rose to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS. “My grandfather was a gardener, back in Leeds,” said Mr Leonard, as he wielded a spade. He heard about grassrooots co-operation in Dalmellinton among groups like The Zone and the care centre.  Mr Leonard said: “It’s the resilience of the people that’s keeping the Doon Valley going. “But it’s about time they were given a helping hand from government. “There are too many people living in poverty and on poverty pay. “We need investment in public services and we need to see communities having more control, with the possibility of community buy-outs.” Mr Leonard said only Labour is pledging a decade of investment. “We’re the only party opposing the austerity policies of the Tories, which are being passed on by the SNP.” He said the SNP’s own Growth Commission report revealed there would be even more austerity in an independent Scotland. And he was adamant: “The Labour Party is absolutely opposed to a second referendum on independence.”  Labour colleague Colin Smyth MSP said: “We’re seeing a growing frustration among voters on a debate focused on the constitution. “People want to see improvements in education and health.” Mr Leonard popped up to Bellsbank to see how streets are being transformed with ‘Balamory’ style painting of houses. In the afternoon, he visited the Sovereign Credit Union in Cumnock to hear about its services in the community. Then it was on to Tarbolton, to meet residents who are unhappy about their doctors’ surgery hours being cut, due to a shortage of GPs.

(Smail\u0026rsquos Guide, pp. 96)\nCardrona Tower: \u0026ldquo...Cardrona was for many ages...the property of a family of the name of Govan, chiefs of the name, one of whom, Laurence of Govan, was Sheriff of Traquair in 1358. They resided in the old Tower on the hill, which is now in ruins. The Govans continued in possession of Cardrona until the latter end of the seventeenth century, when it was purchased by Mr Williamson, writer in Peebles, and Town Clerk of that burgh.

This was granted, and the work of demolition was soon begun. The roof was taken off and the chambers filled with earth, and in the course of a short time the effects of the weather made themselves apparent. The walls cracked in every direction, and large masses of the building fell.\nNext the crowbar was applied with great success and to make the appearance of an ancient ruin as near perfect as possible, a cartwheel was fixed in one of the largest rents, that the effect at a distance might be that of a venerable abbey. (Smails\u0026rsquo Guide, pp. 15 \u0026ndash 16)\nNether Horsburgh Castle: \u0026ldquo...we find that the lands of Easter Horseburgh, then called Schelynelaw, together with lands of Traquair and Innerleithen were, in 1634, in the hands of John Stewart of Traquair, who in that year was served heir to his brother Robert. The tradition in the family [Horseburgh] is that this part of the property was sold to defray the expenses of a lawsuit which had arisen between two brothers.\nAt Nether Horsburgh there are the remains of an old tower or keep, which used to be called Shillinglaw Tower. Tradition is silent respecting it, but it was probably built about the time the lands came into the possession of the Stewarts [sometime after 1550].

he called an \u0026ldquoexcruciating year.\nThe New York Times said the chief executive of electric car maker Tesla alternated between laughter and tears during an interview in which he said he is working up to 120 hours a week and sometimes takes the sedative Ambien to get to sleep.\nBut he denied being \u0026ldquoon weed when he posted news of a potential 72 billion dollar (\u0026pound57

He stood by his tweet last week saying he might take Tesla private and that he had secured the funding to do so.\nAsked if he regretted it, he said: \u0026ldquoWhy would I?\nMusk has a reputation for being an eccentric visionary, but his out-of-the-blue announcement of a potential buyout raised a huge ruckus and pushed Tesla\u0026rsquos shares up 11% in a day, raising the company\u0026rsquos value by 6 billion dollars (\u0026pound4.7 billion). They have since fallen back but remain elevated.\nInvestor support is confirmed.

He decided to round up to 420 dollars \u0026mdash a number that is code for marijuana in counterculture lore.\n\u0026ldquoIt seemed like better karma at 420 dollars than at 419 dollars, he said in the interview. \u0026ldquoBut I was not on weed, to be clear. Weed is not helpful for productivity. There\u0026rsquos a reason for the word \u0026lsquostoned\u0026rsquo.

He later apologised for that remark.\nThe report cited sources as saying Tesla has been trying to find another senior executive to help relieve some of the pressure on Mr Musk.\nHe said he did not intend to give up his roles as chairman and CEO but that if there was someone who could do the job better, \u0026ldquothey can have the reins right now.\nIn a separate report, the Wall Street Journal said securities regulators have been investigating if Tesla misled investors about production problems for its Model 3 car.\nThe company could face sanctions if regulators find it misled investors about production delays.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date()a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0]a.async=1a.src=gm.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\u0027script\u0027,\u0027//www.google-analytics/analytics.js\u0027,\u0027ga\u0027)ga(\u0027create\u0027, \u0027UA-72310761-1\u0027, \u0027auto\u0027, {\u0027name\u0027: \u0027pacontentapi\u0027})ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027referrer\u0027, location.origin)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension1\u0027, \u0027By AP/PA\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension2\u0027, \u0027cc4d94a2-2571-4c01-a27c-aec7da40a637\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension3\u0027, \u0027paservice:news,paservice:news:world,paservice:sci-tech,paservice:sci-tech:technology\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension6\u0027, \u0027story\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension7\u0027, \u0027composite\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension8\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension9\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.send\u0027, \u0027pageview\u0027, { \u0027location\u0027: location.href, \u0027page\u0027: (location.pathname + location.search + location.hash), \u0027title\u0027: \u0027Elon Musk: Stress taking its toll in \\u2018excruciating\\u2019 year\u0027})\n"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc reporter judged castles in the sand","story":"Jamie McIvor, who began his journalism career at the Courier, was roped into the special role at last Saturday\u0026#8217s inaugural Campbeltown Community Regatta by Dalintober Beach Group\u0026#8217s Jamie McLean.At about 2pm Mr McIvor toured Dalintober beach where he found creations ranging from the traditional castle with sea water-filled moat to one decorated with dandelions and another with shoes instead of shells.It was a tough decision but there was only one golden bucket and spade trophy specially made by Kenny Blair.Mr McIvor was unaware of the family connection when he pronounced the winner as the dandelion castle, and was told it was made by Finlay Blair, 5, who had already left the beach.It was not possible to take all the names of sand castle constructors during judging, but here are a selection of the castles and the winner.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"golf lottery results","story":"The next draw, for a jackpot of £700, will be on August 13.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll peloton expands kintyre time trial","story":"Numbers once again ballooned to 30 from the original 14, partly by an echelon from Mid Argyll and also by holiday makers staying in the area, who fancied their chances on MACC\u0026#8217s virtually pan flat closed road circuit.There were many new faces but also a number, such as the Kintyre Wheelers Cycling Club July winner, Dom Sharkey, missing while competing at other events.After gentle protests and to satisfy those who pace themselves against the phone app Strava, the race distance was lowered slightly to exactly 10 miles.Mechanic and time keeper, Ian Brodie, said: \u0026#8216Three cyclists rode the lap and a mean of their GPS recorded mileage was taken to decide on the start and finish point.\u0026#8217A funding bid is to be made by Kintyre Wheeters together with other Argyll cycling clubs for a chip timing kit.

some 17 years ago, I lived on High Askomil for 25 years and before that about eight years on Low Askomil, both overlooking the beach.Long before when I was a teenager I lived in one of the prefabs on Hillside Road.My friends and I would often head for Dalintober beach, commonly known as Banana Beach, where we would spend some pocket money on Jock Shields\u0026#8217 kayaks.There were about six or seven kayaks to hire for a shilling or two and go just about anywhere, in all weathers, for an hour, not a life jacket to be seen.Jock or John Shields ran a bicycle shop on Longrow but was into many things and also had a ship carousel at Banana Beach.The carousel wasn\u0026#8217t unlike one at the fair but consisted of seven or eight little cargo ships and cruise boats, all home made I think, for one child in each boat.They were attached to a centre spindle with one ship only having an outboard motor making the whole assembly rotate.I\u0026#8217m not sure if it was Jock or someone else who hired out rowing boats from the slipway in the harbour.We would hire two seater or four seater boats, the former being cheaper and we could always pick up another crew member when out of sight of the hirer.Rowing  to the large mooring buoy in the middle of the loch was no big deal, neither was accepting a dare to ride out the wake from the Duchess of Hamilton or Montrose sideways on.I\u0026#8217m sweating thinking about it as there were no lifejackets, we must have been crazy.Other memories of Banana Beach were the toilets and shelter at the top of the pier now long gone, and the push button drinking fountain at the wall near the beach slipway.Happy days indeed.  Good luck to those trying to restore it for today\u0026#8217s generation where I\u0026#8217m certain lifejackets will be in

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.  The average UK gross weekly wage in 2017 was \u0026pound552 while the Scottish average was \u0026pound547."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8157352.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"work-taking-place-at-blindwells-ahead-of-houses-being-built-there","story":"  Planning permission for homes at Blindwells, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie, was granted in spring last year.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea? I was asked first thing this morning.  \u0026ldquoAfter I have written my story, I replied.  \u0026ldquoWhat are you going to write about this time?  \u0026ldquoNot sure, let\u0026rsquos see what comes to my mind, I said.  And so now we will head to the Boat Shore, and the walk by the coast there.  I love living by the sea."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-welcomes-zambian-visitors","story":"  The centre received a visit from the country\u0026rsquos social welfare minister Emerine Kabanshi and Julien Mwape, director general of Zambia Agency for People with Disabilities (ZAPD), who are in Scotland to see firsthand a range of health and social care facilities.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.

If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.  Tim Porteus, Prestonpans storyteller and Courier columnist, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom disappointed.

For some it was a practical way to live in the country they have chosen to call home for others it was a way to end anxiety over their future under Brexit.  Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.  Christa said: \u0026ldquoBrexit is the reason I decided to apply for citizenship.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove lived here for 30 years and came with certain expectations thinking we were secure but it has pulled the rug from right under our feet and suddenly the future is uncertain.  \u0026ldquoIt has caused some sleepless nights and so it made sense to get permanent residency.  The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.  The citizenship process involves a series of tests which those applying have to pass, quizzing them on all aspects of British life.  Mohamed Sherif, 31, an engineer from Musselburgh, has lived here for 10 years and is originally from Libya. He said: \u0026ldquoIt is a lot easier to have citizenship than have to spend a lot of money on renewing visas.  \u0026ldquoWe know we want to stay in this country so it made sense to apply.  The seven new citizens who attended were: Christa Gerdwilker (originally from Germany), East Saltoun Mohamed Sherif (Libya), Musselburgh Carmen King (Mexico), Ormiston Bernadette Fitzgerald (Australia), Tranent Diego Onate (Colombia), East Saltoun Gabriele Hegerl (Germany), East Linton John Crowley (USA), East Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-a-bath-in-butterdean-wood","story":"  BEING surrounded by trees, in a wood where the world outside cannot be seen, is a primeval experience. It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.  Autumn in Butterdean is nature\u0026rsquos show, but it\u0026rsquos not ready for that yet, it\u0026rsquos still fully clothed in summer\u0026rsquos colours."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8195899.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=128\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"disgraceful-state-of-north-berwick-toilets-slammed","story":"  The quality of the toilets on the town\u0026rsquos Quality Street has long been lauded by residents and visitors alike, but last week it drew criticism from one resident, who contacted the Courier to offer her concerns.  Helen Mulgray wrote: \u0026ldquoI was shocked to see how the cleanliness of the toilets had deteriorated.  \u0026ldquoThese once highly praised, award-winning toilets have been degraded to become offensive and at times a health hazard \u0026ndash no soap to wash hands and no toilet paper unless [it is] picked off the floor.  She described the condition of the toilets as a \u0026ldquodisgraceful memory of a visit to North Berwick for the thousands of visitors that flock to the town every summer.  East Lothian Council is currently proposing to cut the permanent toilet attendants at the county\u0026rsquos public loos and instead see them maintained by an extended team of mobile attendants.  Ms Mulgray slammed the council for the proposal, adding: \u0026ldquoImplementing the proposed plan to do away with full-time attendants means this mess will be a permanent sight for visitors to the toilets.  \u0026ldquoIt takes no account of the crowds coming from the beach until late, busloads stopping at the car park, and events like the Fringe [by the Sea] and the [Highland] Games.  \u0026ldquoIs saving money this way more important than the tourist image of North Berwick?  Ms Mulgray added that when she returned to the toilets last Monday, they were \u0026ldquospotless.  She put the improvements down to the fact that the usual full-time attendant had returned from annual leave.  Ms Mulgray wrote to the council to express her concerns about the toilets being allowed to deteriorate last week and, in a response seen by the Courier, Lorraine Faulds, senior officer of facilities management, wrote: \u0026ldquoLooking at your specific concerns with North Berwick toilets, it has been maintained by a combination of permanent and mobile attendants for more than six years.  \u0026ldquoThis pattern has ensured appropriate levels of cleanliness throughout the year and includes recognition of the busier summer months.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that at any toilet, on any occasion, whether by intent or accident, toilets or sinks can be blocked by paper or left as debris.  \u0026ldquoFortunately these remain isolated incidents at our sites and North Berwick toilets actually have a more frequent attendance by the mobile attendants than some of our other sites.  She said the emptying of sanitary bins would increase from once a week to twice due to Ms Mulgray\u0026rsquos complaint of them \u0026ldquooverflowing.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoWe take our service provision extremely seriously and aim to maintain the very high standards of our public toilets.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial.

Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans. The consultation process will focus on how we do this through an educational benefit statement.  \u0026ldquoWe have already informed the chairs of the parent councils of this proposal.  \u0026ldquoAll parents, carers and the wider school community will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal once the consultation has been published and the statutory consultation period begins on Monday.

The scheme will apply to the section of the town north of the railway line, with major roads such as Belhaven Road also included.  All roads affected previously had 30mph speed limits.  The new order, which is an experimental order, will mirror what is already in place south of the East Coast Mainline in the Hallhill area of the town, where all the streets, with the exception of Kellie Road, are 20mph.  Herbert Coutts, from the town\u0026rsquos community council, has been heavily involved in moving the project forward and was pleased to see progress being made.  He said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased about it because that is what essentially the research carried out by the community council demonstrated. There was public support for it in Dunbar and it will be good to see it going ahead and I am hopeful the outcome will be positive.  Mr Coutts stressed that the change in speed limit would not see an end to speeding but he felt it would help improve people\u0026rsquos safety.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt was never thought by people supporting it that it was a magic answer to all our speeding problems but a step in the right direction and people become accustomed to going at 20mph in the town.  \u0026ldquoThereby the safety of pedestrians \u0026ndash particularly children and elderly but people of any age \u0026ndash will be enhanced.  \u0026ldquoThat is the hope and hopefully people will observe it.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe order has been made and we are just awaiting the appropriate signage, which should be within the next month.  \u0026ldquoThe order will be for an 18-month period and is an experimental order.  If the order is deemed a success, steps will be taken to see the 20mph speed limit become a permanent fixture.  Feedback from members of the public could also help decide whether any roads become exempt from the 20mph speed limit in the future.  Currently there are no plans for traffic calming measures, such as speed humps or chicanes, on the streets affected by the new speed limit.  The 20mph speed limit starts to the west of Edinburgh Road\u0026rsquos junction with Shore Road and Beveridge Row.

The findings come at the same time as overall employment in the county has increased slightly.  Figures show that the number of people in either part-time or full-time employment in East Lothian rose to 78.6 per cent between April 2017 and March 2018, an increase of 3.6 per cent from the previous year, when the rate was at 75 per cent.  Councillor Brian Small, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoObviously the fact that 4,000 households are without work is worrying.  \u0026ldquoWork isn\u0026rsquot only important for the financial benefits to those in employment, it also generates health and social benefits for them.  \u0026ldquoHaving something to get up in the morning for is good for you.  \u0026ldquoBut we have to welcome that East Lothian is better than both the UK and Scottish average but there is still more that can and should be done to get people back into work.  Peter Dicker of East Lothian Foodbank, based in Tranent, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the statistics for the increase in the population in work is encouraging, the foodbank can only comment on the fact that over the same period that the statistics were compiled for April 2017 to March 2018 we here at East Lothian Foodbank experienced a 12 per cent increase on the number of referrals we had sent to us \u0026ndash this 12 per cent compares to a national average of a 13 per cent increase on referrals (Trussell Trust stats).  \u0026ldquoSince the introduction of Universal Credit in April 2016 we have seen an increase in people being referred to us by over 45 per cent (April 16 to March 17 was 37 per cent increase).  The figures from the ONS estimate that last year 14 per cent of households in East Lothian were workless, lower than the Scotland-wide average of 18 per cent.  County MP Martin Whitfield said: \u0026ldquoClearly the increase in the local employment rate over the last year is welcome. However, the fact there are still many people out of work remains a concern. It underlines the complacency of the UK Government, which is simply not doing enough to help people into work.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, through its East Lothian Works employability service, is doing a good job supporting jobseekers, but both the UK and Scottish Governments must do more to enhance prosperity and create new jobs.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray added: \u0026ldquoI welcome the fact that East Lothian\u0026rsquos employment rate is higher than the Scottish average. However, too many local people are still not in work. We need a fundamental shift in how we grow our economy.  \u0026ldquoWe also need to ensure opportunities for creating these kind of jobs locally are maximised at the former Cockenzie Power Station site and the new innovation park at QMU.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoUnemployment figures in East Lothian are following a positive trend as there are over three per cent more people in employment now compared to last year.  \u0026ldquoThe council continues to strive to grow East Lothian\u0026rsquos economy and to make it the best place in Scotland to live, work and do business and we would very much hope our employment figures will continue to rise year-on-year as a result of this work.  \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to comment in detail on the figure of 4,000 households being classed as out of work as it\u0026rsquos unclear, as yet, exactly how this figure has been calculated.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to note that the roll-out of full service Universal Credit in East Lothian has had an effect on the recording of our out-of-work levels so this too needs to be looked at more closely.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Works continues to support people of all ages and abilities to gain skills, re-train and undertake courses and work experience to get them back into rewarding employment, working closely with employers and education providers. There are also many initiatives to support the most vulnerable in our society, including those living in poverty, including projects initiated by our area partnerships designed to meet the needs of our very different communities across East Lothian.  Across Scotland, the most common reason people gave for not being in work was being sick or disabled \u0026ndash 37 per cent of out-of-work individuals cited illness or disability as the primary reason.  Students made up 13 per cent of the group, and 18 per cent were early retirees, with 10 per cent of jobless people in the area officially \u0026lsquounemployed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash looking for work and able to start within two weeks.  A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said: \u0026ldquoSince 2010 the proportion of workless households is down in every region of Great Britain.  \u0026ldquoThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest since 1971, but we\u0026rsquore committed to ensuring that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so \u0026ndash while making sure there is a safety net for those who can\u0026rsquot.  The DWP has also said that the majority of employment growth has been in both full-time and permanent roles.  David Leese, policy analysis manager at charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said that workless families in particular were at a much higher risk of poverty.  Figures from the DWP for 2016-17 show that in workless households nearly 75 per cent of children were growing up in poverty, compared to only five per cent of children with two working parents.  \u0026ldquoIf a child lives in poverty, it affects their health, their education, their family relationships and their plans for the future, Mr Leese said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not right that any child lives in such insecure circumstances."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/7646470.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dual-carriageway-closed-after-stray-cows-struck-by-vehicles","story":"  Essex Police said on Twitter that people in the vehicles suffered \u0026ldquosome minor injuries on the A12 Witham bypass on Friday morning.

In a tweet sent on Friday morning Mr Hunt said: \u0026ldquoImportant not to misrepresent my words: Britain WOULD survive and prosper without a deal\u0026hellip but it would be a big mistake for Europe because of inevitable impact on long term partnership with UK.  \u0026ldquoWe will only sign up to deal that respects referendum result.

Kristian Jensen said time is running out to strike a deal that is positive for both Britain and the EU, after Latvia\u0026rsquos foreign minister claimed the chance of a no-deal Brexit is \u0026ldquo50-50.  Earlier this week, Edgars Rinkevics said there was a \u0026ldquovery considerable risk of a no-deal scenario but stressed he remained optimistic an agreement with Britain on its withdrawal from the European Union could be reached.  Mr Jensen, appearing on BBC Radio 4\u0026rsquos Today programme, was asked about Mr Rinkevics\u0026rsquo remarks.

He said in the interview that he had wanted to offer a roughly 20% premium over where the stock had been trading, which would have been about 419 dollars. He decided to round up to 420 dollars \u0026mdash a number that is code for marijuana in counterculture lore.  \u0026ldquoIt seemed like better karma at 420 dollars than at 419 dollars, he said in the interview. \u0026ldquoBut I was not on weed, to be clear.

In the interview, he said he fired off the tweet while on his way to an airport, and his reference to having secured funding referred to a potential investment by Saudi Arabia\u0026rsquos government fund.  Mr Musk, 47, said sometimes he did not leave the Tesla factory for three or four days straight, and that he had not taken off more than a week at a time since he was sick with malaria in 2001.  His social media antics have raised eyebrows as he berated analysts and falsely accused a cave diver of being a paedophile after the man was sceptical about a mini-submarine Mr Musk sent to possibly help rescue young football players from a flooded cave in Thailand. He later apologised for that remark.  The report cited sources as saying Tesla has been trying to find another senior executive to help relieve some of the pressure on Mr Musk.  He said he did not intend to give up his roles as chairman and CEO but that if there was someone who could do the job better, \u0026ldquothey can have the reins right now.

In the meantime the campaigners say that the SFA should withdraw from the international matches.  The SPSC said in its petition: \"While the state of Israel continues to violate Palestinian rights with impunity...\u0026nbspthe SFA could make a significant contribution toward the goal of freedom for the Palestinian people and equal rights for all in Israel/Palestine.\"    But the SFA has said it has no plans to comply while the Israeli Embassy in London has said allegations made about Israel\u0027s actions were \"hate-laden\".

Ms Miller, co-founder of Citizen\u0026rsquos Basic Income Network Scotland, suggested every adult could be paid \u0026pound162 a week. This would be funded by hiking income tax to at least 45%.  The IPPR previously said such a scheme would cost \u0026pound20 billion a year in Scotland and would risk making child poverty worse.  Agreeing the economy is in crisis and in need of fundamental reform, Mr Kibasi said a basic income was seductive \"precisely because it\u0027s a big idea, but the problem is that big ideas aren\u0027t necessarily good ideas\".  He added: \"My real objection to UBI is that it lets capitalism off the hook. It is giving in, it is embracing defeat.\"  He said the policy was widely supported by Silicon Valley tycoons such as Elon Musk, former Google chairman Eric Schmidt and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg \u0026ndash as well as Richard Branson.  He continued: \"In politics you always get strange bedfellows \u0026ndash that\u0027s absolutely the case. But if you\u0027re going to get into bed with the billionaires, you\u0027ve got to ask yourself, \u0027Why are they in favour of it?\u0027  \"The reason is that UBI actually maintains unequal power relations.\"  He said introducing a basic income risked leaving 20 or 30 per cent of the population as a \u0026ldquodependent class, and insisted it was \u0026ldquotrying to attempt a form of kind of euthanasia for the working class as a political category and a political concept.  Dismissing the idea as \u0026ldquomagical thinking, he argued money should instead be spent on building good homes, boosting the budget of the NHS or improving schools.  He also insisted UBI would \"solidify and reinforce\" gender inequality, because women would come under pressure to stay at home and look after their children.  He added: \"UBI is to our economic problems what snake oil is to medicine.\"  Glasgow, Edinburgh, Fife and North Ayrshire councils are all considering basic income pilots.  They will be ready to begin their trials in March 2020 \u0026ndash subject to a final decision on whether or not the proposals are feasible.  Supporters deny the scheme is being held up as a \"silver bullet\" that will solve all of society\u0027s problems.  Ms Miller said UBI would help \"emancipate\" people and prevent poverty, and branded the current social security system \u0026ldquovery cruel.  But she said it would need to be introduced gradually to prevent disruption and allow the system to settle in.  She said UBI would live up to the four words engraved on the mace in the Scottish Parliament: justice, integrity, compassion and wisdom.  \"I can\u0027t think of a better foundation for a society than a basic income, bringing about some of these changes that I hope will happen,\" she added.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe are interested in any proposals to help reduce poverty and inequality.  \"We have awarded \u0026pound250,000 over the next two years to four local authorities developing work that seeks to better understand the impact of a citizen\u0026rsquos basic income \u0026ndash including costs, benefits and savings."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8251026.jpg?type=article-full","title":"secrets-of-lost-nuclear-bunker-to-be-revealed","story":"  As the bombs fell, men from the Royal Observation Corps (ROC) were to shelter within the tiny underground bunkers, monitoring the size of the blasts and plotting the course of the radioactive fallout as it spread across the country.  Isolated from each other, but connected with a communications network, the monitoring posts were built as an insurance policy against a day it was hoped would never come.  But as the threat of an atomic exchange receded, they fell into disuse and were abandoned as relics of a darker time, with few remaining intact today.  Yet now the secrets of one of the last nuclear monitoring post\u0026rsquos left in Scotland are to be revealed for the first time in more than 20 years through a project being undertaken to uncover the lost history of a remote part of the North East.    Little can be seen of the bunker above ground  At first glance, the fields of Inverharroch Farm on the Cabrach are an unlikely place for a stronghold from the height of the Cold War.  But it was from here that a three-man squad would watch mushroom clouds spreading from the ruins of Aberdeen, Dundee and other population centres if ther Soviets had ever launched their missiles.  There used to be ROC monitoring posts every 10-15 miles, with the Cabrach, which has been closed since 1992, site neighbouring those in Findhorn and Elgin.  George Anthony from Keith was a former group officer for the ROC and worked at the Drummuir site. He explained what the organisation was tasked to do.  He said: \"Ten thousand observers were part of the Royal Observer Corps around the country and I started out as an observer at a monitoring post in Drummuir. When I was promoted to group officer I looked after four posts in Moray.  \"If we came under attack, our job was to plot the flash going off and the pressure of the nuclear burst.  \"Even in peacetime we had to take readings from instruments every five to 10 minutes so each shift was very busy.  He added: \"There was no heating, though, and the only air was via a small vent and the access shaft, so you had to be hardy.\"    Access is provided through a deep shaft  Sunk 20 feet under the ground, the reinforced concrete bunkers were designed to survive an atomic blast, with access provided by a single ladder descending from a turf-covered steel manhole on the surface.  Inside, there was enough space for three servicemen to live for a period of up to three weeks after a nuclear attack, although conditions were cramped.  Each bunker comprised only a single room, with mapping and monitoring equipment crammed into the living space, along with an adjacent chemical toilet.  From here, the ROC officers would trace the shifting patterns of deadly radioactive fallout blowing on the wind and relay the information to larger underground centres, such as the Troywood bunker in Fife \u0026ndash a 24,000 sq ft facility now open as The Secret Bunker tourist attraction.    Conditions inside were cramped  Andy Fairgrieve from Dufftown, who also manages the arts programme of a nearby Speyside distillery, has visited more than 200 decommissioned nuclear bunkers around Scotland, Northern Ireland and the North East of England.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf you were on duty when the bombs dropped then you had to stay in the bunker. The data you provided would have helped the government to establish the effects on the country and to help any survivors.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe nuclear posts were located around 10 to 15 miles apart and were organised into clusters which communicated between themselves.  \u0026ldquoThe Cabrach bunker, or \u0026lsquoPost 32\u0026rsquo, was part of the Aberdeen Section. The UK\u0026rsquos network of bunkers were reorganised from 1968 onwards, with a number of them being closed down, although Post 32 remained operational until the early 1990\u0026rsquos when the Royal Observer Corps was stood down.  \u0026ldquoMost are now flooded, burned out or permanently locked by the landowner but this one remains in remarkably good condition and I\u0026rsquom really looking forward to showing people around it.  The bunker, which will be opened for one day on Saturday 18 August, is under the care of the Cabrach Trust, which plans to work with historians to convert the existing farm steading into a historically-accurate distillery, heritage centre and cafe as a significant new tourist attraction. All profits will be reinvested locally in jobs, housing and infrastructure.  \u0026ldquoHeritage isn\u0026rsquot just all about ancient history, said the Executive Director of The Cabrach Trust, Sue Savege.  \u0026ldquoThe nuclear bunker is part of the Cabrach\u0026rsquos very recent history and is a fascinating chapter in of the area\u0026rsquos long and interesting heritage. The story behind this bunker will eventually be documented alongside the rest of the history of the Cabrach in our new heritage centre.  \"The Open Day will give us an opportunity to give an update on how work is progressing on the heritage centre, and we\u0026rsquoll be offering a \u0026lsquovirtual tour\u0026rsquo of the site."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8251269.jpg?type=article-full","title":"fans-take-high-road-for-last-runrig-gigs","story":"  Tens of thousands of fans are this weekend making one last pilgrimage to hear Runrig play Loch Lomond. For they and their true loves - as the band\u0026rsquos floorfilling cover nearly goes - will never meet again.  The six-piece has sold 47,000 tickets for farewell concerts in Stirling today and tomorrow that will bring down the curtain on 45 years of their groundbreaking brand of Celtic folk rock.  Their fans - many in the Hebrides - have struggled to afford or arrange the journey with Calmac warning ferries were full and extra flights from the islands put on to cater for extra demand.  Against a backdrop of Stirling Castle, Runrig will perform, for just two last times, what amounts soundtrack of the last few turbulent decades of Scottish history, through two devolution referendums and 2014\u0026rsquos big vote.  The group - despite some changed faces - says it has a special bond with its fans, many of whom were enjoying rock in their own language for the first time. But the time, the musicians said, had come to bow out.  Vocalist Bruce Guthro said: \u0026ldquoI think we\u0026rsquore ready. I think we\u0026rsquore very proud of what we\u0026rsquove accomplished and we\u0026rsquore ready to give Scotland the show of a lifetime.  The Canadian, who has been touring with Runrig for 20 years, said of his time with the group: \u0026ldquoAll of it has been special. It\u0026rsquos almost impossible to pick certain highlights - it\u0026rsquos just been a great journey.  \u0026ldquoThe fans are are a family unto themselves and they are without question the driving force behind this band.  Since forming on Skye in 1973, Runrig have produced 14 studio albums and performed at Edinburgh Castle, the Royal Albert Hall and in New York\u0026rsquos Times Square.  They are hailed for their contribution to Scottish music, the Gaelic language and Scotland\u0026rsquos cultural identity. Though they were never entirely happy to be seen as a kitsch symbol of Scottishness.    Founding member Rory MacDonald said it is a love of performing that has kept the group going through the decades.  The bass player said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tended just to go from album to album, we\u0026rsquove never had a grand plan, or the idea we\u0026rsquore going to take over the world - none of that stuff.  \u0026ldquoVery early on, maybe after the third album, we knew very much that this was what we wanted to do with our lives. It wasn\u0026rsquot for fame or fortune, it was just that we loved playing music and playing together.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove always had that sense of being comfortable with what we\u0026rsquore doing. That\u0026rsquos the way it has worked for us.  Guitarist Malcolm Jones added: \u0026ldquoIf you\u0026rsquod said then that 45 years later we\u0026rsquod still be doing this, you\u0026rsquod have thought no way, not a chance.  Jones said concerts - called Last Dance - marked the end of an era for the band but other projects would continue, including looking after the group\u0026rsquos legacy.  Keyboard player Brian Hurren admitted there has been nerves ahead of the final concerts.  He said: \u0026ldquoI would say it\u0026rsquos unlike any other show I\u0026rsquove experienced with the band. I\u0026rsquove had sleepless nights and I\u0026rsquove had elation and excitement, sadness - everything. It\u0026rsquos been an incredible journey.  \u0026ldquoThere are a lot of fans that can\u0026rsquot get to see us because they\u0026rsquore in Australia or places that are just too far away, but they have been trying to make it over for this show, which is amazing.  Meeting the band ahead of the concerts, Scotland\u0026rsquos Deputy First Minister John Swinney thanked Runrig for their \u0026ldquoextraordinary contribution to Scotland\u0026rsquos cultural life.  He tweeted: \u0026ldquoA very special privilege to thank Runrig1973 on behalf of Scottish Government for all they have done to strengthen Scottish traditional music, the Gaelic language and Scotland in 45 years of amazing music.  \u0026ldquoThey have been such an important part of Scotland\u0026rsquos incredible journey.    Mr Swinney\u0026rsquos SNP colleague Pete Wishart MP formerly played keyboards for the band. Mr Wishart had said he would never join the SNP when interviewed in 1991.  Speaking to writer Peter Ross in last weekend\u0026rsquos Herald Magazine, Mr Wishart stressed his band\u0026rsquos part in helping Scotland learning to love and appreciate a sense of itself as confident and assertive. He added: \u0026ldquoAll the other political changes could never have happened without a feeling that what we have in Scotland is important and worth celebrating.  The band did not write Loch Lomond. But the traditional song\u0026rsquos lyrics may offer some consolation. \u0026ldquoThe broken heart it kens nae second spring again, it goes. \u0026ldquoThough the waeful may cease frae their grieving."},{"url":null,"title":"teachers-and-parents-sound-off-to-swinney-on-education-policy","story":"  Marie, a mother of twins, contacted a live radio phone-in with Mr Swinney to raise the treatment of her disabled daughter at school.  Now educating her children at home, Marie told the minister her daughter was given little or no help despite being unable to get dressed or go to the toilet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWhen there was no learning assistant about her class teacher asked her twin to take her to the toilet. Obviously at 10-years-old \u0026hellip both of them were very upset.  \u0026ldquoShe was left in the changing room, the teacher never got her changed, her twin had to do that, then got in trouble for taking too long.  \u0026ldquoIf she approached a supply teacher to ask for help they would say a child of her age should be able to get dressed herself.  Mr Swinney said her experiences were \u0026ldquototally unacceptable and pledged to look into the situation.  \u0026ldquoIndividual local authorities have got to make the assessment of how to fulfil the needs of individual children, but what you\u0026rsquove recounted to me is very clearly not acceptable, he said.  It was one of a number of difficult calls Mr Swinney fielded during his hour-long appearance on BBC Scotland\u0026rsquos Kaye Adams Show, hosted by Stephen Jardine.  Mr Swinney conceded it had been a challenging time in Scottish education and it was clear the parents, grandparents and teachers who phoned in from across the country shared that view.  Lesley, from the Scottish Borders, said pupils were being placed under too much exam pressure and were not taught properly.  She said her granddaughters had sat exams with questions that had not been covered by their school.  Mr Swinney stressed the importance of pupils being supported and said they should be fully taught courses.  \u0026ldquoBut they\u0026rsquore not, came the frustrated reply. \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot think the system is working and it is punishing children very badly. It is robbing them of their confidence.  Susan, a primary school teacher and headteacher for 39 years, accused Mr Swinney of failing to address workload pressures and teacher shortages.  She said the profession was \u0026ldquohaemorrhaging teachers because morale was \u0026ldquoso low, telling Mr Swinney: \u0026ldquoYou have a real crisis with recruitment and retention.  \u0026ldquoA number of my friends started out as teachers at the same time I did and out of all of those talented committed individuals I was the only one that lasted until 60.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot hear anything there that you have said this morning that would convince me that you have got a handle on this.  Another listener from North Lanarkshire texted to say her secondary school had been short of a chemistry teacher for five years.  Mr Swinney said he accepted teaching was demanding, but said he had engaged with teachers to reduce their workload.  He added: \u0026ldquoWhat we have got us a very challenging period in education. We have some staff shortages, he said.  Predictably, Mr Swinney was also put under pressure on primary school testing.  The Education Secretary said the assessments would help teachers identify issues as pupils progressed, but there was strong opposition.  Tommy, a teacher from the Highlands, said the tests jarred with current classroom practice.  \u0026ldquoThe requirement for recording assessments in primary school is bordering on the ridiculous. It\u0026rsquos another thing added to the list.  And Stuart, who starts a primary school teaching qualification on Monday, said he had \u0026ldquoreal worries arguing the tests were \u0026ldquonot needed and not wanted."},{"url":null,"title":"shining-a-spotlight-on-highs-and-lows-in-the-political-world","story":"  Brexit continued to dominate the political landscape, imperilling Theresa May\u0026rsquos leadership, and generating ever greater tensions between the UK and Scottish governments.  The strain led to a series of constitutional firsts.  MSPs passed legislation despite the Presiding Officer warning it was invalid, prompting a Supreme Court challenge, and Holyrood rejected the UK\u0026rsquos main Brexit bill as a \u0026ldquopower-grab, but Westminster imposed it regardless, prompting a fierce debate on the value of the Sewel Convention.  With Ms Sturgeon staying silent on a second independence referendum, a frustrated Yes movement took it on itself to organise a series of huge marches demanding a new vote.

It comes amid complaints of an Edinburgh Tattoo performance being disturbed by the nearby Rag\u0026lsquoN\u0026rsquo Bone Man gig in Princes Street Gardens.  Controversy erupted last week over blackboards that prevent the public seeing ticketed concerts in the gardens, which could host up to 200 events a year when a new \u0026pound25 million arena is completed.  The association accused council chiefs of trying to commercialise \u0026ldquoevery square metre of the city centre.  Only the festival fireworks finale would be allowed in the gardens under the Cockburn\u0026rsquos vision for the beauty spot.  Chairman Cliff Hague said: \u0026ldquoLike many others, my concerns have grown, as it seems like every square metre of the city centre is being viewed as a means of raising revenue. This also links disruption such events cause before, during and after the event itself.  \u0026ldquoI have no problems with the fireworks at the end of the festival, which depend on the setting of the castle to add to the spectacle.  \u0026ldquoBut I am less convinced by the necessity to stage major pop and rock concerts.

It comes as a music festival was told to take down a massive black-out fence blighting the city centre.

Some studies have linked vaping with lung damage, heart disease and even cancer and infant mortality.  Research by the University of Birmingham published this week said e-cigarette vapour has a similar effect on the lungs and body that is seen in regular cigarette smokers and patients with chronic lung disease.  A study by the New York University School of Medicine found smoke from e-cigarettes damages DNA and can increased the risk of cancer and heart disease in mice.  Meanwhile, researchers at the Geisel School of Medicine in the US have warned any kind of nicotine exposure during pregnancy, whether from smoking, skin patches or vaping, heightens the chances of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Many experts say much more research needs to be done in the area.  \u0026ndash Can they encourage people to smoke conventional cigarettes?  The STC says concerns that e-cigarettes could be a gateway to conventional smoking, including for young non-smokers, \u0026ldquohave not materialised.  Expert opinion on the issue is divided.  In the UK a person must be 18 to buy e-cigarettes or the e-liquids they vaporise.

For not only will it commemorate the centenary of the end of World War One, but it will also mark the centenary of the restoration of Poland’s sovereignty as the Second Polish Republic from the German, Austrian and Russian Empires.                                       \t      \t\tLabour of love...for Keith Burns, project manager from MAPA Scotland, the charity founded to restore the Great Polish Map of Scotland in 2010. Some eight years and \u0026#65533120,000 later, that goal has now been achieved.      \t                                                             The independence celebrations will be marked here in Scotland by Polish people across the country.                                                    And taking centre stage will be the Great Polish Map of Scotland.        In the summers of 1974 to 1979, this lasting legacy was created in the Borders to celebrate the links between Scotland and Poland.Although dating back to before 1576, it was in that year Royal Grants first recorded the relationship – with the King of Poland protecting the Scots “who supply us with all that is necessary”. Our friendship has remained firm ever since.The Great Polish Map of Scotland was mainly the work of a small group of Poles from the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, led by the map’s lead designer, Dr. Kazimierz Trafas.                                                                                                        But its creation was the brainchild of Krakow-born Jan Tomasik, a sergeant in the 1st (Polish) Armoured Division, who was stationed in Galashiels during the war and married a Scottish nurse in 1942 after being treated in the town’s Peel Hospital.He became a successful hotelier in Edinburgh after the war and added Barony Castle in Eddleston to his properties in 1968, where the map was conceived and created.He wanted to show hotel guests the landscape of Scotland and hoped the map would become a tourist magnet.Jan also wanted to show the coastline of the country Polish forces had been responsible for defending.                                                                                                        He is remembered as saying to hotel patrons: “I shall die but I shall leave my map as a gift to the Scottish people to thank them for the hospitality they showed the Poles when it was needed”.After the hotel closed in 1985 and ownership of Barony Castle passed from the Tomasik family, the map fell gradually into disrepair.But in 2010, Mapa Scotland was formed – a group of volunteers who were dedicated to restoring the map to its former gloryThanks to grants from the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Fund, along with fundraising, that goal has now been achieved.And it is hoped it will become both a visitor attraction and an educational resource for many generations to come.                                                                                                        With that in mind, a digital documentation team from Historic Environment Scotland spent five days on site, laser scanning the map to create a 3D model.The team then spent several months, working with Mapa Scotland and the Polish Cultural Festival Association, to create an interactive app highlighting Scotland’s Polish heritage.For Marta Pilarska, digital documentation intern with HES, the project proved to be a learning curve.She said: “I’m Polish and even I was discovering new connections between Poland and Scotland which I had never heard before. “It was a really interesting project to be involved with.“I knew the basics – the soldiers during the war years and that Bonnie Prince Charlie’s mother was Polish.“But I never knew that 40,000 Scots emigrated to Poland in the 1600s and that many towns and areas are still named after Scotland.“One of the quirkier facts we discovered was that a Polish folk dance, dating back to the 1600s, is actually based on a ceilidh dance.“I had no idea about any of that until this project.”Marta joined the HES team at an ideal time too – just one month before work started on the project.She added: “I was in the perfect place at the perfect time – a nice coincidence.“We hope people will enjoy finding out more about the two countries links and that teachers will also visit the map and use the digital app as a learning tool.”The Great Polish Map of Scotland measures some 50 metres by 40 metres and lies in an oval pit surrounded by a 142 metres long perimeter wall. Covering an area of 1590 square metres, it is understood to be the largest three-dimensional physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world.Visit https://sketchfab/HistoricEnvironment Scotland to explore the app.A labour of love for MAPA Scotland volunteers who restored landmarkA business meeting at Barony Castle Hotel in 1996 led Keith Burns to stumble across the Great Polish Map of Scotland, literally – it was so overgrown.But it wasn’t until 1999, when the engineer from East Linton retired, that the discovery started “nagging away” at him.In 2000, Keith and several friends started discussing what they could do to transform the landmark’s fortunes.And in 2010 they formed the charity MAPA Scotland, with the aim of raising enough funds to restore the map.Initially, they thought it would take two years and around £45,000 to rectify – but it proved a much larger undertaking.Keith, who was the project manager, explained: “We seriously understimated how long the work would take and how much it would all cost.“There were two reasons for that: firstly, we didn’t realise how much repair work the foundations of the map would require. They had been built with old tin cans from the hotel and they were crumbling away.“And secondly we had to get one or two specialist contractors to repair the pit wall and relay a lot of underground water supply pipes for the seabed.“The water supply had never worked it now does so we’ve actually upgraded the map.“But all of that took money and, to date, it has cost in excess of £120,000 to restore.”That funding was raised thanks to the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Funds, as well as major contributions from the Barony Castle Hotel, Borders Council, the Polish Consulate and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, as well as generous public donations.However, 12 MAPA volunteers bore the brunt of the labour.Keith added: “We were all retired and could spend time on the project. It was hard work and involved a fair bit of travel but we’re delighted the map has now finally been restored.”Collection boxes around the site will help MAPA maintain the map for future generations.

Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Friday 17 Aug 2018 11:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117108.jpg","title":"Dont be put off if youre being bullied employees are told after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSpeaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0026rsquo Advice Bureau (CAB), stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\u0026ldquoClients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment, he said.\u0026ldquoAnyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \u0026ldquowhistleblower while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \u0026ldquosubstantial number of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \u0026ldquoperhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation.He added: \u0026ldquoHowever, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0026lsquoEarly Conciliation\u0026rsquo process.He underlined that it is \u0026ldquocomparatively unusual for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \u0026ldquosmall percentage going that far.\u0026ldquoWhile it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights, Mr Gregory said.\u0026ldquoThe system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.Friday 17 Aug 2018 11:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116895.jpg","title":"Gala furore over Lidl Wayne absolutely ridiculous","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMany people took to social media to voice their anger and concern at the reaction and coverage in the national and regional press following the appearance of the character on Saturday night.Around 90 per cent of the responses were positive and supportive.

These are exciting proposals and it is going to be important that everyone understands the vision for future care in Caithness.\u0026ldquoThis is about making sure that as many people as possible can take part and have their say.The proposals resulted from extensive engagement to explore possible options. NHS Highland recently approved the move to public consultation, which has been widely welcomed.The preferred option includes the development of a proposed care hub/village at the Dunbar Hospital site in Thurso and the Pulteney House care home site in Wick.The plans also include a multimillion-pound upgrade for Caithness General as part of an overall \u0026pound30 million investment for the area.The option of developing Wick\u0026rsquos Town and County Hospital will also be included in the consultation.The Wick event will be held on Monday, August 20, between 6pm and 7pm, while the Thurso one takes place the following evening at the same time.People planning to attend either should contact Christian Nicolson of NHS Highland on 07870513114 or email christian.nicolson@nhs.net to help ensure adequate seating can be provided.The health authority says further events will be arranged in due course and dates will be widely publicised.Friday 17 Aug 2018 11:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116965.jpg","title":"Wildlife cruise passengers get close up view of orca pod","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt happened on Sunday during a Pentland Venture wildlife cruise when five orcas, including two calves, came into view \u0026ndash to gasps of delight from onlookers.Fred Fermor of John O\u0026rsquoGroats Ferries said: \u0026ldquoAs luck would have it we had more than 100 passengers on our wildlife cruise that day.\u0026ldquoI was taking a walk round the stacks and witnessed the spectacle from the shore.\u0026ldquoIt was great to hear the excited chatter and shouts from the passengers when they saw the orcas approach the Pentland Venture which by that time was just bobbing around.He added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a case of letting people see these magnificent creatures while respecting their space and habitat.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to think that Caithness can offer such experiences and that folk will go back to the far corners and tell their friends what a wonderful place we live in.The orcas were photographed from Duncansby Head by Colin Bird, former area group co-ordinator for Sea Watch Foundation, who started the annual Orca Watch at Duncansby.He said: \u0026ldquoThe ferry has been a great help in providing sightings of cetaceans in the Pentland Firth over the past 15 years.These sightings have helped form a greater understanding of the movement of orcas between Iceland and the north of Scotland.As reported in the Courier, local wildlife photographer Karen Munro saw seven killer whales on Friday close to the shore at St John\u0026rsquos Point, where they \u0026ldquoharassed seals for about an hour. They moved on towards Stroma and she alerted the ferry team.Mr Fermor said: \u0026ldquoThe orcas stayed at Stroma for a while and although some distance from John O\u0026rsquoGroats it caused a bit of a stir onshore and Karen generously let visitors view the whales through her powerful telescope.Meanwhile, Sea Watch Foundation says its latest National Whale and Dolphin Watch event looks like being the best in the past two decades in terms of the unprecedented variety of species of whales and dolphins seen around the British Isles.The event involved thousands of volunteers from all around the British Isles and was conducted between July 28 and August 5.This summer\u0026rsquos stable weather is one possible explanations for the high number of cetacean sightings in the country as a whole, with higher temperatures bringing warmer-water species and creating the conditions for plankton fronts to develop \u0026ndash attracting shoals of fish and, in turn, whales and dolphins.Meanwhile, Sea Watch Foundation says its latest National Whale and Dolphin Watch event looks like being the best in the past two decades in terms of the unprecedented variety of species of whales and dolphins seen around the British Isles.The event involved thousands of volunteers and was conducted between July 28 and August 5.Friday 17 Aug 2018 11:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will also improve the availability of recycled material for use in the production of bottles and cans in future.“I would encourage everyone with an interest to provide their views on how this scheme can meet Scotland’s needs and help us tackle our throwaway culture.”Iain Gulland, Chief Executive, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “Scotland’s planned deposit return scheme is a landmark in the nation’s circular economy journey, with the potential to drive inward investment and create jobs in Scotland at the same time as improving recycling and reducing litter.\u0026#8221Consultation available to view.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They were both originally earmarked for closure, but were later given temporary reprieves to see if customer numbers increase.The new report also warned that while \"online banking, Post Office banking and mobile bank vans go some way to providing alternatives\", there were concerns over cyber security, \"the fragile nature of Post Office contracts\", and accessibility of mobile banks.Zoe Laird, HIE\u0026rsquos regional head of communities infrastructure, said: \"Along with the findings of the Scottish Parliament Enquiry into bank closures this [study] will inform how public sector agencies and service providers respond.\"Friday 17 Aug 2018 11:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The result is that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"\u0026nbspThe society hopes to screen at least one movie a week drawn from the film programme at Eden Court in Inverness.It would initially be volunteer-run but there are plans to eventually train up managers and projectionists \"who would also be able to work at Eden Court\".Mr Mackenzie-Blackman said sharing films in this way would allow the film society to avoid having to pay licensing fees.He said, in addition, Eden Court may handle online bookings from its box office in Inverness.He added: \"If Cromarty and Resolis Film Society raise the money needed to make the project happen I will be firmly supportive of it.\"We will work in collaboration with them to help them project the cinema in Cromarty.\"Friday 17 Aug 2018 11:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Even non-dog owners have praised our initiative.\"She added: \"This is a disappointing thing to happen in our village where so many volunteers do their best to maintain the area to ensure this is a clean and safe place for residents and visitors and I am appalled that this vandalism was apparently carried out by a local resident.\"The community council and Men\u0026rsquos Shed group were put in touch via link man Roddie McPherson, who lives near the fishing village\u0026rsquos landmark harbour.The eco-friendly wooden dispensers can be found at the Avoch end of the railway line path, on Shore Walk by the industrial units, at the harbour green and at the start of the Shaltie Burn path.The move follows a recent initiative in the village to highlight the many paths which can be enjoyed by visitors to the village via a panel erected at a prominent spot near the Lazy Corner.A police spokesman said: \"Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101, quoting NE5003/18, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.\"Friday 17 Aug 2018 11:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The 3.6km section between Glendoe and Loch Tarff has been particularly challenging and would not have been possible without funding support from SSE, Highland Council and the Scottish Government and European Union totalling \u0026pound250,000, as well as the full support from Glendoe Estate over whose land the trail has been constructed. The opening of this section opens up the South Loch Ness Trail to more walkers, mountain bikers and horse riders and, particularly on this section of the trail, to those of limited mobility.\"Mr Ambrose added that the creation of the LochNess360\u0026deg trail will bring new opportunities for businesses, communities and deliver major economic benefit to the area in the long term.\"It will achieve this because it will attract visitors who may spend up to six to seven days completing the full circuit,\" he added. We know from feedback that there is already substantial interest from key European markets, particularly Germany, and VILN hope by spring 2019 to confidently go out to markets and promote it.

I said you can\u0026rsquot do that \u0026ndash no one has been notified about this. The guys just said they were acting on instructions.\"Hamish Mackenzie of Tarbat Community Council wrote to Highland Council chief executive Steve Barron back in June after receiving apologies in January from local authority community services staff for the lack of warning.They said the equipment was removed on health and safety grounds \u0026ndash a reason given in other similar instances across the region.However Mr Mackenzie says follow-up enquiries for details about land ownership and the legalities of the situation have not been responded to months later.\"The first choice is to get Highland Council to continue to maintain the park in accordance with the original agreement. People certainly feel short-changed by the council.\"People are also aware of things like threats to toilet provision and grass not being mowed. We seem to have an endless series of services being cut, often without any notice.\"He added: \"I understand budget pressures but we will fight when things are taken away without any warning, particularly when we see no justification for it.\"He said the developer of the Knockshortie Estate, Micky Austin was \"staggered\" to learn of the latest development having paid \u0026pound18,000 towards the cost of the playpark, which he had assumed would continue to be maintained and available to locals. He said: \"He is a public spirited person and has developed a nice estate. A play park lets children to get outside and away from gadgets and devices. It\u0026rsquos a great tragedy.\"\u0026nbspQuestion marks though remain for the community over the legality of the move. Many on the estate feel cheated that a facility which helped attract them in the first place has been stripped away \u0026ndash while others say Highland Council has \"played the health and safety card\" without justification.\u0026nbspThey are now left seeking answers and facing the prospect of potentially having to raise thousands to replace the facility.Tain and Easter Ross councillor Derek Loudon said: \"Highland Council officers have ordered a search of the Land Register and the Register of Sasines to clarify ownership. \"This will allow what is a very pro-active community to acquire or lease the land for a lottery or other funding bid. That is a prerequisite for any lottery bid. Let\u0026rsquos hope the community gets a quick turnaround and are able to buy the equipment needed and get it ready for next summer.\"Highland Council was approached for comment but had not responded as we went to press.Friday 17 Aug 2018 11:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

All my sculptures contain a memory and I felt it apt that this particular work should be imbued with the feeling of being held in a loving embrace, feeling safe and secure enough to develop your potential.\"The Shelter of Your Arms is one of a collection of pieces created by Ann on display throughout the garden and in the Sawyer Gallery within Inverewe House.Operations manager Kevin Frediani said: \"As a result of the Gulf Stream meeting the Highlands, Inverewe Garden is a nirvana of unusual and wonderful plants and wildlife. Through our arts and exhibition programme we are providing visitors with another dimension to the garden and new way to enjoy Scotland\u0026rsquos national and natural treasures, as our reputation as a centre of arts and culture grows.\"The exhibition is open now and runs until August 30.Last month, NTS unveiled its vision of a proposed new 20m viewing tower within the garden.The plans, which have been submitted to Highland Council for consent, would see an observation tower overlooking Loch Ewe.If given the go-ahead, the tower would provide unique panoramic views for visitors with, according to the NTS, minimal impact on surroundings and could be used to host educational talks.A spring 2019 opening is planned if all goes according to plan.The attraction has enjoyed a surge in visitor numbers after recent investment including the renovation of Inverewe House, the development of the new Sawyer Gallery and Bothy Caf\u0026eacute and new glasshouses.Friday 17 Aug 2018 11:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We wanted to take positive action to help the red squirrel population spread into the local woodlands as safely as possible. The combination of bridge and road signs definitely appears to be working well, which is great news.\"It\u0026rsquos safer for reds to travel in the tree canopy rather than on the ground, so it\u0026rsquos likely that if they have the option of using a bridge rather than crossing the road, they will take it. We also installed feeders at each end of the bridge to encourage the squirrels to use it.\"Since the bridge and road signs were introduced, there has only been one known red squirrel road death locally, with none reported so far in 2018. The year before, there were three reported road deaths of reds in the immediate area and two others further away.The rope bridge is suspended over the A896 outside Shieldaig village, alongside the Ben Shieldaig woodland, one of Scotland\u0026rsquos few remaining fragments of ancient Caledonian forest.Local climber Chris Hingley worked with Becky to install the bridge last June 2017, with support from Highland Council.

We will keep residents informed once a proposed timescale for this work to take place has been identified in consultation with Highland Council.\"On health concerns, he said the water supply across Scotland is sampled, on average, once every two minutes and tested against strict quality standards to protect public health. Additional samples are routinely taken when a main is returned to service.He said the World Health Organisation has concluded there is no evidence of a health risk connected to drinking water from asbestos cement water mains.Friday 17 Aug 2018 11:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"more seabirds entangled but fishing industry not always to blame says tour guide ","story":"\nDarron Smith cuts free a gannet.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements.

If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country.

The intention is that it can be used in all weather and not only by tennis players and other sports enthusiasts but also by the likes of the Cubs and Scouts, Guides, playgroups, charities and even for children\u0027s parties and ceilidhs.\nThe mystery benefactor came forward after reading last week\u0027s appeal in the Strathy.\nA spokesman for the donor said: \"The extent of the community\u0027s input into the campaign was really impressive and that\u0027s what swung it.\n\"Local people had put in a major effort to raise their share of the cost and the project deserves to get off the ground.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nFriday 17 Aug 2018 11:40 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116807.jpg","title":"Dont play mother to lost wildcat kittens","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nThe public is being urged to be hands off if they spot a possible Scottish Wildcat kitten in the wilds of Strathspey unless they are certain it is in immediate danger.\nExperts have issued the warning after a well-meaning member of the public removed possible kittens from the wild and their mother.\nRare wildcats \u0026ndash and other cats in the countryside \u0026ndash are now at an age when they are out and about, even without their mums.\nScottish Wildcat Action Project Officer Emma Rawling said: \"If anyone sees tabby kittens alone in a possible wildcat area and or if mother looks like a wildcat, the public should be cautious and assume they could be wildcat kittens.\n\"Wildcats are protected by law.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-the-visitor-large-1.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

inspires local woman to take on berlin marathon","story":"  \nA Ballymena woman is taking on 26.2 miles at one of the world’s most famous marathons on September 16 to help raise money for the British Heart Foundation Northern Ireland (BHF NI).\n  \nMairead Agnew was inspired by her young neighbour Mark Lynn, who has complex congenital heart disease. At just 8 years old, he has undergone four open heart surgeries and numerous cardiac procedures. \n  \nIn 2015 Mark was diagnosed with heart failure but this still hasn’t stopped him and his parents Donna and Geoff supporting BHF NI and raising almost \u0026pound3,000 for the charity.\n  \nMairead explained: “My sister was born with congenital heart disease so this is a cause that has always been extremely close to mine and my family’s hearts. When I saw the wonderful fundraising that Mark and his family had raised, I wanted to do something to help. When I told Mark I was taking on the Berlin Marathon, he was sure he wanted us to support BHF NI once again.”\n  \nKaren McCammon, Health Services Engagement Lead for BHF NI explained: “When the BHF was founded in 1961, 8 out of every 10 babies born with congenital heart disease died before their first birthday. Our research has helped to turn this around, and now 8 out of 10 babies survive to adulthood. Breakthroughs such as these are only possible because of the support we receive from supporters like Mairead, Mark and his family. We are therefore extremely grateful for all their efforts.”\n  \nBHF have also developed pioneering surgical techniques to treat complex congenital defects.

I understand that the work is expected to last right up until Christmas.\n  \n“My issue is firstly there has been no consultation, I don\u0027t know exactly what they are planning to do. \n  \n“We are relying on hearsay at the minute and I have heard that there are plans to lay stone similar to the rest of the town.” \n  \nClaire said she had written a letter to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council about the issue.\n  \nShe continued: “It took ten days to get a reply which said there was “nothing concrete at the minute”.\n  \nClaire said that among her concerns was that the area has a very slopping street which raises issues around what type of paving is used.\n  \nShe added: “Also there are concerns around water flowing down the street due to the slope and the fact that if the paving used is light in colour chewing gum, which will eventually cover it, will turn black and soon make the street look grubby and shabby.”\n  \nClaire said she would like to see either the street remain the same and be “brought back to its former glory” or be consulted on any proposed plans.\n  \n“We want to have a debate about it, not have to rely on hearsay. I have a sizeable investment in this street and I feel as a business owner I should have a say,” she concluded.\n  \nA Mid and East Antrim Council spokesperson said: “Plans are being considered to extend the public realm scheme on this street, however, these are at a very early stage. \n  \n“We will be liaising with traders over the coming weeks in relation to initial consultation on concept designs.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921291.jpg--.jpg?1534232684000\n","title":"dungonnell dam features on ulster giants tv show","story":"  \nA reservoir in the hills between Ballymena and the glens features in the new series celebrating the achievements in Northern Ireland of the Institution of Civil Engineers on the occasion of their 200th anniversary. \n  \nThe fifth episode of ‘Ulster Giants’, which continues on Monday, August 20 at 8pm on UTV is all about water and the various ways in which it has been collected, stored and treated before being delivered to our homes and workplaces. \n  \nJoe Mahon’s first port of call is the now abandoned Hunt’s Park Water Tower in Donaghadee in Co. Down. \n  \nAnd of local interest, he also visits the water treatment works at Dungonnell Dam in the Antrim Hills. \n  \nJoe interviews Derek McKane of NI Water, who demonstrates the operation of the dam and takes him on a tour of the bewildering number of processes our modern water supply has to undergo before it is deemed fit for human consumption. \n  \n“After watching this you’ll never take tap water for granted again!” Joe promises.\n  \nCivil engineer Alan Cooper then directs our attention to the innovative construction of the actual dam itself – the first to be built using asphalt, and employing many of the same construction methods you would find in road-building! Alan rounds off with some insights into the general history of dam-building in this country and relates how civil engineering has developed its own code of ethics over the 200 years since the foundation of the Institution of Civil Engineers.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921285.jpg--.jpg?1534232428000\n","title":"estelle in the frame for spectacle wearer of year win","story":"  \nA Ballymena woman has been chosen from thousands of proud glasses wearers as a finalist for Specsavers’ Spectacle Wearer of the Year.\n  \nEstelle Wallace, shortlisted in the 45 – 59 age category from Rasharkin could follow in the footsteps of last year’s Award winner, Love Island hunk Alex Miller, winning \u0026pound10,000 and the chance to mingle with the stars at the annual awards. \n  \nGlasses wearers across the UK and Republic of Ireland have been showing off their specs style by sharing their selfies online.\n  \nEstelle, who is a health and wellness coach, was invited to visit her local Specsavers store in Fairhill Shopping Centre to receive a bottle of champagne, a certificate and a \u0026pound125 glasses voucher.\n  \nEstelle said: “I was really delighted to be shortlisted as a regional finalist.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInterested?

Their actions made history but Dungannon’s pivotal role in the quest for social justice was soon forgotten as images of beaten and bloodied marchers on the Duke Street march that October grabbed headlines around the world.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nDungannon-born presenter Lynette Fay with Bernadette McAliskey during recording for Stories in Sound: In The Footsteps, due to be broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster this Sunday (August 19) at 12.30pm\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nBorn in Dungannon only a decade later, presenter Lynette Fay had no idea that people she knew growing up – her brother’s primary school teacher, and her next door neighbours – were among the organisers of that first march.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIn this Stories In Sound documentary for BBC Radio Ulster, she follows ‘In The Footsteps’ of those first civil rights marchers. She revisits the issue of housing discrimination and the ground breaking protests of the young mothers of the Homeless Citizens League, and learns first-hand about the organisation of the march from the so-called “Protestor Number One”. She hears from Bernadette McAliskey about how the march turned her into a lifelong campaigner, as well as from those who took part in a counter protest.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nUsing a blend of highly personal interviews and archive audio, Lynette asks what spurred them to take to the streets in pursuit of civil rights, whether or not they achieved their aims – and at what cost. Fifty years on from that first civil rights march, how has Dungannon – and Northern Ireland – changed?\n\nIn the Footsteps - presented by Lynette Fay and produced by Freya McClements – is broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster on Sunday, August 19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602191.1534343875!/image/image.jpg","title":"fundraising in memory of elizabeth","story":"\nElizabeth Adams was an employee of Mountvale Private Nursing Home, Dromore for over 11 years, she was a work colleague but mainly a friend.  \n\n                \nAfter a short illness called Sarcoidosis, she passed away peacefully on January 15.

Since its formation in 1994, the initiative has sent over 2000 students from Northern Ireland to all four corners of the United States where they have successfully completed a year studying\n\nJonathan Stewart, Director, British Council Northern Ireland, added: “I am confident that the students departing for the US this year will be great ambassadors for Northern Ireland and will help to further important long-term links and connections. A recent report published by the British Council has highlighted that the relationship between the US and the UK is driven as much by cultural factors, as political with programmes such as Study USA supporting these links and strengthening them for the future. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Through Study USA, students will have the opportunity to not only enhance their employability skills but also develop intercultural skills, which will help them to prepare to work in a global economy. We wish them success, and trust that new connections and friendships will be developed in the year ahead.”\n\nStudy USA is just one of many international opportunities available through British Council Northern Ireland.

In addition, the company has faced an extremely challenging retail trading environment reflecting weak consumer confidence and reduced consumer spending. These factors have had a significant adverse impact on Homebase’s trading position.\n\n“After a comprehensive review, Homebase has concluded that its current store portfolio mix is no longer viable. Rental costs associated with stores are unsustainable and many stores are loss making.\n\n“The CVA enables Homebase to make essential changes to its store portfolio, reducing its cost base and providing a stable platform on which to continue its turnaround.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Under the terms of the CVA proposal, all creditors receive a better outcome than any other likely alternative.\n\n“It is anticipated that 42 stores will close during late 2018 and early 2019.\n\n“The proposed changes to the store portfolio will regrettably mean redundancies from those stores earmarked for closure. The process is expected to lead to a reduction of up to 1,500 roles, although every effort will be made to redeploy team members within the business where possible.\n\n“All stores in the UK and the Republic of Ireland will remain open for business as usual and this process will have no impact on customer purchases, outstanding orders or any product or service guarantees.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The creditors will vote on the CVA on 31 August 2018.”\n\nDamian McGloughlin, CEO of Homebase, said: “Launching a CVA has been a difficult decision and one that we have not taken lightly. Homebase has been one of the most recognisable retail brands for almost 40 years, but the reality is we need to continue to take decisive action to address the underperformance of the business and deal with the burden of our cost base, as well as to protect thousands of jobs. The CVA is therefore an essential measure for the business to take and will enable us to refocus our operations and rebuild our offer for the years ahead.”\n\nStephanie Pollitt, Assistant Director of Real Estate Policy, British Property Federation (BPF), said: “These situations are never easy as property owners need to take into consideration the impact on their investors, including those protecting their investors’ pensioners’ savings, as they vote on the CVA proposal. Homebase and Alvarez \u0026amp Marsal have, however, demonstrated best practice, engaging with the BPF in the process and therefore ensuring property owners’ interests have been properly taken into account. Ultimately, it will be for individual property owners to decide how they will vote on the CVA, but the proposal has sought to find a solution that provides a sustainable future for Homebase.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8478809.1533901811!/image/image.jpg","title":"was speeding in hurry to get to work","story":"\nIn a hurry to get to work a 49-year-old man broke the speed limit in his van, Craigavon Magistrates Court heard last Wednesday.\n\n                \nAsen Asenov, whose address was given as Flush Place, Lurgan, was fined £75 for excess speed on May 30 this year.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThree penalty points were also imposed and he was ordered to pay a £15 offender’s levy.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFor having a defective light on his vehicle he was fined £50.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe court heard that at 11.30pm on the Portadown Road in Lurgan police saw a Mercedes Sprinter van with a Bulgarian registration travelling in excess of the 40mph speed limit.\n\nThey followed the van for a distance of over half a mile and to keep up they were doing between 60mph and 65mph.\n\nPolice also noticed that the right rear side light was not working.\n\nThrough an interpreter Asenov said he had been rushing that day.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe explained that he had already received a warning about his job and he didn’t want to be late.

As the years went on they became less and less involved, but they were still on our board of directors for a number of years.\n“As time went on we became more secular and we didn’t have that relationship with the Church anymore. But we’re still very grateful for them for setting it up and for identifying the huge need for counselling and support in this area, I suppose because Ardoyne was hit so hard by the conflict.\n“The Passionists worked tirelessly, and I remember sister Kathleen constantly bringing funders into a room and saying ‘You have got to fund this.’ Because there was very little funding in the early days she worked extremely hard to get us established, funded and working.\n“We have grown considerably, and we now deliver about 12,000 to 13,000 sessions a year to about 2,500 people. As well as operating from this site, we also work in a range of local schools and community venues. If someone wants to be seen or needs help somewhere else we can do that too.”\nNorma continued: “Our clinical practice is excellent. We have just been awarded BACP [British Association for Counselling and Psycho-therapy) accreditation for our services. Most counsellors are individually accredited by the BACP, but very few organisations carry the accreditation. We are one of only six in Northern Ireland to be accredited this year.”\nWith a degree in psychology and a professional background in both therapy and conflict resolution, Norma said that New Life felt like a place where she could make a difference.\nIn the past, she has worked at New Life as a sessional counsellor and her experience in play therapy has allowed her to help children and adults alike. New Life is one of the few organisations in the north that offers child and family therapy – services that Norma insists are vital for North Belfast.\n“I think in this area you are working with generations of people who have had things really difficult,” she said.\n“Personal safety was at risk throughout the Troubles and the area has grown up with generations and generations of high unemployment. Poverty, conflict and trauma have a huge impact, not just psychologically, but on a cellular level it impacts people physically.\n“Poverty also has a huge impact on children’s education and a number of different things, so we’re working with multiple issues for a lot of families and they are trying really hard to overcome those things. It has a massive impact on people’s self-esteem, so it’s almost a vicious cycle.”\nShe continued: “There is a lot of research that has come out recently into adverse experience in childhood and the impact that those have on physical health, mental health, and educational achievement. The aim is to try to tackle things early. I think that’s why we believe that child therapy is so important, because you’ve got to be working with children from an early age to begin to address their issues early on.\n“If you don’t catch certain things in childhood, sometimes you’re working with very difficult teenage years because it’s harder to intervene. Sometimes those teenagers will come back as adults and they will feel like they are ready to tackle the issue at that stage.\n“At any stage in life it’s encouraging to know that anything can be repaired. Our brains are wonderful organs and in many ways they have a great plasticity so you can address those issues, you just have to be motivated and have the right motivator to identify what that change might look like.\n“Not everybody needs counselling, sometimes a friend or a colleague or anyone you can connect with can transform things for you. Talking to anybody helps you and can help you, but counselling gives a framework and a focus for those who need it.\n“If you can catch people before they hit the crisis it’s much better. When you’re in a crisis your ability to think clearly, to support yourself or to act lessens, so it’s much harder to activate the changes you need. If you can get into counselling when you’re not in crisis then you’ll be able to change things more quickly, but counselling can really help. It helps you to clear your mind enough to realise what needs to happen next to take you out of crisis.”\nWhile New Life has come on leaps and bounds since it began, offering thousands of yearly counselling sessions, Norma admits that mental health charities, including New Life, need more support to effectively help those in need of support.\n“I think pre-Troubles we didn’t have nearly enough mental health services,” she said.\n“People were just in lockdown mode, they were just surviving. Since the peace process there has been a lot more services established. I think mental health services are still desperately underfunded in Northern Ireland given what we have come through.\n“For our service we have a six-month waiting list and sometimes it can go up to a year. If you need a counsellor it’s way too long to wait, but we don’t have the funding to deliver any more sessions than we currently do.\n“I think there needs to be more accessible services. People get fed up sitting on a waiting list and a lot can happen in that space of time.”\nShe concluded: “If you do need someone to talk to it’s important that you come forward. Young people, especially can access our services quite quickly so we would really encourage them to come forward.”\nIf you think you might benefit from talking to New Life, call 90 391630.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"75m rooftop running track plan for old belfast","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"celtic fan sorry for airport confrontation with novo","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself. I would like thank genuine Celtic supporter.”\n\nNovo was left fighting for his life in January after suffering a heart attack while starring in a Rangers legends tournament in Germany. The star received thousands of goodwill messages.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"former loyalist leaders sisterinlaw celebrates alevel irish result","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

interview with ITV News after a meeting with the Dutch foreign minister as part of a three-day tour of Northern Europe.\n\nWhen asked whether he was presenting the Government’s Brexit plan as “take it or leave it”, Mr Hunt answered: “No, but it is a framework on which I believe the ultimate deal will be based and I’ve been to several countries and met seven foreign ministers and am meeting more in the weeks ahead and I’m getting a strong sense that not just in Holland but in many of the places I’ve visited that they do want to engage seriously to try and find a way through to try and get a pragmatic outcome.”\n\n\n\nIt (no-deal Brexit) would be a mistake we would regret for generations, if we had a messy, ugly divorce and would inevitably change British attitudes towards Europe\nJeremy Hunt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked if the UK would make concessions regarding environmental and social legislation, Mr Hunt responded: “I think we have to see what their proposal was, some of those things can have an impact on the level playing field, some won’t.”\n\nDiscussing the risk of no proper negotiated deal he said: “It would be a mistake we would regret for generations, if we had a messy, ugly divorce and would inevitably change British attitudes towards Europe.”\n\nAsked to compare himself with Boris Johnson’s approach as foreign secretary he said: “I think the role of the foreign secretary is to go around foreign capitals and point out the implications of not getting a deal are profound in terms of our friendship and corporation with foreign countries across a whole range of areas.”\n\nMr Hunt went on to respond to reports that Brussels Brexit negotiators were concerned they were being bugged by British spies.\n\nOfficials had raised security concerns after the UK obtained sensitive documents “within hours” of them being discussed, according to the Daily .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Hunt is touring northern Europe (David Cheskin/PA)\n\n\n\n\nSabine Weyand, the EU’s deputy chief Brexit negotiator, reportedly told officials at a European Council working party on exit talks that “it could not be excluded” that British intelligence had penetrated their meetings.\n\nMr Hunt, when asked about the rumours, said: “I’m Foreign Secretary and foreign secretaries never comment on such matters but you are a journalist and you don’t have any trouble finding out what is going on in those meeting just like you have no problems in finding out what’s happening in our London meetings.”\n\nA European Commission spokesman told journalists in Brussels at a regular briefing: “The commission’s position today is that we cannot comment on this press report.”\n\nIt comes as Brexit talks resumed in Brussels between UK and EU officials.\n\nBrexit Secretary Dominic Raab and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier are not involved in the latest round of discussions, which are focused on the Irish border and future relations, and are due to finish on Friday.\n\nThe spokesman said: “As this week’s round is at technical level there won’t be a meeting between Michel Barnier and Dominic Raab.\n\n“We will confirm in due course whether a subsequent meeting has been arranged.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"new look windsor park ready for frampton showdown","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

He\u0027s been in the industry for 30 years and has worked in venues from Andersonstown Leisure Centre to Wembley Stadium.\n\n\"This is just another day at the office,\" he said. \n\n\"It doesn\u0027t matter whether it\u0027s in a leisure centre, the SSE Arena, here or in Wembley Stadium, all I\u0027m doing is putting the same facilities together, using the same people.\n\n\"I\u0027ve put a schedule together and worked it all out so we all know what to do and when it\u0027s going to be done.\"\n\nWhat is clear is that it\u0027s a collaborative effort from all members of staff at the IFA. From ground staff to directors, employees have had to adapt to changeable surroundings.\n\nThomas Fulton is the ICT project manager and usually works in a team of two at the stadium. Sub-contractors have been brought in to cope with technical demands.\n\n\"We\u0027ve had to put temporary scanning into two corners of the pitch, which adds a little more pressure to my job,\" he said. \n\n\"We\u0027ve also put in a wireless network to monitor how many people are moving on and off the pitch, while having visibility of how many people are coming through our turnstiles.\"\n\nDirector of sales and marketing Simon Fitzpatrick added that the increase in visitor numbers will be beneficial to the future of the stadium and to local football.\n\n\"This gives us an opportunity to showcase the stadium for future events,\" he said. \n\nIn a night that\u0027s set to place Belfast back on the boxing map, everyone at Windsor Park is hoping the dedication and hard work has been worth it. \n\nIt\u0027s now over to you, Carl.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

other religious and civic leaders in Dublin Castle on August 25 for a reception set to be attended by Pope Francis and Taioseach Leo Varadkar.\n\n\n \nDancer dazzled by invite to perform at papal concert\n \n\n\nIt is understood that the Catholic Primate of Ireland, Archbishop Eamonn Martin, will introduce the Moderator and other church leaders to the Pope.\n\nLater on, Dr McMullen and his wife Barbara will attend a concert at Croke Park, at the invitation of Archbishop Martin.\n\nPope Francis will be the chief guest at the concert which will feature 2,000 performers, including singers Andrea Bocelli, Daniel O\u0027Donnell, Nathan Carter, and the Riverdance act.\n\nNorthern Ireland will be represented by The Priests and world famous flautist Sir James Galway.\n\nThe Croke Park concert will end a busy week for the Presbyterian Moderator and his wife who will return to Belfast next Tuesday from an official church visit to Jordan.\n\nSpeaking from the Middle East yesterday, Dr McMullen said: \"As a Church we recognised that this Papal visit would bring great joy to our Roman Catholic neighbours and friends, and it was something we wanted to welcome.\n\n\"I am pleased that our church has been able to accept the invitation to the reception and I am looking forward to it.\n\n\"Should there be an opportunity to meet Pope Francis I would very much welcome that in the context of building good relations.\"\n\nThe Presbyterian Clerk, Rev Trevor Gribben, told the Belfast  last night that there was a broad consensus to welcome the Pope.\n\n\"We are a large church and there will be people who believe sincerely that this would be a step too far, on theological grounds,\" he said.\n\n\"A small number of people on our General Council made this point, but did so graciously.\"\n\nThe Presbyterian Church did not send its Moderator to meet Pope John Paul II during his visit to the Republic in 1979, but the Assembly Clerk Dr Jack Weir personally attended a Papal reception in Dublin.\n\nDuring the UK visit by Pope Benedict in 2010 the Moderator Dr Norman Hamilton attended an ecumenical service involving the Pope in Westminster Abbey, but did not attend a reception afterwards to meet him.\n\nHowever, Presbyterian Secretary Dr Donald Watts met the Pope during his visit to Scotland during that tour.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed top 10 baby names

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"presbyterian moderator hopes to meet pope in dublin","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass.

generations”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nThe Foreign Secretary said that failure to hammer out a deal with the UK would be “a big mistake for Europe”.\n\nHe insisted the Government would only sign up to a deal that respected the result of the 2016 election.\n\n\n\nI\u0027m getting a strong sense that not just in Holland but in many of the places I\u0027ve visited that they do want to engage seriously to try and find a way through to try and get a pragmatic outcome\nJeremy Hunt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Hunt had been criticised by Brexiteer MPs after an interview with ITV News on Thursday in which he appeared to play up the risks of leaving the EU in March without a deal.\n\nIn a tweet sent on Friday morning Mr Hunt said: “Important not to misrepresent my words: Britain WOULD survive and prosper without a deal… but it would be a big mistake for Europe because of inevitable impact on long term partnership with UK.\n\n“We will only sign up to deal that respects referendum result.”\n\nSpeaking earlier to ITV Mr Hunt had discussed the risks of no proper negotiated deal, saying: “It would be a mistake we would regret for generations, if we had a messy, ugly divorce, and would inevitably change British attitudes towards Europe.”\n\nWhen asked whether he was presenting the Government’s Brexit plan as “take it or leave it”, Mr Hunt answered: “No, but it is a framework on which I believe the ultimate deal will be based and I’ve been to several countries and met seven foreign ministers and am meeting more in the weeks ahead and I’m getting a strong sense that not just in Holland but in many of the places I’ve visited that they do want to engage seriously to try and find a way through to try and get a pragmatic outcome.”\n\n\n\"What we are seeking from these negotiations is a deep and special partnership\"\n\nForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt discusses \n#Brexit\n during a three-day visit to Finland, Latvia, Denmark and the Netherlands \npic.twitter/snRWdhlJS2\n\n— Foreign Office 🇬🇧 (@foreignoffice) \nAugust 16, 2018\n\n\n\n\nHe also revealed that the Government would consider EU proposals that demanded accepting European environmental and social legislation, in order to facilitate a free trade agreement.\n\nFellow Tory Conor Burns told the  that “the thing that we want to avoid for ‘generations to come’ is being locked into a permanent orbit around the EU where we end up with a deal but don’t have a seat around the table”.\n\nThe Danish finance minister on Friday echoed warnings that there is an even chance of the UK crashing out of the European Union without a deal.\n\nKristian Jensen said time is running out to strike a deal that is positive for both Britain and the EU, after Latvia’s foreign minister claimed the chance of a no-deal Brexit is “50-50”.\n\n\n\nWe need to move fast if we\u0027ve got to strike a deal that is positive both for the UK and EU\nKristian Jensen\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this week, Edgars Rinkevics said there was a “very considerable risk” of a no-deal scenario but stressed he remained optimistic an agreement with Britain on its withdrawal from the European Union could be reached.\n\nMr Jensen, appearing on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, was asked about Mr Rinkevics’ remarks.\n\nHe said: “I also believe that 50-50 is a very good assessment because time is running out and we need to move really fast if we’ve got to strike a deal that is positive both for the UK and EU.\n\n“Every forces who wants there to be a good deal needs to put in some effort in the months to come otherwise I’m afraid that time will run out.”\n\nHe went on to describe Theresa May’s Chequers plan as a “realistic proposal for good negotiations”.\n\n“We need to go into a lot of details but I think it’s a very positive step forward and a necessary step,” he told the programme.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"9 ribtickling witticisms for national tell a","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nIn the clip, writer and composer Aaron Alon breaks down the maddening inconsistency of English vowel pronunciations, and entertainingly re-imagines it as a phonetically-consistent language. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe seemingly tongue-twisting video took the 37-year-old American around three days to make and has gone viral, with hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube and a huge reception on Reddit.\n\n“My creative work is often inspired by interesting questions and hypotheticals,” Aaron told the Press Association. \n\n“The greatest difficulty in making the video, outside of remembering how to speak normally again, was probably that I aimed to make this with a zero-dollar budget.” \n\n\n\nComment\n from discussion \nbig_american_tts’s comment from discussion \"What If English Were Phonetically Consistent?\"\n.\n\n\n\n\nAaron, who lives in Houston, Texas, and recently directed an award-winning film musical, Bully, hopes viewers will take two lessons from the video.\n\n“First, I hope that people gain an appreciation for how difficult it is for non-native speakers to learn English, given what a linguistic kludge it is,” he said.\n\n“Second, I think that people often get weird questions and ideas in their heads, but dismiss them pretty quickly. \n\n“I’d encourage them to dig into those instead talk about them with friends, write a sketch, or make a video. \n\n“There’s a lot of creative fodder in the weird places to which our thoughts drift.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAaron Alon (courtesy of Aaron Alon)\n\n\n\n\nAlthough his main focus is working on plays and film, Aaron’s work dissecting the English language may not be over.\n\n“I’m considering working on something to do with idioms and possibly the Oxford comma (of which I’m a fan),” he said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch this baby sun bear enjoying hugs from their mum","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

Funding secured.\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) \nAugust 7, 2018\n\n\n\n\nThe interview offered rare insights into Mr Musk’s personal life and thinking. \n\nHe stood by his tweet last week saying he might take Tesla private and that he had secured the funding to do so.\n\nAsked if he regretted it, he said, “Why would I?”\n\nMr Musk has a reputation for being an eccentric visionary. But his out-of-the-blue announcement of a potential $72 billion (£57 billion) buyout of the publicly held company raised a huge ruckus and pushed Tesla’s shares up 11% in a day, raising the company’s value by $6 billion (£4.7 billion). \n\nThey have fallen back but remain elevated.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that government regulators have subpoenaed Mr Musk as they dig deeper into his disclosure of the potential buyout.\n\n\nInvestor support is confirmed. Only reason why this is not certain is that it’s contingent on a shareholder vote. \nhttps://t.co/bIH4Td5fED\n\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) \nAugust 7, 2018\n\n\n\n\nThat signals regulators are investigating if Mr Musk was truthful in the tweet about having the financing set for a deal.\n\nThe company did not comment on that report, but it did say it was forming a special committee to evaluate proposals to take the company private.\n\nThe newspaper said that in response to questions for its article on the interview, Tesla issued a statement from its board, excluding Mr Musk, that said: “We would like to make it clear that Elon’s commitment and dedication to Tesla is obvious.”\n\nIn the interview with The New York Times, Mr Musk said he fired off the tweet while on his way to the airport. \n\nHe said his reference to having secured funding referred to a potential investment by Saudi Arabia’s government investment fund.\n\nThe 47-year-old said sometimes he did not leave the Tesla factory for three or four days straight, and that he had not taken off more than a week at a time since he was sick with malaria in 2001.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry singer actor pays tribute

November 2018, with over 100 family friendly activities at more than 40 venues, stretching over eight jam-packed days.\n\nThe theme for this year’s Carnival Parade is Return of the Ancients, looking back to the Pagan origins of Hallowe’en which reach far back to the times of Cúchulainn and Fionn MacCool and beyond.\n\nLaunching the event, the Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District, Councillor John Boyle, said the gathering of witches perfectly conjured up some of the magical atmosphere which has made Derry Halloween renowned across the world.\n\n“I was delighted to see so many people donning their pointy hats and hopping on their broomsticks to join in the launch this evening.

Following the spectacular carnival celebrations and fireworks finale on October 31st, just when you thought it was all over, on November 1st the Walls will once again become the setting for First Light, which will bring the community together for a special celebration of light, remembrance and renewal.\n\nAdd to this story-telling, ghost tours, the Jack-O-Lantern Festival, the Monster Funfair, Little Horrors, Shape Shifter costume and make up workshops and the haunted Harvest Market, and you have the secret formula for the best Halloween celebration in the world.\n\nLooking ahead to the event, Festivals and Events officer with Council, Liz Cunningham, said: “Tonight’s gathering of witches gives just a hint of what’s to come, and really shows how much the people of the city have made this celebration their own. We are thrilled that so many wicked witches turned up for some fun this evening. This year we’ve extended our programme, making it our biggest celebration to date, and we just look forward now to showing the world how it’s done.”\n\nYou can find out more about all the spooktacular

continue, an annual Pride Festival.\n\n2018 will mark its 25th year during which time it has gone from strength to strength, with an ethos of continuing to supporting equality and the rights of those who identify as LGBT. \n\nThis year’s week-long Foyle Pride Festival begins Saturday, with the festival culminating in the massive parade which will depart from the Waterside Train Station at 2pm on Saturday, August 25.\n\nHowever, before the parade brings the festival to an end, there are a host of events people can attend as part of the packed programme of events.\n\nThe festival will kick off this Saturday with the ‘Gay’s the Word’ exhibition, featuring photographs celebrating Foyle Pride over the past 25 years, which will take place at the Ulster Bank building in Waterloo Place at 9pm.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200],
