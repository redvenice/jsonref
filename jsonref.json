Milk bars had been transformed into more modern convenience stores (pictured), but inside remained hints of what used to be          The Olympia Milk Bar (pictured) in Sydney was one of the most recent milk bars to close its doors - Mr Donnelly said it had remained unchanged for more than 50 years          The first milk bar was created back in 1932 and was based off the idea of the American Soda Bars but with milkshakes (pictured) as the main focus          Aged painting and decades old signage (pictured) were some of the things that drew Mr Donnelly to create his seriesGreek born Sydney entrepreneur Joachim Tavlaridis or \u0027Mick Adams\u0027 brought the idea to Sydney and opened the Black \u0026amp White 4d Milk Bar.The industry was once hailed as the most successful small business the country had ever seen.\u0027I was filled with sadness to find that my childhood milk bar had closed down - I always thought it would be there and that one day I could walk through the doors again and revisit my childhood,\u0027 he said. \u0027Sadly from the 1970s the decline of the milk bar started to slowly take hold, supermarkets trading restrictions changed allowing them to take business from the smaller family run milk bars.\u0027           Some stores had its original concept modernised (pictured) as it transformed into a convenience store, offering more options to customers  Scabby buildings dotted across the country was all that\u0027s left of what once was hailed the most successful industry in the country          Greek born Sydney entrepreneur Joachim Tavlaridis or \u0027Mick Adams\u0027 brought the idea to Sydney - opening up small shops like the one above          A quirky yellow milk bar was one to grab the attention of Mr Donnelly sporting a \u0027forgot what?  Milk Bar\u0027 sign on the fronty window           A dreary facade was all that remained of one of his subjects, with windows covered in graffiti and blocked out with white sheeting He noted how big business had slowly forced small stores into redundancy, with supermarkets and service stations pushing them out of the market. \u0027Milk Bars Service stations started offering the same items as milk bars with more convenience.\u0027\u0027Then the 24 hour convenience stores started to pop up all over Australian in the 90s.\u0027 \u0027Quite a large percentage of milk bars have closed down in this time, having been sold off and re-purposed as either cafes or residential buildings or knocked down.\u0027          Big supermarkets and service stations seemed unable to push one small store out of the market, with it still sporting bright blue plastic strip curtains          A large Fanta sign was written above the door of an old milk bar shop, which was complete with a rusty roof and chipped paint          Old milk bar signage in large vintage printing had been scuffed and drawn over the top of with graffiti          The sign for \u0027Macca\u0027s Milk Bar\u0027 was completely rusted, with some advertising having peeled away and others appearing newly printedHe recently launched a Kickstarter campaign to help fund the release of his book \u0027MILK BARS: Documenting the last of Australia\u0027s Corner Stores\u0027.Mr Donnelly hoped it would highlight an icon of Australian culture and bring back memories from people\u0027s childhood. \u0027Around 400 of the best images have been choose for The Milk Bars Book.

He’s got a very busy schedule I imagine.Asked why Harry seems so at ease with the competitors, he replied: I think it’s because he’s around military people. It’s hard to explain if you haven’t served. I think that’s why he’s so comfortable, he’s around like-minded people.After meeting Meghan for the first time he said: “She was lovely, like you see on the TV. Very polite and humble, so just great. She asked me what I was doing, how I was. She was cool, really cool, just like I imagined.Mr Ormrod, who lost both legs and an arm to an IED in Helmand Province in 2007, said he would be watching their big day on TV.He said: “We will be at home glued to the box watching it and wishing them all the best not just on the day but for their future together.

That makes him a lot different.“I couldn’t imagine living the life he has and having that of normality and being able to do that, he must be really grateful for that. We all just look in on that and are happy for him.Speaking about the surge in applications to compete at this year\u0027s Games, he said: I love it, the buzz is even bigger this year. It’s crazy. They’ve included the families now in the trial process as well, which is really important.‘The buzz is just great. It feels like five minutes ago that we were doing this for last year and I’m back here again and I’m just grateful to be here.What’s really cool is the first couple (of games) the focus was on all us Afghan vets and now the older guys are coming out and it’s growing the veteran family.

It is cheaper than an egg donor and relatively unheard of.\u0027It still blows me away whenever I talk about it and I have to break it down into simple terms with explaining it to others,\u0027 Nancy, a fertility coach, said. \u0027Trying to explain IVF is hard enough, let alone telling people that our daughter had actually been frozen for 13 years.\u0027I had never heard of embryo adoption before then, it\u0027s not something that\u0027s overly popular, few people know about it and it\u0027s much less expensive than other treatments.\u0027Our embryo adoption process was under $5,000 which makes it so much more accessible to families because using an egg donor can cost up to $30,000.\u0027It baffled us, I had no idea how old the embryos were when we adopted them, I thought they would have been frozen for a couple of years, but she was created in February 2004.\u0027The success rate is 50 per cent with embryo donation, but with the first one we had transferred it worked and she became our Luna.          Nancy gave birth to Luna  in December via c-section after being in labour for close to four days      Nancy describes Luna as their \u0027miracle girl\u0027 who was frozen in time for a little over 13 years          Nancy and Chris started trying to conceive shortly before her 40th birthday. After six months without falling pregnant they decided to visit fertility specialists          The new parents are now trying to raise awareness of embryo adoption as another option for couples to fall pregnantThey kept hopeful even after a chemical pregnancy in 2016, which means she miscarried in the first two weeks prior to the foetus being detectable on scans.  \u0027No matter what happened, I remained constantly positive, I was determined that one day I would become a mother,\u0027 Nancy said.The pair found out about embryo donation, where embryos are donated from couples who have had a successful IVF cycle. After having their child, the IVF couple can choose to have their remaining frozen embryos destroyed, used for science or donated to other hopeful parents trying to conceive.\u0027Our nurse coordinator matched us with donors who had similar characteristics and were the closest match,\u0027 Nancy said.Princess Charlotte will make history once her new sibling...Children born after intensive IVF treatment may have a...Share this article\u0027Everything from their physical looks to their personal and health history, including things like cancer or psychological issues.\u0027We had three sets to choose from and the one we went for would give us Luna.\u0027It\u0027s weird that our daughter was here waiting for us both. We were warned it could take up to a year for us to be matched, but it happened within three months.\u0027After being implanted with the adopted embryo that had been frozen for 13 years, Nancy says she felt different straight away.\u0027It was incredible, it was like I knew I was pregnant and just had a feeling, I woke up that morning to take the test and it came back positive,\u0027 she said.\u0027I told my husband I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s real but it\u0027s positive, we were very excited and cautiously optimistic, but remained calm until we had tests done at the doctors.\u0027After the positive results were confirmed, Nancy had a \u0027blissfully wonderful\u0027 pregnancy apart from severe morning sickness for her first 14-weeks.

It might be his last word on architecture. There is the city – specifically Waterloo Bridge, the Houses of Parliament and the grimy lead-shot factory opposite the balcony on which he is working – and there is the ever-changing play of climate, atmosphere and light around them. The buildings are just a pretext for painting the sublime.Weather and waterlilies, haystacks, poplars and seascapes: Monet (1840-1926) is not an artist of bricks and mortar. And even after seeing almost 80 paintings linking him with architecture, I doubt anyone will have their mind changed on this score. Of course he is indelibly associated with certain cities – there are seven paintings of London, eight of Rouen and nine of Venice at the National Gallery – but the show’s premise is at the very least counterintuitive. What does Monet have to do with architecture? An early surprise is just how many different structures edge into his paintings. He paints a pitched fishing shack against a blustery sea near Le Havre and scarlet windmills cartwheeling across a flat Dutch horizon. One Parisian scene shows the side of an apartment block emblazoned with a massive advertisement, another centres on pedestrians milling along the stepped quays. A shadowy figure stands framed in a medieval doorway. Light filters through the sloping glass roof of the new Gare Saint-Lazare. In Giverny, in winter, the houses are like loaves of soft snow.So far, it seems as if Monet is drawn to them all purely as shapes, combinations of rectilinear or triangular forms subjected to weather. And many of these built structures conjure classic Monet – cottages shaped like haystacks bridge struts recalling stands of poplars or gondola poles. But it soon becomes apparent that architecture, both complex and primitive, offers Monet far more.The Pont Neuf in rainy smog is a study in the innumerable different nuances of taupe, grey and pearl. A red-tiled roof sharpens up the predominant green of a landscape. A tiny house is like an index to the vast scale of the surrounding countryside. Monet is always preoccupied by what the eye can take in of each scene, near and far, at the fullest scope and all at once. An early driver, he motored so fast around Giverny the mayor gave him a speeding ticket in 1904.Architecture is a constructive element, so to speak, in Monet’s picture-making. It might be a way of taking the eye into or around a painting. A vision of clifftops, sandy shore and the great opening blur of the sea is pinned together, for instance, by a little steeple. It is not much more than a circumflex, but enough to orientate the eye. And one of the most exhilarating works in this show, The Hollow in the Cliff Path at Varengeville, shows the eponymous path as a hot, dark gully leading to a tantalising glimpse of wild blue yonder. The sense of anticipation is intensified by a cottage high on the cliff, a kind of human surrogate that seems to see, and even to be looking at, what we cannot – the glittering sea beyond.The opening galleries are brilliantly selected to disrupt any conventional view of Monet’s evolution as an artist. In the early 1870s he is depicting windmills and Dutch houses, their gable ends traced in paint as stiff and thick as royal icing. And then here he is again, barely moments later, with a view of Amsterdam so hazy it’s nearly vanishing from the canvas and you think it’s all there, the substantial world transmuted into air.And then he jumps back, next decade, to lush strokes and oily accretions that build thick on the substrate and even, occasionally, to quite detailed cobblestones. His trajectory was never straight from old realism to modern abstraction. Subject always dictates style. Steam in the Paris stations is diaphanous damp sand at the new resort of Trouville is almost claggy the Doge’s Palace melts like golden butter.A notion, a recollection, an effect: his kind of impressionism does not deal in hard data. You couldn’t make an exact blueprint of the facade of Rouen Cathedral from any of the paintings in his great 1890s series. But you can deduce season, rainfall, the beauty of the circumambient air around the medieval structure above all, the passage of time.Monet worked variously in an empty apartment and a ladies’ clothes shop opposite the cathedral, for up to 12 hours a day. The effects were so fleeting – a colour, he said, lasts no more than three or four minutes – that he might alternate between several different canvases. At 8am the cathedral shimmers in lemon light but the streets around it are still in blue shadow. Later that morning the sunshine turns golden and the traceries have higher definition. At dusk, the portals fill with gloomy purple shadows.The angle shifts, the light changes, the focus pulls from one view to the next – in sequence, the paintings almost move.Monet compared the cathedral to a cliff. Architecture is nature by other means for him. Each subject is a structure on which to hang the memory of a gradual dawn, a glowing form or fog. That is what this marvellous exhibition reveals through its clarifying emphasis on one limited subject – that for Monet, the experience of seeing always comes first.And it is the same for the viewer standing before these ever-modern works. Rouen Cathedral, in rare loans from Belgrade and Cardiff, is translucent as fragile honeycomb or thick as rose and lavender blossoms, the surface muzzy and matt. In Venice, Monet floats on water. His cropping is so radical that the paintings put you right in the middle of the Grand Canal watching the buildings dissolve in the late light. What beauty there is in the art, the mind and surely the working days spent before the palaces and churches. People talk of the melancholy in the Venetian period, but it is not obvious to me. This late room is dreamily ecstatic.Boat-loaders on the Paris quays, the tricolour blur of fluttering French flags, the dark chimneys of the lead-shot factory on the South Bank: there are many unexpected scenes in this show. But no matter how erse, all are concerned with optical experience: the total effect on the eye, then the mind and memory. Each is a complete vision, not pieced together in fragments or details the very antithesis of architecture in that way.And from the Savoy, the bridges cross the Thames like the wooden structures over the pond at Giverny. Parliament becomes an apparition, its spikes softened by fog and dusk. They are all still there, the recognisable s, domes and towers, but not as stony structures so much as an ethereal stage for the ceaseless and ever-changing play of Monet’s art."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee204099e044de123a4bc85db11afe8356f0587d/0_410_6144_3686/master/6144.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=77f433c31b4b17f1281cb3ae5be18d05 2600w","title":"new centre point hoover building london luxury flats review","story":"Denounced as vulgar when they were built, these newly desirable London landmarks have been reborn as luxury flats boasting distinctive dimensions as well as chequered pasts“With Britain’s entry into the EEC,” barked an early 1970s advert, “Centre Point, London, offers an unrivalled opportunity to organisations with imagination to occupy this spectacular office complex.” How times change. Now, with Britain’s impending exit from the EU, the same building offers an unrivalled opportunity for iniduals wishing to spend £1.8m on a one-bedroom flat or £55m on a penthouse, the first of whom have been gradually moving in since last Christmas. A Crossrail station at its base will whisk owners from Tottenham Court Road to Heathrow airport in 28 minutes and thence to the new global opportunities promised by Brexiters.Meanwhile, nine miles west of Centre Point’s central location, the celebrated former Hoover factory, whose colonnaded art deco billboard of a facade merges ancient Karnak with American roadside industry, is also turning into flats. For there’s an entropy in the contemporary property business, its own second law of thermodynamics, which states that eventually everything becomes residential.These two white edifices, the temple and the tower, have something in common. Both were deplored by Nikolaus Pevsner, the architectural historian and postwar cataloguer of British architecture who made deploring into a one-man, quasi-nationalised industry. The Hoover, for him, was a “modernistic atrocity”, Centre Point “coarse in the extreme”. Both buildings, decried for their commercial vulgarity, have now inveigled their way into public and official affection. Spun around in the great washing machine of taste, both are now listed as buildings of architectural interest.Centre Point, completed in 1966, has a special status in cultural history, for the fact that it stood empty for years while its owner, Harry Hyams, tried to find the one big corporation that would take it at the rents he wanted. It was claimed that the developer kept it purposely unoccupied for accounting reasons, as he could watch his paper profits grow as property values shot up. Hyams, a publicity-shy man who once wore a Mickey Mouse mask to a shareholders’ meeting to avoid being photographed, took successful legal action against such claims, but empty his tower nonetheless was.At a time when, as now, there was seen to be a housing crisis, Centre Point managed to unify the Tory minister Peter Walker and the folk group Lindisfarne in opposing its sterile, antisocial pursuit of profit. The former attacked this “incredible scandal”. “Your madness is making a machine of everyone,” went the latter’s 1972 single All Fall Down, which featured the tower on its sleeve. Architectural reviews were more varied. Not everyone shared Pevsner’s scorn: some critics scented swinging London in its slender profile and zigzag rhythms. Neither Hyams nor his pipe-smoking architect, Colonel Richard Seifert, was exactly Mick Jagger or Marianne Faithfull, but you can see what these observers were thinking.It is indeed London’s most stylish tower, even now, when, in quantity if not quality, there is so much competition. Broad on its two convex faces and miraculously thin at its ends, it has the merit of changing in proportion as it appears from different parts of the city. It tapers towards the top, like a classical column. Its skilful and bold structure, by the engineer Wilem Frischmann, is worn on the outside, in the form of that zigzag lattice, precast with a concrete mix of almost marble-like whiteness. The tower occupies its singular spot with confidence and bravura, terminating Oxford Street and calling across Fitzrovia to its equally idiosyncratic contemporary, the BT Tower. It has presence, its mass energised by the design’s devotion to angles other than 90 degrees.Centre Point is the outcome of particular forms of talent, not all of them concerned primarily with beauty: Hyams’s as a developer, for example. It grew from Seifert’s special skill at working the planning system to his clients’ advantage, in this case giving the local authority a traffic gyratory system that they wanted in return for unexpected height. Seifert’s design partner, George Marsh, whose name is attached to a majority of the practice’s most memorable buildings, borrowed liberally from the great buildings of the recent past to give Centre Point its distinctive look. The profile owes much to Gio Ponti’s Pirelli tower in Milan, the expressive concrete to the mature work of Marcel Breuer. You can call it homage, or copying, but it works.Cynical and expedient though it partly was, Centre Point had architectural qualities – form, composition, detail, depth, light and shadow – that are hard to find in most speculative buildings, then as now. So it is welcome that it should be given a new life by the developer Almacantar and the architectural practice Conran and Partners in an updated version of Seifertian louche luxury. A pedestrianised open space, to the designs of another practice, Mica, will open in phases from this summer.The worst part of Seifert’s design was always the gyratory system that the planners saw as its main benefit, which, together with some wilfully mean pavements, made for an obnoxious and dangerous public space. The revamp loses some of the dynamism and distinctiveness of the old, but it’s preferable not to be asphyxiated and run over.The Hoover factory, now known as the Hoover building, never reached Centre Point’s heights of controversy, but when it opened in 1933 in the nascent suburb of Perivale, it was still seen as a dangerous manifestation of an arterial-road Americana that the Town and Country Planning Act of 1947 would eventually stamp out. Like Centre Point, it combines stasis and motion, with the venerable forms of ancient Egypt repurposed to attract the attention of drivers on the roaring A40.It, too, has been set to music, although more affectionately than Centre Point, in Elvis Costello’s Hoover Factory of 1980. “Must have been a wonder when it was brand new,” he carolled. And it has always been a delight, for its powerful horizontals offset by insistent verticals, for the exuberant ornament that plays off its solemn columns, for its absolute indifference to stylistic propriety, which allowed its architects Wallis Gilbert and Partners to throw Bauhaus glazing, expressionist corner windows and Native American forms into the eclectic mix. Its colours too: its sunny white concrete, the hopeful minty green of its steel window frames, the outbursts of red and rich blue in its glazed bricks.“One of these days”, as Costello sang, it’s “gonna be all the rage in those fashionable pages”. And here it is, its value enhanced by the shocking demolition in 1980 of the nearby Firestone factory, also by Wallis Gilbert and Partners, over a bank holiday weekend. (Its owners wanted to pre-empt the Firestone’s probable listing.) The Hoover building is now in its second reincarnation, having been taken over by Tesco in the 1980s. Its less glamorous rear buildings were replaced by a superstore that still stands. Its front, used for offices by the retail giant, is now apartments, laid out to the designs of the engineering and architecture practice Interrobang.The most interesting thing about Interrobang’s conversion, a light timber frame designed to minimise loading on the existing structure, is sadly not visible. It would have been nice to keep a sense of this, as if installing an inside-out Amish village in the old factory, but the conventions of the residential property market don’t allow for such adventure. What you get instead are flats of proportions and spatial complexity that come from their adjustment to the old fabric.There is some weirdness – the noise from the road and from Tesco deliveries means you mostly can’t open windows and have to rely on a ventilation system for fresh air – but the spaces are still livelier and richer than you’d get in a new building.Centre Point makes for nice flats too (as they should be for the price): long and slightly curving glass walls combined with the reassuring depth of the structure. This makes one grateful for the listing of relatively modern buildings, eccentric though the system sometimes is. As the rest of the planning system gets ever more flaccid, listing at least obliges architects to come up with non-standard designs and developers to pay them to do so.The pioneering engineer of Centre Point looks back on the London landmark’s construction and the new type of building it ushered inThe engineer Wilem Frischmann, now aged 87 and still working, was not yet 30 when he designed the structure of Centre Point in central London. He says the site was made so complicated by pre-existing sewers and tube tunnels that no one had thought it possible to build much more than a single storey there – “only some shops”. “When I grew up,” says Frischmann, “I was told you can’t build tower blocks on clay” – the stuff on which London stands – so he made a point of showing that you could. Frischmann’s method was to drill close-packed piled foundations into the ground (he inspected the holes himself, got stuck in one and had to spend the night there until it was discovered how to get him out). The tower above is then unusually light, using thin floor slabs and the system of external structural elements that are the building’s signature. Precast in Portland, Dorset, and trucked to the site by night, these enabled the tower to rise at a rate of a storey a week. Their concrete was exceptionally strong, and its steel reinforcement has not suffered from the sort of corrosion that often forces structures of Centre Point’s age to be demolished.Frischmann, a man unafraid to point out his achievements, is most proud of the glazed walls of a horizontal box that is a bridge between the tower and a lower block, over what was until recently a busy road. This, he says, is the first use of structural glass – panels that support themselves without the help of frames. It has become commonplace in sleek modernism since. How did he come up with the idea? “I just tried to do things differently,” he says.

Helen Mayo, resident of Upper Sweet Dog Lane, reports that her neighbour, Bob Honey, is doing weird stuff.Cactus Fields, a care home in the desert that has been deserted – summer 2016. A man takes out a mallet and kills three old people.Meet Bob Honey. He lives alone after his wife left him. A woman who concentred candy smells to her crevices offering him only her identity-infidelity and her abhorrent ascensions to salacious sessions of sexual solitaire. Bob doesn’t know what any of this means. Only that he thinks it sounds tough and grown-up. He now wakes up to the thrum of his throbbing thesaurus in search of ever more woeful whimsy, ever more aggravating alliteration.It wasn’t always like this. Previous he did other stuff. The hyper-reality of real estate, the pandering picnic of commercial waste. In 2003, Bob went to Baghdad to breathe the Muslim air, feverishly figuring the faeces of Iraqis would be flowing in the streets. There he met the Guineans, foot soldiers of the Bilderberg Group-funded Scottsdale Program, aimed at reducing the methane in the atmosphere by wiping out the sharting seniors who were prone to frantic, feral flatulence.The doorbell never rings. The doorbell rings and Bob answers. “Hi,” says an unmanly male man. “I’m Spurley Cultier. A jobbing, jotting journalist jizzing with journalust. I’d like to talk.”They talk and Spurley leaves. Bob thought back to the last time he felt like he wasn’t just doing stuff. It had been with Annie. They had met on a park bench. She may have been young. Too young. But Bob never bothered with those distinctions. Annie was airless with alopecia. For reasons known only to Annie, she decided to have sex with bouncing Bob.“You have a magical vagina,” he said, the sensation of Roman arrows careening chaotically within his skull. “Though I could do with a bit more Vietnam.”“Next time I’ll wear my moistest merkin,” she replied with tantric teasing.Whenever he felt these collisions of incubus and succubus, he punched his way out of the proletariat with the purposeful inputting of covert codes, thereby drawing distraction through Scottsdale deployments, evading the viscount vogue of Viagratic assaults on virtual vaginas.Three days later, while Bob is moulding his molecular mallet, a text arrives from Annie. A photo of a black dildo. He drives to Vegas and finds it lying on the pavement and takes it out to the sand where he subatomises it with Semtex. When he gets home, Spurley is waiting for him. The journeying journo makes notes about Bob’s monumental mono mentalism unaware Bob can decode the script by sacred sense. Next door, a helicopter hovers over Helen Mayo’s house, before helicoptering hellishly into the ravenous roof and incinerating all the insipid inhabitants into crispy creme croaks.“I guess I’d better leave,” Spurley shrugged. Neither man was that concerned about the conflagration. Bob left to do more stuff. Both with his marvellous mallet and without. On one trip back from brachycardiac Bolivia, he sailed on a boat with a drug dealer who later absquatulated alone into the varietal void.There was another ring on the doorbell that never rang. This time it was Sean’s editor. “We need to talk, “ he said. “The confluence of cosmic conversation,” Bob curlewed. “Thing is, this book just isn’t working,” said the editor. “Worse than that, it’s an embarrassment. Stringing together random words under the impression you’re a latterday Hunter S Thompson isn’t writing.”“How about I put some drugs stuff in then?”“Have you listened to a word I’ve said?”Bob believes Scottsdale has been infiltrated by Loodstar. Don’t ask. Unaware that only one person is still reading, he stops off in New Orleans to take seven tabs of litmus-red lysergic acid before heading to Florida. “Are you Annie?” he asks, having taken his magnificent mallet to 17 shuffling snivelling geriatrics.“No, I’m Anasmyrma.” Really, don’t ask. It’s not worth it. An operative pulls out a Magnum and shoots Bob through the head. Rarefied resins liquefied during a life languishing unloved were beginning to create new free radical initiation of polymerisation. Or, to put it another way, Bob wasn’t badly hurt.“You will still publish this shit?” he beseeched beggingly.“Cool.

Overall, today’s homes are the same size as those built in the 1940s, the research found. The figures are based on an analysis of 10,000 floorplans of homes built since the 1930s and taken from property sites such as Rightmove and Zoopla. LABC Warranty started its analysis for 1930s homes because of the lack of data available for properties built before then: “Whether they have been knocked down to make way for new housing developments or turned into student accommodation, there simply weren’t 10,000 houses available for us to analyse,” they said. The figures will add to the growing controversy over “rabbit hutch Britain”, with the boom in office-to-residential conversions, particularly of urban 1960s tower blocks free from the usual space standard requirements, resulting in a spate of “shoe-box homes”.The Guardian found one property in the centre of Croydon measured just 14.9 sq m, even though government guidance states that the minimum floor area for any new home should be 37 sq m.“We were also passed drawings of plans for an eight-apartment development in Archway, north London – in Jeremy Corbyn’s Islington North constituency – where two of the units measured just 13.5 sq m (145 sq ft). That’s a room measuring just 12ft by 12ft. The plans were rejected by the council. In 2014, researchers from Cambridge University found that, at an average of 76 sq m, the UK’s newly built homes were the smallest by floor area in Europe, some way behind the next worst, in Italy and Portugal, at 81.5 sq m and 82.2 sq m respectively. Danish homes were by far the most spacious, at 137 sq m, followed by Greece, at 126.4 sq m.Developers of modular homes, pre-fabricated cheaply in production-line factories, argue that micro-homes offer a solution to the urban housing crisis. One social housing provider in south-west London has pioneered factory-made units that are 26 sq m in size, which it says is suitable for single young people to rent while they save for a mortgage deposit.

But 30 years ago, when the author was growing up there, Canary Wharf was a wasteland. She tracks the shifts and asks: was it worth it?The house I lived in, growing up on London’s Isle of Dogs, was beside a huge gate and high walls – impenetrable barriers even to the naughty kids who wanted to explore the docks beyond. My friends and I remember glimpses of watery wastelands as we walked off the Thames peninsula that we all called “the Island”, on rickety bridges whose gaps and creaks featured in our nightmares.When, 30 years ago this month, Margaret Thatcher drove the first pile for Canary Wharf and promised a land of opportunity, those high walls came down. But by the time its celebrated pyramid roof was placed on One Canada Square in 1991, Thatcher had been ousted and the London commercial property market had collapsed. It was quite possibly the worst time to launch and, within a year, Olympia and York, the company charged with making the neoliberal dream of turning redundant docks into the reality of a gleaming financial citadel, filed for bankruptcy.But now, Canary Wharf provides as many jobs as the docks did when they acted as a linchpin between the City of London and the global trade of the British empire. Canary Wharf’s first building, the second tallest in the UK after the Shard, is now as much a part of London’s skyline as the Empire State in New York and the area, with a further massive expansion already under way, is now more Wall Street than wasteland.Yet the past three decades have not only tracked the boom and bust of the UK economy but have left the Isle of Dogs a microcosm of the social revolution that has changed the face of Britain. At the same time, the extremes of income inequality – from great wealth to desperate deprivation – have revealed social tensions that bedevil the country as a whole.My mum and sisters still live on the island and I go back all the time when the development first started, I had just gone to university and each holiday brought a new road network to negotiate and a new building site to discuss. I thought things could only get better for everyone living there, yet it took the surprise of Brexit to make me realise that the reality has been very different.Local deprivation levels are among the worst in the country and a sense of powerlessness, which may have started as a reaction to the unaccountable regeneration scheme, now seems more widespread. The transport, shopping and leisure opportunities might have been revolutionised, but for a surprising number living there, Canary Wharf appears just as impenetrable as the docks were when I was a child.Someone who remembers these times keenly is the Right Rev Nick Holtam, now the bishop of Salisbury. He was appointed to the local church in 1988 with an episcopal remit to try to improve community relations. Residents objected to the unelected nature of the London Docklands Development Corporation, the quango in charge of planning: there were marches and protests, one involving 60 dog-driven sheep and more than 150 bees.Holtam remembers taking his congregation to a special service beside Millwall dock. “For lots of people, that was new territory, but there’s an invisible wall now, isn’t there?” he says. “People who live round the edge don’t all feel as though it’s their space to go into and it feels quite smart and City and businesslike.”There have been enormous successes, of course, many of which were trumpeted in a special report commissioned by Canary Wharf to mark this year’s 30th anniversary. Canary Wharf Group has presided over the largest urban regeneration project in Europe, with more than 17m sq ft of London real estate providing the head offices for many global firms, from Barclays to Reuters. With 120,000 jobs, Canary Wharf claims to be the biggest single centre of employment in the UK.The change in the transport system has been even more remarkable. Young people at my old school on the island look at me like some sort of relic when I tell them that a 277 bus was the only form of public transport in the 1980s. It could take as little as 15 minutes or three times as long to get to my Saturday jobs in Poplar because of the way the bridge system played havoc on the roads. When the Docklands Light Railway was opened in 1987, everyone scoffed at its toy train driverless cars but, with a network that extends to Stratford and Woolwich in the east and Bank and Tower Gateway in the west, some 122 million people use it every year. Throw in, too, the underground lines: the Jubilee line opened in 1999 and, by the end of this year, a new east-west Elizabeth line station will be in place at Canary Wharf.Looking back, the regeneration was a help to me personally. I was the first in my family to go to university and during college holidays I got lucrative work as a temp in some of the office buildings sprouting up. Yet for many residents, such employment has been harder to come by. Now, just one-tenth of the people working in Canary Wharf are residents of the borough, Tower\u0026nbspHamlets.The larger companies moving in, such as Citibank and HSBC, may have taken advantage of the big business rate concessions, but they have tended to bring their staff with them. Jill Skeels has lived on the island for 48 years and describes the difficulties her daughter faced trying to get a local job. “I walked round the whole of Canary Wharf with my daughter, giving out CVs … never heard another word. So imagine how we feel. When you think of all what we’ve put up with and our kids can’t even get anything. I don’t think you’re bitter, I don’t think that’s the right word, but you just feel walked\u0026nbspover.”Years ago, talking to students from my old school about becoming a journalist, I remember one teenager saying she wanted to work in an office but couldn’t imagine getting a job in Canary Wharf. At the time, I think I brushed it off as one 14-year-old’s lack of confidence but it stuck with me and now I realise she wasn’t alone.Time and again, talking to people in bingo halls or community associations, it’s the older white generation who are angriest about the changes. Rich Gerrard is an ex-docker: “The people in this area feel that no matter what they do, it’s a plan that they ain’t part of,” he says. “We are in the path of a runaway train.”Howard Dawber, who has been managing director of strategy at the Canary Wharf Group since 2004, says much of the early anger was from people such as Gerrard who “wanted the docks back”. Very few middle-aged dockers got jobs in Canary Wharf, though one, Peter Wade, was appointed as the development’s first community development officer in 1988. He became a local cause celebre, a “poacher turned gamekeeper”.The Canary Wharf Group, which has gone through several changes of ownership and now belongs to the Qatari state investment authority and global property company Brookfield, has spent millions investing in community projects or offering in-kind help such as mentoring for schools.Insiders say the biggest barrier to those wanting a job in Canary Wharf is education. There is one 11-18 school on the Isle of Dogs, George Green comprehensive, my old school. When I left to go to the local authority sixth form college at 16 – not enough of us warranted the school running a sixth form – I was one of only two students to pass my maths exam at the first attempt. Yet, pre-league tables, I can’t remember anyone but the handful of us who wanted to do A-levels really making much of a fuss.Far smaller when I was there, the school prided itself on an informal approach – no uniform and often chaotic classes. One friend of mine, an undiagnosed dyslexic, remembers skipping classes to take the books home to learn the biology syllabus. It was a tough school in some ways, with discipline often an issue, but there were, as there are now, some brilliant, dedicated teachers. Now there is a far more systematic approach and a relatively new head, Jill Baker, who has introduced tougher disciplinary measures.Given these demands, it is little surprise that the teachers are grateful for any philanthropic support they can get from Canary Wharf and others. Ian Cullenbrooke, the assistant head, says trips and careers advice would be pretty much impossible without it.It is true that several George Green pupils have benefited from mentoring programmes run by firms in Canary Wharf and even impressive internships, all of which would be far harder to get outside London. Talks from local high-flying employees are popular, but the teachers recognise that while many pupils say they want to be a bankerlawyerjournalist, far fewer of them have a realistic idea of how to get there from where they now are. There are, though, still norm-defying academic success stories.Wafa Mohbubul is the school’s 17-year-old head girl and hopes to apply to read natural sciences at Cambridge. With 12 GCSE passes and a regular job looking after the elderly, she is currently deciding between a summer internship at Citibank or Morgan Stanley in Canary Wharf. The height of my Saturday job success was working for Marks \u0026amp Spencer in Marble Arch, which meant leaving the island very early in the morning to get there on time.As in the country as a whole, the biggest underachievers tend to be the white working classes. The reasons are many and complicated and Cullenbrooke, who recently taught in a comprehensive in Dagenham, saw the same trend there.Recognising that there are exceptions to any rule, he says: “Students who come from immigrant families tend to be more aspirational. You know their families have come here more recently. They’re looking for opportunity and you know they’re trying to move on and to try to achieve as highly as they can. I think that with the ‘indigenous’ communities possibly you find more entrenched levels of low aspiration.”Of all the changes on the Isle of Dogs over the past 30 years, housing is the most extreme and the thing most likely to cause a sense of despair. Once an area with the highest concentration of council houses in England, it is now one of the top 10 locations for foreign investors looking to buy London property.The difference is in the extremes: estate agent Knight Frank found that a majority of Canary Wharf tenants are from overseas and the area can still feel a bit empty at weekends. By contrast, the busiest part is still the ring of largely substandard housing sandwiched between the river and the docks, the road I used to live on.Fourteen-year-old Josh Holmes is angry about aspects of life on the island and many of the changes. He lives with his grandparents, single mum, aunt, uncle and two young cousins in a three-bedroom house near the school. “Looking at the current housing state, what they’re doing is building for the rich. They should be affordable,” he tells me. “Looking at these houses they’re building down the road from here, I’m not going to be able to afford them. My aunt’s not going to be able to afford them.”Again, high-achieving Wafa is highly unusual in liking her council accommodation. She was moved, with her parents and three younger siblings, to a four-bedroom high-rise after their last flat caught fire. “We were emergency rehomed – it was life-changing because now I see the island differently,” she says. “I love it now.”She has a view of the river from her bedroom and neighbours who include homeowners in the penthouse flats: “You’ve got many contacts, so if you’re from a very low-income family, you’ve got your neighbour who’s from a very high-income family and you can just relate and increase your network.”Howard Dawber suggests that planners are now recognising the downsides of housing policies, which, though incredibly lucrative for many, have failed to provide a big enough mix, a failure to “create the steps for people moving out of social housing into low-priced, reasonable private accommodation. We as a society need to look at that gap in the market”.Newfoundland, a high-rise currently being built with stunning views west across the Thames, for example, will have 700 new flats to rent with a gym and concierge on site. The 300-plus social tenants will be in separate lower-rise buildings in Poplar. This is to provide low-rise housing for families and to avoid the “poor back door” of some developments, but it still suggests a kind of\u0026nbspsegregation.Wood Wharf, set for completion in 2023, is a further sign of the relentless pace of change on the island. But I have rarely known a time when the skyline wasn’t filled with cranes.One woman I interviewed who works in the Canary Wharf Waitrose but refused to give her full name wants to move out of the area, partly because of the nonstop building work. She used to work in several pubs, but all were closed down and turned into lucrative private housing, she says.Local objections have stymied some new plans, however, including proposals to build 2,000 homes in 33-storey towers, plans that would have meant the loss of a garage and, more importantly, encroachment on to the Mudchute, the island’s biggest – indeed, only – large area of green space.The Mudchute, created by conveying silt and slurry from the creation of Millwall docks was one of the places I loved most growing up and residents obviously still feel the same way. People started to keep animals and grow food on the Mudchute when Canary Wharf was still a disused warehouse named after the islands that produced its fruit and vegetable cargo.A 32-acre green space was the site of a sort of riding school and some weirdly generous scheme allowed me and a handful of horse-mad girls to skip PE once a week and learn to ride. I was so proud of the subsequent certificate in secondary education in horse mastership that I kept it on my CV for years. It was also helpful when I found myself studying at Cambridge, in proving I had “posh” habits.The ramshackle place of my youth is a now a fully certified equestrian centre with prices to match. Yet entrance to the farm and fields is still free, partly financed by a highly successful nursery that offers wraparound care.The fight to call a halt to high-rise development, to say “enough” to any encroachment on this incredible green space and example of community spirit – founded in the 1970s and still going strong today – feels somehow in the same spirit as all that talk of trying to get the balance between life and work right in Wood Wharf. Vicky Strong, assistant director of the Mudchute, doesn’t live on the island, yet she understands local concerns: “When I look at Canary Wharf, I think it’s amazing – to have something so grand on your doorstep. I still feel it’s an exciting time for the Wharf, but I think it needs to stop now.”Canary Wharf is amazing. Every time I use the DLR, I marvel at the access it provides, not just to the shops and towers but to Stratford and beyond. The new Elizabeth line will make the trip to Heathrow less than 40 minutes. Yet, while the development has brought jobs and prosperity to some, the fact that poverty and deprivation have increased for those living on the island is astonishing. It’s as though the shadows cast by these feats of engineering have left such dark spaces that nobody saw what was happening inside.The Long Shadow of Canary Wharf, presented by Jane Martinson, will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4’s Archive on 4 on Saturday 21 April at 8pm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/922f0ee9b49f1d19443b76bb92f8e92ebc45f272/0_101_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=bd60b7ab7a76b489adf0b12e80fd52a9 1240w","title":"sinclair broadcast anchors us labor contracts","story":"Why would dozens of news anchors recite a Sinclair Broadcast group script? Because their contracts entrap themDozens of news anchors robotically intoned “This is extremely dangerous to our democracy,” after reciting what turned out to be a script by Sinclair Broadcast Group, owner and operator of 193 local TV stations. Dan Rather called it Orwellian, and many have asked in amazement: why would local journalists across the nation allow themselves to be used in such a demeaning way? The answer is clear to me, as a lawyer with decades handling cases involving low-wage workers: people need jobs. But the anchors may have an even more specific concern: an employment contract that doesn’t just bind but entraps them. Among other things, Sinclair contracts contain a requirement that employees must pay their employers if they leave their jobs before their contract terms end. For example, an employee making $50,000 annually might have to pay in the ballpark of $10,000 if she wanted to leave after one year of a two-year term. While it’s plainly illegal to impose a penalty on employees for leaving a job, the contract describes this requirement as “liquidated damages”. But such damages are allowed only in very limited situations, such as when an employee leaves a job shortly after receiving, at the employer’s expense, costly, specific, and transportable training. This is hardly the situation for Sinclair employees. Some states already limit non-competes: they’re unenforceable in California banned for low-wage workers in Illinois, and prohibited for broadcast employees in New York and, as of last week, in Utah. Many other states have active legislative proposals. And even where there is no statute, state case law typically allows non-competes only to protect the employer’s legitimate business interests (like trade secrets), and requires them to be reasonable regarding time period and geographic scope. Preventing a journalist from working for BuzzFeed or Facebook anywhere in the world seems, well, not very geographically limited. Sinclair is not alone in using contracts to reduce workers’ rights. More than half of private sector non-union employees can’t bring cases in court because they are subject to forced arbitration, sometimes even as a requirement of applying for a job. The furniture chain Raymour and Flanigan contractually slashes the time for bringing discrimination claims in half, with mixed results in court. One New York tutoring company had contract provisions requiring employees to waive their right to apply to unemployment benefits, and to indemnify the company if they applied and lost. Given the importance of an independent press, the Sinclair example may be particularly sinister. But the use of employment contracts to trap and exploit workers is a growing trend, including for low-wage workers, who may “sign” the contracts rapid-fire among a pile of papers in the HR office or among a string of touch-screens, and who often don’t receive copies of their own contracts. Worst of all, they have no real ability to consult with lawyers or understand what they’re giving up and they have no choice but to sign if they want the job. Companies that try to limit their liability by hoodwinking their employees into signing abusive employment contracts are taking advantage of the extreme power imbalance between an employer and a working person. People need to put food on the table and a roof over their heads. Abusing that fact to keep people tethered, and to steal away basic rights, is reprehensible. And as the disturbing Sinclair videos demonstrate, disempowerment of workers has an effect that pervades things we value in society – among them the free flow of information and journalistic integrity. What would help this sad situation? Ideally, federal legislation would outlaw some of these practices, including use of forced arbitration for workers. More realistically, states can take the lead, for example, by banning or limiting non-competes prohibiting shortened statutes of limitations for key workplace laws and requiring pre-hire disclosure of key employment terms in simple, accessible language, with adequate opportunity for workers to understand what they’re signing. State enforcement agencies can pursue violations of the laws that already exist, like the prohibition on penalties for leaving a job, and private attorneys can file lawsuits to challenge abusive contracts. High road employers – who realize that workers are their team and a key component of their success – can treat their workers fairly in their contracts, as well. Above all, workers and their allies can take the lead in joining together to unearth and combat these abusive practices. Teachers from West Virginia, Kentucky, and Oklahoma are rising up, seeking better conditions for themselves and their students. Workers at media companies have been electrified, too, organizing new unions in recent years. The Sinclair anchors spoke in unison delivering the company’s message. Maybe one day soon, they can take back the power and again speak in unison, this time delivering their own.

They believe this subterranean store of naturally heated water could be used to warm homes in the city. If the system proves successful, such water could then be exploited in other cities and towns across Britain, they say.The £9m project will initially involve drilling narrow boreholes filled with instruments to survey temperature, seismic activity, water flow, acidity and other variables to establish the state of the water in the rocks below the city. The aim will be to establish whether this warm water can be extracted for long periods to heat Glaswegian homes.“The rocks below Glasgow are crisscrossed with tunnels that were hewed into the rock by coalminers in the 19th and 20th century,” said Professor Michael Stephenson, the director of science at the British Geological Survey (BGS), which is funding the project. “Eastern Glasgow was once the location of some of Scotland’s busiest mines. These old, long-abandoned tunnels should now be allowing water to flow freely beneath the city.”Because the reservoir of subterranean warm water is now linked by the tunnels, engineers believe they will not have to worry that water will dry up at an inidual location when they drill a borehole.Drilling of the first test boreholes – at sites yet to be selected – is the first part of an initiative by the BGS: the creation of several UK geo-energy observatories. Where other observatories look up to the sky, these will monitor conditions underground, say scientists. One test system has been selected for Scotland: the Glasgow Geothermal Energy Research Field Site. A second has been proposed for Cheshire – where scientists want to study rock conditions to assess the possibility of using underground vaults as storage for heated water.“At present it is very hard to store energy and that is a problem when using renewable power plants – such as wind plants – which operate intermittently,” said Stephenson. “Our second borehole array, again crammed with instruments, would allow us to test the feasibility of storing water – heated by renewable power plants – and then releasing that energy later when it is needed.”Heating of homes is set to become a crucial issue, researchers have warned. The UK is on target to decarbonise electricity generation as a result of the growing numbers of renewable power plants. However, the nation is still heavily reliant on North Sea and imported natural gas to heat its homes. Combustion of these fossil fuels forms a substantial part of the carbon dioxide emissions which the UK has pledged to reduceto help limit global warming.“One solution would be to use the energy beneath our feet,” said Stephenson. “The temperature of the water that is sloshing through the old mines and in the rock layers under Glasgow is about 12C. That is not red hot, obviously. However, there is a great deal of water down there and by using heat exchangers we can turn that mass of lukewarm water into a moderate supply of very hot water which could be pumped into homes to provide hot water and heating in winter. At least that is the idea.” “Our underground observatory will determine whether it is feasible or not. It will analyse rates of replenishment, acidity, temperature and many other features. Based on that data we will know if we are on to a winner.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93b01a3bd8a98aec5dfea49833fe7d6f236e8ae2/29_49_1792_1075/master/1792.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=18a5facff2d7cd4b2b6199b59a92271c 1240w","title":"all women programmes female film makers on demand streaming","story":"Seasons celebrating women behind the camera redress the balance while showing that gender is not a genreWhich makes curated programmes such as Mubi’s current The Present Is Woman, the Woman Is Present season, however unideal, spirit-lifting. If anything, the broadness of its female-film-makers-only remit serves to underline the pointlessness of pigeonholing an entire gender. On the mainstream side of the spectrum, there’s Elaine May’s once-maligned buddy comedy Ishtar, an absurdly wild and woolly Hollywood bro-farce that has been critically rehabilitated of late. At the distant opposite end is Hungarian Márta Mészáros’s Diary for My Children, an aching, hope-streaked and unjustly little-seen study of mourning and coming of age in post-Stalinist Budapest. Selections in between run the gamut from a sensual, honey-slow double shot of shorts from French-Senegalese actress-film-maker Mati Diop to Kathryn Bigelow’s punk-rave-era sci-fi kaleidoscope Strange Days, a still-electric vision with only Ralph Fiennes’s extravagant locks to tip you off that it’s somehow 23 years old.There’s also Documenteur, a teasing, well-picked deep cut from French New Wave queen Agnès Varda. If you’re looking to further brush up on your Varda ahead of the imminent UK release of her Oscar-nominated documentary Faces Places, however, head to Curzon Home Cinema, which has a pleasing eight-film retrospective of her work on offer, including 1962’s seminal, swinging vérité character study Cleo from 5 to 7 her later, tougher, more fractured feminist masterwork Vagabond and Jacquot de Nantes, an utterly beguiling early-years portrait of Varda’s late husband Jacques Demy, tenderly made a year after his death from Aids.Curzon’s menu also highlights a modest playlist of films by women, though not one as ersely or inventively selected as that on offer at the BFI Player’s Women With a Movie Camera collection, which includes modern essentials from the likes of Andrea Arnold (Red Road), Céline Sciamma (Tomboy), Lucrecia Martel (The Headless Woman) and Joanna Hogg (Unrelated), but also more esoteric, rarely exposed finds such as Laura Mulvey and Peter Wollen’s theory-riddled 1970s mindwarp Riddles of the Sphinx, Sally Potter’s early experimentalist beauty The Gold Diggers and, of a more recent vintage, Anocha Suwichakornpong’s Kermode-endorsed By the Time It Gets Dark, a woozy meditation on art, activism and tobacco leaves.Finally, to Festival Scope, whose current, unsexily named Festival of French-Speaking Belgian Cinema, streaming until June, may not be gender-themed, but has a gratifyingly high number of strong female-directed selections. These include Amer, Hélène Cattet and Bruno Forzani’s visceral, bewitching psychosexual homage to Italian giallo horror, and a discovery in Rachel Lang’s short For You I Will Fight, a flinty, moving study of a female army recruit. Best of all, they’re all free to stream. So if you’ve never seen the collection’s most famous title – Chantal Akerman’s trailblazing Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du commerce, 1080 Bruxelles – a mesmerising study of weathered female psychology revealed through painstaking domestic routine – it’s never been easier for you to tackle it.Star Wars: The Last Jedi(Disney, 12)The all-slaying juggernaut makes its way to living rooms, and the harshly polarised debate over its merits can continue apace – though this agnostic thought it more idea-driven and visually dynamic than any of the franchise’s last five entries.Gook (Kaleidoscope, 15)You may have blinked and missed it in cinemas, but Justin Chon’s raw, funny, politically fiery Korean-American view on the 1992 Los Angeles riots is worth catching up with at homeThe Disaster Artist(Warner Bros, 15)Sexual harassment allegations against James Franco halted the mounting buzz for his Tommy Wiseau biopic – but even putting that aside, there’s not much to be gained from this japey stunt that you wouldn’t get simply from watching The Room.Stronger(Lionsgate, 15)Through no fault of his own, Jake Gyllenhaal saw awards hopes dwindle for this straightforwardly affecting biopic of Boston Marathon bombing survivor Jeff Bauman: his piercing performance, and that of Tatiana Maslany as his wife, deserve a second look.The Three Faces of Eve(Signal Hill, PG)A welcome Blu-ray release for this unavoidably dated but still-fascinating 1950s study of dissociative identity disorder in picket-fence suburbia, anchored by Joanne Woodward’s Oscar-winning double-somersault of a tour de force."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46fbdaa47632679136809b31330fc7b39ce7c1eb/0_685_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=364484e00162124aa03f5439ea792940 1240w","title":"john krasinski a quiet place emily blunt horror","story":"Nepotism alert: John Krasinski, the 38-year-old actor-writer-director, discovered the co-star of his new film, A Quiet Place, sitting next to him on the sofa. To be fair, though, the American’s wife is Emily Blunt, the Bafta and Golden Globe-winning British acor. A smart, stylish horror flick, A Quiet Place is Krasinski’s third film as a director, but he is best known for an eight-year stint as Jim Halpert in the US version of The Office. He and Blunt live in New York with their two daughters, aged four and one.A Quiet Place has a clever, innovative premise: the Alien-style monsters can’t see but have exceptional hearing, so the humans in the film have to be almost wordless. Are you someone who knows and loves horror films?No. Completely the opposite, which is crazy. I never was a big horror guy, because I was just too scared. That’s the truth. Then these producers called me one day and said: “Would you ever act in a horror movie?” I said: “I don’t know, I’m kind of a scaredy cat, but if it’s a cool idea maybe.” And they said: “Well, the idea is that this family can’t make any noise and you have to figure out why.” And I thought: “That’s as good a one-liner as you can get.”As part of the online publicity for A Quiet Place, you did a skit with your wife where you called yourselves, “The Krunts”. Are you going to regret coining that?Yes! I immediately regretted that – I’m not going to lie to you. I just wish I could do better for my wife, because we could have made Bluntinski, we could have done a lot of things. But Krunt is what comes out of it. I mean, just imagine if we came back to England and had a lovely estate, we’d have to call it Krunt Manor.What do people in Britain say about The Office?One of my favourite encounters was with a customs agent who said: “Are you an actor? What would I know you from?” And I said: “The Office, but don’t worry, the American Office.” Then, as he stamped my passport, he very under his breath went: “Well, I like it better.” And I went:“NO WAY!”You beefed up a lot for the 2016 film 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi. What’s the best part of getting into that kind of shape?I remember Matt Damon saying this and it’s true: you pick your kids up and don’t have back pain. Like nothing. You can pick them up, toss them in the air and not feel like you’re going to the hospital that night.Do you get the feeling that your wife has a preference either way?I don’t think she does, but I’m sure she wasn’t upset that I was in great shape.You’re about to be the latest incarnation of Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan in a new Amazon series. What’s your spin on him?Well, the whole thing for me is I’ve been a huge fan of Jack Ryan – I feel like he’s our James Bond. I mean, a lot less sex, but Bond nonetheless.So you want to play him with more sex then?No, I tried and they wouldn’t go for it. For me, he’s a character that I think resonates really well now: we’ve had so many stories about superheroes who can fly, superheroes who can shoot things out of their hands and I think to have a real person do heroic things is kind of a nice thing to put out in the world right now.You’re better qualified to talk about Paw Patrol then?Exactly, correct. That’s probably what I should do next: the reboot of Paw Patrol. That’s your headline: here comes the live-action Paw Patrol from John Krasinski.You have a reputation – in your roles and in press – of being a good guy, a gentleman.

The drama was relentless and for neutrals there was the bonus of seeing the contest descend into chaos after Jack Wilshere’s clash with Jack Stephens in added time.Yet Southampton departed with an empty feeling. They had teased their supporters with the rarity of a Shane Long goal and their pursuit of an equaliser during the second half had yielded a reward when Charlie Austin, who had entered the fray moments earlier, cancelled out Arsenal’s lead with his first touch in the 73rd minute.A precious point was there to be snaffled and, having ruined their first league game under Mark Hughes with a wretched collapse against West Ham last Saturday, that unfamiliar sensation Southampton were experiencing was a surge of optimism.Yet the speed with which it was replaced by despair encapsulates why their hold on their Premier League status remains so uncertain. They had been level for eight minutes when Dusan Tadic allowed Alex Iwobi to cross for Welbeck, who had just produced a contender for miss of the season, to rise above Cédric Soares and head home Arsenal’s winner. “At\u0026nbspthat point you need to have clarity of thought to make sure you take something out of the game,” Hughes said.There are six games left for Southampton, who are three points below 17th-placed Crystal Palace, and Welbeck’s second goal was the cue for a loss of composure from Stephens, who accepted the bait when he felt Wilshere nibbling at him. Wilshere was in full wind-up-merchant mode as Southampton attacked and the frustration was too much for Stephens to bear.It was a naive reaction and the way the centre-back lashed out left Andre Marriner with no option but to send him off. Mohamed Elneny would follow him down the tunnel – Arsène Wenger suggested Arsenal could appeal against the Egyptian midfielder’s dismissal for pushing Soares – but the damage was already done.“Wilshere should have been sent off,” Hughes said. “Jack Stephens has reacted to being pulled back for about 20 yards. It’s not correct but it’s understandable. But if you’re going to send Jack off, you have to send Wilshere off for bouncing up. I thought I saw a definite movement with his knee towards Jack.”Wilshere escaped with a booking and Hughes was left to reflect on Southampton’s failure to take advantage of opponents whose minds were elsewhere for long spells. The visitors began with a cautious 5-4-1 system, with the return of Oriol Romeu giving the midfield a steelier look and Long foraging on his own up front. Yet they had players who could trouble for Arsenal on the break and James Ward-Prowse had an early effort hacked off the line by Héctor Bellerín.The opening stemmed from an error from Shkodran Mustafi, who was an accident waiting to happen in the heart of Arsenal’s defence, and Southampton’s reward arrived in the 17th minute. Sead Kolasinac allowed Soares to squeeze in a cross from the byline and Long nipped in front of the motionless Mustafi to prod his second goal in 46 appearances beyond the exasperated Petr Cech.Wenger’s decision to rest seven players before his side’s trip to CSKA Moscow for the second leg of their Europa League quarter-final on Thursday demonstrated where Arsenal’s priorities lie. Their challenge for a place in the top four is all but over.However, they equalised with their first coherent attack, Welbeck conjuring a beautiful flick from Iwobi’s pass, the ball running into the area for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to elude Stephens and beat Alex McCarthy. Aubameyang’s sixth goal since his arrival from Borussia Dortmund settled the mood and Southampton’s porous defence was again exposed when Welbeck scored in the 38th minute. Iwobi found him and the striker sped past Stephens before seeing his powerful shot hit Maya Yoshida, whose punishment for turning his back on the ball was to watch it fly into the right corner.Southampton chased an equaliser, Long and Pierre-Emile Højbjerg testing Cech, Wesley Hoedt forcing Elneny to clear his header off the line. Long turned in Højbjerg’s wayward shot, only for the flag to go up for offside.Wenger introduced Wilshere in place of Reiss Nelson, who faded on his first Premier League start but a goal from the visitors felt inevitable. Soares drove inside from the right and Austin, who had just replaced Yoshida, converted his cross.Cech denied Austin a second a few minutes later and Southampton must have thought their luck was in when Welbeck turned Wilshere’s cushioned ball over an unguarded net. They were\u0026nbspwrong."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14aa8d65b66e38bc77e5ca477a561e81539f455a/576_28_2869_1722/master/2869.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=13f729e355feff7669cd0723ac4bc637 1240w","title":"chelsea west ham united premier league match report","story":"The life of Ray Wilkins had been celebrated with gusto in this arena prior to kick-off, from banners in the stands to flowers and a vintage No 8 shirt placed on the assistant manager’s seat in the home dugout. Both sets of fans had warmed to the glimpses of the former Chelsea midfielder and coach in action, beamed out over the big screens at either end, with West Ham’s support bellowing out their own admiration.The tributes were heart-felt and fitting. It was to the champions’ intense frustration that their team could not quite produce the victory that would have thrilled Wilkins from his seat just in front of the press box.He would have rejoiced in some of his favourites’ attacking play, particularly when they were dominant throughout a one-sided opening period, and enjoyed the frantic intensity of the last quarter, once the visitors had plucked parity from nowhere. But he would have cursed the reality that Chelsea’s campaign is petering out.This draw left Antonio Conte’s side 10 points off fourth-placed Tottenham Hotspur with six games still to play, the prospects of qualifying for the Champions League fading with each hiccup. The gap has widened this weekend, with Chelsea’s profligacy ultimately costing them yet again. Back when they had been dominant, the zest of their approach play appeared to have set them apart but chances were missed and a victory passed up. West Ham, six points clear of the bottom three, can spy safety.They had weathered the home side’s eagerness here and ended the match grateful for Joe Hart’s excellence in goal. Chelsea’s front three had seemed to feed off N’Golo Kanté’s energy through the centre, the Frenchman a frenzy of interceptions and short passes, cajoling Cesc Fàbregas into action at his side. Willian and Eden Hazard were a blur of movement ahead of them and, when they clicked, that combination sliced through West Ham almost at will.Some of their more intricate play took the breath away, summed up when Fàbregas slid a pass from deep to prompt a rat-a-tat exchange at pace between Hazard and Álvaro Morata, with the Belgian liberating Willian cleverly. Only Hart’s smart save with his outstretched left leg denied the Brazilian as he bore down on goal.It was a fine intervention so to ship from Hazard’s resultant corner, played short, felt horribly careless on the visitors’ part. Victor Moses’s centre was looped towards the far post and nodded down far too easily by Morata, in amid grounded opponents. César Azpilicueta duly flicked up and away from a dozy Marko Arnautović, dangling a leg weakly, with the Spaniard able to poke the loose ball into the far corner from five yards out. West Ham’s defenders had rather stumbled into the concession, concentration lapsing while they marvelled at Hart’s original save. Everything about their attempt to repel the corner had been slack.Other opportunities had been spurned but, while Hazard was on the move, Chelsea always carried real menace. Willian should have doubled the advantage in the hosts’ first foray forward of the second period, collecting from the Belgian’s back-heel to shimmy inside Mark Noble only to drag a shot wide of the far post. Morata, with goals in his last two games, had two ruled out here for offside, with his eagerness having edged him carelessly in front of the last man. With each missed chance, the visitors’ conviction that this might not prove another fruitless trip across the capital was pepped.West Ham’s threat had been sporadic – and invariably conjured by Arnautovic. One glorious diagonal pass from deep, summoned by Arthur Masuaku, had bypassed the recalled Gary Cahill early on only for the Austrian forward to collect rather than volley first time. The England centre-half recovered sufficiently to suffocate that attempt but would be culpable when David Moyes’s side plucked parity 17 minutes from time.Cahill’s header from Noble’s punt into the box was indecisive, neither a pass to a team-mate or a clearance, with Arnautovic quick to tear on to the loose ball and pull back his centre. There loitered Javier Hernández, only introduced three minutes earlier and a regular scorer as a substitute against these opponents, to fizz a shot inside Thibaut Courtois’ post with his first touch of the contest.It was a goal the locals had feared, scarred as they are by their side’s inadequacies over recent weeks, with Hart’s wonderful leap and fingertip save to deny Marcos Alonso an immediate riposte doing nothing to improve the mood of the majority. Everything thereafter was frenetic, from Kanté’s timely challenge on Arnautovic, bustling free of the home side’s backline, to another magnificent spring and save from Hart to turn away Olivier Giroud’s header. But West Ham stood strong. Chelsea’s season of missed opportunities is maintained."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bf511b8efc28f576ec540146749942cbc0501d7/69_0_2117_1271/master/2117.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3e1484ca0d2e2e5322681d3ca69b7785 1240w","title":"chelsea west ham premier league live","story":"An expert finish from Javier Hernandez and some fine goalkeeping from Joe Hart earned West Ham a valuable point at Stamford BridgeChelsea are booed off, which is a bit harsh.

Evra heads the corner clear.90 min There will be five minutes of added time.88 min Giroud’s towering header bounces up towards the far corner and is pushed onto the post by Joe Hart! It wasn’t quite as good as the earlier stop from Alonso but it was still high-class goalkeeping. 86 min Arnautovic almost wins it for West Ham! He flicked the ball one side of Azpilicueta and ran round the other before surging into the area. He was about to shoot when Kante appeared from the side to make a wonderful tackle. Arnautovic wanted a penalty but the referee wasn’t interested. Chelsea broke and Hazard’s low shot from a right angle was pushed away by Hart.Edit: I was wrong, it should have been a penalty to West Ham. Kante actually went through Arnautovic to win the ball, though that was only apparent after a few replays.80 min This is pulsating stuff now, with both teams trying to win it.79 min: Great save from Hart! Alonso turned on the edge of the area and hit a sizzling rising drive with almost no backlift. Hart flew to his right and fingertipped it over the bar. That was a brilliant stop.78 min Arnautovic, who has been outstanding in the last 15 minutes, skins Rudiger and hits a cross that deflects wide off Cahill.  78 min Chelsea make a change, with Pedro replacing Victor Moses. 76 min “The moronry of fantasy football teams is in a class of its own, I think,” says Charles Antaki. “We presume to be knowledgeable not only about form, fitness and statistical probability, but also on the tactical shrewdness of playing the various odds-enhancing jokers at just the right time, and so on and so forth. And were we but to know it, the leaderboard is composed either of very clever 13-year olds who can actually manage all of that, or of complete jammy beggars who get lucky every week. But I have Azpilicueta, hooray!”Yep. It’s a lamentable mess. Grown men and women panting furiously until they find out WHO GOT THE EFFING ASSIST. I hate myself for doing it, but I hated myself beforehand so it’s a no-lose no-lose really. And I’ve got Arnautovic, so.74 min The chance came from a mistake by Cahill, who headed a long ball across his own area. Arnautovic cut the ball back on the turn, and Hernandez finished like the expert he is.A goalscorer comes on as substitute and scores a goal straight away. It’s a brilliant finish from Hernandez, smacked low past Courtois from a really clever cutback by Arnautovic. 70 min Javier Hernandez, who scored some big goals against Chelsea in his time at Manchester United, replaces the disappointing Edmilson Fernandes.69 min After a mistake from Masuaku, Moses sweeps a left-footed curler just wide of the far post. Good effort.68 min A terrific cross from Moses is well cleared by the noggin of Ogbonna.67 min We know 1-0 is a dangerous lead - almost as dangerous as 2-0, the most dangerous lead in christendom - but there is no real sense that West Ham are going to score. I’m surprised they haven’t brought Javier Hernandez on. Maybe goals are overrated.65 min “You called Azpilicueta’s goal ‘Andrex-soft’,” says John. “It made me wonder if there’s a product placement bonus to be had from MBM-writing..?”What the Diesel L-QUAD Leather Biker Jacket are you talking about? 63 min Cresswell is unable to continue. He’s replaced by Chelsea fan favourite Patrice Evra.61 min Arnautovic really needs help. He’s playing Chelsea on his own. It’s a shame West Ham don’t have a proven goalscorer on the bench.60 min “Film director anatomy?” says Dom. “How about Stanley Cuteprick? Or is that just homoerotica?”I don’t know about homoerotica, but it’s a heck of an unlikely typo.59 min For the second time today, Morata has a goal disallowed for offside. This one came from Willian’s low cross, and... replays show it was again the right decision. Daft bugger, he’s in my fantasy team. (Yes, I have become a Fantasy Football Moron.)58 min Cresswell is going to try to run it off, though at the moment it’s more of a hobble.56 min Cresswell is in a lot of pain after landing awkwardly. The physio is on the field manipulating his ankle. 55 min Willian’s outswinging corner is headed over at the near post by Morata. That was a decent chance.53 min West Ham started the match fairly well but it has been hopelessly one-sided since Chelsea took the lead.51 min Another chance for Chelsea. Alonso’s low cross flashes past Willian in front of goal and is retrieved by Morata, who tees up Moses. He ks the ball into orbit from the edge of the box.48 min “Ian Copestake’s 36th-minute mentioning of ‘Brain de Palma’ made me wonder how many other celebrated directors might be typoed into a lesson in human biology,” says Mac Millings. “Venereal Herzog? Peter Jacksie? Alfred Itchcock?”47 min A decent effort from Arnautovic, whose low shot from 20 yards is comfortably saved by the plunging Courtois.47 min Willian misses an excellent chance, poking wide of the far post from 10 yards after a nice dragback from Hazard.46 min Noble is booked for pulling Hazard back.46 min Peep peep! West Ham begin the second half.Peep peep! That was an increasingly comfortable half for Chelsea, who played some classy stuff and then took the lead through a pathetic goal from Cesar Azpilicueta. West Ham look pretty toothless. See you in 10 minutes for the second half!45 min “I don’t think there’s another manager quite like David Moyes,” says Joe Harvey. “Can’t think of another manager where the teams, when they’re good, look like they’re winning in spite of him, and when they’re bad, completely look like they’re ignoring every word he says. How frustrating it must be to be a West Ham fan to hire someone so synonymous with long, slow, demoralizing failure.”Don’t take this the wrong way, but have you forgotten his 11 years at Everton?44 min West Ham have offered the square root of bugger all in attack. Arnautovic is far too isolated.42 min There’s been some lovely link play between Hazard and Morata - reminiscent of Yorke and Cole in their angles, movement and use of the dummy.40 min “In a non-Rooney response to Benjamin Park, if I may, I was far from expecting entertainment (after all I am not an entitled child), but I was not expecting such an assault of non-achievement on every level,” says Ian Copestake. “There was not a single element of satisfaction to be gained other than my need to watch it being ended by the ref’s whistle.”‘An assault of non-achievement’ is a glorious phase, and one I will be stealing at the precise moment you read this. 38 min The original chance for Willian - which ultimately led to the goal - came from some beautiful quick passing between Fabregas, Morata and Hazard. When they play at pace they can be scintillating.Hart makes a brilliant save from Willian - but then Chelsea score from the corner. It’s an Andrex-soft goal, with West Ham’s defenders half asleep as Azpilicueta pokes a volley into the net from five yards.36 min “Chelsea’s dominance brings to mind an observation made by the film critic Pauline Kael about the horror oeuvre of Brain de Palma,” says Ian Copestake with a formidably straight face. “In the end you want the tension to be broken by someone being killeda goal being scored.”35 min Arnautovic is getting no real support.

Atletico will be much happier with the result, as it heightens the chances of their finishing above Real considerably. Real had the chances to win it, Oblak playing superbly in goal for Atleti, and one assumed they would push on after Ronaldo’s brilliant volley. But, fair play to Atletico, they equalised soon afterwards through a well-worked Griezmann goal and could have scored again in the little spell after that. They weren’t really stretched by much of Real’s late pressure and will believe they deserve their point.90+2 min: Sergio Ramos steps up and that’s a fantastic save from Oblak! There was whip, speed, direction, the whole lot, but the one-handed stop is simply magnificent. From the corner Ramos flashes a header over at the near post! That is probably that.90 min: Here we go ... Real have a free-kick in a central position on the edge of the ‘D’ as we enter added time ...89 min: Hernandez is booked for a fairly rudimentary foul on Bale 15 yards inside the Atletico half.88 min: More cries for a penalty after a lovely Real move down the left ends with Vazquez going down, but he’s booked for a e. He probably couldn’t stay on his feet much longer. Marcelo made an absolutely glorioys backwards flick in the build-up.87 min: It is all Real again and a teasing Carvajal delivery goes beyond everyone, before Kroos sizes up a 20-yarder to considerable anticipation but bursts it by firing well over.85 min: Real ramp up some more pressure and Juanfran hacks away after Marcelo, alone beyond the back post, drills across.83 min: Vazquez is back on but it seems to me that Real have 10 and a half men for the final few minutes, really. He is clearly injured and it’s a bit of a risk to have him back out there.82 min: I’m not sure we will see Vazquez again and, remember, Real have used all three subs. Atletico almost capitalise instantly, Griezmann doing brilliantly to kill a ball stone dead down the left but then centring *just* beyond Correa. And yes, Simeone clearly fancies going for it a little more now ... Gameiro replaces Partey ...80 min: Vazquez is in pain again, this time seeming to have twisted his ankle by the byline, and requires treatment.78 min: Modric drills one wide of the near post and he has got straight into the game, as has Isco.77 min: Close-ish there though as Benzema, picked out by another good Bale delivery, can’t really get a good enough header in and a defender smuggles away. Then Bale himself arrives late to power a Carvajal cross wide and this might be the pattern of things now.75 min: Carvajal drills against a defender and Real are applying some pressure now, even if they don’t really look like breaking through again at the moment. Vazquez is down, possibly with a blood injury after colliding with Godin, but should be OK.72 min: Modric and Isco come on for Kovacic and Asensio, so the cavalry – bar Ronaldo – are now on.70 min: Griezmann shows wonderful feet to set Saul away but he doesn’t quite look confident enough to outstrip the defence and, more critically, ignores a pass to Diego Costa. He does eventually get a decent shot in, curling not far wide from 20 yards, but that could have been so much more. Straight afterwards Costa is brought on for Gabi and you sense Simeone will be fine with a point.69 min: Will Ronaldo’s absence be a psychological boost for Real? Benzema is excellent but doesn’t quite inspire the same dread. The home team have certainly gone pretty quiet ... is it time we saw Isco?64 min: Real make a change ... and it’s Ronaldo, more than a touch surprisingly, who is replaced by Benzema. Nobody in the Bernabeu seems quite sure about that and not least Ronaldo, who seems to have words for Zidane as he marches off.62 min: And another Griezmann sortie briefly takes him beyond the defence now, with Costa also free, only for a defender to block. What a turnaround this has been since Real scored.61 min: Now a change for Atletico, Correa replacing Vitolo.59 min: And all of a sudden Atletico could be ahead, Koke seizing onto a half-cleared cross from the right and striking towards goal from 12 yards only to see Navas save superbly. What a start to the half!Yes there is! Moments later Partey plays in Griezmann, who slips the ball to Vitolo and is then in place to slot into the vacant goal when Vitolo’s touch takes the ball away from Navas. Well!57 min: Costa looks for a split second to have got away from Varane but is delayed. He works the ball to Saul, whose cross-shot is pawed away by Navas. Is there life in Atletico yet?55 min: Real go in search of a quick second and Ronaldo is denied a tap-in by some desperate defending. Atletico could soon be out of this if things continue at this pelt.He does come up with a showstopper! Bale makes hay down the left and knows, if he stands the ball up long and deep, that Ronaldo will pull off Hernandez. He does, and the resulting volley, cracked low across Oblak, is absolutely textbook. Real deserve it.51 min: Hernandez fouls Vazquez in dangerous right-sided territory. Will someone have a crack? The angle is just a little wide so Kroos attempts a cross, but it’s cleared as far as Kovacic and the midfielder can’t make good contact on the volley. Shortly afterwards Vazquez loops a header to Oblak.48 min: Not a lot has happened yet, some early Atletico possession quickly giving way to the pop-pop-pop of Real passes.Can Real take one of their chances? Will Atletico make one of their counters count?In one of the world’s other top leagues, Arsenal v Southampton is winding down a little tempestuously and you can see how with our friend John Brewin:That’s the half, Real unlucky not to be ahead. Oblak has made two or three good saves, Marcelo has hit the bar and they should have had an early penalty. Diego Costa has come close to Atletico though and it’s an open affair. See you shortly!45 min: Koke nutmegs Carvajal neatly and wins a free-kick in the Real half. We’re close to a goalless first 45 here.42 min: Marcelo hits the bar! He cuts inside in trademark fashion, whips one with his right foot and it pings off the frame, Oblak parrying Carvajal’s volleyed follow-up away! Real could so easily be ahead by now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef96c6f495ce5fb93cb81f33b950f4b91bed0331/0_458_2125_1259/master/2125.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b905b2b7997b75091be0bdab2e5abfcf 2600w","title":"when stag nights go wrong","story":"A stag night used to mean a few drinks down the pub. Now it’s a test of masculinity fuelled by cheap airfares and alcohol. Sirin Kale hears about those who lost so much more than just a night’s memoriesReturning to his Ibizan hotel room, the stag notices that his best man is missing. Mike Rutter last saw Luke Rhoden when he put him to bed, after Rhoden suffered an adverse reaction to cocaine and ecstasy. Rhoden’s bed has been made. His shoes are lined up. Knowing instantly that something is wrong, Rutter begins calling his friend. As the call disconnects, Rutter turns around and sees the hotel manager standing in the doorway. His stomach rolls away from him, bouncing like a coin down Balearic cobblestones.“The last thing I said to him,” Rutter tells me, “was ‘Go to bed and sleep. If you need me, ring me.’ So that was the last time… yeah.” He trails off.After being put to bed, Rhoden jumped from a balcony. Observers described him as frightened and hallucinating. Police officers, apprehending him, pushed a plastic baton into his neck. Rhoden died. In 2016, a British coroner recorded that the cause of death was asphyxiation caused by the excessive restraining methods adopted by officers, as well as the drugs in his system.Back home, Rutter got married without his best man. “It was very difficult, to be honest,” he tells me. “It was a different wedding, let’s just say that.”For a long time, Rutter was haunted by the fact that he wasn’t there when Rhoden died. “I nearly lost everything,” he explains. “Bad depression. Counselling. There was a lot of guilt.”What happens when your stag do ends in tragedy? The loss spreads outwards, like a blight: contaminating everyone who comes into contact with it. “It takes a toll on the people around you. You end up treating people like shit. Wife like shit, kids like shit, everyone around you like shit.”All nine men on Rutter’s stag weekend have been affected. “Every single person in the group has struggled,” Rutter tells me. “To the point where one of the lads has moved to Australia. He just had to get away.”I first became aware of the horrifying trend of British men dying on stag dos when a girlfriend whispered in shocked tones of a man we knew who had gone on a stag weekend. By the time they went to wake the stag up in the morning, he couldn’t be roused. He was dead.To me, this seemed to be an astonishing and exceptional tragedy, but the more I researched, the more I realised that it was not. Although UK coroners’ courts don’t collate data on whether deaths are stag-do related, at least 30 British men have died in the past decade alone while on stag dos. Others have suffered life-changing injuries. And fatalities seem to be increasing: about a third of deaths over the past decade took place in 2017.Typically, the victims are men from tight-knit communities: family men, with partners or children. They have steady jobs and often play team sports. Many deaths happen overseas, in stag party hotspots, such as Budapest, Magaluf, Hamburg or Ibiza. Often victims don’t have travel insurance and fundraising pages for repatriation costs are necessary. “Bring Watson home to his family,” reads one. “An amazing guy deserves an amazing send-off.”The deaths I tracked fell, broadly, into three categories. There’s death by misadventure: often related to alcohol or drug abuse. Men die of heart failure after drug binges that leave them car-jacking vehicles, or they drink so much they die of alcohol poisoning. Balcony falls merit their own sub-category: typically, men try to climb back into their rooms while drunk. One Ibizan hotel, the Pisces Park, is notorious for stag-do balcony deaths – two British men died this way in 2015. The second category is death by suspicious causes, such as Rhoden’s death at the hands of police. Then there’s death by brute bad luck unrelated to stag-do activity: undiagnosed heart conditions, or blood clots.A covenant of silence, forged in party capitals around Europe, persists around stag dos. What happens on tour, stays on tour. But when men die on stag weekends, silence becomes codified into omertà. People don’t want to talk about the fatalities: interview requests fall on deaf ears.Sometimes, families are ashamed of the circumstances in which their loved ones died. “You don’t want people thinking bad things about your son,” explains one mother over the course of a tearful phone call.For others, the grief pounds as strongly as a new hangover. “I hate talking about Paul’s passing – it just makes me too sad,” writes the Racing Post columnist Steve Palmer, whose best man, Paul Bush, died on his stag weekend. Palmer sends me the column he wrote after Bush died. “Returning from Budapest with an empty seat beside me on the plane was a soul-destroying experience. I was due to get married just five days later, something I considered almost impossible… A week after the worst day of my life, came the best.”I make inquiries, pushing into people’s grief. As I’m writing, news breaks that a 29-year-old Scot named Liam Colgan is missing. Liam is his brother Eamonn’s best man and was last seen in Hamburg’s Reeperbahn district, an area popular with stag parties. When I speak to Eamonn, it’s been two days since Liam’s disappearance, and he’s returning home. He sounds weary.“I’m beyond worried,” Eamonn says. “It’s totally out of character for Liam to go missing. He doesn’t use drugs or anything like that. Obviously, he was under the influence of alcohol quite heavily, as anyone would be on a stag do. But for him not to have any contact with anyone…”Eamonn trails off, panic edging into his voice. “He doesn’t have his passport. He’s missed his flight.”Many cultures have rituals by which boys become men. In Brazil, male initiates to the Sateré-Mawé tribe plunge their arms into gloves full of stinging bullet ants. Afterwards, they are welcomed by the tribe, as men.Like the men of the Sateré-Mawé tribe, Brits are also expected to demonstrate their masculinity through the complicated and often costly ritual of the modern stag do. Dentist’s chairs – a game where you sit and have alcohol free-poured directly down your throat – were banned in the UK in 2010 as part of a package of proposals aimed at tackling binge drinking. However, they remain popular in many European stag hotspots. In 2013, a British man, Paul Tobutt, died at his own stag party in Benidorm, after playing the game. Sateré-Mawé men suffer trial by venomous ants British men endure trial by dentist’s chair. Both practices are likely to prove poisonous and painful.It wasn’t always like this. The modern British stag do as a performance of masculinity exploded in the late 2000s, with the advent of cheap airfares to European capitals – where alcohol is cheap, strip-clubs are plentiful and beer is super-strength. Films such as 2009’s The Hangover captured the spirit of this emerging phenomenon, and reinforced the narrative that a stag do isn’t a stag do unless something stupid or dangerous happens.“A generation ago, the stag night would have been the groom and some friends down the local pub,” says Dr Thomas Thurnell-Read, lecturer in cultural sociology at Loughborough University. Now, stag dos are a ritual of male friendship. “The stag passes from unmarried man to married man. The cultural urge to mark that transition causes all the hedonistic and ostentatious behaviour you see on stag weekends.”Reckless behaviour, as well as excessive alcohol consumption, is part of the tradition. “There’s this emphasis on ritualistically punishing the stag for this change of status. You humiliate him with fancy dress and make him get drunk,” Thurnell-Read says.Above all, the group takes precedence. “Being seen to not be drinking is an affront to the male-bonding ritual, to the idea we’re all in this together,” says Thurnell-Read. During his fieldwork in Krakow, Thurnell-Read witnessed men furtively tipping drinks into plant-pots, rather than admit to the group they didn’t want to drink any more.I want to know how stag do antics can devolve into dangerous behaviour. In a London pub, I meet 35-year-old Kit. He’s a veteran of more than 20 stag dos. “This is how people can die on stag dos,” he says casually. “When you’re in a group of guys, you regress back to how you were as boys. And there’s an amount of peacocking involved. You’re always egging someone on.”On a recent stag weekend in Hamburg, Kit witnessed a stag – dressed in a hamburger outfit – climbing a telegraph pole. “We’re chanting: ‘Have you ever seen a burger up a pole?’ So he’s like, fuck it. It’s 30ft and he’s pissed. Everyone’s chanting. Falling from that height, he definitely would have died.”Kit sips his drink. “But you don’t want to be the guy who spoils it. That’s why no one wanted to stop it being dangerous.”These often extreme stag dos offer up a romanticised version of male friendship but by contrast they also result in violence or injury. When masculine ideals are collectively being performed by groups of drunk men, it’s easy for things to go wrong.James Thorpe, 29, knows this first-hand. After breaking his neck on his own stag weekend in Magaluf in 2016, the former firefighter is now in a wheelchair. “I suppose a little bit of stupidity was involved,” Thorpe remembers. “We’d had a couple of drinks and saw some friends swimming and we were trying to get into the spirit of it, so we went for a swim. I’m not quite sure if I tripped or ed – I can’t remember. But I banged my head on the sea bed and broke my neck.”Luckily, a friend dragged Thorpe out of the water. “If they hadn’t found me within the next 30 seconds, I’d probably have drowned.”Since his accident, life has changed dramatically. “Day-to-day stuff is difficult. Getting yourself up is an effort getting dressed is an effort. I still have dark days, but I’m starting to get my independence back.”Despite everything, Thorpe would go on another stag do. “I haven’t changed my mind on stag dos,” he tells me. “They do have the potential to get out of hand, when you’ve got that laddish behaviour, a bit of peer pressure and showing off. That’s where they tend to go wrong. But I’d still go on one.” He laughs. “I probably wouldn’t return to Magaluf, though. Too many bad memories.”Messing around near water has proved fatal for other British stags. In 2015, 24-year-old Dale Joint drowned on his stag do after jumping into the water near moored boats in Salthouse Docks, Liverpool.“Until it touches you, you don’t really think about it,” his aunt, Gaynor Isherwood, tells me. “In one fell swoop, a night out ends up with this. It’s hard to take in.” After Joint died, Isherwood says, she felt like she’d been hit by a bus – and finally understood what that metaphor means. “He was just larking around with his mates.”Isherwood feels that not enough has been done to prevent similar accidents taking place at the docks. After we speak, I go online. “The recently renovated Albert Dock area is an ideal place to start any stag night out,” I read.Not all deaths are down to drunken misadventure. Sometimes, nefarious or criminal factors are at work. “Being in a foreign city tends to make people vulnerable,” Thurnell-Read says. “Especially if you’re in fancy dress. You’re very obvious. If anyone wants to mug or attack some foreigners, they stand out.”When men die on stag dos, it’s easy for them to be victim-blamed. No Ibizan civil guard officers have been charged with Rhoden’s unlawful killing. “They kicked it under the carpet,” Luke’s father, Norman, tells me. “They said it was a done deal, an accidental death. People think: ‘Oh well, it’s just a stag do, he had too much to drink.’”Entire economies are propped up by stag-do tourism. When money’s involved, there’s a vested interest in the authorities downplaying deaths. Justice may be a long time coming, or may not come at all.I speak to David Swindle, a private investigator working on the case of Craig Mallon, killed from a single punch on a Spanish stag weekend in 2012. “Numerous evidential opportunities weren’t pursued,” Swindle explains. “There hasn’t been the level of investigation we’d expect. And there’s a wider issue about a lack of support by the British government for the families of murder victims abroad.”“I’ve realised that my son’s death was just a drop in the ocean,” Norman agrees. “There’s big money involved. And what’s happening isn’t highlighted enough. As quickly as it happens, it’s forgotten. It’s only the people who were around that remember. I’ll be chatting to people I know, and they’ll say: ‘My boy’s off to Ibiza… Oh, sorry I didn’t realise.’ That’s how quickly they forget.”It’s a brutal alchemy, when men die on stag dos: a life-affirming celebration combusts into death. Tough questions need to be asked. What is it about our society that requires men to perform masculinity according to rigid protocols that result in physical injury or worse? And why do we laud men for adhering to these rituals? I read one satirical article that sums up this approving spirit: “Prince Harry’s stag do likely to end in at least one death.”Liam Colgan is still missing. Eamonn returned to Hamburg to search for him. “The wedding won’t go ahead without Liam,” he tells me. “We have to find him soon and get him home.”While some search for their loved ones, and others fight the authorities for justice, for those left back home, life returns to normal – almost. “Everything changes. It’s a different life,” Mike Rutter tells me. “It doesn’t matter what you do. He’s not coming back. That’s probably the worst part.”Rutter is back at the boxing gym that he and Luke Rhoden used to frequent. For a long time, he stayed away. “I couldn’t go back. I’m back now. I’ve gone back to boxing, finally. It’s good.

Quakerism was founded in the 17th century by the dissenter George Fox during the years of Puritan England. The group’s meetings are characterised by silence, which is occasionally broken when someone present feels the urge to speak, say a prayer or offer a reading. The idea for the silent podcast first came from Tim Gee, a Quaker living in London, who was inspired by the BBC’s season of “slow” radio, which treated audiences to – among other things – the sounds of birds singing, mountain climbing and monks chatting. Gee said he had wanted to “share a small oasis of calm, and a way to provide a moment of stillness, for people on the move”.Jessica Hubbard-Bailey, 25, from the Nottingham Young Quakers, who recorded the podcast, said they had jumped at the opportunity to broadcast something “immersive and unusual”. She added: “We have very different ways of worship to most people of faith and we thought this was a really unique opportunity to give people a little slice of what the Quakers do. Also, we are really good at being quiet because we’ve made a practice of it and I think that is of value. These days everyone is so busy, everyone is working all the time, so it’s really valuable to have the opportunity to sit down once a week and just be quiet and listen.”Hubbard-Bailey, who was brought up as an atheist but became attracted to Quakerism for its egalitarian principles, said that the podcast had had a good reception, with nearly 400 uses of it. “I think that makes it the biggest Quaker meeting this year technically,” she said. “I’ve had one couple say that they’ve listened to the silence episode and are going to go to a Quaker meeting for the first time this Sunday. We’ve also had some people saying ‘oh, I’m not sure about this, seems like a bit of a waste of time’. But I think that’s really indicative of how we as a society view silence and stillness.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44bf52c3463457e906b39342c78ec9e72777bc7d/32_0_3437_2062/master/3437.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a6942c128f7437ddfb7a0a0bd423ae67 1240w","title":"uk government aims to streamline property sales with new measures","story":"Professional qualifications for estate agents and protection from gazumping among plansEstate agents will be required to obtain a professional qualification and disclose payments for referring customers to solicitors, surveyors or mortgage brokers under government plans aimed at streamline property sales.The measures announced by the housing secretary, Sajid Javid, will also discourage agents from taking part in gazumping, whereby higher offers are accepted after a deal has already been agreed.Promoted as a means of improving professionalism and cracking down on “rogue agents”, the reforms follow a consultation on how to improve the process of buying and selling property. There are about 20,000 estate agent companies in England and anyone can practice as an estate agent. Javid said buyers and sellers had been trapped in a stressful system full of delays and uncertainty for too long. “We will require estate agents to hold a qualification so that people are no longer at risk from a minority of ‘rogue agents’ and can trust the process when buying or selling their home,” he said. Mark Hayward, the chief executive of NAEA Propertymark, which represents estate agents, welcomed the commitment to further regulation. “We have long argued that estate agents should be recognised as professionals. This is an important step towards achieving this and we look forward to working with the government,” he said. The proposals from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government involve encouraging the use of voluntary reservation agreements to help prevent sales falling through and reduce gazumping.The new measures will also involve setting a timeline for local authority searches so buyers find the information they need within 10 days, and requiring managing agents and freeholders to provide up-to-date lease information for a set fee. An agreed timetable, it is hoped, will end the situation where leaseholders are at the mercy of freeholders and their agents.The government also intends to strengthen the National Trading Standards Estate Agency Team so that it can carry out more enforcement action, such as banning agents. Guides on how to buy and how to sell will be published to ensure customers are better informed about the process and know what questions they should be asking.

The neglect is now a thing of the past. This performance was at least its third professional outing in London in the last decade. The revival of interest tells us something about this ambitious piece’s enduring capacity to fascinate. But so does the earlier neglect. Mass is a problem piece for a reason.Actually, it’s for several reasons. There is the vast challenge of staging the unruly “theatre piece for singers, players and dancers”, which dramatises the crisis of faith in anguished times in music of many genres, all woven around the Latin mass. Nearly 500 are involved in Jude Kelly’s reworked 2010 production in the Festival Hall, with Marin Alsop again holding everything together. But Mass requires more than the enthusiasm of its performers. It is very episodic, uneven in musical quality and, culturally and politically, a period piece. Kelly’s attempt to draw modern political parallels overstretches it, and the relentless positivity of the evening cannot disguise the fact that Mass is a failure, though a heroic one.But it’s a blast, that’s for sure. And intermittently something more. Alsop’s meticulous commitment ensured utterly engaged playing and singing from the National Youth Orchestra, the Chineke! Junior orchestra and an array of far-flung young and adult performers, including a marching band. The Brazilian baritone Paulo Szot was tireless in the role of the Celebrant, who abandons his faith at the climax of the evening’s most dramatic scene. Mass is essential listening for anyone interested in Bernstein’s lifelong attempts to weave the popular and art music traditions together. One just wishes it was a more persuasive achievement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80c3cab9e4b3778b8061a5127f8d61aa522684d0/0_0_2763_1658/master/2763.jpg?w=2750\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55771385718cd1a0c19c8e99b6216ca3 5500w","title":"british jazz invasion moses boyd matthew halsall nubya garcia","story":"The UK is home to a erse, collaborative and newly confident jazz scene. We meet seven musicians whose innovative sounds are liberating the genre for new audiencesby  Kate Hutchinson. Photographs by  Antonio Olmos for the ObserverEvery so often, British jazz pops its head above the parapet, gets a Mercury nomination, and has a noodle on telly to remind everyone that it’s still there, like it’s always been, parping away from mainstream view. For many of us, jazz has seemed like something other people listened to. But in the past few years, the genre has had a serious overhaul. When Kendrick Lamar released his landmark album To Pimp a Butterfly in 2015, one of its most extraordinary aspects was its liberal use of jazz, which dovetailed with hip-hop and opened it up for a new generation. Not only did it immediately feel more accessible but, played by the likes of strikingly cosmic characters such as Thundercat and Kamasi Washington, it looked commandingly cool.In the UK, a new and thrilling jazz movement has evolved. As with Lamar, Thundercat and Washington, it is born out of fresh experimentalism, is reaching far younger, more erse audiences and doesn’t care for snootiness. Unlike in previous waves, these musicians are in their 20s and early 30s, come from erse backgrounds and, as with grime, have created their own community outside of major labels and concert halls. Their music, meanwhile, pulls liberally from other genres, whether hip-hop, neo-soul, UK club sounds such as broken beat, or from the African and Caribbean diaspora. And it’s not just at gigs that you can hear it but, much like in the acid jazz days, nightclubs too. British DJs such as Bradley Zero and Floating Points have liberated jazz for the dancefloor to the extent that it’s now not unheard of for a 10-minute Pharaoh Sanders odyssey to be spun on the decks to an appreciative, twentysomething crowd.Notable, too, is how prolific this wave is, with jazz musicians infiltrating summer music festival listings, signing to indie labels or taking their sound abroad. The sheer volume of talent is being recognised across the world. “Wherever I’m travelling, whether it’s in the States, Argentina, Japan, or all over Europe, everyone is talking to me about the British invasion,” says DJ and broadcaster Gilles Peterson, who himself helped usher in the acid jazz sound of the mid-80s. “I’ve had people talking about Courtney Pine and Steve Williamson in slightly hushed tones, but I’ve never had this before. They feel this is a very important movement.”The movement hasn’t just sprung out of nowhere. In London especially there is the sense that today’s jazz musicians have come up together over the past few years. They are collaborative, constantly threading through one another’s projects, and jamming together at a number of DIY stomping grounds, including the Church of Sound in an east London chapel and Dalston’s Total Refreshment Centre. South of the river, where much of the capital’s abundant scene has coalesced, music nights Steez and weekly Afrofuturism session Steam Down – recently attended by Kamasi Washington – are where players team up and try out new material. Broadcaster Teju Adeleye says: “The artists don’t feel like inaccessible superstars, they come to all the gigs and jam nights.”Adeleye is one of the new crop of radio hosts who are supporting jazz’s rising stars on internet stations such as NTS and Worldwide FM. “Having affordable spaces where people can go and experiment in front of audiences is important,” she says. “It fosters something genuine in a city where so much is driven by corporate ventures.” Also crucial are the jam sessions and artist development charities that have nurtured many of the new wave. These include Tomorrow’s Warriors, at London’s Southbank Centre, whose ethos is to support the development of jazz newbies, especially women and musicians of colour. It’s an ethos shared by Jazz re:freshed, Justin McKenzie and Adam Moses’s promotions company turned label, which has played a huge part in supporting new jazz, whether giving musicians a stage in the UK or overseas.Perhaps what’s most exciting, though, is the sense that this generation is wresting jazz from its gatekeepers and making it their own. With this scene, says Adeleye, “not everyone is classically or formally trained”, and as a result “there’s an accessible, anti‑hero energy that feels like sweet vindication for a music that should be for everyone, but has felt locked away and preserved only for a few. They’ve liberated the sound.”Soweto Kinch, an established saxophonist who runs Birmingham-based jam session The Live Box, agrees. “Genre boundaries are more fluid,” he says. “There’s less kowtowing to the jazz police.” The UK’s next-gen jazzers have an important confidence and it’s bolstered by the fact that their audience want to hear something original. It’s why Kinch hopes this jazz wave won’t end up being a wave at all, but will be here to stay: “It’s music of quality and of longevity it’s not disposable new music,” he says. Peterson agrees: “This lot are all doing original music, and that’s a really important sign. The last thing jazz needs is another version of Summertime or Feeling Good. Just make original music – that’s what people want.”London-based drummer, composer and producer, 26“I’ve been in Cape Town and people are talking about what’s going on here,” says Moses Boyd of the London jazz scene, which he has played a central role in shaking up and making new over the past few years. “In New York and at South by Southwest, people stop me in the street and show interest. It’s definitely a good time.”You can hear this very clearly in Boyd’s 2017 solo EP Absolute Zero, which fuses live jazz drumming with synthesised sounds and grime rhythms. Even his more straightforward jazz tracks have the potential to fill dancefloors. When he recorded Rye Lane Shuffle in 2016, Boyd sent it to his mentor Sam Shepherd, AKA DJ and producer Floating Points. “Before I knew it, Sam had cut a dubplate and was sending me videos of him spinning it across the world. Suddenly my inbox was filling with DJs asking, ‘Where can I get this?’ That was a big shift for me.”These days Boyd is surrounded by jazz musicians with a similarly open-minded approach to genre and process, but 10 years ago, when he started playing around London, things felt very different. “There was a big audience but it wasn’t really people like me. The jazz world felt very separate.”Touring with Soweto Kinch and meeting Gilles Peterson helped Boyd find his own way. “Seeing how Gilles used jazz in club culture, the dots all started to connect for me. I was like, ‘there is a place for the music I’ve been hearing in my head’. Because it’s easy to get disillusioned: maybe it’s just me, maybe I’m in the wrong country, maybe I’m some alien planted here. But gradually it started to click.”Another big influence on the current sound, Boyd says, is London itself and its vibrant sound‑system culture. “I think London is a unique place, a very culturally integrated place,” he says. “You walk down the street and hear 10 different languages being spoken and that’s not strange. That definitely seeps into the music.”Interview by Killian FoxMoses Boyd plays at the Love Supreme jazz festival, Glynde, East Sussex, 29 June-1 July London-based bandleader and saxophone and clarinet player, 33Shabaka Hutchings is easily one of the most interesting bandleaders of the past decade. He deals in shape-shifting sax and clarinet, but it’s his carefree approach to other genres that’s established him as a musical outlier who’s rattling rigid jazz traditions. His three projects, Shabaka and the Ancestors, Sons of Kemet and The Comet Is Coming – the latter a nominee in the Mercury’s “token jazz category”, he jokes – are peppered variously with calypso, dub, Afrofuturist beats and hat-tips to Sun Ra, Miles Davis and sweat‑soaked New Orleans party music.Trumpeter and Gondwana label boss, Matthew Halsall, calls Hutchings “the Kamasi Washington of the UK jazz scene” and it’s easy to see why. Hutchings – who is from Birmingham by way of Barbados, where he lived till he was 16 – is a similarly gifted brass player, has a commanding presence, and comes with a penchant for all things cosmic. He is also as ubiquitous, having played with the likes of mid-00s breakthroughs Melt Yourself Down, Ethio-jazz pioneer Mulatu Astatke and Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood, on the latter’s soundtrack for Paul Thomas Anderson’s film The Master.Hutchings is also helping to document the scene, and last month oversaw We Out Here, a compilation that spotlights south London’s rising stars. He gathered together Maisha, Ezra Collective, Moses Boyd, Theon Cross, Nubya Garcia, Triforce, Joe Armon-Jones and Kokoroko and recorded them over three days of jamming last year. He says of these musicians that, much like him, “the differences in the generation now and generations past is that it feels like young musicians aren’t trying to satisfy the standards that were set by jazz in the past. They’re just going, ‘What is the music that represents me today?’”This generation are bringing with them a younger audience, though it tickles Hutchings because, at 33, he’s old enough to remember “the time where jazz wasn’t cool at all. If you said, ‘I play jazz’, people were just like, ‘Oh no, that’s terrible’.” But he suggests that jazz will continue to innovate regardless of trends. Like punk, “it’s an attitude of, ‘Fuck it, we’re doing something that’s probably not going to be popular anyway’. Jazz is that music that no one’s expecting to go anywhere, and the musicians are just getting on with it.”Interview by Kate HutchinsonYour Queen Is a Reptile by Sons of Kemet is out now on Impulse!If there is a movement happening in the UK, says Sheila Maurice-Grey, then it’s not limited to jazz alone, it’s a “new wave of British culture”. The 27-year-old trumpeter and visual artist grew up in Vauxhall, south-west London, her mother from Sierra Leone, her father from Guinea Bissau and her stepfather from South Africa and Zimbabwe. She says that heritages such as hers – “this idea that I’m British, but I’ll never be classed as English” – is “what’s adding to the scene everyone keeps talking about”. She and her peers are changing things up because they are “taking from different aspects of their culture and making it a British thing”.Maurice-Grey was encouraged to pick up her instrument by the late Mat Fox, who as well as being her music teacher also ran the carnival band-style youth project Kinetika Bloco. She was inspired to hold her own masterclasses as part of Kinetika, called Bloco Lates, because “it’s important to always be aware of the people coming behind you”. Kinetika is also where the west African influences in her band, Kokoroko, have come from. She met their percussionist, Onome Ighamre, during a musical project in Kenya and the two were “complaining to each other that there are so many Afrobeat bands in the UK that perform for people that don’t look like us”. They decided to start a group to challenge that and represent “the idea of being young, black and British”.Yazmin Lacey didn’t exactly elbow her way into a career as a singer of smoky, soulful jazz music she had to be enticed. Growing up in a musical family in east London, she had a strong singing voice but never felt inclined to show it off. Shortly after moving to Nottingham in 2013, she let her guard down. “I’d had a lot to drink,” she laughs. “Someone persuaded me to sing. Then this girl came over and said, ‘Oh my gosh, I run this acoustic night, do you want to perform?’ I was like, ‘Yeah, take my number.’Gradually, while working at a children’s charity by day, Lacey built up a repertoire and a following. Performing at a night organised by Gilles Peterson’s Brownswood Recordings brought her to the attention of Future Bubblers, the label’s talent discovery scheme, and she was accepted on to the year-long development programme in 2015. It connected her with like-minded musicians and set her up to release an assured, richly melodic EP called Black Moon last summer. A second EP, 90 Degrees, is out on 19 May.Though her music blurs genres, including R\u0026ampB, soul, reggae and even garage, the 29-year-old feels especially connected to the resurgent British jazz scene – she cites Ezra Collective, Nubya Garcia and Shabaka Hutchings as inspirations. “I think there’s an undercurrent of everybody speaking their truth now,” she says, “and for me that’s what jazz means. It’s rebellion music, there are no rules. You sing from the heart, tell the stories that are real, say what you see, what’s going on in society. There’s a strength in that.”She finds strength, too, in collaborating with other musicians. “My guitarist said something that really stuck with me: when it was just the two of us, the music sounded so lonely and delicate, but play the same song now with a band and it sounds really powerful. That’s jazz in action: people connecting and talking about what’s real.” KFManchester-based trumpeter, composer, arranger and bandleader, and founder of  Gondwana Records, 34Manchester may be best known for its wayward rave days, but Matthew Halsall has more recently helped to put the city on the jazz map. A trumpeter from the age of six, he grew up in a mill town near Wigan and balances music-making with running Gondwana Records, the label he started 10 years ago to capture the cross-pollination of jazz with hip-hop, trip-hop, classical and electronic styles that was happening live on stage at a Manchester haunt called Matt \u0026amp Phred’s.The venue was a hub for acts such as the Cinematic Orchestra, hosting jam sessions where Halsall, now 34, was able to play alongside local A-listers including Nat Birchall, Jon Thorne and Chip Wickham. Inspired by their shared sensibilities, he began building his own collective, explaining how “all the early Gondwana releases were the same group of Manchester’s most interesting musicians performing together on each other’s records”.The sound they’ve developed references the ruminative approach of John and Alice Coltrane – but it’s also distinctively northern and, says Gilles Peterson, “beautifully delicate”.“Someone wrote that it has a ‘rain-stricken spiritual jazz feel to it’,” says Halsall. “It’s definitely different to the London scene. In some ways it’s more mellow and floaty. The people I work with are quite spiritual and into meditation, and a lot of them live in the countryside, so they are very chilled out.”Meditation in particular, he says, is “ingrained in the music”, Halsall having attended the Maharishi Free School in West Lancashire, which teaches a “consciousness-based education”. These days, though, he is “more interested in the exciting movement of a larger number of people”, adding that jazz has “always been greater than the sum of its parts”. It’s why he started the Gondwana Orchestra, an official ensemble of his regular players, who’ll be performing as part of the label’s 10th anniversary festival at London’s Roundhouse in October, alongside established minimalists Portico Quartet and north African‑inspired Norwich newcomers Mammal Hands, who have also recently released music on the label.Back in Manchester, Halsall says, there is a “massive demand” for jazz, with his early discovery and last year’s Mercury prize nominees GoGo Penguin due to play the city’s Albert Hall in November. And it continues to evolve, too. “The hip-hop scene in Manchester has brought in a lot of jazz recently, and when I go out on weekends it’s amazing now how many DJs will be playing jazz records.” Being a hometown hero, even an unassuming one in a flat cap and cardigan, does he get stopped on the street? “Yeah, yeah I do,” he says. “You wouldn’t think that was possible in the jazz world. But people are really into it now.” KHGondwana 10 is at the Roundhouse, London NW1, on 10 OctoberWhen Theon Cross was eight, his parents signed him and his brother Nathaniel up for brass lessons at school in Nunhead, south London. Nathaniel chose the trombone, and now he’s a prominent trombonist on the London jazz scene. Theon, meanwhile, picked up a French horn. Later he progressed to the euphonium and eventually, when he was big enough to grapple with it, a tuba. Now Cross’s tuba playing underscores some of most exciting UK jazz records of the past few years, including Rye Lane Shuffle by Moses Boyd and the last two albums by Sons of Kemet, as well as his own highly accomplished Aspirations EP from 2015.The largest and lowest-pitched member of the brass family may seem an odd presence on a London jazz stage – you’re far more likely to see it in marching bands or classical orchestras – but Cross reminds me that “the tuba was actually the first bass in jazz. When they were recording for gramophones, the tuba was the only instrument loud enough to be picked up, so they used it instead of the double bass. It’s been at the forefront right from the start.”Now Cross is making it a fixture of the new London jazz sound. “It’s an anchor for music, it’s got so much power,” he says. “I’m quite a reserved, quiet guy and I’m amplified by that instrument.” Recently he’s been playing with the London rapper Kano, who features a brass section in his live show. “When I come out at Glastonbury with my tuba, people are like, ‘What’s that about?’ But when they hear me doubling the bassline, they’re like,” – he widens his eyes and nods his head – “‘OK!’”Cross credits much of his success to good music teachers at school and free workshops around London supported by now-dwindling arts funding. As a teenager, he played with Kinetika Bloco, a youth performance group that runs a summer school at the Southbank Centre. “We’d be playing the Notting Hill carnival or Thames festival and marching for hours,” he says. This prepared him for Sons of Kemet’s frenetic live shows where he plays “intensely with two drummers for an hour and a half. That requires real stamina.”Much of the year ahead will be given over to Sons of Kemet – he’s just got back from playing with them in São Paulo – but he also needs to clear some space for his own music: he’s releasing a new single in October, with an album to follow around the end of the year.Clearly, committing to an unusual instrument has not served him badly in the London jazz world. “I’ve been lucky with the tuba,” says Cross. “I’ve always gravitated towards it since I was young. It wasn’t really a choice: I’d say the tuba picked me.” KFLondon-based saxophonist and composer, 26As one of the few female brass players at the forefront of contemporary jazz, Nubya Garcia is familiar with challenging expectations. “People do look at you, and it used to bother me a lot, but I’m trying to learn how to deal with it,” she says. “If you get comments like ‘Whoa, it’s so nice to see a woman on stage’ every time you gig, which I do, eventually you’re like, ‘Godammit!’ It’s not a negative thing, it’s just that person one doesn’t know that person 30 is also saying that. It’s just normal to me, but not normal to everyone else.”Garcia, 26, from Camden, north London, graduated from Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance two years ago and since then her career as a saxophonist and composer has taken off. She got back a few days ago from playing taste-making Texas festival South by Southwest, where she was a little unprepared for the demand. “This huge queue of people followed me outside to buy my vinyl,” she says. “I was like, ‘fuck, I’ve only got 11’.” That record was last month’s When We Are, a solo EP laced with jazz, gospel, neo-soul and the electronic touches she picked up under the tutelage of the jazzdance producer Floating Points. She has also soundtracked a current touring production of A Streetcar Named Desire and she’s part of spiritual jazz-inspired ensemble Maisha. And with Nérija, the collective she is in alongside Sheila Maurice-Grey, she’s just signed her first record deal with indie label Domino."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47c204947a9b3117a705e0e5d693490b93e33ee9/0_180_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=af49fb4721939ece37f3ee2242a664a4 1240w","title":"firms touted as top employers for women pay them less than men","story":"Almost half of companies listed as best places to work as a woman report gender pay gap greater than national averageAlmost half of the companies included on a list of businesses feted as the best places to work as a woman in the UK have a gender pay gap higher than the national average, exclusive Guardian analysis has revealed.Analysis also shows that more than four in 10 FTSE 100 companies, based on subsidiaries which were required to report, have a gender pay gap higher than the national average and nine in 10 report they pay women less than men on average.The figures were revealed as businesses published the difference between what they pay men and women for the first time on 4 April. More than 10,000 companies reported figures with almost 300 subsidiaries of FTSE 100 companies among those reporting. Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society said the gender pay gap was a complex indicator of inequality in the workplace. “Even good employers can have significant pay gaps,” she said. “What matters is their action plan to tackle it and deal with any inequality they find.”All companies and some public sector bodies in Great Britain, except Northern Ireland, with more than 250 employees had to\u0026nbspreport their gender pay gap to the Government Equalities Office. All companies were due to report by 4 April 2018.Commonly known as the average, the mean is calculated by adding up the wages of all employees and iding that figure by the number of employees. The mean gender pay gap is the difference between mean male pay and mean female pay.The median gap is the difference between the employee in the middle of the range of male wages and the employee in the middle of the range of female wages. Typically the median is the more representative figure, because the mean can be skewed by a handful of highly paid employees.“Women are afraid to speak up because they’re dismissed or made to feel silly. I spoke up, and got given advice by two separate senior people to stop talking about the gender pay gap,” she said.Most large companies, including many on the Times Top 50 and FTSE 100, reported multiple subsidiaries with more than 250 employees. The Guardian’s analysis is based on the subsidiaries with the largest reported median hourly pay gap as of 6 April. 13 FTSE 100 companies did not publish figures as they do not have enough UK-based employees to be required to report their pay gap.Companies on the Times list are self-nominated by submitting a 5,000 word report which is then “marked against a framework of best practice”.Five JP Morgan subsidiaries reported an average gender pay gap worse than the national average. In its gender pay gap report the company laid out a range on policies in place including recruitment and targets at VP and ED level.A spokeswoman for Business in the Community, which compiles the Times’ list, said it did not specifically ask about the size of a company’s gender pay gap, but focused on the companies’ actions. “Companies in the Top 50 have proven they are taking action to address inequalities such as fewer women going into certain industries, lower pay due to working part-time, or having taken a career break, as well as unconscious bias and discrimination, personal choice and corporate culture,” said a spokeswoman. “Of course, we want to see impact and culture change, and we would expect to see everyone’s gender pay gap improve over time.”Karen Gill, co-founder of Everywoman, which aims to advance women in business, said companies needed to take bolder action.“They are taking steps and they are making progress, but the things that need to change are not quick fixes,” she said. “That doesn’t mean they are not good places to work – or at least better than others – it just means they are not going fast enough.”If companies failed to take action, they would face the consequences, she added.“Women are going to use this tool. It’s a talent game, and they won’t get the best talent unless they deal with it.”Additional reporting Joseph Scott Davies and Giacomo Boscaini-Gilroy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e4a07efc6214bcbd69f8d19b37316e2d2571e87/137_0_5413_3248/master/5413.jpg?w=5250\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=784e45bc9fa4e87160287f679feb49af 10500w","title":"way of grief and park life fridays best photos","story":"The Guardian’s picture editors bring you a selection of photo highlights from around the world including Orthodox Christians marking Good Friday and reaction to a former South Korean president’s prison term"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e73503eacccd15bceab5b9e8ea8bde2b62893a1e/0_41_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=130efc13a017f3c3c35a6879ee068700 1240w","title":"a daft waste of time labour pours scorn on new centrist party","story":"John McDonnell and other senior figures dismiss plans for movement said to have secured £50mSenior figures in the Labour party including John McDonnell have poured scorn on plans for a new centrist political party that is said to have secured £50m from financial backers, including the multimillionaire founder of LoveFilm.The movement, spearheaded by the former Labour donor Simon Franks and revealed by the Observer, has been secretly under development for more than a year and involves entrepreneurs, philanthropists and benefactors keen to break the Westminster mould.There has been persistent speculation about the potential for a new party as Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership has taken Labour to the left, while the Conservatives’ approach to Brexit has alienated some on that party’s modernising wing. The Liberal Democrats have so far failed to take advantage of the polarisation.But the plans for a new centrist party were dismissed by Labour shadow cabinet members, with the shadow chancellor tweeting: “That’s a novel idea. A party of the rich, by the rich, for the rich. A party for the few not the many.”The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, said: “For goodness sake, what a daft waste of time. Anyone putting money into this nonsense would be better off investing in our campaign to restore and rebuild our NHS.”Jon Trickett tweeted: “A new political party with £50m in the kitty, no members, no rule book, no ideology. Perhaps with support from sections of the British Establishment. A plaything for the rich? Let’s focus on the task in hand: building a social movement which will change our country for good.”Other Labour MPs also reacted with disdain. The MP for Norwich South, Clive Lewis, describing the new movement as an “establishment reboot job” for a “failed ideology”. Manchester Central’s Lucy Powell said: “Sounds like a bad idea, over-hyped.”The plan was even criticised by the arch-Blairite Lord Adonis, who was among those who formed the Social Democratic party in 1981. He said: “Labour and the Labour movement is the only means to defeat Brexit and bring about a radical reforming government. Believe me, I was a founder member of the SDP: it failed and we can’t fail this time, the stakes for the country are too high”. The movement, the latest in a line of new centrist parties but the only one to have such substantial financial backing, is understood to have been drawn up by a group frustrated by the tribal nature of politics, the polarisation caused by Brexit and the standard of political leadership on all sides.It appears to have a centre-left policy platform that borrows ideas from both left and right, including asking the rich to pay a fairer share of tax and better funding for the NHS, as well as ideas on wealth creation and tighter immigration controls.Franks, a philanthropist and businessman, has set up a company, Project One Movement for the UK, which is likely to be the vehicle for the enterprise. It is unclear whether the project will concentrate on funding community activism or becoming a formal political party. Senior figures from business and charity are understood to be involved, as well as former supporters of the main parties, including a number of former Tory donors. However, it is not yet trying to convince MPs to defect.The project appears to be the most significant attempt yet to challenge the main parties, joining a field including the anti-Brexit party Renew and grassroots activists’ party Advance. However, Britain’s electoral system and the reluctance of existing politicians to make the jump make it difficult to succeed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d04c4cb7510a4bd9a8bec449f53425aeccee895/0_71_1731_1038/master/1731.jpg?w=1500\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7b51b0673e228ade28d936bf4081213 3000w","title":"how to give your kitten the purrfect start in life","story":"Eager to bring a ball of joy and fluff into your world? Get set with everything from advice on finding your feline friend and turning your pad into a puss-worthy palace to grooming and getting them ready for the outside world. They grow up so fast …Getting you and your pad kitten-ready need not be a drama, as long as you get to grips with just what they need to feel safe and secure. Understanding how young cats work is the key to making their transition from kittenhood to a much-loved family member as smooth as possible.“Do you need eyes in the back of your head? Maybe,” laughs registered feline behaviourist, Lucy Hoile. “But knowing how a kitten matures helps us understand their behaviour, which means fewer surprises (hopefully) and you can build a solid foundation for a lifetime of wonderful feline companionship.”Finding your new kittenIf you are responding to an advert for a kitten, there are a few pointers to be aware of to ensure you are buying from a reputable breeder.“Unlike dog breeding, there isn’t the same legislation in place for cats, so it’s best to ensure you can see the mother and her litter,” explains Hoile. “Expect to be asked a lot of information about your home setup – a caring breeder will want to know where their kitten is going.”Equally, most animal shelters have lots of unwanted kittens that need rehoming, so it is often a great place to start your search. Try the RSPCA, Cats Protection League, Battersea Dogs and Cats Home or Blue Cross for more information.Prepping your padInside, tape up any gaps that could intrigue your new kitten, such as that tiny space in between your washing machine and tumble dryer. “It’s incredible the tiny gaps your kitten can squeeze through, so better safe than sorry,” says Hoile. “Kittens are programmed to explore – they’re hunters by nature, so every new thing is an adventure. In these early weeks they have less fear than when they are a little older – they really are fearless.”You may also have noticed by now that cats can climb, so don’t presume your fencing will retain them. Kittens won’t be as strong, but they can still scale a decent height. Ensure you can keep your kitten in until they have had their first set of vaccinations (about eight weeks), before letting them explore the area around their new manor.Tip: Discuss neutering with your vet as soon as you bring your cat home – a female cat can get pregnant at around six months and an unneutered Tom is not an ideal family pet.Getting the right kitWhen it comes to shopping, less is generally more, but some specific kit is essential for settling in a kitten. “You do need to buy kitten-sized kit,” advises Hoile. “It may sound obvious but a high-sided litter tray will prevent a kitten from using it, the wrong-sized litter will be sore on a kitten’s paws and a food bowl that’s too deep will deter it from feeding adequately,” advises Hoile.As a starter kit you will need:“Buying a climbingscratchinghiding kit might seem excessive, but it’s not,” says Hoile. “Kittens climb, explore and want to hone their physical ability, if they don’t have something to climb they will shoot up your curtains, along your carpet, round your sofa … they’re programmed to train their bodies, so they need an outlet to do it.”Feeding“Kittens need to be fed little and often,” says Hoile. “Ask your breeder what foods your kitten has been used to and follow suit, making sure it is age and weight appropriate. If in doubt, ask your vet.”Myth buster: kittens and cats should not be given cow’s milk. “They can’t tolerate it and it’s a myth they crave it,” says Hoile. “Kittens and cats need fresh water in the wild they would drink from fresh running water, so they prefer to drink water fresh from the tap. Wet food is good for cats as it contains water – cats need water in their diet as they often have kidney and urine issues in later life without adequate quantities.”Worming and vaccinationsA responsible breeder or animal shelter will already have wormed your cat or will raise the issue of vaccinations with you.“Once you have your kitten, book a visit to your vet as soon as possible. Many vets hold kitten days now, they will check your kitten’s health and weight and advise on the worming, flea and vaccination programme. It is also a great way for your kitten to get accustomed to a vet’s visit. The more they are exposed to as kittens, the easier they will be to handle as adults.”GroomingGrooming isn’t just for a sleek coat, it also helps us get to know our cat’s physical shape and allows us to spot any health issues as soon as possible. Short-haired cats need grooming once a week to ensure the coat is kept free of dead hair and it helps you to bond with your cat. Longer-haired cats, such as persians, need to be groomed daily.“Otherwise, the damage to their coat and their skin can be devastating,” says Hoile. “Long-haired varieties very quickly get matted and this causes problems that go beyond just a matted coat – it can lead to skin infections and more.”House-trainingIf you get your kitten at between eight and 12 weeks, they will probably have been litter trained already.“Provide a kitten-friendly tray, with kitten-sized litter and ensure it is kept clean and accessible at all times,” says Hoile. “If your kitten isn’t using it, chances are it’s not big enough, not clean enough, or the litter is either a) too highly scented or b) too big for the kitten to rake easily.”Cats are very clean animals by nature. Once your kitten is old enough to go outside, move the litter tray outside during the day and, at night, leave a clean litter tray by the door.Going outsideYour kitten should be vaccinated before it ventures outside under supervision. International Cat Care recommends your kitten is four months old and also neutered before going into the great outdoors on its own. Most vets will microchip your kitten when they are neutered, before then a kitten safety collar with a name tag is a good idea just in case they escape – and it’s not the worst idea to keep a safety collar with a home address disc on, especially in these early days. When they are ready to go outside, monitor short trips into and around the gardensurrounding spaces.Tips for a (relatively) stress-free first-timer:Of course, not all cats love the outdoors, some are happier as house cats – if you’re unsure what’s best for your cat, speak with your vet.Whether they’re in, out or – most likely – all about, an energetic new cat needs food tailored to them. Royal Canin provides nutritionally complete, age- and breed-specific diets for optimum feline health "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4eb138382c40f5ef99e3ad5fa2111e7d65472c51/2050_515_2450_1470/master/2450.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a29aab7f02f647af0414e2b6f6d2d54e 1240w","title":"neuroscientist gregory berns studying dogs more enjoyable than studying himan","story":"Gregory Berns is a distinguished professor of neuroeconomics at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. His current work involves taking brain scans of dogs to probe what goes on between canine ears, as well as using scanning techniques to probe the connections within brains of dead animals, including the extinct Tasmanian tiger, the thylacine. In your new book, you say a dog’s brain is about the size\u0026nbspof a lemon… That’s probably for a medium-size dog, like a labrador. Bigger dogs generally have bigger brains, so obviously you are not going to get a lemon inside a chihuahua’s head.What’s the rest made of? Is it just\u0026nbspair\u0026nbspbetween the ears? You are not far off. There is a lot of air in the skull, especially in the\u0026nbspfront between the eyes and above the nose, there is a big frontal\u0026nbspsinus and then around the\u0026nbspsides it is all muscle.Why did you want to look at the dog’s\u0026nbspbrain? It was an idea in search of a question\u0026nbspinitially. But one of the first\u0026nbspthings that I wanted to know was, if we are looking at dogs’ reward system – in terms of parts of their brain that are critical for motivation and, if you want to be a little philosophical about it, pleasure and what they like – do they hang around us humans just for food because we feed them or is\u0026nbspthere more to the dog-human bond than that?You said that you see a reward response in a dog’s brain to human odours and that is evidence of something like love. Could it not just be\u0026nbspan association with food? That finding by itself could be association. But it is not just any human because it was only the smell\u0026nbspof their human that triggered that response, so there is a recognition component there – but it still could be “Hey, this is the person who feeds me.” Which is why\u0026nbspwe did the other experiment of food versus praise, where we examined the response to the expectation of food versus the expectation of “Hey good girl!” We\u0026nbspfound most of the dogs had equal responses to both. One of the\u0026nbspbig messages I am trying to convey is that dogs are iniduals too and in every experiment that we have done we\u0026nbspsee a range of responses.The structure of a dog’s brain is rather different from a human’s – how far can we say there are analogous areas?That’s a good question. If you just look physically at the brain, there are obvious differences in size, so\u0026nbspimmediately there is a challenge there to identify corresponding parts\u0026nbspin one brain with another. Humans have proportionally much larger frontal lobes, so there is more\u0026nbspstuff there that a dog does not\u0026nbsphave. So it is problematic to say that regions are analogous just based on how they appear. But there\u0026nbspis a functional analogy, which is\u0026nbspreally what I am talking about. The\u0026nbspidea with a functional analogy\u0026nbspis,\u0026nbspif you have two iniduals, whether they are the same species or\u0026nbspnot, engaging in the\u0026nbspsame activity or the same task and you see a region of the brain that is active in the same condition in both\u0026nbspcases, then you would say they\u0026nbspare functionally analogous because they seem to be doing the same thing.Is this a big project in anthropomorphism? I don’t think so. I don’t claim dogs understand what we are saying the way we do. Some people are convinced their dogs understand what they are saying, but dogs don’t\u0026nbsphave the same amount of brain real estate for processing language that we do.There was a study recently about dogs manipulating their faces to communicate with humans. What do\u0026nbspyou make of that? Do they really pull\u0026nbspthe big eye stunt? Obviously they want to communicate with us because they live with us. They are very social\u0026nbspanimals in my view, their greatest trick is how social they are – that is what makes them a dog and not a wolf. But if a dog makes a particular facial expression, are we to conclude that they are trying to communicate with\u0026nbspus or not? I don’t know.When you look at a dog in an MRI scanner and you see activity in a region, do we know if that is down to thoughts, an impulse, inbuilt or training? What is the alternative if they don’t think? Then we are back to what essentially Descartes said, which is that animals have no thoughts, that they are just a bundle of reflexes. That would be a Cartesian view of animals that I\u0026nbspthink most people would not accept any more. Most scientists would not accept that. In part, that is because dogs and all animals have the ability to learn from the environment. They are at some level taking things into account, things that have happened to them, and altering their actions based on these things. To put it in words, they form predictions of how the world behaves around them and that includes other entities. To me, that is what thought is. Now the thing I think people get hung up on is that they don’t have an internal monologue like we do.Do you think dogs have an imagination? For sure. I think all animals have a form of imagination. I think one of the major functions of a brain is to, for lack of a better word, imagine. Now that may be a bit anthropomorphic for your tastes, so the other way to think about it is that brains are necessary for\u0026nbspprediction.There was one incident you talk about\u0026nbspwhere you had to kill a dog as\u0026nbsppart of your work... It wasn’t research, that was training as a medical doctor. It was just what all medical doctors had to do. Yeah, it left a lasting impression and I regret it greatly.Do you think some animals have lower sentience so it is OK to eat them? It is really tricky to kind of prioritise certain animals over other animals. At least in the western world, nobody\u0026nbspis going to eat a dog, but that doesn’t mean they are more sentient or more intelligent than other animals that we do eat – it is because they are charismatic and we like them. On the face of it, that doesn’t seem right.You talk about how in your experiments the dogs are not restrained but free to leave at any time, just as humans are. That is admirable, but how realistic an\u0026nbspapproach is that for medical\u0026nbspresearch? The problem with a lot of medical research is they use animals in ways\u0026nbspthat don’t even translate to human health. It is well known that\u0026nbsprat and mouse physiology and the way they react to drugs is not very predictive of how humans react\u0026nbspto drugs. So we do need to think seriously about the use of animals in\u0026nbspmedical research and whether it is really worth doing or\u0026nbspnot.Do you see yourself as a modern\u0026nbspDr\u0026nbspDolittle? No, I didn’t think it was going to end\u0026nbspthis way, but it is more enjoyable than studying people.• What It’s Like to Be a Dog by Gregory Berns is published by Oneworld (£16.99).

First up, the leader Patrick Reed, who sends his drive towards the base of a tree down the left. If that’s not bad enough, Rory McIlroy sends a wild one almost straight right! There’s out of bounds over there, so his heart is in his mouth. But he’s got a break, in so much as his ball has stayed within the boundaries of the course. Blimey. Will he have a route out from the pine straw?! The drama didn’t take long, did it. Meanwhile up the hole, Fowler and Rahm find the green in regulation and make a pair of pars.Disaster for Bubba on 2! The pin’s tucked behind the big bunker at the front right of the green. His ball is at the front. There’s no straight line to the cup along the kidney-shaped green. So he tries to use the camber of the bunker on the right to throw a putt towards the flag - but skirting with the edge of the trap is taking liberties, and his ball topples in! That’s absurd. Putting into a bunker! Of course he splashes out to two feet - delicately, without much green to play with - and salvages par. But still. He stays at -6. It might not have been Tiger’s week, but the man sure knows how to entertain the galleries. Having birdied 13, he now guides in a huge left-to-right breaker on 15 for eagle! The patrons erupt in delight, and Tiger cracks a huge smile as well, feeling the love rolling towards him from all angles. He’s +1. Meanwhile Branden Grace has just carded four birdies in a row, at 13, 14, 15, and 16: he’s -1 all of a sudden.The penultimate pairing is on the tee. Rickie Fowler bashes his drive down the right of the fairway and is very lucky to stop short of the sand. Jon Rahm - who had been standing around with his eyes shut tight, waiting, perhaps praying - blooters his down the left. Up on the green, Tommy Fleetwood leaves himself a monster birdie putt from the front of the green. He leaves it well short. But in goes the six-foot saver. He stays at -6. But his partner Henrik Stenson had sent his second pin high to eight feet, and makes no mistake with the birdie putt. He’s -8. Meanwhile on 4, another birdie for Justin Rose. He’s -5.Spieth’s eagle effort slides past the left lip, but that’s a birdie-birdie start for the 2015 champion. He’s -7. His partner Justin Thomas can only make a par, but what an eventful one it was: a huge hook into the hazard down the left, a chip out, a third onto the green, a 75-foot putt with a huge left-to-right break lagged close, and in. Then breathe. Hey, Spieth’s given us a reason to update our leaderboard at last...Bubba is one turn of the Titleist away from a birdie start. He’d crashed his drive miles down the middle, only to leave himself a 30-footer for birdie. His aim was dead on, but he didn’t quite give it enough. He stays at -6. Up on 3, Rose has a curly birdie putt from the back of 2, but he can’t quite guide in the big rightwards swinger. He stays at -4. Meanwhile on 2, Jordan Spieth crashes his second into the heart of the green to set up a 25-foot birdie putt. After a couple of hesitant days, he’s clearly in the mood to give this a tilt. Easy to forget he was four clear of the field at -7 after 17 holes of the opening round.Hideki Matsuyama is going along nicely: birdies at 2, 3, 5 and now 8, with just the one dropped shot at 4. He’s -3 for his round and the Tournament. Charley Hoffman has birdied 2 and 3: he’s up to -3 already. Paul Casey has reached the turn in 33, after birdies at 2, 5 and 8: he’s -3. Birdie for Dustin Johnson at 2: he’s -5. And though Webb Simpson drops his first stroke of the day at 12 to slip back to -2, all of this serves as evidence of Ian Poulter talking sense. With the weather warming up, but the greens staying receptive after yesterday’s rain, the pack chasing Patrick Reed should indeed be “licking their chops”. There’s a score out there for someone.Doug Ghim signs off in style! The guaranteed winner of the Silver Cup as low amateur - the only amateur to survive the cut - holes out from the bunker at the front left of 18, and earns a hug and a kiss from his dad as player and caddy leap around in celebration! Does that closing birdie beat his eagle from the centre of the fairway on day one? Hard to say, isn’t it. What a choice to have! Delightful scenes, and the young Texan deserves the huge ovation he receives: he’s carded 72-76-74-74 this week, and ends the week very respectably at +8!Thanks to Tom. And tell you what, there’s plenty of players who would pay Webb Simpson cash money for his start today. Those eagles at 7 and 8 were something else: his second at 7 landed in the centre of the green from 170 yards, the slope of the green gathering the ball back towards and into the cup, then a chip-in from the side of 8. He’s only the fourth player to card back-to-back eagles in Masters history. Meanwhile birdie for Justin Rose at 2, and he moves to -4.The Justin ThomasJordan Spieth pairing arrives at the first. Thomas his a three-wood towards but not into the trees on the left but finds some rough on the edge of the fairway before Spieth finds the top of the hill in a fairly central position with is tee shot. Thomas’s second shot iswell judged though, to the edge of the green, but is outdone by Spieth whose second with the driver is even better. Thomas’s birdie putt is just skewed slightly to the right of the pin and he must settle for par. Spieth makes no mistake with his though, from an easier distance, and the 2015 champion is underway with a birdie.Ian Poulter speaks: “I played lovely today, I felt free, and it was one last hurrah to see how many birdies I could make, but a bit frustrated at lack of eagles. A few sloppy mistakes but the good stuff was good which is why I made seven birdies. The course is receptive, typical Sunday pin positions. I think the chasing pack today should be licking their chops.”Talking of licked-chops, Scott’s back and, I trust, well fed, to talk you through to the keenly-anticipated end.Mickelson gets himself into the greenside bunker on 18 but chips adeptly out of it onto the green and then drains his par putt to finish on two over. Warm applause follows him off. Back up the leaderboard, Hoffman adds another birdie on the 3rd to move to three-under and Webb Simpson’s charge continues, a birdie on the par-four 10th taking him to -3, having made two eagles on his front nineAnother couple of finishers – Ian Poulter has signed for a 69, his best round of the week. He was never in contention after his heroics to get here, but he’ll be pleased with his finish. He heads to the clubhouse four-over. Also going round in 69 to finish +4 is Brian Harman. Tiger finds a good position on the fairway on 11 and six-irons to the green with a satisfying plonk, but he can’t nail a sinkable putt for birdie and has to settle for par. Woods’s playing partner, Cabrera Bello, drops his first shot of the day here though, drifting back to two over. And another birdie for Mickelson at the 17th – he’s left it all too late, but he’s put on a decent show today: five-under for the round but two over for the tournament.In the meantime, here’s Neil McLean, going route one on sandwich tips: “Thick cut white bread, butter, extra stong cheddar and a layer of salt and vinegar Pringles on top.”An eagle for Webb Simpson on the 7th followed by a birdie on Yellow Jasmine has put him in the red at two under, where he is joined by Matsuyama and Charlie Hoffman, who has birdied the 2nd. Singh meanwhile has signed for a 71, to finish on +7.It’s been a fine final round from Phil Mickelson, Lefty has eagled the long par-five 15th to leave himself four-under for the round, +3 overall, while another old-stager having a good day is Bernhard Langer, who’s two-under for the round after successive birdies on 8 and 9 have put him one-over for the tournament.Tiger’s rollercoaster round continues – a bogey at the 9th while the veteran Vijay Singh has stumbled towards the end, dropping two shots on the 16th. He’s -1 for the round but plus seven overall. Eveningafternoon everyone, and thanks Scott. Hope you enjoy your ‘burger’. In the meantime, Tiger’s responded to his mis-steps on 7 with a birdie at Yellow Jasmine to move back to three-over overall. None of which will matter much at the business end of things. Further up the leaderboard, Rafael Cabrera Bello has hit his groove, birdie-ing 6 and 8 to move to advance to +1. Webb Simpson too is on something of a charge. A stunning eagle on the seventh has put him level par overall, while Hideki Matsuyama, who began the day on even par, has birdied the 2nd and 3rd to move to two under.Anyhows, while I’m here feel free to email me here with your observations and cheese sarnie recipes. Hideki Matsuyama has been frustrating this week. Steady, but never threatening to break into a charge. An early birdie at 2 today, though, and last year’s PGA nearly man moves into red numbers at -1.And with that, I’m off to stick my face into a plate of Hamburger Helper, the only MSG-and-sodium flavored food product to be marketed by a singing, grinning, gurning golf glove. You couldn’t get away with the tagline of this advert in these more enlightened days, though gender stereotyping never tasted so good. See you in an hour in the meantime, Tom Davies will be your host!Haotong Li came of age at last year’s Open, of course, with that final-day 63 at Birkdale. But the 22-year-old from China will have done his profile no harm with his joyous perambulations around Augusta this week. He led the Masters for a brief moment on Thursday afternoon, knocking his tee shot at 16 to a few feet and making the birdie putt to move to -4, encouraging the patrons to break out into a chorus of Liiiiiiiiiiiii in the Matt Kuchar style. He ended up carding a debut round of 69. It couldn’t last, and he shot 76 on the second day, but he’s entertained the gallery with his good humour and innate showmanship: he’s a very expressive player, wearing his heart on his sleeve. Anyway, an early birdie at 2, the result of a fine up and down from the wrong side of the sand guarding the front right of the green. But then a bogey at 3, after fluffing a chip from the bottom the big bank at the front left of the green. He’s +1, and there’s nobody at Augusta who would begrudge the young man a strong finish.Tiger’s flat stick has let him down today. He’d sent his second at 7 pin high to six feet, a wonderful approach from a tight spot restricted by a tree to the right of the fairway. But all the good work was undone as he pulled his putt. And then he misses the short one coming back! A three-putt bogey from close range, and he’s back to level par for the day, and +4 overall. “I took the precaution of making two batches of pimento cheese yesterday,” boasts the very wise Richard Sillett. “Roasted red bell peppers, diced, seem to work equally well. Replacing some of the mayonnaise with cream cheese results increases smoothness and decreases life expectancy. I can’t imagine Gary Player has eaten many of them.”Vijay’s hot streak continues. He makes his third birdie of the day, this time at 13, to move to +5. He’s putting together the best round out there right now: three under for the day. Singh won two PGAs as well as the 2000 Masters: the greats never lose it. Meanwhile Xander Schauffele, more than half Singh’s age, adds birdie at 8 to the one he made at Tea Olive. These two are the only players currently out there at two under or better, because of the aforementioned multiple-birdie-making fast starters, Zach Johnson has bogeyed 4, while Ian Poulter and Phil Mickelson have dropped shots at 11.A great up and down for Tiger on 6. He’d sent his tee shot well wide right of the green, but bumped a careful chip down a slippery bank and knocked in his four-footer for par. He stays at +3 then his partner Cabrera Bello deals with his birdie business.The 2012 US Open champ Webb Simpson has enjoyed playing the par-five 2nd this week. Birdie every day. He opens fast for the fourth day in a row, to rise to +2. He’s out with 2007 Masters and 2015 Open winner Zach Johnson: the steady-as-you-like Iowan also birdies 2, and then 3 as well, to move back to level par for the tournament. Meanwhile now it’s time for Rafa Cabrera Bello to bother the pin at a par-three: he lands his tee shot at 6 a couple of feet to the right of the cup, and will surely tidy up for a birdie that’ll take the Spaniard - who briefly led this Tournament earlier in the week - to +2.There’s nobody tearing it up out there. Phil Mickelson had started off fast, but he’s dropped one at 8, having skirted with trouble all the way down the left of the hole, and taking three putts. He’s reached the turn in 34 strokes, two under for the day and +5 overall. Vijay Singh is also two under for his round, having just added birdie at 10 to the one he made a while back at 2. He’s +6. And Ian Poulter is the only other player on the course a couple of shots to the good today. He’s had a very eventful morning: a birdie at 1 followed by bogey at 3 and double at 5 ... then a run of four birdies in five holes: 6, 7, 9 and 10! He never really had time to prepare for this Masters, having only qualified last Sunday by winning the Houston Open ... but he’s not done badly at all in the circumstances. And being here at all seemed a pipe dream a fortnight ago, so he’ll not be complaining too much. He’s +5, and hopefully his trademark Sunday surge will continue in the name of early-doors entertainment.Tiger’s iron play is certainly a lot better today: he nearly makes hole in one at the par-three 4th! An iron arrowed straight at the flag. His ball lands a couple of feet in front of the pin, takes a skip forward, and clips the left-hand edge of the cup. It could drop ... but doesn’t, and zips ten feet past. He’ll get a good read at his birdie putt, because his partner Rafa Cabrera Bello is outside him, coming in from a similar line. The Spaniard strokes a fine left-to-right curler into the cup from 18 feet. That’s a birdie that offsets a bogey at the previous hole, and he’s +3. As is Tiger, who having gone to school makes no mistake! An eventful start to Tiger’s round.Tiger crashes a drive down 3, a hole he usually enjoys at the Masters. His ball rests front left of the green, but he’s got that huge bank to get over, and there’s not a lot of room to play with at the top, because the flag is front left. He wafts at his lob, and the ball stays at the bottom of the slope. His second effort only just makes it, apologetically creeping onto the green. He can’t make the 12-foot saver, and drops back to +4. That birdie handed straight back. This hole location, teetering on the edge by the big bank, might result in quite a few incidents today.Birdie for Tiger at 2, despite an errant drive down the left of the hole. He got greenside in two, then pitched to a couple of feet. He’s up to +3, and his bid to reach level par - maybe even get into red figures for the week - is on. It really should have been his second birdie of the day, but the flat stick let him down on the 1st. The good news, however, is that his irons seem to be behaving themselves today he’s struggled with them all week. Better late than never.It’s been a fine week for the veteran Vijay Singh. Few expected the 55-year-old Fijian to make the cut, but the 2000 champion made it with ease after rounds of 71 and 74. At one point early on Thursday he was leading the Tournament after starting out with birdies at 1, 3 and 4. A birdie-free 79 yesterday was an unwelcome reintroduction to 2018 life, but he’s going well today: one under for his round through 8 after birdie at 2. He’s out first, so he’s out there with a marker. Incidentally, Jeff Knox, the Augusta National member and Masters cult hero, birdied 11 yesterday as marker, a feat beyond all of the players in the field. In fact, only ten players have birdied that hole all week. “It was a brilliant birdie, he’s very good,” his partner of yesterday Paul Casey reported. Any old excuse to post this marvellous profile.Hatton is out there today with Doug Ghim, the young Texan who, as the only surviving amateur, is guaranteed to win the Silver Cup providing he completes his round. Ghim’s dropped a shot at 3, so he slips to +7. There’s a fair chance he could end the Tournament in last place, but as an amateur there’d be no shame in that, and in any case he’ll be taking away one of the moments of this year’s event, a hole-out for eagle from the middle of the 18th fairway. His dad on his bag, too. Millions of golfers would give anything to experience a moment like that with the old man. Also, Ghim will be in good company as a winner of the Silver Cup. In recent years, it’s been lifted by the likes of Hideki Matsuyama, Ryan Moore, Patrick Cantlay and Bryson DeChambeau. It’s also been won in the past by future champions Cary ‘Doc’ Middlecoff, Jack ‘Golden Bear’ Nicklaus, Gentle Ben Crenshaw, Phil the Thrill, Tiger and Sergio. I hope he’s got a snappy nickname up his sleeve.Tiger’s second into Tea Olive is a peach. An easy wedge clipped to five feet. But he can’t convert for birdie, the uphill putt lipping out. He makes do with par. He hardly missed a single putt from that sort of length between 1997 and 2008. A long time ago now, I guess. Elsewhere, there’s a fast start for Tyrrell Hatton, who has birdied 1 and 2 to move to -2. Much was expected of Phil Mickelson, too, despite his advancing years. Lefty’s bid to become the oldest Masters champion in history looked on when he shot an opening round of 70, but he only just survived the cut after a second-round 79. He did well to post 74 yesterday after opening with a whiff in the trees and a triple-bogey down 1, but he set out today at +7, one of the pre-Tournament tips down with the stragglers. He’s the hottest thing out on the course so far today, though: birdies at 2, 3 and 4 catapulting him up to +4. You can’t keep a three-time Masters champion down. It didn’t quite happen for Tiger Woods this week. One of the pre-Tournament favourites never got going, posting rounds of 73, 75 and 72. The expectation a little too much for a rusty genius. He’s out early today as a result, but that’s not stopped the galleries swarming around him for a close look at a living legend. And it’s not stopped the CBS featured groups cameras trailing him either, so we’ll see plenty of him in these early hours before the real action gets going. He starts at +4 today, and has made it his goal to reach level par for the week. He begins well by splitting the fairway at Tea Olive. But he did that on Friday and Saturday and made bogey both times. Let’s see how this one goes.Great news: there’s no threat of bad weather today! It’s going to be cloudy in the morning, with the sun hopefully breaking through later on. There’s not going to be much in the way of wind, and what little there is will drop come the afternoon. It’ll be cool all day, though expect noggin temperatures to rise by many degrees around Amen Corner. No rain. In other news, click here to have a gander at today’s pin positions. All very traditional for a Sunday at Augusta National, designed as ever for optimum excitement. Can you wait? Us neither!Here we go then! Are you all set for one of the greatest days in the sporting calendar? Pimento cheese sandwich made? Sweet tea fixed? Just a quick bit of prep, and we’ll be good to go!For the sandwich, mix white and yellow sharp cheddar, sliced pimentos and mayonnaise. Spread industrial quantities onto white bread. For the Southern-style sweet tea, place tea bags in a heatproof jar add boiling water remove tea bags and add industrial quantities of sugar. Pour over ice. Turn on golf. Keep eye on this report. Put up feet (preferably on porch swing). Relax!Only six men have ever completed the career grand slam in major-championship golf. Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods have all collected the set of Masters, US Open, Open and PGA, while Bobby Jones won the US Amateur, US Open, Open and British Amateur titles in the pre-Masters era. It’s an elite club. And it’s one Rory McIlroy can join this evening if he manages to banish the ghosts of 2011 and add a green jacket to his already-stellar résumé.He’s playing well enough to complete his application. He carded a joint best-of-week 65 yesterday, a round he doggedly kept on track despite at one point finding himself waist-deep in azaleas. He knows he can deliver on Sunday when the pressure is on: forget that meltdown here in 2011, and consider instead his four subsequent major titles, his street-fighting FedEx Cup smash-and-grab in 2016, or the final-round 64 he shot to claim the Arnold Palmer last month. Immortality is within his grasp.Only problem is, Patrick Reed is playing like a dream. Reed doesn’t have a major championship to his name yet, but everyone’s got to start somewhere, and this could be the moment the 27-year-old Texan finally joins the big league. He came very close at last year’s PGA, shooting 67 at Quail Hollow to push Justin Thomas hard he was one misjudged putt from making a play-off at the Valspar last month. And he’s been nothing short of sensational here this week: an opening-day 69, a 66 on a testing second day, then those two eagles yesterday on his way to a scintillating 67. It’s earned him a deserved three-shot lead over McIlroy going into the final round. Keep doing the same things, maintain a cool head, and the title’s his. He’d be a most deserved winner.But nothing’s ever certain at Augusta on Sunday. Just ask Greg Norman, who shipped a six-shot 54-hole lead in 1996. Or Ed Sneed, who couldn’t convert a five-shot advantage in 1979. Or Rory himself, who crashed and burned so sadly around Amen Corner in 2011. Plus the fact everyone knows the tournament doesn’t really start until everyone reaches the turn on Sunday. In that respect, the story’s yet to begin.So it could be a Patrick Reed procession ... or a drama of such epic proportions we’ll remember every twist, turn, eagle, birdie, hook and yip until our dying breath. And the erstwhile Ryder Cup combatants Reed and McIlroy might not be the only characters in our story, either. Working on the premise that nobody has won the Masters from further than eight shots back going into the final round - when Jack Burke Jr. overhauled Ken Venturi in 1956 - there are a further six players within range who could still have a realistic shot. Step forward Rickie Fowler, Jon Rahm, Henrik Stenson, Tommy Fleetwood, Bubba Watson and Marc Leishman. That’s quite a cast of talent, and they’ve all been on song this week. Hell, let’s go a couple of shots further back, just so we can namecheck the brilliant US trio of Justin Thomas, Jordan Spieth and Dustin Johnson in our roll-call. Hey, it’s unlikely, but records are there to be broken.We went into this Tournament hoping for a classic. The first three days have more than delivered. So here’s hoping day four can put the icing on the cake. Good luck, Patrick. God speed, Rory. All the best, Rickie. Give it your best shot, Jon. It’s the denouement of the 2018 Masters. It’s Augusta National on Sunday. It’s on!... and the tee times for the final round:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1892a236b5d8b2d9a65835a0c6ae464bfd1c9949/14_0_1873_1124/master/1873.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4515a00b91f2bf05a6864e0453ad2afc 1240w","title":"rudolf slansky czechoslovakia show trial","story":"It was among the most notorious show trials of the 20th century, the prosecution and sentencing to death of Czechoslovakia’s leading communist, who had been arrested in a brutal purge ordered by Stalin.But an event that has fascinated historians could soon be seen in graphic detail after footage and audio recording of the 1952 trial was found. Hours of film and voice recordings, much of it mould-damaged, believed to cover most of the eight-day procedure were found stashed in metal and wooden boxes – along with millions of classified Czechoslovak Communist party documents – in the basement of a bankrupt former metal research business in Panenské Břežany, near Prague.The discovery came after Czech historians and archivists lost trace of recordings known to have been made on the orders of the communist authorities in preparation for a propaganda film that was never produced.The material was found by an insolvency specialist, who alerted historians after seeing labels on the boxes that clearly advertised their content.By strange coincidence, the bankrupt plant occupied the same grounds as a castle which, during the occupation of Czechoslovakia, was used as a residence by the Nazi governor of Bohemia and Moravia, Reinhard Heydrich, an architect of the Holocaust, until his assassination in 1942.The items are believed to have been removed from the Communist party’s headquarters and hidden after the 1989 Velvet Revolution that ended its 41-year rule in what was then Czechoslovakia.Historians are unsure whether they were spirited away to ensure their safekeeping with a view to selling them for profit or to conceal evidence about the trial, which is widely considered one of the darkest stains on the party’s record.The material – consisting of six hours of 35mm black-and-white film and 80 hours of audio – is now with the Czech National Film Archive, which is asking the government for an estimated 12m koruna (£410,000) to fund delicate restoration work that would make it fit for public viewing.Michal Bragant, the archive’s chief executive, called the discovery “a great opportunity” because it would allow Czech archivists to compile a rare video depiction of Stalin-era show trials, very few of which have available long-form footage.“The priority is to make the footage safe,” Bragant said. “But it will be even safer once it’s publicly available, because we also need to make the knowledge safe. We still have not learned enough from the 20th century. The more people learn about it and the horror of the show trials, the safer we will be.“One day, when we can make it available for the public, you will be able to see the facial expressions, people’s movements, the body language and the staged performances. Because this was nothing to do with due process. It was all rehearsed.”Slánský, who spent much of the second world war exiled in Moscow, was put on trial along with 13 other high-ranking communists in November 1952, accused of “Titoism” and Zionism. The charges were fuelled by Stalin’s wish to purge eastern European communist parties after the Soviet Union’s break with the Yugoslav regime of Josip Broz Tito and his anger that Israel, born four years earlier, had not become a communist state.The trial had antisemitic overtones, with Slánský and 10 of the other defendants being Jewish. Slánský is believed to have been tortured into a convoluted, rehearsed confession, which he made in court before requesting to be punished with the death penalty.He was hanged in Prague’s Pankrac prison on 3 December 1952, but was exonerated during the liberalising Prague spring of 1968. Plans to turn the trial footage into a propaganda film were shelved after Stalin died in March 1953."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9384743b8f19a7550803495ea1605f034b5dfd5e/0_297_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b1949208ebbcaafee395dd379eda8386 1240w","title":"hungary election victor orban expected to win third term live updates","story":"Follow the latest developments as prime minister’s Fidesz party hopes for victory after anti-immigration campaignPolling day is a family affair in many countries and Hungary is no different.

He thinks higher turnout will favour the opposition.Gábor Vona, pictured, leads the far-right Jobbik party, which is trying to move away from its roots as a far right, antisemitic party. He has said the shift will bring the party into government, sooner or later.A spokesman for Hungary’s ruling Fidesz party has said it is unlikely to get a two-thirds majority. Viktor Orbán’s party won a two-thirds majority in 2010 and 2014, which enabled him to change the constitution. The super-majority was lost in a 2015 by-election defeat.Going into the poll, most analysts predicted that Fidesz would not get a two-thirds majority, but would keep overall control. The latest forecast came from Gergely Gulyás, Fidesz group leader.While we wait for the results, it is worth looking at how Hungary’s electoral system works.Voters are electing 199 members of parliament in a single round. A total of 106 seats can be won in single-member constituencies in a first-past-the-post system. The remaining 93 seats are awarded under a list system.Fidesz has changed election rules since 2010, boosting the ruling party’s chances against a fragmented left-wing opposition and the far-right Jobbik party.Reuters has produced this useful list of the key changes.Hungary may be heading for its highest-ever voter turnout, according to a spokesman for the ruling party, Fidesz. Gergely Gulyás, the Fidesz group leader, thanked Hungarians for the high turnout, according to an official website, AboutHungary.huHungarian democracy is strong, this is what the high turnout signals. We thank all those who have voted, this way the next government can have a strong legitimacy.It may very well be the highest turnout ever. The parliament of Hungary will then be especially strong.Here are more reports of the long queues to vote, from correspondents in Budapest.Politico’s correspondent, Lili Bayer, tells of a heavy police presence. The Guardian’s Shaun Walker has heard from voters in London, who said the Hungarian embassy was not prepared to deal with the numbers wanting to vote.And from Andrew Byrne of the Sunday Times.In Budapest, Brussels and London, there have been reports of long queues to vote.In London some Hungarians have waited two hours to cast their ballot, according to Index.hu, which also reports one three-hour wait at a polling station at a school in Budapest.Viktor Orbán, accompanied by his wife, Aniko Levai, voted this morning in a wealthy neighbourhood in Budapest.Speaking to journalists, he said he would stand up for Hungary’s interests. We love our country and we are fighting for our countryAsked if he was fighting the European Union, he said: The EU is not in Brussels. The EU is in Berlin, in Budapest, in Prague and in Bucharest.A post on his Facebook page later showed him attending church.I’ve taken the quotes from ReutersGood evening and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Hungary’s parliamentary elections, one of the least predictable votes in the country’s recent history.The outcome matters, not only because Hungary is a European Union member state at the geographic heart of the continent, but because these elections could be decisive for the country’s future direction. During eight years in power the current prime minister, Viktor Orbán has re-written the constitution, tightened control over the media and judiciary and put loyalists in key posts.Polls have closed, with long lines seen just outside voting stations in Budapest. Election officials have said they will remain open until everyone in the line by the 7pm close (6pm BST) has been able to vote.My colleague, Shaun Walker, the Guardian’s central and eastern Europe correspondent, has been visiting polling stations in Budapest today.Here is his assessment of what could happen:It will be a nervous wait for Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s hardline rightwing prime minister to find out how his Fidesz party has done and whether he will win a third consecutive term as prime minister, after a campaign focused almost exclusively on migration.There are three potential outcomes: either Fidesz keeps the two-thirds parliamentary majority it has enjoyed for the last eight years, which would be a resounding mandate for Orbán’s anti-migrant politics and give him a free hand to continue with legislative and constitutional changes.Another possibility is Fidesz loses the two-thirds majority but keeps a simple majority, giving Orbán another term as prime minister. Going into the vote, this is what many analysts were predicting.The final plausible outcome is that the high turnout means opposition gains, which could leave Orbán without a majority in the 199-seat parliament to form a government and would usher in a period of messy coalition dealmaking.The opposition is split between Jobbik, the former far-right party which has been trying to rebrand itself as a centrist anti-corruption force, and a number of smaller liberal parties. They have been unable to agree on strategically withdrawing candidates to present united fronts against Fidesz in each district, partly because the level of state funding political parties receive is dependent on how many candidates they field. But a number of sites and groups have been set up to advise Hungarians who want a change of government on the best way to vote tactically in each district."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ba01dc9382ba2540098ba321563d569700dcb06/0_301_4600_2760/master/4600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=19c064abf7386dc5b9f1de3f3bc0ed82 1240w","title":"are you getting the most from your savings","story":"Save cash and get more money – for free. It sounds like a win-win situation, but is a Lifetime Isa right for you?If someone offered you thousands of pounds towards the purchase of your first home, you might think the prospect was too good to be true. But that’s what’s on offer if you save using a Lifetime Isa. The latest addition to the range of inidual savings accounts, Lifetime Isas give savers the chance to earn extra funds to put towards their first property or later life.“Having the government bonus is a great way to boost your savings – for every £4 you save you are getting another £1,” says Nici Audhlam-Gardiner, managing director at financial services provider OneFamily. “Even if you have got a relatively small amount to save, it does add up.”There are, of course, a couple of catches – the money can only be used to buy a property if it is genuinely your first, and the accounts can only be opened by people aged 18 to 39. However, the bonus keeps being paid, every month you pay in, until you turn 50. That means if you start as soon as you turn 18 and put in the maximum every year, you can get up to £32,000 from the government.“It isn’t for short-term savings – when people open one, either they are going to use it for a house deposit or it is going to be tucked away for their retirement,” says Audhlam-Gardiner.If you’re a steady Eddie and don’t fancy taking too much risk, a cash Lifetime Isa, similar to a normal savings account, may be most appealing. Anyone prepared to take a bit more risk can opt for a stocks and shares Lifetime Isa. If the stock market goes up, this could provide better returns than a simple cash Lifetime Isa, but you can lose money too. Stocks and shares Lifetime Isas are better suited to longer-term investments, of at least 5 years, so that any dips in the market are balanced out.Whichever you choose, you will have to plan a little in advance – you’ll need to have an account for a year before you can use it to buy a home.Got all that?

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Department of Foreign Affairs has collected emergency plans from all Government departments amounting to 280 documents in preparation for the possibility of no deal being reached on Brexit. Plans were sought by the department, which is leading the Government’s preparations for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU in March 2019, as part of contingency planning for a worst-case scenario. The reports sought from the departments are aimed at preparing a Government-wide response to manage a disorderly Brexit, including any emergency legislation required and measures to deal with high tariffs imposed on goods entering and leaving the UK and delays at Irish and British ports. In some cases, the department has sought more detailed plans, resulting in dozens more documents being submitted by the Departments of Finance and Business. The Department of Finance has looked at whether new legislation would be required for financial services in the event of a hard Brexit given that contracts in this area are governed by English law.The potential number of new customs and excise staff and additional resources required by the Revenue Commissioners to manage post-Brexit inspections and Border checks has also been explored by the department.“A massive amount of work has been going on across all Government departments to ensure Ireland is prepared for every eventuality with Brexit,” said a spokesman for Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Simon Coveney, who is managing the Government’s Brexit team.“We have to be prepared for a disorderly Brexit and that work is under way, it is contingency planning we hope never to have to use,” he added.The department has declined to release details of the planning contained within the documents as it was “still being processed and is extremely sensitive” with Brexit negotiations ongoing, said the spokesman.“It is not in the national interest for us to air our contingency planning for all to see during international negotiations which are of such fundamental importance for the future of the island,” he said.EU and UK negotiators have been meeting over the quiet Easter period in Brussels discussing for the first time potential ways to avoid a hard Border on the island of Ireland.In a separate development, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has accepted an invitation to visit Ireland again at the end of this month. Mr Barnier is expected to visit the Border and possibly Belfast when he visits for the Government’s next all-island civic dialogue on Brexit, comprising 1,500 civic society and industry representatives, in Dundalk, Co Louth.
