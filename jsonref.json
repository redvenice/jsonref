Meghan Markle imagined here wearing the gown she is rumoured to wear on her wedding day, at the Ralph \u0026amp Russo fashion show at Paris Fashion WeekWill Meghan’s wedding dress impact the bridal industry?Meghan, like Kate Middleton, is likely to choose a dress from a British brand in order to curry favour with the public and in turn, boost the nation’s valuable fashion and bridal industries.Despite the Meghan Markle effect being an industry in itself, being valued at £150 million to the British fashion industry in the form of unofficial brand endorsements, the new Royal’s impact on the bridal industry may be more subtle.After Kate Middleton’s marriage to Prince William, some bridal designers decided to replicate the Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen dress with hopes that all those who had watched the Royal Wedding would want to purchase a wedding dress similar to hers.According to Lori Conley, Senior Vice President of Product and Design at David’s Bridal, the recreated dress with lace sleeves, plunging neckline and full skirt did not sell. ‘We have internal benchmarks we work with to understand traction of a dress. It feel below those.’While women were inspired by Kate’s look, they did not want to feel as if they were in a costume, so bridal designers are expected to take elements from Meghan’s dress after May 19 and incorporate them in their new collections.However, before the 2011 Royal Wedding, 75 per cent of wedding dresses that David’s Bridal sold were strapless, but after, around 65 percent of brides opted for something with more coverage, from straps to full sleeves.          Kate Middleton seen here on her wedding day with her Maid of Honour and sister Pippa Middleton at Westminster Abbey in LondonIn the same way, Kate’s second wedding dress sparked an interest in sashes, Brides magazine Deputy Digital Director Roberta Correia told Racked that bridal designers are still being influenced by this accessory seven years on.‘Long sleeves, V-necks, and lace have been seen all over the bridal runways since, even at the most recent Bridal Fashion Week. H\u0026ampM released a new dress as part of their wedding collection, which looked almost exactly like Kate’s,’ Roberta said.Although there is high consumer interest in what Meghan wears, trend adoption is slower in the bridal industry, but some brands, like minimalist brand Floravere have already announced that they will have styles inspired by the dress ready within days of the Royal Wedding.Floravere CEO Molly Kang said: ‘As soon as she goes down the aisle, we can see what’s going to explode, whether it’s silhouette, fabric, or neckline.’Royal Wedding dressesWhile Meghan has somewhat disregarded the unspoken Royal dress code when it comes to her day-to-day fashion, she is expected to go for a traditional and classic bridal gown for her big day, similar to what other Royal brides have worn before her.The Queen’s wedding dressQueen Elizabeth II wore a timeless dress designed by the favoured royal couturier Norman Hartnell for her marriage to Lord Philip Mountbatten.The Duchesse ivory silk-creation took three months to complete and had a heart-shaped neckline with a scalloped edge, crystals and a 13 foot patterned train. Like all British brides at the time, the Government gave her 200 extra clothing coupons towards her wedding trousseau.          This picture was taken during the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh showing the couple at Buckingham PalacePrincess Margaret’s wedding dress Princess Margaret, the Countess of Snowdon and The Queen’s sister, was seen in a non-traditional dress made from silk organza in what was dubbed the most glamorous wedding of its time, in 1960.During her first marriage to Antony Armstrong-Jones, the Princess wore a modern dress with a skirt comprising of 30 metres of fabric, also designed by Norman Hartnell.Critics claimed it was the simplest wedding gown in history, yet beautiful and sophisticated and can be seen as part of a display at Kensington Palace in London.          Princess Margaret and Anthony Armstrong Jones seen here on the balcony of Buckingham Palace on their wedding day with one of the Princess\u0027s bridesmaidsPrincess Diana’s wedding dressAt the time, Lady Diana Spencer’s wedding dress was known as the ‘most closely guarded secret in fashion history’.Designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel, the meringue style gown was worth £9,000 in 1981 and is now valued at approximately £36,800.For her wedding to Prince Charles, Diana’s dress was made of ivory silk taffeta and antique lace with what has now become an iconic 25 foot train.

You won’t see a lot of skin. At least you shouldn’t. It would be seen as disrespectful,’ Meier said. She continued to explain that dresses in black or white should not be worn, as white is for the bride and black is still associated with mourning.While light prints and patterns are welcome at a Spring wedding, big and block patterns are unacceptable but international guests will be permitted to wear their country’s equivalent.          Spain\u0027s Prince Felipe seen here flanked by Princess Letizia and Spain\u0027s Queen Sofia, outside of Westminster Abbey ahead of the wedding between Prince William and Kate MiddletonAccording to etiquette experts Debrett’s, Meghan Markle’s boundary-pushing style will allow for some leeway when it comes to traditional Royal Wedding protocol.It may be unusual to see women wearing trousers at a wedding, but Meghan’s own decision to wear a pantsuit at formal events may mean that covered legs could be welcomed on the big day, especially after jumpsuits were approved at Royal Ascot’s Royal Enclosure.Many invitees may also take a page out of Kate’s book and choose a piece by British labels such as Stella McCartney, Burberry, Emilia Wickstead, Erdem or even Marks and Spencer, as Meghan Markle has in the past.Will Royal Wedding guests be required to wear hats?Women often start with the hat when planning their outfits, as Meier explained and they are kept on during a wedding church service. ‘Hats are a sign of festivity for a British wedding. They are kept on inside the church, but people should be careful of the people sitting behind them. It\u0027s not the Kentucky Derby. No huge brims. Nothing too high.’Princess Beatrice’s hat at Prince William’s wedding was regarded ‘ridiculous in so many ways’ by Royal watcher Anne Chertoff.          Princess Beatrice seen here wearing the Philip Treacy hat she wore at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011When it comes to shoes, open toes, wedges and slingbacks are too informal. Meier said: ‘You want something that is about 4 inches maximum. \u0027The walk in is not going to be easy. There are lots of cobblestones even though there will be different types of carpeting.’In addition to this, handbags should be small as the seating in St. George’s Chapel is very tight, so clutches are recommended.What will men wear to the Royal Wedding?Those who have a military uniform are encouraged to wear it, but most men will opt for a morning suit in either grey, navy or black with coattails. Men will also be expected to wear a waistcoat and a regular tie.For lounge suits, the rule of thumb is the darker it is, the more formal it will look and that rules goes for morning suits too. In the same way, brown shoes are considered less formal than black ones.          Prince William and his wife Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, seen here coming out of Westminster Abbey in London, after their wedding service in 2011What will Meghan Markle wear?Despite the Royal Wedding dress designer being a closely-guarded secret, rumours have suggested that Ralph \u0026amp Russo is the British couturer that has been picked by Meghan Markle. The dress is expected to be a hand-stitched and heavily beaded gown with long sleeves.What will Prince Harry wear?Prince Harry will most likely wear his Household Cavalry British Army uniform and it has been rumoured that he will have to shave his beard because facial hair is frowned upon by the military circle, according to Elle.However, Harry may also go for a morning suit because the wedding is a much more low key affair than that of his brother, Prince William’s. Other rumours suggest that he will wear the Royal Marines ceremonial uniform as a mark of respect to the regiment he took over from Prince Philip.Who is Sam Selvon?

Her father was a struggling department-store buyer. Wildenstein moved to Paris when she was a teenager.During that time she was in a relationship with the filmmaker Sergio Gobbi. Before her marriage to Alec, she was also linked to Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi and Cyril Piguet.In 1977, at the age of 31, Wildenstein met Alec on a safari trip to Kenya. Alec was there to kill a lion and Wildenstein asked to accompany him. The pair eloped the following year in Las Vegas.It was a tempestuous marriage. The couple reportedly spent $1 million a month on average and went for his-and-hers eye-lifts a year into their marriage. This marked the beginning of a long list of plastic surgeries.‘I would always find out last. She was thinking that she could fix her face like a piece of furniture. Skin does not work that way. But she wouldn’t listen,’ Alec Wildenstein told Vanity Fair.\u0027I don’t think I’ve known her when she wasn’t healing from something,\u0027 said a friend of Jocelyn in 1998. Wildenstein has frequently denied she’s had work done, saying in 1998 that her looks, which led to her being branded ‘Catwoman’, were natural.          In February 2018, the 77-year-old socialite said that she hasn\u0027t had any plastic surgery done‘If I show you pictures of my grandmother,’ she says, ‘what you see is these eyes—cat eyes—and high cheekbones.’ Wildenstein went on to deny she ever had any work done on her nose.After the couple’s children left home, Alec and Wildenstein ended up having ‘constant’ fights.One night, Wildenstein says she walked in on her husband with another woman and alleges he pointed a gun at her and her bodyguards—something Alec disputed, saying Wildenstein was downstairs when he saw the bodyguards.Alec spent the night in jail after the police were called.The pair’s orce was highly public and messy, with Alec slowly cutting Wildenstein’s financial means.Jocelyn Wildenstein before and after plastic surgeryJocelyn Wildenstein reportedly had her first plastic surgery a year after marrying her husband, in 1978. The pair went in for eye-lifts and the surgery was reportedly the first of many.However, in February 2018, Wildenstein and her now second husband, Lloyd Klein both denied she had any work done.\u0027I don\u0027t understand the whole press and the Catwoman thing because Jocelyn always looked like that,\u0027 Klein told DailyMailTV.Jocelyn Wildenstein reportedly had her first plastic surgery, an eye-lift, with Alec in 1978\u0027She never really did anything to change her face. I have pictures from 16 years old where she looks exactly the same as today.\u0027 However, in April 2018, Wildenstein admitted to having surgeries but stopping for a time during her orce from Alec.\u0027In the beginning, it\u0027s why I stopped correcting my appearance because the articles were mean and would repeat the image that my ex-husband tried to paint of me,\u0027 she told Paper Magazine. What is Jocelyn Wildenstein’s net worth?Jocelyn Wildenstein’s net worth is $16,386,100, according to her Chapter 11 bankruptcy documentation.This is a far cry from the $2.5 billion she was awarded during her orce from Alec Wildenstein. The filing lists that the socialite receives a $900 check a month from Social Security, which it says is her only source of income.Jocelyn Wildenstein bankruptcyJocelyn Wildenstein filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 2018, reportedly owing 16 creditors over $6 million. This includes hundreds of thousands of dollars to several building contractors, $70,000 to American Express, over $200,000 to two law firms, and $179,000 to Trump world Tower Condominium.Wildenstein also owes a staggering $4.6 million to Castellan Capital and $700,000 to a New York storage company.Who is Sam Selvon?

Kate\u0027s 1936 diamond \u0027Halo\u0027 tiara by Cartier was her \u0027something borrowed\u0027, on loan from the QueenBoth gowns shared a high-waisted, full-skirted silhouette with a long, dramatic train, and were worn with the sheerest of veils and diamond tiaras.However Kate\u0027s vintage headwear was from an era that preceded Princess Grace\u0027s marriage - the 1936 diamond \u0027Halo\u0027 tiara by Cartier was her \u0027something borrowed\u0027, on loan from the Queen.The comparison reveals how very classic Kate\u0027s style is, and how timeless Princess Grace\u0027s bridal look was. Princess Diana            The details of Princess Diana\u0027s dress managed to be kept a complete mystery until hours before her wedding to Charles, Prince of Wales, at St Paul\u0027s Cathedral  Diana chats to five-year-old bridesmaid Clementine Hambro under the watchful eye of the Queen (left) and travelling from Clarence House to St Paul\u0027s in the royal carriage (right)Harry and William\u0027s mother Princess Diana wore a huge puffy gown designed by the Emanuel\u0027s when she married Prince Charles in 1981. Her dress was known as at the time as the \u0027most closely guarded secret in fashion history.\u0027The meringue style gown, which was worth £9,000 in 1981 is approximately equivalent to £36,800 today. Details of the future princess\u0027s dress managed to be kept a complete mystery until hours before her wedding to Charles, Prince of Wales,  at St Paul\u0027s Cathedral.And the grand unveiling of the gown, which back in 1981 cost £9,000, did not disappoint.Designed by husband-and-wife duo David and Elizabeth Emanuel, the intricate ivory taffeta gown later saw copycat creations made around the world.

The Duchesse ivory silk-satin creation took royal couturier Sir Norman and his team three months to finishWith a heart-shaped neckline with scalloped edge, the gown was decorated with 10,000 seed pearls, glittering crystals and featured an intricate 13ft star-patterned train. Embroidered with roses, star-shaped flowers and wheat in pearl, crystal and appliques of transparent tulle, its floral design was seen as a symbol of growth and regeneration after the hardships of the Second World War. On the day of the wedding at Westminster Cathedral, the seamstresses who worked tirelessly on the gown were given a prime spot outside Buckingham Palace as a reward.  The Queen, like all British brides in the post-war days, was given 200 extra clothing coupons from the Government towards her wedding trousseau.Women across the UK, keen to ensure Princess Elizabeth would have the dress of her dreams, sent their own coupons to the young royal to help out.But it was illegal to give coupons away and the gifts had to be returned.  However, The Crown gave a good idea of how much the dress might cost to make today as designers for the BBC programme created an identical gown for the wedding scene, which cost £30,000.

So I feel personally invested in this romance!)The large crowd whooped ecstatically with each celebrity sighting and the stars waved with as much faux regalness as they could muster.But as I watched, my mind kept going back to one uneasy question: how can you justify having NONE of your family at your own marriage when you’re filling the church with famous people whom you’ve known for a fraction of the time?It smacked of ruthless and rather distasteful social climbing by a woman who was absolutely delightful when we met in my pub, but whose life has been marked by a worrying tendency to ditch people when they cease to be of use to her. (Her first husband thought they had a happy marriage until the day that Meghan sent his rings back in the post.)          Piers Morgan has given his verdict on the ultimate showbiz weddingMy hackles were raised further when some of the actors strode to the front of the church quire, nestling opposite senior Royals in a clear thespian statement of intent from Ms Markle that screamed: ‘We’re just as big stars as you stuffy lot in tiaras.’They are not, of course. There are no bigger stars than the British Royals, no other human beings who can command 5,000 media people to their weddings, or a billion television viewers.But there’s no doubt Hollywood hijacked this Royal Wedding, both in personnel and in tone, in a carefully co-ordinated operation by an actress putting on the performance of her life, to celebrate the greatest day of her life.Meghan played it safe with her choice of elegant, stylish dress. For her choice of speaker, she played with fire. Literally.The Most Reverend Michael Curry let rip with surely the most memorable Royal Wedding speech ever heard. A sensational tour de force that cited slaves, quoted Dr Martin Luther King, and spoke repeatedly of the raging power of fire and love.At first, I was startled. What the hell was happening here? Then, I was amused. Was he ever going to stop? The cameras cut to a giggling William, Charles and Camilla, to a stern-faced Queen and Philip, and then to a completely baffled Sir Elton John.As Bishop Curry roused himself to ever-higher decibels, I found myself laughing out loud, as were all my family watching with me at home.Eventually, he finished, and my phone rang. It was my 17-year-old son Bertie, who was at school.‘Dad, did you see that?’ he exclaimed excitedly.‘Yes, hilarious wasn’t it…’  US chat show host Oprah Winfrey waved to cameras as she arrived, and Mumford \u0026amp Sons singer Marcus Mumford and actress wife Carey Mulligan arrived together          Sir Elton John, pictured, wore a pair of ominous rose-tinted spectacles at the wedding. Morgan says: \u0027I would think it’s hard to overstate the significance of the ceremony, beamed live around the world, to black people everywhere\u0027‘No! It was incredible!’ he replied. ‘Can you imagine what this must mean to a black American – seeing a black preacher make that kind of speech at a traditionally white British Royal Wedding? This was history happening right before our eyes. I love this wedding!’His youthful passion and excitement shamed my middle-aged cynicism. Bertie was right.Bishop Curry sent us all to church yesterday and reminded us that at its core this wedding was about race too: a biracial woman from America marrying into the world’s most famous white family.When he finally sat down, the cameras panned to the bride’s mother Doria, sitting alone, diamond nose stud glinting, tears rolling from her eyes.It was very obvious just what the speech meant to her.He was followed by a black gospel choir singing a brilliant version of Stand By Me and 19-year-old black musical genius Sheku Kanneh-Mason playing the cello so beautifully.I would think it’s hard to overstate the significance of the ceremony, beamed live around the world, to black people everywhere. To borrow the words of Dr King, this was a day when little black girls could watch TV and genuinely share little white girls’ long-held dreams of one day marrying a Prince.(And yes, before the tiresome radical feminists start raging, I know not all girls want to be princesses, and I know not all girls now identify as girls…)In the end, though, this was like the greatest Oscars ceremony of all time: just one hour long, with tub-thumpingly brilliant off-piste speeches, musical performances to melt the heart, comedy moments to make you cry with laughter, and raw emotion to just make you cry.I loved seeing Prince Philip, 96, march into the church without a stick just weeks after a hip operation. (Perhaps he should send Thomas Markle a guidebook on how to man-up for important family events?)I loved seeing Prince Charles chivalrously take Meghan’s arm halfway down the aisle and focus so intently on his brief but vital job in delivering her safely to his son.And I loved the bridesmaids and pageboys all desperately trying not to behave too badly and succeeding remarkably well.I also loved the fact that, in direct contrast to most awards ceremonies, the biggest winners were two superstars who the public clearly adore.  Actor Idris Elba arrived with his model fiancée Sabrina Dhowre, both wearing navy blue, and James Corden looked sharp alongside his elegant wife Julia CareyMeghan looked radiantly beautiful, supremely confident, and born to play the role of a princess, even if in fact she’s going to be the Duchess of Sussex, the county where I grew up.Harry looked madly in love, endearingly nervous (His ‘I’m ******** it!’ confession to his bride at the altar spoke for every man at every wedding ever) and carrying the weight of the world’s hopes on his shoulders.We all want this charming, sensitive young man to be happy. Not least because we all remember him trudging so sadly behind the coffin of his mother, Diana.Of course, we have no idea if this marriage will last.The recent matrimonial record of Royal couples is inarguably dreadful and palace life remains such a suffocating force for even the brightest of those, like Meghan and Diana before her, who enter its confines.So, we’ll just have to sit back and hope for the best.But what I do know is that their marriage ceremony was the most enjoyable and unpredictable Royal Wedding I’ve ever experienced.It mixed the best of traditional British pomp and majesty with large dollops of Markle Sparkle and the result was a biracial, Hollywood-fused union of very different cultures that worked magnificently well.As my Good Morning Britain co-presenter Susanna Reid, who only last week reaffirmed to me her lifelong phobia of all things marital, tweeted afterwards: ‘I may have just been converted to weddings.’Since I’m a orcee, I prefer not to give advice to newlyweds. But I can proffer one piece of uncontestable wisdom that is very easy to adopt.Meghan apparently insisted on lots of geraniums at her wedding. They’re one of her favourite flowers. By coincidence, my family motto is based on something that a Covent Garden flower seller once said to my grandmother: ‘Life ain’t much, but it’s all ya got, so stick a geranium in yer ’at and be ’appy.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/22/4C7384D100000578-0-image-a-4_1526765077031.jpg","title":"Oprah Winfrey arrives royal wedding mystery man Stella McCartney dress overnight","story":"    Who dat?: Oprah Winfrey arrived to the royal wedding without Stedman Graham and instead with a mystery man, entering behind Idris Elba          It\u0027s been real: She and the man did part ways however when Oprah went to find her much better seat in St George\u0027s Chapel      Think pink like Oprah in a Stella McCartney midi dressShop the current line here!Achieving best-dressed guest status is no easy feat when you\u0026#39re attending the most anticipated wedding of the year, but we think Oprah Winfrey might be a strong contender for the title!The talk show host donned a custom Stella McCartney midi dress for Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s big day, topping off her look with a bespoke Philip Treacy concertina lace hat with a feather plume.

These days it is used mainly for entertainingIn fact, their dinner party had more in common with a West End club night than a traditional wedding breakfast, with Harry’s favourite House tracks ‘curated’ by DJ Sam Totolee (who also performed at Pippa Middleton’s wedding), a ‘drinks of the world’ themed bar, and candyfloss and ‘dirty burgers’ as midnight snacks.One source reported a cocktail featuring ginger and rum was put on the menu as a cheeky nod to Harry’s red hair. It was named ‘When Harry Met Meghan’, a play on the film When Harry Met Sally.The party was a notably relaxed, more youthful occasion than the afternoon reception.The intimate guestlist of 200 meant there was no room for mere acquaintances, nor even many minor Royals. Pippa Middleton and Harry’s party-girl ex Chelsy Davy were expected to be absentees.There was something of a carnival atmosphere in the gardens of the 230-year-old stately home, which once belonged to King George III. These days it is used mainly for entertaining.The sit-down dinner was strictly organic, sourced at the request of Prince Charles, and the light-bite canapes were themed ‘spring meets summer’. The meal, paid for by the Prince of Wales, started at 7.30pm and finished at around 10pm.Its three courses were understood to have been peppered with ‘naughty’ speeches from Prince William and a joint effort from Tom Inskip, known as ‘Skippy’ and Tom Van Straubenzee. Any crude nods to Prince Harry’s playboy past were held back until the older guests had departed.Prince Harry took his new wife Meghan Markle out for a spin in a Jaguar that was hailed as \u0027the most beautiful electric car in the world\u0027          The revamped classic car\u0027s number plate read \u0027E190518\u0027 - a tribute to the newlywed\u0027s wedding date. It also had an EU stamp on the plate Inskip – Harry’s closest confidante – was also under strict instructions to downplay Prince Harry’s Las Vegas trips – all before he met Meghan.Guests are also understood to have returned to London late last night for an ‘after-after party’ at celebrity favourite Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone. Another party had been planned in a soundproofed private home in Chelsea.It was quite a contrast with the earlier ‘stand-up’ wedding breakfast in Windsor Castle’s St George’s Hall, which saw 600 guests enjoy ‘bowl food’ and canapes such as Scottish langoustines wrapped in smoked salmon, croquette of confit Windsor Lamb and champagne and pistachio macarons. Harry and his father then gave speeches. Suhani Jalota, the founder of the India-based Myna Mahila charity, said of Harry’s speech: ‘He was talking about his wife. Everybody was clapping because it was the first time he was using that term for Meghan so it was really nice.’She described a speech by the Prince of Wales as ‘lovely’, adding: ‘Essentially it was just about how Harry was as a child and growing up. And about the couple and how beautiful they are together.’Another guest said: ‘Charles nailed it in his speech.

Harry and Meghan had already spoken in their engagement interview of their passion for the Commonwealth and their hopes for engaging with its young people.

Within a few months, the couple had visited every country in the United Kingdom and she appeared to take it all in her stride. Displaying characteristic confidence, she would often introduce herself without waiting for Harry to show her the way.Meghan will be 37 on August 4, so it is likely that starting a family will be a priority. It is something they would both like.Three years ago, after I revealed Harry was quitting the Army, I asked the Prince: ‘What are you going to do next?’ ‘You’ll probably know before me,’ he joked. But he soon became reflective, saying that he wanted to use his celebrity for the good of others.We spoke about his plans to focus on his charity work and a desire to spend ‘a significant period abroad’ on field projects in Africa, which he later did. But mostly he was driven to give back, especially to former military colleagues, as well as to continue his mother’s legacy in helping to eradicate AIDS.          The couple’s first real test will be a major overseas assignment in October: a Commonwealth tour taking in Australia – where Harry will open his Invictus Games – New Zealand, and the islands of Tonga and Fiji"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/20/00/4C743B1800000578-5749359-image-m-73_1526774319518.jpg","title":"Royal Wedding Harry bride dressed page boys bridesmaids match themselves","story":"    For all the four page boys and six bridesmaids who made up Meghan’s Mini Army, it was a triumph  Look chic in a yellow coat like the Duchess of Cambridge in Alexander McQueenClick to shop the brand!Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s wedding must have taken the Duchess of Cambridge back to her own royal nuptials, so we weren\u0026#39t surprised to see she that she opted for another Alexander McQueen design.

The stunning leather interior of the car driven by the Duke of Sussex away from Windsor CastleIt was known in-house as ‘Project Dylan’, a nod to singer-song-writer Bob Dylan’s controversial switch in the mid 1960-s from acoustic to electric guitar when one traditionalist fan shouted ‘Judas.’But converting the classic E-Type means owners can ‘future proof’ their classic cars, says Jaguar. The original engine can even, if required, be swapped back.It can accelerate from rest to 62mph in 5.5 seconds – about a second faster than the original petrol version – with a top speed 150mph. However, with Prince Harry at the wheel he appeared to be taking things much more sensibly.The electric E-Type claims a ‘real world’ range of about 170 miles though that could increase to just over 200 miles. So there was little risk of running out of juice for the short hop between engagements at Windsor.It can be fully charged at home overnight in about six to seven hours with the fuel cap flap opening to reveal the electric charging point.          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex drive off from Windsor Castle in a fully electric version of Jaguar’s legendary E-Type sports car          Prince Harry took his new wife Meghan Markle out for a spin in a Jaguar that was hailed as \u0027the most beautiful electric car in the world\u0027If they had time to to avert their gaze from each other, the road ahead, and the cheering well-wishers, Harry and Meghan may have had time to admire how the original dashboard has been replaced with hi-tech carbon-fibre and the classic instruments given a digital revamp with hi-tech ‘virtual’ dials showing road speed and engine speed.But all other underpinnings, including brakes and suspension are the same, to ensure it still drives like the ‘original’ E-Type.The one-off electric E-Type would cost around £350,000 although Jaguar says prices could drop as more orders are received. But with its new royal connection, this one could now be priceless.Tim Hannig, director, Jaguar Land Rover Classic, said other models could follow: ‘Our aim with E-type Zero is to future-proof classic car ownership.’‘The Jaguar E-type Zero not only drives and looks like an E-type, it also offers outstanding performance. It’s quicker than an original E-type: 0-62mph takes only 5.5 sec, about one second quicker than a Series 1 E-type. But it is authentic to its DNA.’Jaguar said the restored Series 1.5 Roadster is’ totally original apart from its 21st century electric powertrain and modified instrumentation and facia. It also has LED headlights to save energy. The Zero’s lithium-ion battery pack has the same dimensions as the original XK six-cylinder petrol engine and sits in precisely the same place. The 220kW motor lies just behind the battery pack where the original gearbox used to be.          Under the bonnet: Jaguar have replaced the powerful petrol engine with a zero emissions electric motor and plug-in battery          The boot of the stunning Jaguar driven by the Duke of Sussex on Saturday after his weddingOne of Jaguar’s own restored ‘Reborn’ range – with a petrol engine - would be £280,000. Classic E-Types can cost from around £70,000, depending on condition. Back in the 1960s a new E-Type cost just a few thousand pounds.The electric E-Type Zero was one of three battery-powered cars that Jaguar showcased at its special ‘Tech Fest’ event in London last Autumn.Jaguar Land Rover chief executive officer Dr Ralf Speth said: ‘Every new Jaguar Land Rover model line will be electrified from 2020, giving our customers even more choice. We will introduce a portfolio of electrified products across our model range, embracing fully electric, plug-in hybrid and mild hybrid vehicles.’There is already a strong link between the Royal Family and Jaguar Land Rover.In April Prince Charles became the first VIP to be seen in Jaguar’s new I-PACE electric car – on the day that the heir to the throne was confirmed as the Queen’s successor as head of the Commonwealth.He used the all-new electric Jaguar I-PACE for official duties at during the Commonwealth Heads of Government (CHOGM) meetings – having been kept abreast of its hi-tech and environmentally-friendly development towards more ‘green’ electric cars for more than a year.The new I-PACE was unveiled at the Geneva motor in Spring with first customer deliveries begin in June priced from £62,000 to £84,000. The zero-emissions coupe accelerates from rest to 60mph in just 4.5 seconds with a top speed of 298 miles and enough battery charge to drive 300 miles from London to Newcastle on one charge.Jaguar Land Rover his the only car maker to hold three royal warrants: from the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Charles. JLR’s German-born chief executive Dr Ralf Speth has an honorary knighthood, which ca be granted to foreign nations, but recently took up UK citizenship.The Queen is regularly seen and photographed driving Land Rovers around her royal estates and, as Hon Second Subaltern Princess Elizabeth, trained during the war as a truck mechanic with the Territorial Service ‘ATS’.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/20/18/4C78CD8B00000578-5750501-One_runner_asks_the_driver_Are_you_f_stupid_as_another_says_I_m_-a-4_1526837413876.jpg","title":"Astonishing moment motorist drives car path half marathon runners ignoring restrictions","story":"    Driver was caught on camera in Plymouth knocking over a cone and almost injuring runners as they attempt to block the vehicle ploughing into participants in the city\u0027s half marathon          One runner asks the driver \u0027Are you f******* stupid?\u0027 as another says \u0027I\u0027m a police officer you\u0027re breaking the law\u0027          There\u0027s no indication the woman wanted to cause any harm and goes on to explain she\u0027s attempting to get out of the city to work, not knowing which way to go          More runners pile in and say \u0027The road is closed, you\u0027re just going to have to wait and another adds \u0027don\u0027t be so stupid, you\u0027re going to kill someone\u0027          A Plymouth City council Highways official races over, telling the driver \u0027don\u0027t move, stay there\u0027           The woman then replies: \u0027I can\u0027t get out...listen, I have tried to get out every which way\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/20/16/4C78C42300000578-0-image-a-155_1526830114410.jpg","title":"Chelsea Flower garden sponsored Russian bank set Putin ally sanctioned US","story":"Last month America sanctioned Russian businessman, Andrey Kostin, 61, president and chairman of its sister company, VTB Bank          The President Vladimir Putin ally previously described sanctions against Russia as ‘economic war’          Allyson Peace puts the finishing touches to The Solar System display by the National Chrysanthemum Society.

If sponsorship is about having a dialogue with your audience, there are more ways to do that than there used to be.’The cost of creating a show garden is estimated between £200,000 and £330,000, the RHS suggests.And if a company wants ‘any hope of winning a gold medal’ it could cost them a staggering £500,000, one insider says.Last year, chaos erupted when Chelsea’s headline sponsor, the investment manager M\u0026ampG, said it would end its partnership with the RHS.Eventually M\u0026ampG was persuaded to stay on for another three years at what is understood to be at a discounted rate.The RHS said: ‘When the partnership came to an end in 2017, M\u0026ampG looked at a number of other marketing and sponsorship options in the UK but quickly came to the conclusion that there was little out there to compare with Chelsea.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/21/4C69303E00000578-0-image-m-15_1526674822022.jpg","title":"After tackling man eating crocodiles filming love scenes easy Roger Moore writes","story":"Today is B-day 36 — the 36th day of filming my first James Bond movie, Live And Let DieThe farm is run by the amazing Ross Kananga. He has more than 1,300 crocodiles and alligators and a unique ability to coax them to him by imitating their mating calls. Although his father, a crocodile wrestler, was killed by the creatures, Ross still holds them in some bewildering form of affection.One of the film unit asks Ross how he can tell the difference between the males and the females. He replies: \u0027Oh, that\u0027s easy. The girls have such pretty, petite faces.\u0027Ross has lent his surname to Live And Let Die. Tom Mankiewicz, the scriptwriter, liked the sound of the name Kananga and has called one of our characters Dr Kananga after him.The 007 love scene that drove my wife crazy – and sparked a...Mayfair casino once popular with Princess Margaret, Roger...Share this articleJoining us for the first time in this far-from-jolly location today is Julius Harris who plays Tee Hee, the chilling heavy who has a steel snipping claw on his artificial arm.Today\u0027s scene is where Bond is in captivity and introduced to the crocodiles by Tee Hee, who is casually feeding them chicken with this gadget.Julius and I watch, sweating and waiting on jelly knees as Ross summons the beasts with his special call. As the crocs slither around, my colleague struggles manfully to claw up the chicken and fling it at their snapping jaws.          Today\u0027s scene is where Bond is in captivity and introduced to the crocodiles by Tee Hee, who is casually feeding them chicken with this gadgetOne piece sticks to his hook and a croc seems to have its eye on it, causing Julius to back away somewhat smartly then another piece of chicken falls to his feet unnoticed by us — but not by an 8ft croc, which is torpedoing towards us to get it until someone kicks the grisly lump of meat into the swamp in the nick of time.Rather to our relief, Harry Saltzman, the co-producer, says that tomorrow the main unit, including me, will switch to the bus chase sequence, while the second unit stays to get painstaking shots of the crocs crunching their chicken.B-Day 38. At this stage in the plot, Bond becomes a bus driver. I jump into the driving seat, Jane Seymour — who plays Solitaire — clambers aboard, and we use it to escape from pursuing police. This bus, shipped over from London, is a normal double-decker that has spent the best years of its life on the No 19 run.In preparation for the scene in which it whizzes under a low bridge, the upper deck has been cut away and placed on rollers so that when the crash comes it will shoot spectacularly backwards, leaving Bond and Solitaire in the bottom half.In charge of the bus and here to teach me how to handle it is Maurice Patchett, a London Transport driving instructor who has flown in specially.          Rather to our relief, Harry Saltzman, the co-producer, says that tomorrow the main unit, including me, will switch to the bus chase sequenceB-Day 39. A slow day. It looks as if we might all be stuck here for Christmas — efforts to charter a plane back to Britain for December have hit trouble. I would not be too disturbed by the thought as my family is with me, but there would be a revolt among the film crew who would miss their wives, children and Christmas cheer.B-Day 40. If I never land another film role, I can always get a job on the buses. To qualify as a London bus driver takes ten days\u0027 instruction, and Maurice says that I am doing very nicely indeed.The cab of a London bus is full of gadgets. Maurice is particularly careful to explain the function of a small red flag that drops down in an emergency.\u0027When you see that,\u0027 he warns, \u0027put your foot down on the brake and don\u0027t lift it off again because you don\u0027t get a second chance. It means your brakes have gone.\u0027For the first shot, I have to drive the bus fast for 20ft to where an electrician stands in the road with sun reflector boards to get the proper lighting effect.The boards are striking the sun right into my eyes and, as I take off as fast as I can, it is difficult to see where to stop. I do it four times, each time getting a little faster, so the electricians with the reflector boards are side-stepping more rapidly each time.On the last take, I hit the brake and down comes the red flag I keep my foot down hard and pull on the handbrake. If Maurice hadn\u0027t told me about it, there would have been one electrician as flat as his reflector board, under an AEC Regent London bus.Amazingly, we get the shots we want, and first time. A tremendous end to B-Day 40.B-Day 47. Fire and 1,300 ferocious crocodiles make this a day to remember, and I am lucky to have lost no more than the hair on my hands and arms.We shoot the scene where Bond, encircled by crocodiles, escapes from the island near a shed where the villains\u0027 workers are packing heroin. Bond surrounds it with benzene-soaked rags and rubber, and lays a trail of chicken pieces from the swamp to the shed door.An alligator slithers from the swamp, follows the trail through a gate and inside the shed. We see workers tumbling over each other to get out of the door on the other side, but Bond has lit the rags and ringed the building in flames.To escape from the island, Bond makes a death-defying leap over the crocodile-infested water. I am glad we get this shot in the can quickly because I must confess my \u0027bottle\u0027 is twitching.\u0027Bottle\u0027, for those unfamiliar with rhyming slang, is short for \u0027bottle and glass\u0027, which rhymes with what was twitching.          We are moving back to Britain, where most of the rest of the film will be shot at Pinewood Studios, not far from my homeWhen it comes to the burning building, our special effects have a field day. The shed is circled in a sheet of fire, and before I can dodge back the licking flames have singed all the hair off my hands and arms.However, the whole thing goes beautifully, and our star alligator, Daisy, crawls on cue through the gate and into the hut.Ross has had Daisy since she was eight, and she is now 30. From the moment he saw the Live And Let Die script, Ross trained her to walk up the bank at a certain spot, choosing a nice, shady place she fancied, and fed her there.When Daisy was familiar with her walk, the construction team then moved in and built the hut at the end of it. Daisy is quite a tough lady she is the alligator who killed two crocodiles and duffed up three more, losing half her teeth in the conflict, which upset Ross because she is unlikely to grow any more.Personally, I confess that I am not at all perturbed.B-Day 49. We are moving back to Britain, where most of the rest of the film will be shot at Pinewood Studios, not far from my home.After a lot of transatlantic telephone talking, a DC-10 charter flight for England has been fixed for December 20, and before then we must have a clear day to pack our ten tons of equipment, plus personal belongings and close the offices.It\u0027s hard to believe it\u0027s nearly Christmas. The children are looking forward to going home to the pony and the dog I am looking forward to Sunday papers, English marmalade, frosty mornings and seeing my mother and father.B-Day 58. My big love scene with Jane. Despite the fact that her father-in-law, Richard Attenborough, is one of my best friends, and her husband, Michael, has had dinner at our house, it is still an enjoyable experience, even if she is wearing thick tights and knickers under her flimsy negligee!It reminds me of something Joan Collins said when she visited us for lunch on Sunday with her husband, Ron Kass. Doing a love scene with a leading man she detested, she armed herself with tights and the heaviest pair of football socks that she could find. Jane, cuddling a hot water bottle between takes, complains of the cold, but stoically reminds herself that it is all in a good cause.B-Day 59. I get out of bed, do my work-out, have a shower, shave, brush my teeth, get dressed, eat my breakfast of scrambled eggs, get into the car, drive to the studio, take my clothes off, and get back into bed with Jane Seymour. It\u0027s a hell of a way to earn a living!B-Day 64. We are having dramas with the première date because the Duke of Edinburgh won\u0027t be available, nor will Princess Anne, nor Prince Charles, who is at sea with the Royal Navy. It looks like the date will have to be changed.B-Day 66 and I have spent a romantic weekend in Paris with my wife Luisa after an early wrap on Friday.The weekend isn\u0027t all pleasure, though. Co-producer Harry Saltzman asks me if I will visit the Crazy Horse cabaret, and look the girls over for a likely lass to play a scene in the picture that calls for a busty beauty.Ever devoted to duty, I stoically sit through two hours of striptease, and Luisa kindly comes along, too.I pass my opinion to Harry and tell him that, if really necessary, I will go back and have another look with him.Oh, the burdens of Bond!          We are having dramas with the première date because the Duke of Edinburgh won\u0027t be available, nor will Princess Anne, nor Prince Charles, who is at sea with the Royal NavyBrenda Arnau, who was such a success on the London stage in Oh! Calcutta!, appears in the movie as a club singer performing the Live And Let Die title song.Paul McCARTNEY has written it, and I have lunch today with the man who is arranging it, George Martin. It is a tremendous piece of music, and I will stick my neck out and say that three weeks from its release it will be No. 1.B-Day 75 is the day I bed my third Bond girl: a lovely Italian secret agent played by the voluptuous Madeline Smith. Our pillow appointment is in a bed in Bond\u0027s London mews — in other words an elegantly furnished construction on \u0027B\u0027 stage at Pinewood.First-time visitors to a film studio are always struck by the fact that sets built for interior shots rarely have roofs, so that light can blaze in from above. As a result, Madeline and I are exposed to freezing draughts, and the bed is icy.Props have not provided hot water bottles, no doubt taking the view that anyone in bed with Madeline will find them superfluous. I bound and rebound in and out of bed all morning, my feet freezing with every leap.It would tarnish Bond\u0027s image to wear woolly socks, and I envy Madeline, who, though bare from the waist up, can slide under the bed clothes she squeals every time my cold feet touch her knees.At this point in the story, Miss Moneypenny — the secretary of secret service boss M — has delivered to Bond an intriguing magnetic watch.During the preamble to the encounter in bed, James embraces the signorina, then, holding the watch magnet near the back zip on her dress, draws his wrist down her spine without touching her.The metal zip responds and the dress falls to the floor.\u0027What a gentle touch you have, James,\u0027 she whispers.\u0027Sheer magnetism,\u0027 I reply.It may seem money for jam being pressed close to the beautiful Madeline, but on the 20th take, your arm is aching, you\u0027ve got cramp in your left foot and your right knee is going to sleep.Part of the trouble is that Madeline\u0027s dress just will not fall far enough down. Costume designer Julie Harris has to go on her knees off camera and gently pull the dress down.As the watch isn\u0027t really magnetic, assistant director Derek Cracknell, nicknamed Crackers, is also on his knees with his hands up Madeline\u0027s skirt, pulling a hidden wire attached to the zip — so the floor around our feet is starting to get pretty crowded.When I arrive home, the children ask me, as they always do: \u0027What did you do today, Daddy?\u0027I\u0027m not quite sure what to tell them. I can hardly say: \u0027I was in bed with a lady this morning, and I made 20 attempts to take her dress off this afternoon.\u0027After so many months, it is a depleted crowd that flies back to New York to complete the final scenes — it has even crossed my mind that the producers are trying to get out of paying me by having me bumped off in the car chase scenes on Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive expressway.Be that as it may, I am still not ready for the phone call that comes on the evening of B-Day 84.It is Crackers, saying with qualifying caution learned from years in the picture business: \u0027All being equal, that is, if the rushes are okayed tomorrow afternoon from London, you are finished on the picture.\u0027This is it, then. The party is over. I feel a terrible sense of anti-climax. Numbed, I mix myself a very stiff drink.Luisa and I are leaving for California Bond co-producer Cubby Broccoli and his wife Dana have kindly loaned us their house in Beverly Hills, Hollywood, where I have been asked to present the Oscar for \u0027Best Actor\u0027.Without wishing to sound too partisan, I hope I hand it to my mate, Michael Caine, nominated for his performance in Sleuth.Later, Joan Collins and husband Ron Kass are bringing our children to join us at the Acapulco house of English songwriter Leslie Bricusse and his wife Evie, where I will recuperate from the rigours of Bond.After jetting the bayous in boats, whizzing around in a wingless plane, courting bites by crocodiles, and crashing cars, I will always wryly recall my last line in Live And Let Die. Delivered to the driver on the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive expressway, it is: \u0027Easy, Charlie, let\u0027s get there in one piece.\u0027Give or take a tooth, I have.Adapted from The 007 Diaries: Filming Live And Let Die by Sir Roger Moore, published by The History Press on June 1 at £14.99. © Roger Moore 2018.

And yet Doria’s loneliness on the bride’s side was brutally obvious.And there was her hand, fluttering, for one uncertain moment, towards Prince Charles. Immediately, his hand reached out towards hers and, in a gesture that seemed to symbolise the joining of two very different families, she held on to it firmly as he gently pulled her into the group.No face in the chapel on Saturday glowed with pleasure as hers did at that moment, even more than when it was turned towards the Most Rev Michael Curry, drinking in his fervent and unexpectedly lengthy message of love.For her, there were tears, too, moments before her daughter entered through the West Door to make her solitary progress halfway down the aisle to the top of the nave. Quickly, Doria controlled her emotions. Not easy for her. Indeed, nothing was easy for her last week.Sore heads? Wills and Kate cover their eyes with sunglasses...George who-ney? Police keep actor and his wife waiting for...Share this articleAs she flew alone to Heathrow on an 11-hour flight from Los Angeles on Wednesday, family discord threatened to overshadow her daughter’s big day. Although, of course, it was her ex-husband’s side of the family and did not directly affect her.Meghan’s personal assistant, Amy Pickerill, was at the airport to greet her and take her to Kensington Palace. After that came 48 dazzling hours when Meghan’s sole family representative had tea with Prince Charles and Camilla at Clarence House and then with the Queen and Prince Philip at Windsor Castle.With Charles and Camilla, she felt comfortable and welcomed. What made it so much easier was that Meghan was there with Harry, with his jokes and easy manner. At least she had met Harry before, at the Invictus Games in Toronto.With the Queen, though, it was not quite so easy as they talked over tea (a blend of Darjeeling and Assam) and fruit cake in the Oak Room, where Her Majesty has tea every day in her private apartment in the castle.  Charles and Doria pictured in St George\u0027s Chapel at the wedding of Harry and Meghan MarkleAlthough the Queen has a lifetime of experience making uneasy guests feel at home, Doria was nervous at first. However, by the time she was saying her goodbyes 40 minutes later, she was much more relaxed.At 61, Doria Ragland had suddenly been elevated into the social stratosphere. But why should we be surprised that she rose so superbly to the occasion? Those who know Meghan’s family have always noted that the actress gets her brains and her fluency from her mother.Doria’s start in life was as the bright, only child of a single mother whose parents were the bell-boy and lift-girl in a hotel in Cleveland, Ohio – a five-star establishment for white guests only. She was in the top academic stream at school but, money being short, didn’t go to university and instead began training as a make-up artist.It was on the set of ABC’s popular TV series General Hospital that she met the show’s lighting director Tom Markle, a orced man with two children, and married him.Meghan was their only child before they in turn orced, though amicably, even continuing to go on holidays together. One can only wonder what her ex-husband, apparently unable to be at the wedding because of a recent operation, felt as he watched Doria on the arm of the Prince of Wales.The truth is that Doria has conducted herself with extraordinary dignity since it emerged that her only daughter was marrying the Queen’s grandson.Never an attention-grabber, her work in Los Angeles as a yoga instructor and social worker, particularly among the elderly, has not allowed the excitement or the sudden spotlight to change anything about the way she goes about her life. Never for her the staged paparazzi pictures her ex-husband so foolishly allowed himself to do. No interviews. No efforts to profit from her daughter’s happiness.           Doria Ragland, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall walk down the steps of the chapelThat said, her daughter becoming the Duchess of Sussex changes things. Being an in-law to the royal family hasn’t meant too much to the parents of sons or daughters who have married into the Firm.Traditionally, they would be welcomed by the royal family, share the wedding and then summarily be forgotten. For example, the mother of Mark Phillips, Princess Anne’s first husband, complained that she and her husband were ‘virtually ignored and never invited to anything by the palace’.That attitude changed with the arrival of Kate Middleton.Even before she and Prince William married, her parents, Michael and Carole, were regularly extended invitations to royal homes. They have stayed as guests at Balmoral and Sandringham.William has insisted they are included in royal gatherings – they’ve been guests of the Queen at Royal Ascot, participating in the carriage drive down the course.Harry will want to go the same way, and for royal doors to be as open to Meghan’s mum Doria as they are to the Middletons.For now, at least, Meghan’s mother will continue to live 5,500 miles away in LA and go to work as normal, so her participation in royal life is hardly likely to be as frequent as Mike and Carole Middleton.But judging by the way she linked arms with Prince Charles on the steps of the chapel, when those embossed invitations come she’ll certainly be able to handle it."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/20/22/4C6B8C6C00000578-5751241-image-a-43_1526853472685.jpg","title":"So Beckhams Clooneys invited royal wedding","story":"Take style tips from Julia in a dress by Tom FordFind it at Farfetch!Deciding what to wear to a wedding can be tricky at the best of times, but when it\u0026#39s the wedding of the century...

The Royal Wedding hits and misses by LIZ JONESThere were no real clangers on the big day. No outrageous hats from Eugenie and Beatrice. No outrageous bottoms threatening to eclipse the bride. There were only two slight faux pas: Amal Clooney threatened to outshine the sun, and the mother of the bride wore mint while the Queen chose lime: almost, almost a colour clash.On the whole, the female guests – particularly the Royals – had put in time and effort to get it right, and had clearly been poring over the springsummer catwalk photos to make sure they were all bang on trend. Hence, there was lots of asymmetric tailoring on show, so much so many assumed Windsor had been built on a hill. The HITS              Pippa Middleton in a £495 print by British label The Fold.

The length of skirts proved problematical: either a tad too short, a la Eugenie and Joss Stone, or midi length, which looks great on teenage supermodels but a little droopy drawers on normal women.Not too many gloves on show: the Duchess of York, a surprise hit on the day, was a rare fan, with a short navy pair, and the Queen, of course, wore hers.Hats were all proper structures, and not half-baked fascinators. And, thank the Lord, on such a hot day there were plenty of pretty open shoes displaying toe cleavage: not possible if the ceremony had taken place in a cathedral.Heels, though, were as high as the sun in the sky.Rumour has it slippers were handed out later for those who could no longer teeter after yet another glass of champagne             Amal Clooney chose a marigold dress by Stella McCartney with a bow at the back and a train            Singer Joss Stone sported shorter hair and swapped her hippy look for a girly print            Carole Middleton looks very elegant in Princess Diana\u0027s favourite atelier Catherine Walker            Pastel Stella McCartney for Oprah Winfrey, with a Philip Treacy turkey and pheasant feather hat            Countess of Wessex wears ice-blue satin by London couturier Suzannah and hat by Jane Taylor            Meghan\u0027s Suits co-star Gina Torres in a very elegant floral tea dress by Costarellos            Fergie was a picture of elegance on Saturday as she paired a navy skirt suit with a Jess Collet hat and towering heelsThe MISSES            Sofia Wellesley, James Blunt\u0027s wife, is in new season Valentino.

Some even believed the space in front of the Queen was left empty for Princess DianaThen there was the bridal bouquet of forget-me-nots — the Princess’s favourite — that Harry hand-picked from the walled garden at Nottingham Cottage, his home at Kensington Palace.The ring Meghan wore to the evening reception had been a gift to Diana in 1996. After her orce, when she no longer wanted to wear her sapphire engagement ring — now worn by Kate — it sometimes appeared on the third finger of her left hand.Both rings were part of Diana’s small personal jewel collection — there were also aquamarine drop earrings and a charm bracelet bought by Prince Charles. Not much really, for the mother of a future King, and nowhere near the amount of jewellery the Prince has since lavished on the Duchess of Cornwall.All the other major pieces Diana had were returned to the Royal Collection after she died, but Harry and William inherited her privately owned trinkets.Each has used these treasured pieces for the truly significant moments in their lives.\u0027Keep waving, Philip!\u0027: Lip reader reveals the Queen\u0027s...The moment Prince Charles grabbed Doria\u0027s hand, she was one...Share this articleBut perhaps the most indelible element of Diana’s legacy was not in any physical object but in the choice of speaker for the ceremony’s only reading — her sister, Lady Jane Fellowes.Some might think she would not ordinarily have been the most obvious choice. Diana was closer to her eldest sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, who often accompanied her on official engagements as a lady-in-waiting.And Jane’s marriage to the Queen’s then private secretary, Sir Robert — now Lord — Fellowes, with whom Diana quarrelled, had created tension between the two women.Harry, however, wanted it to be Aunt Jane. He is close to the Fellowes’s children, Laura, Alexander and Eleanor. As youngsters they lived and played together at Kensington Palace and there were memorable holidays to Necker Island, Sir Richard Branson’s Caribbean hideaway.Visits to Aunt Sarah and her children at their home in Lincolnshire were less frequent.  The ring Meghan wore to the evening reception had been a gift to Diana in 1996. After her orce, when she no longer wanted to wear her sapphire engagement ring — now worn by Kate — it sometimes appeared on the third finger of her left hand.Tellingly, William also asked Jane’s daughter Laura to be godmother to Princess Charlotte.Indeed, these deep links ensure that for both Harry and William, their mother continues to play a huge part in their lives.Only four years separated Diana from Jane, and many listening to her read from the Song of Solomon in St George’s Chapel were mentally transported back to Jane’s powerful contribution at Diana’s funeral.Then, her voice, cracking with emotion, had sounded so like Diana’s.In the intervening years, she has remained the most low-profile of the Spencer family. So low, indeed, that many were surprised she agreed to carry out such a prominent role.She spoke the lines with feeling but you could sense that, unlike the bride, she is a woman used to living a totally private life and who, for the best of reasons, had taken her courage in both hands to do something this public.For her part, it was perhaps a healing act — and with Harry’s overture to her, a similar gesture on his side. We all recall the harsh, long-scarring words of the Spencer sisters’ little brother Charles, Earl Spencer, at Diana’s funeral, when he spoke of Diana’s ‘blood family’ — a phrase interpreted as deeply wounding to the Windsors.In all circumstances, how appropriate it was for Jane and her husband to be sitting in the sovereign stall where the Queen normally sits. And, significantly, the couple were on the steps near Harry and Meghan when they had their first kiss as man and wife.This was proof, surely, that Meghan and the Spencers are going to get to know one another very well in the coming months.Meanwhile, sprinkled among the congregation in some of the most prized seats, were friends of Diana who played key roles in her life.There was Carolyn Bartholomew, with her husband William, in the front of the choir, facing the best man and the Prince of Wales. She is Harry’s godmother and was one of three young women who shared Diana’s Earl’s Court flat and was privy to the secret when she first met Charles.Willie Van Straubenzee, Diana’s tennis partner and confidant, was across the aisle from her friend Julia Samuel and her husband Michael — she is Trustee and Founder Patron of Child Bereavement UK, a charity with which Meghan and Harry have formed strong links.Diana’s childhood friend, the former Lady Carolyn Herbert — who is married to John Warren, who oversees the Queen’s equine interests — was sitting alongside George Clooney.Poignantly, Harry’s one-time nanny Jessie Webb, whom Diana hired, was seated next to Princess Anne’s son, Peter Phillips.No royal ceremony, it seems, is complete without Sir Elton John, who has been entertaining the Queen’s guests since Prince Andrew’s 21st birthday party in 1981. It was there that Diana, not yet married, first met Elton — the pair danced the Charleston for 20 minutes.  Perhaps the most indelible element of Diana’s legacy was not in any physical object but in the choice of speaker for the ceremony’s only reading — her sister, Lady Jane Fellowes (left). Diana was closer to her eldest sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, but Harry chose Jane who they visited regularly as kidsIt was a friendship at first sight, but their relationship was complicated at times.In 1997 they fell out after the pop star used pictures of Diana and the boys, among others of semi-nude models, for a charity fundraising book. They were reconciled at the funeral of the murdered fashion designer Gianni Versace.Six weeks later, Diana was dead.Elton performed at Diana’s funeral and because Harry knew how much his mother had loved Elton’s music, he invited him to attend the wedding — and to perform at the reception.One intriguing element of the day that was noted by many television viewers was the empty seat in front of the Queen and next to Prince William.Could it have been a deliberate and profoundly emotional gesture by Harry, leaving a space for his absent mother?As touching as this sounds, the real reason is more mundane.Remember that St George’s is the Queen’s private chapel and this particular seat is one she doesn’t find comfortable. Nor, under protocol, can anyone sit in front of her.So no one did.For many, however, it served as an emotional symbol of Harry’s deep sadness that his mother could not be there. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/00/4C6DE1E800000578-5751563-image-a-5_1526860191218.jpg","title":"Copy blue number worn Meghans best friend Miss Mulroney available online 1 000","story":"    A pop-up collection by Di Carlo Couture went live on the morning of the wedding with the ‘Jessica’ dress – a replica of Miss Mulroney’s form-fitting number, available to purchase for £1,100Her seven-year-old twin boys Brian and John played a key part in the wedding ceremony, carrying the bride’s train.But mother Jessica Mulroney appears to be carving out a starring role of her own.While the 37-year-old Canadian mother-of-three, who is Meghan’s best friend and closest confidante, was circumspect online, the style guru and her outfits were plastered over social media by her associates.The PR consultant and bridal expert, who has been dubbed Toronto’s Gwyneth Paltrow, met Meghan when the actress moved to the city to film US legal drama Suits and the pair bonded over a love of yoga.Over the weekend Instagram addict Miss Mulroney posted just a single photograph on her Instagram account – a picture of her twins holding Meghan’s train as she walked up the steps of St George’s Chapel on Saturday. ‘Proud friend.

Dotted throughout the gardens to entertain the guests were outdoor games, including a giant chessboard, fairground performers and stalls offering late-night snacks – from burger and ice cream vans to candy floss kiosks and bars stocked with several types of expensive whisky.Bespoke cocktails were flowing from a ‘round the world’ bar, whose top offering was the ‘When Harry Met Meghan’, combining rum and ginger beer – a cheeky nod to the colour of the groom’s hair.Musical entertainment came from DJ Sam Totolee, a celebrity favourite who has previously played at the weddings of both Pippa Middleton and Rod Stewart, and Uma Thurman’s engagement party.Harry is said to have danced ‘furiously’ to the DJ’s set – which included the controversial drug-themed hit I Took A Pill In Ibiza – at Pippa’s wedding last May, and had put him under strict instructions to ‘avoid cheese’ and stick to trendy house music and R\u0026ampB.          Harry looked very emotional at points in the service and several others in the congregation were in tears on their happy day         Harry and Meghan exchanged vows and then rings as the couple married after a whirlwind romance               Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland, who the star calls her rock, was in tears ahead of her daughter\u0027s big entrance         Meghan walked halfway through the church before being met Prince Charles at the Quire who took her to Harry         Meghan walks down the aisle in St George\u0027s Chapel at the start of the royal wedding ceremony in Windsor         Meghan, wearing her bridal veil, smiles at her groom Prince Harry as she arrives at the wedding ceremony in Windsor              Meghan smiles broadly during her wedding to Prince Harry at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor         The Archbishop of Canterbury smiles as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle stand at the altar at St George\u0027s Chapel         Harry and Meghan hold hands as they walk out of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding ceremony       Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland (far left) stands next to Prince Charles, Camilla, George, William, Charlotte and Kate on the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding         Prince Harry watches as his father, Prince Charles, accompanies Meghan Markle down the aisle at St George\u0027s Chapel         The train of Meghan\u0027s dress trails down the aisle as she and Prince Harry stand in front of Archbishop Justin WelbyAt one point later in the evening, British actor Idris Elba – who has DJ’d in some of the world’s top clubs – apparently took over for a brief turn on the decks. But that didn’t stop Meghan from making her own musical requests, and she is believed to have been behind the list of Sixties soul songs that were played by covers band Atlantic Soul Orchestra, which calls itself ‘the country’s hardest-hitting and most authentic soul band’. Its musicians have toured and recorded with groups including Take That, Girls Aloud and Sir Elton John.Their set list included My Girl by the Temptations Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I’m Yours by Stevie Wonder Marvin Gaye’s How Sweet It Is and Ain’t No Mountain High Enough Soul Man by Sam and Dave and Knock On Wood by Eddie Floyd.The reception went on into the early hours, with music and cheering heard as far away as Windsor’s Long Walk. Even as the clock struck midnight, guests could be heard singing along enthusiastically to Respect by Aretha Franklin, and Dancing In The Street by Martha and the Vandellas.The newlyweds’ first dance is believed to have followed a similar theme, with Harry and Meghan eschewing a slow song for the 1966 hit Land Of A Thousand Dances by American soul singer Wilson Pickett (not, as has been reported elsewhere, Whitney Houston’s I Wanna Dance With Somebody).The final coaches departed Frogmore House around 3.30am, with insiders reporting that George Clooney was among the last to stagger off the dancefloor, having earlier shown off his moves alongside actor Tom Hardy. Bleary-eyed revellers were offered bacon or sausage sandwiches for the journey home.A select few were then invited to the late-night party which reportedly took place at celebrity haunt Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone, followed by a private party in a sound-proofed home in Chelsea. It is not known if the bride or groom accompanied them.Yesterday morning, though the newlyweds – who spent the night at Windsor Castle – were nowhere to be seen, several of the guests appeared rather the worse for wear.A weary looking James Corden was seen checking out of Coworth Park with his wife at 8am, while Jessica Mulroney did not emerge from her £600-a-night room before lunchtime. A fresh-faced Serena Williams was one of the few to make it down to breakfast.Rugby player Will Greenwood left with his wife Caroline around 9.40am, followed by Meghan’s Suits co-star Patrick Adams and his children, who left for a flight to LA.Earl Spencer, Harry’s uncle, was spotted at Cliveden House – where the bride stayed the night before the wedding – enjoying Bloody Marys with his family yesterday afternoon. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/05/4C6D7D2100000578-5751779-image-a-58_1526878184151.jpg","title":"Newlyweds Harry Meghan return royal duty fairytale wedding","story":"  Meghan Markle reportedly didn\u0027t talk to her father, Thomas Markle, on her wedding day.

Venezuela\u0027s election board, run by Maduro loyalists, said he took 5.8 million votes, versus 1.8 million for his closest challenger Henri Falcon, a former governor  \u0027The process undoubtedly lacks legitimacy and as such we do not recognize it,\u0027 said Falcon, a 56-year-old former state governor, looking downcast.Maduro had welcomed Falcon\u0027s candidacy, which gave some legitimacy to a process critics at home and around the world had condemned in advance as the \u0027coronation\u0027 of a dictator.Falcon\u0027s quick rejection of Sunday\u0027s election, and call for a new vote, was therefore a blow to the government\u0027s strategy.Falcon, a former member of the Socialist Party who went over to the opposition in 2010, said he was outraged at the government\u0027s placing of nearly 13,000 pro-government stands called \u0027red spots\u0027 close to polling stations nationwide.Mainly poor Venezuelans were asked to scan state-issued \u0027fatherland cards\u0027 at red tents after voting in hope of receiving a \u0027prize\u0027 promised by Maduro, which opponents said was akin to vote-buying.Labour\u0027s shadow chancellor John McDonnell says he wants to...Share this articleThe \u0027fatherland cards\u0027 are required to receive benefits including food boxes and money transfers.A third presidential candidate, evangelical pastor Javier Bertucci, followed Falcon in slamming irregularities during Sunday\u0027s vote and calling for a new election.Despite his unpopularity over a national economic meltdown, Maduro benefited on Sunday not just from the opposition boycott but also from a ban on his two most popular rivals and the liberal use of state resources in his campaign.His tally, however, fell short of the 10 million votes he had said throughout the campaign he wanted to win.   Falcon (center, in white), a former member of the Socialist Party who went over to the opposition in 2010, said he was outraged at the government\u0027s placing of nearly 13,000 pro-government stands called \u0027red spots\u0027 close to polling stations nationwide           Supporters of the opposition react during the announcement of the electoral results in Caracas, Venezuela          Supporters of the opposition are seen hugging and crying after the announcement was made on Sunday  Maduro, the self-described \u0027son\u0027 of Chavez, says he is battling an \u0027imperialist\u0027 plot to crush socialism and take over Venezuela\u0027s oil. Opponents say he has destroyed a once-wealthy economy and ruthlessly crushed dissent.Attendance appeared thin in many polling stations visited by Reuters reporters, from wealthy east Caracas to the Andean mountains near Colombia. There were lines, however, at poorer government strongholds, where the majority of voters interviewed said they were backing Maduro.\u0027I\u0027m hungry and don\u0027t have a job, but I\u0027m sticking to Maduro,\u0027 said Carlos Rincones, 49, in the once-thriving industrial city of Valencia, accusing right-wing business owners of purposefully hiding food and hiking prices.Many Venezuelans are disillusioned and angry over the election: they criticize Maduro for economic hardships and the opposition for its dysfunctional splits.Reeling from a fifth year of recession, falling oil production and U.S. sanctions, Venezuela is seeing growing levels of malnutrition and hyperinflation, and mass emigration.Venezuelan migrants staged small anti-Maduro protests in cities from Madrid to Miami.   Turnout at the election was just 46.1 per cent, the election board said, way down from the 80 per cent registered at the last presidential vote in 2013   Voters line up at a polling station during the presidential election in Barquisimeto, Venezuela, on Sunday In the highland city of San Cristobal near Colombia, three cloth dolls representing widely loathed officials - Electoral Council head Tibisay Lucena, Socialist Party No. 2 Diosdado Cabello and Vice President Tareck El Aissami - were hung from a footbridge.But streets were calm, with children playing soccer on one road in San Cristobal blocked off at past elections to accommodate long voter lines. For many Venezuelans, Sunday was a day to look for scant food or stock up on water, which is increasingly running short because of years of underinvestment.\u0027I\u0027m not voting - what\u0027s the point if we already know the result? I prefer to come here to get water rather than waste my time,\u0027 said Raul Sanchez, filling a jug from a tap by a busy road in the arid northwestern city of Punto Fijo because his community has not had running water for 26 days.With the election behind him, Maduro may choose to deepen a purge of critics within the ruling \u0027Chavismo\u0027 movement.He faces a Herculean task to turn around the moribund economy, with the bolivar currency down 99 per cent in the past year and inflation at an annual 14,000 per cent, according to the National Assembly."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/11/4C7D1BDE00000578-5752281-Guests_invited_by_Meghan_and_Harry_to_see_them_marry_are_already-m-93_1526897966497.jpg","title":"Cheeky guests caught trying flog Royal Wedding gift bag eBay 400","story":"    Harry and Meghan had wanted a \u0027people\u0027s wedding\u0027 and 1,200 people were given a free goodie bag - but some have started to flog them off  Guests invited by Meghan and Harry to see them marry are already cashing in by selling their gift bags on eBay for £400 or more          Guests arriving in the grounds of Windsor Castle passed tables where bags were handed out to each guest but some have taken advantage of this generosity          The canvas bags had the happy couple\u0027s initials on the side and are being sold on the promise buyers will be getting a piece of royal wedding historySo why WERE the Beckhams and Clooneys (not to mention Chloe...Why did George and Charlotte suddenly go missing?

Meghan is the first mixed-race member of the royal family in an extraordinary journey for a girl born in LA to a white father and African-American mother who fought her way through the tough world of showbusiness to land a plum role in the TV series Suits.Harry and Meghan\u0027s big day couldn\u0027t have been more different than royal weddings of the past, especially because the prince was visibly emotional throughout - and guests suggested it was the most erse major event in the Queen\u0027s 66-year reign.The prince had looked tearful when he saw his bride for the first time, grabbing her hand telling her: \u0027You look amazing - I missed you\u0027 before tenderly lifting her veil.The new Duke of Sussex also said \u0027thank you, pa\u0027 after his father Prince Charles walked the now Duchess of Sussex down the aisle of St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor, having stepped in at the last moment for Meghan\u0027s father Thomas.           Harry looked very emotional at points in the service and several others in the congregation were in tears on their happy day          Harry and Meghan hold hands as they walk out of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding ceremony          A sea of smiling faces greets Harry and Meghan as they leave the church after the American-influenced service conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury          Laughter: One of the well-wishers in the crowds makes Meghan laugh and Prince Harry smile as they continue with their 25-minute tour of the royal market town Meghan Markle told wedding guests: \u0027I\u0027ve found my prince\u0027 in an emotional speech after her ecstatic new husband said the support of his \u0027far better half\u0027 meant he could finally be \u0027me\u0027, it was revealed today.The new Duchess of Sussex also thanked the Queen, Prince Charles and other senior royals for welcoming her so warmly to the royal family \u0027firm\u0027.The bride, resplendent in a white evening gown by Stella McCartney, took to the microphone after a private evening dinner thrown by Prince Charles at Frogmore House.  Meghan\u0027s short speech was yet another part of her modernising mini-revolution of the royal family because royal brides usually leave it to the groom to address guests.The 36-year-old, who wore an aquamarine ring which belonged to Harry\u0027s mother beloved mother Princess Diana, ended her short address by declaring her deep love for Harry and said: \u0027I have found my prince\u0027, according to the Daily Mirror.Before she spoke Harry said his wife, brother, father and friends \u0027are the people that make \u0027me\u0027, me, in my Harry life\u0027 before adding: \u0027Now I\u0027m going to hand over to my far better half\u0027.Earlier he is also believed to have told his bride: \u0027I can\u0027t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.\u0027     One source described how Meghan also expressed her gratitude at how welcoming the prince had been to both herself and her mother, Doria Ragland. \u0027She has been so touched by how welcoming the Prince of Wales has been. So is her mother,\u0027 the source said. \u0027Honestly, they are touched beyond belief. It was important to her to make a point of thanking him publicly, although, of course, he knows privately how she feels.\u0027Another source said: \u0027It is often said that he always wanted a daughter and I think he has been really moved by how well they have got on. There is definitely a special connection there. Meghan\u0027s mother means more to her than anything, so it was lovely to see the way he was so welcoming to Doria too.\u0027          Meghan and Harry looked like movie stars after they changed for the evening reception at Frogmore House          Harry and Meghan travelled in a Jaguar converted to electric power, which had a numberplate with Saturday\u0027s datePrince Charles had also paid tribute to his \u0027darling old Harry\u0027 in an emotional speech that is said to have left the 600 guests, including Hollywood stars, in tears.Speaking at the afternoon reception at St George\u0027s Hall in Windsor Castle shortly after they married he Charles told of how moving it was to watch youngest son  get married.Charles, who walked Meghan to the altar, finishing by saying: \u0027My darling old Harry, I\u0027m so happy for you.\u0027Harry, 33, is also said to have given an \u0027off the cuff\u0027 speech about how happy he was.He is also said to have turned to his guests and asked: \u0027Can anyone play the piano\u0027 – before Sir Elton John played a medley of Your Song, Tiny Dancer, Circle Of Life and I\u0027m Still Standing.Harry also said Meghan had \u0027navigated everything with such grace\u0027, adding: \u0027We make such a great team\u0027. According to the Sunday Times. Wedding guest Peter Fearnhead, co-founder of African Parks, told the Sunday Telegraph: \u0027When Harry and Meghan came in they stood on the podium and Prince William introduced them.\u0027Prince Charles made a really gracious speech, it was amazingly endearing. He\u0027s got a wonderfully dry sense of humour. Prince Harry was charming about Meghan, they are so clearly in love. We all had a tear in our eye.\u0027 Later he whisked his bride away in an open-top Jaguar to head for a star-studded, champagne-fuelled, black-tie reception for the bride and groom at the opulent Frogmore House in Windsor Great Park on Saturday night.The newlyweds were cheered wildly as they took to the floor with the funky soul classic Land of a Thousand Dances for their first dance at the spectacular royal wedding reception.Comedian James Corden is reported to have launched a dance routine with Harry, his brother William and his father Charles, apparently refereeing a \u0027dance-off\u0027, while George Clooney danced with both Meghan and Kate. After a very modern take on the traditional royal wedding, the late-night revelry followed suit – and those fortunate enough to bag a place on the ultra-exclusive guest list were treated to a night of risque speeches, wild dancing and plenty of stodge to soak up the alcohol.  George and Amal Clooney were the among the huge stars to celebrate with Harry and Meghan with George dancing with the bride and Kate   From left: Priyanka Chopra, Serena Williams and Jessica Mulroney show off the dresses they wore to the royal wedding party          Revellers watch the fireworks display over George III\u0027s former stately where the reception of Harry and Meghan took placeExclusive details from inside the evening celebrations reveal that guests – including George and Amal Clooney, Sir Elton John and David Furnish and more glitzy actresses than an Oscars after-party – spent the evening sipping bespoke cocktails, tucking into \u0027dirty burgers\u0027 and candyfloss from outdoor stalls and dancing to a trendy DJ.It was, insiders say, \u0027the party to end all parties\u0027, with a carnival atmosphere in the grounds of the 230-year-old stately home, which once belonged to George III.  Record viewing figures made Harry and Meghan’s wedding the TV event of the year so far.It was watched by a peak of 13.1million just after 1pm on BBC1, making it the biggest peak figure so far in 2018, the broadcaster said. ITV’s coverage peaked at 3.6million.The combined average audience for BBC and ITV was around 11million. But this was lower than the figure for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding in 2011, which had a combined audience of 17.6million – although this included people watching on catch-up. Charles and Diana’s wedding was watched by more than 28million in 1981.Saturday’s FA Cup Final averaged 6.7million viewers and peaked at 8.7million on BBC1. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/09/4C6B70BB00000578-5752413-image-m-23_1526890066091.jpg","title":"Doria Ragland Oprah interview filmed England","story":"Doria Ragland is planning to film an interview with Oprah Winfrey while the pair are in London, it was reported today  Think pink like Oprah in a Stella McCartney midi dressShop the current line here!Achieving best-dressed guest status is no easy feat when you\u0026#39re attending the most anticipated wedding of the year, but we think Oprah Winfrey might be a strong contender for the title!The talk show host donned a custom Stella McCartney midi dress for Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s big day, topping off her look with a bespoke Philip Treacy concertina lace hat with a feather plume.

So, when you are doing embroidery, you need to keep your hands very fresh.‘There were many people involved in the workmanship and, obviously, it took an enormous amount of hours to do it.’The idea to embroider each of the 53 Commonwealth flowers on to the veil was the designer’s idea, after long discussions with Meghan, who wanted to include a tribute to the ‘Family of Nations’ that will be such a central part of her new life, working on behalf of the Queen.‘There was a conversation early on about the story that we were going to tell through this wedding,’ she said. ‘And the fact she and Prince Harry will be working a lot in the Commonwealth was something that could be built on.’It was Meghan, however, who came up with the idea for the simple, but utterly enchanting, little bridesmaids’ outfits.

Kate\u0026#39s Alexander McQueen gown has got to be one of the most copied styles of all time, and this breathtaking design is destined to be just as iconic. We\u0026#39ve all been speculating for months as to who Meghan might ask to create the all-important dress. Stella McCartney, Ralph \u0026amp Russo, Burberry or perhaps Erdem? She kept us all guessing right up until the last moment, and as she arrived at St. George\u0026#39s Chapel in Windsor it was announced that it\u0026#39s the work of British designer Clare Waight Keller, Artistic Director at Givenchy. We love the elegant simplicity of this dress. The slight off shoulder neckline, the train... it\u0026#39s perfection. When teamed with Cartier jewellery, a dramatic veil and Queen Mary\u0026#39s diamond tiara, it\u0026#39s a fairy tale come true.

They have slippers for us. Slippers!\u0027Meghan is also believed to have given her closest friends – none of whom was chosen to be a bridesmaid – bespoke bracelets worth £450 as a mark of their friendship and support on her big day.Once inside the grounds, guests were guided to a giant marquee at the back of the house, bedecked with stunning floral displays by royal florist Philippa Craddock.Liveried waiters circulated, offering guests drinks – English sparkling wine and ice-cold beer – and trays of light canapes, themed in the style of \u0027spring meets summer\u0027. These, and the three-course sit-down dinner, all comprised seasonal organic produce, much of it sourced from Prince Charles\u0027s Duchy Estate.While the canapes and bowl food earlier in the day had been provided by Buckingham Palace, Harry and Meghan used leading society caterers Table Talk for the evening do.          The newlyweds leave Windsor Castle after the royal wedding on their way to the reception at Frogmore House         Princess Eugenie (left), the Duke of York and Princess Beatrice arrive at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle yesterday         A car carrying Prince Edward and Sophie, Countess of Wessex arrives at Frogmore House for the reception yesterday       George Clooney, who attended the royal wedding earlier, arrives for the evening party at Frogmore House       Security outside Frogmore House where around 200 guests were expected to attend Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding reception              Meghan and Harry\u0027s kiss sparked huge cheers from people outside the chapel and the 100,000 watching on the streets of Windsor         The Duke and Duchess of Sussex shared their first kiss as a married couple outside St George\u0027s Chapel          A sea of smiling faces greets Harry and Meghan as they leave the church after the American-influenced service conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury         Meghan and Harry process out of the chapel after exchanging vows in a quite extraordinary wedding       Harry looked delighted as he walked his new wife out of St George\u0027s Chapel to start their new life together         The couple, who are now the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, organised a wedding that reflected both their backgrounds         Meghan and Harry wave to royal fans during their open-top procession through Windsor after the wedding ceremony         The newlyweds stare deeply into each other\u0027s eyes after the biggest and happiest day of their lives         This extraordinary image shows Meghan clutching her husband\u0027s gloved hand while resting her holding her other hand and bouquet, which was picked by Harry, in the lap of her Givenchy dress         Laughter: One of the well-wishers in the crowds makes Meghan laugh and Prince Harry smile as they continue with their 25-minute tour of the royal market town Insiders say that the meal was punctuated by informal toasts and speeches – most memorably a brief toast by the bride herself, who, in a historic break with tradition, stood up to thank Harry and his family for their kindness and hospitality.In return, Harry gave a gushing, off-the-cuff speech praising Meghan for \u0027navigating everything with such grace\u0027 after a turbulent week. \u0027We make such a great team,\u0027 he said. \u0027I can\u0027t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.\u0027Guests reportedly burst into cheers when he referred to her as his wife for the first time.Prince William is believed to have performed something of a double act with Charlie van Straubenzee, who attended prep school with Harry at Ludgrove in Berkshire.As well as a poignant reminder of how proud their mother would have been of her youngest son on his wedding day, the speech included several family in-jokes.A fourth speech was reportedly given by Charlie\u0027s older brother, Thomas, along with Tom \u0027Skippy\u0027 Inskip, who was under strict instructions from the Palace to downplay Prince Harry\u0027s exploits during a 2012 boys-only trip to Las Vegas – long before Meghan was in the picture.Actor and talk show host James Corden, who attended the reception with his wife Julia, acted as compere, introducing speakers and keeping guests in stitches by gently ribbing Harry for \u0027punching above his weight\u0027. Dotted throughout the gardens to entertain the guests were outdoor games, including a giant chessboard, fairground performers and stalls offering late-night snacks – from burger and ice cream vans to candy floss kiosks and bars stocked with several types of expensive whisky.Bespoke cocktails were flowing from a \u0027round the world\u0027 bar, whose top offering was the \u0027When Harry Met Meghan\u0027, combining rum and ginger beer – a cheeky nod to the colour of the groom\u0027s hair.Musical entertainment came from DJ Sam Totolee, a celebrity favourite who has previously played at the weddings of both Pippa Middleton and Rod Stewart, and Uma Thurman\u0027s engagement party.Harry is said to have danced \u0027furiously\u0027 to the DJ\u0027s set – which included the controversial drug-themed hit I Took A Pill In Ibiza – at Pippa\u0027s wedding last May, and had put him under strict instructions to \u0027avoid cheese\u0027 and stick to trendy house music and R\u0026ampB.          Harry looked very emotional at points in the service and several others in the congregation were in tears on their happy day         Harry and Meghan exchanged vows and then rings as the couple married after a whirlwind romance               Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland, who the star calls her rock, was in tears ahead of her daughter\u0027s big entrance         Meghan walked halfway through the church before being met Prince Charles at the Quire who took her to Harry         Meghan walks down the aisle in St George\u0027s Chapel at the start of the royal wedding ceremony in Windsor         Meghan, wearing her bridal veil, smiles at her groom Prince Harry as she arrives at the wedding ceremony in Windsor              Meghan smiles broadly during her wedding to Prince Harry at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor         The Archbishop of Canterbury smiles as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle stand at the altar at St George\u0027s Chapel         Harry and Meghan hold hands as they walk out of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding ceremony       Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland (far left) stands next to Prince Charles, Camilla, George, William, Charlotte and Kate on the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding         The train of Meghan\u0027s dress trails down the aisle as she and Prince Harry stand in front of Archbishop Justin WelbyAt one point later in the evening, British actor Idris Elba – who has DJ\u0027d in some of the world\u0027s top clubs – apparently took over for a brief turn on the decks. But that didn\u0027t stop Meghan from making her own musical requests, and she is believed to have been behind the list of Sixties soul songs that were played by covers band Atlantic Soul Orchestra, which calls itself \u0027the country\u0027s hardest-hitting and most authentic soul band\u0027. Its musicians have toured and recorded with groups including Take That, Girls Aloud and Sir Elton John.Their set list included My Girl by the Temptations Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I\u0027m Yours by Stevie Wonder Marvin Gaye\u0027s How Sweet It Is and Ain\u0027t No Mountain High Enough Soul Man by Sam and Dave and Knock On Wood by Eddie Floyd.The reception went on into the early hours, with music and cheering heard as far away as Windsor\u0027s Long Walk. Even as the clock struck midnight, guests could be heard singing along enthusiastically to Respect by Aretha Franklin, and Dancing In The Street by Martha and the Vandellas.The newlyweds\u0027 first dance is believed to have followed a similar theme, with Harry and Meghan eschewing a slow song for the 1966 hit Land Of A Thousand Dances by American soul singer Wilson Pickett (not, as has been reported elsewhere, Whitney Houston\u0027s I Wanna Dance With Somebody).The final coaches departed Frogmore House around 3.30am, with insiders reporting that George Clooney was among the last to stagger off the dancefloor, having earlier shown off his moves alongside actor Tom Hardy. Bleary-eyed revellers were offered bacon or sausage sandwiches for the journey home.A select few were then invited to the late-night party which reportedly took place at celebrity haunt Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone, followed by a private party in a sound-proofed home in Chelsea. It is not known if the bride or groom accompanied them.Yesterday morning, though the newlyweds – who spent the night at Windsor Castle – were nowhere to be seen, several of the guests appeared rather the worse for wear.A weary looking James Corden was seen checking out of Coworth Park with his wife at 8am, while Jessica Mulroney did not emerge from her £600-a-night room before lunchtime. A fresh-faced Serena Williams was one of the few to make it down to breakfast.Rugby player Will Greenwood left with his wife Caroline around 9.40am, followed by Meghan\u0027s Suits co-star Patrick Adams and his children, who left for a flight to LA.Earl Spencer, Harry\u0027s uncle, was spotted at Cliveden House – where the bride stayed the night before the wedding – enjoying Bloody Marys with his family yesterday afternoon. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle¿s fun-filled wedding reception featured a royal dance-off and boozy \u0027beer pong\u0027 gamesGeorge Clooney danced with Meghan then Kate but Fergie turned him down: Exclusive details from party of the year - Mirror Online"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/10/4C7D643300000578-5752637-image-a-15_1526895188903.jpg","title":"Is Nessie Schoolgirl eight snaps footage splashing waters Loch Ness","story":"    Eight-year-old Laria Annand was visiting the loch with her grandmother, Marie, when they noticed strange movement in the water\u0027We were just taking silly pictures of each other and splashing our feet in the water.\u0027\u0027I just looked up and that’s when I spotted the flickering in the water.\u0027It looked as though the light was bouncing off something but there were no boats or people and it was something long - very long.

And yet Doria’s loneliness on the bride’s side was brutally obvious.And there was her hand, fluttering, for one uncertain moment, towards Prince Charles. Immediately, his hand reached out towards hers and, in a gesture that seemed to symbolise the joining of two very different families, she held on to it firmly as he gently pulled her into the group.No face in the chapel on Saturday glowed with pleasure as hers did at that moment, even more than when it was turned towards the Most Rev Michael Curry, drinking in his fervent and unexpectedly lengthy message of love.For her, there were tears, too, moments before her daughter entered through the West Door to make her solitary progress halfway down the aisle to the top of the nave.

Although, of course, it was her ex-husband’s side of the family and did not directly affect her.Meghan’s personal assistant, Amy Pickerill, was at the airport to greet her and take her to Kensington Palace. After that came 48 dazzling hours when Meghan’s sole family representative had tea with Prince Charles and Camilla at Clarence House and then with the Queen and Prince Philip at Windsor Castle.With Charles and Camilla, she felt comfortable and welcomed. What made it so much easier was that Meghan was there with Harry, with his jokes and easy manner. At least she had met Harry before, at the Invictus Games in Toronto.With the Queen, though, it was not quite so easy as they talked over tea (a blend of Darjeeling and Assam) and fruit cake in the Oak Room, where Her Majesty has tea every day in her private apartment in the castle.  Charles and Doria pictured in St George\u0027s Chapel at the wedding of Harry and Meghan MarkleAlthough the Queen has a lifetime of experience making uneasy guests feel at home, Doria was nervous at first. However, by the time she was saying her goodbyes 40 minutes later, she was much more relaxed.At 61, Doria Ragland had suddenly been elevated into the social stratosphere. But why should we be surprised that she rose so superbly to the occasion? Those who know Meghan’s family have always noted that the actress gets her brains and her fluency from her mother.Doria’s start in life was as the bright, only child of a single mother whose parents were the bell-boy and lift-girl in a hotel in Cleveland, Ohio – a five-star establishment for white guests only. She was in the top academic stream at school but, money being short, didn’t go to university and instead began training as a make-up artist.It was on the set of ABC’s popular TV series General Hospital that she met the show’s lighting director Tom Markle, a orced man with two children, and married him.Meghan was their only child before they in turn orced, though amicably, even continuing to go on holidays together. One can only wonder what her ex-husband, apparently unable to be at the wedding because of a recent operation, felt as he watched Doria on the arm of the Prince of Wales.The truth is that Doria has conducted herself with extraordinary dignity since it emerged that her only daughter was marrying the Queen’s grandson.Never an attention-grabber, her work in Los Angeles as a yoga instructor and social worker, particularly among the elderly, has not allowed the excitement or the sudden spotlight to change anything about the way she goes about her life. Never for her the staged paparazzi pictures her ex-husband so foolishly allowed himself to do. No interviews. No efforts to profit from her daughter’s happiness.           Doria Ragland, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall walk down the steps of the chapelThat said, her daughter becoming the Duchess of Sussex changes things. Being an in-law to the royal family hasn’t meant too much to the parents of sons or daughters who have married into the Firm.Traditionally, they would be welcomed by the royal family, share the wedding and then summarily be forgotten. For example, the mother of Mark Phillips, Princess Anne’s first husband, complained that she and her husband were ‘virtually ignored and never invited to anything by the palace’.That attitude changed with the arrival of Kate Middleton.Even before she and Prince William married, her parents, Michael and Carole, were regularly extended invitations to royal homes. They have stayed as guests at Balmoral and Sandringham.William has insisted they are included in royal gatherings – they’ve been guests of the Queen at Royal Ascot, participating in the carriage drive down the course.Harry will want to go the same way, and for royal doors to be as open to Meghan’s mum Doria as they are to the Middletons.For now, at least, Meghan’s mother will continue to live 5,500 miles away in LA and go to work as normal, so her participation in royal life is hardly likely to be as frequent as Mike and Carole Middleton.But judging by the way she linked arms with Prince Charles on the steps of the chapel, when those embossed invitations come she’ll certainly be able to handle it."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/20/22/4C6B8C6C00000578-5751241-image-a-43_1526853472685.jpg","title":"So Beckhams Clooneys invited royal wedding","story":"Take style tips from Julia in a dress by Tom FordFind it at Farfetch!Deciding what to wear to a wedding can be tricky at the best of times, but when it\u0026#39s the wedding of the century...

First laid out for Queen Charlotte in the 1790s, they are based on a model \u0027picturesque\u0027 landscape. It is only open to iniduals on three days of the year.  So whose fashion sparkled... and who missed the Markle? The Royal Wedding hits and misses by LIZ JONESThere were no real clangers on the big day. No outrageous hats from Eugenie and Beatrice. No outrageous bottoms threatening to eclipse the bride. There were only two slight faux pas: Amal Clooney threatened to outshine the sun, and the mother of the bride wore mint while the Queen chose lime: almost, almost a colour clash.On the whole, the female guests – particularly the Royals – had put in time and effort to get it right, and had clearly been poring over the springsummer catwalk photos to make sure they were all bang on trend. Hence, there was lots of asymmetric tailoring on show, so much so many assumed Windsor had been built on a hill. The HITS              Pippa Middleton in a £495 print by British label The Fold. Thank the Lord the pleats hide her bottom            Her Majesty was elegant in a Stewart Parvin dress and coat, with Angela Kelly hat             The Duchess of Cornwall in an ice-pink silk Anna Valentine coatdress with flared sleeves            Princess Michael of Kent\u0027s outfit is a bit salmony but she doesn\u0027t look show-offy at allThere was also a riot of hot colours and pastels, and enough florals to fill the stands next week at Chelsea. The length of skirts proved problematical: either a tad too short, a la Eugenie and Joss Stone, or midi length, which looks great on teenage supermodels but a little droopy drawers on normal women.Not too many gloves on show: the Duchess of York, a surprise hit on the day, was a rare fan, with a short navy pair, and the Queen, of course, wore hers.Hats were all proper structures, and not half-baked fascinators. And, thank the Lord, on such a hot day there were plenty of pretty open shoes displaying toe cleavage: not possible if the ceremony had taken place in a cathedral.Heels, though, were as high as the sun in the sky.Rumour has it slippers were handed out later for those who could no longer teeter after yet another glass of champagne             Amal Clooney chose a marigold dress by Stella McCartney with a bow at the back and a train            Singer Joss Stone sported shorter hair and swapped her hippy look for a girly print            Carole Middleton looks very elegant in Princess Diana\u0027s favourite atelier Catherine Walker            Pastel Stella McCartney for Oprah Winfrey, with a Philip Treacy turkey and pheasant feather hat            Countess of Wessex wears ice-blue satin by London couturier Suzannah and hat by Jane Taylor            Meghan\u0027s Suits co-star Gina Torres in a very elegant floral tea dress by Costarellos            Fergie was a picture of elegance on Saturday as she paired a navy skirt suit with a Jess Collet hat and towering heelsThe MISSES            Sofia Wellesley, James Blunt\u0027s wife, is in new season Valentino.

They have slippers for us. Slippers!’Meghan is also believed to have given her closest friends – none of whom was chosen to be a bridesmaid – bespoke bracelets worth £450 as a mark of their friendship and support on her big day.Once inside the grounds, guests were guided to a giant marquee at the back of the house, bedecked with stunning floral displays by royal florist Philippa Craddock.Liveried waiters circulated, offering guests drinks – English sparkling wine and ice-cold beer – and trays of light canapes, themed in the style of ‘spring meets summer’. These, and the three-course sit-down dinner, all comprised seasonal organic produce, much of it sourced from Prince Charles’s Duchy Estate.While the canapes and bowl food earlier in the day had been provided by Buckingham Palace, Harry and Meghan used leading society caterers Table Talk for the evening do.          The newlyweds leave Windsor Castle after the royal wedding on their way to the reception at Frogmore House         Princess Eugenie (left), the Duke of York and Princess Beatrice arrive at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle yesterday         A car carrying Prince Edward and Sophie, Countess of Wessex arrives at Frogmore House for the reception yesterday       George Clooney, who attended the royal wedding earlier, arrives for the evening party at Frogmore House       Security outside Frogmore House where around 200 guests were expected to attend Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding reception              Meghan and Harry\u0027s kiss sparked huge cheers from people outside the chapel and the 100,000 watching on the streets of Windsor         The Duke and Duchess of Sussex shared their first kiss as a married couple outside St George\u0027s Chapel          A sea of smiling faces greets Harry and Meghan as they leave the church after the American-influenced service conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury         Meghan and Harry process out of the chapel after exchanging vows in a quite extraordinary wedding       Harry looked delighted as he walked his new wife out of St George\u0027s Chapel to start their new life together         The couple, who are now the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, organised a wedding that reflected both their backgrounds         Meghan and Harry wave to royal fans during their open-top procession through Windsor after the wedding ceremony         The newlyweds stare deeply into each other\u0027s eyes after the biggest and happiest day of their lives         This extraordinary image shows Meghan clutching her husband\u0027s gloved hand while resting her holding her other hand and bouquet, which was picked by Harry, in the lap of her Givenchy dress         Laughter: One of the well-wishers in the crowds makes Meghan laugh and Prince Harry smile as they continue with their 25-minute tour of the royal market town Insiders say that the meal was punctuated by informal toasts and speeches – most memorably a brief toast by the bride herself, who, in a historic break with tradition, stood up to thank Harry and his family for their kindness and hospitality.In return, Harry gave a gushing, off-the-cuff speech praising Meghan for ‘navigating everything with such grace’ after a turbulent week. ‘We make such a great team,’ he said. ‘I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.’Guests reportedly burst into cheers when he referred to her as his wife for the first time.Prince William is believed to have performed something of a double act with Charlie van Straubenzee, who attended prep school with Harry at Ludgrove in Berkshire.As well as a poignant reminder of how proud their mother would have been of her youngest son on his wedding day, the speech included several family in-jokes.A fourth speech was reportedly given by Charlie’s older brother, Thomas, along with Tom ‘Skippy’ Inskip, who was under strict instructions from the Palace to downplay Prince Harry’s exploits during a 2012 boys-only trip to Las Vegas – long before Meghan was in the picture.Actor and talk show host James Corden, who attended the reception with his wife Julia, acted as compere, introducing speakers and keeping guests in stitches by gently ribbing Harry for ‘punching above his weight’. Dotted throughout the gardens to entertain the guests were outdoor games, including a giant chessboard, fairground performers and stalls offering late-night snacks – from burger and ice cream vans to candy floss kiosks and bars stocked with several types of expensive whisky.Bespoke cocktails were flowing from a ‘round the world’ bar, whose top offering was the ‘When Harry Met Meghan’, combining rum and ginger beer – a cheeky nod to the colour of the groom’s hair.Musical entertainment came from DJ Sam Totolee, a celebrity favourite who has previously played at the weddings of both Pippa Middleton and Rod Stewart, and Uma Thurman’s engagement party.Harry is said to have danced ‘furiously’ to the DJ’s set – which included the controversial drug-themed hit I Took A Pill In Ibiza – at Pippa’s wedding last May, and had put him under strict instructions to ‘avoid cheese’ and stick to trendy house music and R\u0026ampB.          Harry looked very emotional at points in the service and several others in the congregation were in tears on their happy day         Harry and Meghan exchanged vows and then rings as the couple married after a whirlwind romance               Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland, who the star calls her rock, was in tears ahead of her daughter\u0027s big entrance         Meghan walked halfway through the church before being met Prince Charles at the Quire who took her to Harry         Meghan walks down the aisle in St George\u0027s Chapel at the start of the royal wedding ceremony in Windsor         Meghan, wearing her bridal veil, smiles at her groom Prince Harry as she arrives at the wedding ceremony in Windsor              Meghan smiles broadly during her wedding to Prince Harry at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor         The Archbishop of Canterbury smiles as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle stand at the altar at St George\u0027s Chapel         Harry and Meghan hold hands as they walk out of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding ceremony       Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland (far left) stands next to Prince Charles, Camilla, George, William, Charlotte and Kate on the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding         Prince Harry watches as his father, Prince Charles, accompanies Meghan Markle down the aisle at St George\u0027s Chapel         The train of Meghan\u0027s dress trails down the aisle as she and Prince Harry stand in front of Archbishop Justin WelbyAt one point later in the evening, British actor Idris Elba – who has DJ’d in some of the world’s top clubs – apparently took over for a brief turn on the decks. But that didn’t stop Meghan from making her own musical requests, and she is believed to have been behind the list of Sixties soul songs that were played by covers band Atlantic Soul Orchestra, which calls itself ‘the country’s hardest-hitting and most authentic soul band’. Its musicians have toured and recorded with groups including Take That, Girls Aloud and Sir Elton John.Their set list included My Girl by the Temptations Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I’m Yours by Stevie Wonder Marvin Gaye’s How Sweet It Is and Ain’t No Mountain High Enough Soul Man by Sam and Dave and Knock On Wood by Eddie Floyd.The reception went on into the early hours, with music and cheering heard as far away as Windsor’s Long Walk. Even as the clock struck midnight, guests could be heard singing along enthusiastically to Respect by Aretha Franklin, and Dancing In The Street by Martha and the Vandellas.The newlyweds’ first dance is believed to have followed a similar theme, with Harry and Meghan eschewing a slow song for the 1966 hit Land Of A Thousand Dances by American soul singer Wilson Pickett (not, as has been reported elsewhere, Whitney Houston’s I Wanna Dance With Somebody).The final coaches departed Frogmore House around 3.30am, with insiders reporting that George Clooney was among the last to stagger off the dancefloor, having earlier shown off his moves alongside actor Tom Hardy. Bleary-eyed revellers were offered bacon or sausage sandwiches for the journey home.A select few were then invited to the late-night party which reportedly took place at celebrity haunt Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone, followed by a private party in a sound-proofed home in Chelsea. It is not known if the bride or groom accompanied them.Yesterday morning, though the newlyweds – who spent the night at Windsor Castle – were nowhere to be seen, several of the guests appeared rather the worse for wear.A weary looking James Corden was seen checking out of Coworth Park with his wife at 8am, while Jessica Mulroney did not emerge from her £600-a-night room before lunchtime. A fresh-faced Serena Williams was one of the few to make it down to breakfast.Rugby player Will Greenwood left with his wife Caroline around 9.40am, followed by Meghan’s Suits co-star Patrick Adams and his children, who left for a flight to LA.Earl Spencer, Harry’s uncle, was spotted at Cliveden House – where the bride stayed the night before the wedding – enjoying Bloody Marys with his family yesterday afternoon. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/05/4C6D7D2100000578-5751779-image-a-58_1526878184151.jpg","title":"Newlyweds Harry Meghan return royal duty fairytale wedding","story":"  Meghan Markle reportedly didn\u0027t talk to her father, Thomas Markle, on her wedding day.

It contains the page saying Thomas Markle would give away his daughter that could not be changed in time for the weddingInviting 1,200 guests to get close to them was all part of Meghan and Harry\u0027s most erse and royal rule breaking wedding ever seen.The newlyweds shared tears, laughter and a passionate kiss in front of their hundreds of VIP guests dominated by Hollywood stars including the Clooneys, the Beckhams, Idris Elba, Oprah Winfrey, Tom Hardy and James Corden.Elton John, who sang at Princess Diana\u0027s funeral in 1997, performed at the lunchtime reception hosted by the Queen in a poignant nod to Harry\u0027s late mother.All the senior British royals were also there to support the couple including Her Majesty the Queen, Prince Philip, Harry\u0027s best man Prince William and his wife Kate, who brought George and Charlotte but left baby Louis with the nanny. Meghan is the first mixed-race member of the royal family in an extraordinary journey for a girl born in LA to a white father and African-American mother who fought her way through the tough world of showbusiness to land a plum role in the TV series Suits.Harry and Meghan\u0027s big day couldn\u0027t have been more different than royal weddings of the past, especially because the prince was visibly emotional throughout - and guests suggested it was the most erse major event in the Queen\u0027s 66-year reign.The prince had looked tearful when he saw his bride for the first time, grabbing her hand telling her: \u0027You look amazing - I missed you\u0027 before tenderly lifting her veil.The new Duke of Sussex also said \u0027thank you, pa\u0027 after his father Prince Charles walked the now Duchess of Sussex down the aisle of St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor, having stepped in at the last moment for Meghan\u0027s father Thomas.           Harry looked very emotional at points in the service and several others in the congregation were in tears on their happy day          Harry and Meghan hold hands as they walk out of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding ceremony          A sea of smiling faces greets Harry and Meghan as they leave the church after the American-influenced service conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury          Laughter: One of the well-wishers in the crowds makes Meghan laugh and Prince Harry smile as they continue with their 25-minute tour of the royal market town Meghan Markle told wedding guests: \u0027I\u0027ve found my prince\u0027 in an emotional speech after her ecstatic new husband said the support of his \u0027far better half\u0027 meant he could finally be \u0027me\u0027, it was revealed today.The new Duchess of Sussex also thanked the Queen, Prince Charles and other senior royals for welcoming her so warmly to the royal family \u0027firm\u0027.The bride, resplendent in a white evening gown by Stella McCartney, took to the microphone after a private evening dinner thrown by Prince Charles at Frogmore House.  Meghan\u0027s short speech was yet another part of her modernising mini-revolution of the royal family because royal brides usually leave it to the groom to address guests.The 36-year-old, who wore an aquamarine ring which belonged to Harry\u0027s mother beloved mother Princess Diana, ended her short address by declaring her deep love for Harry and said: \u0027I have found my prince\u0027, according to the Daily Mirror.Before she spoke Harry said his wife, brother, father and friends \u0027are the people that make \u0027me\u0027, me, in my Harry life\u0027 before adding: \u0027Now I\u0027m going to hand over to my far better half\u0027.Earlier he is also believed to have told his bride: \u0027I can\u0027t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.\u0027     One source described how Meghan also expressed her gratitude at how welcoming the prince had been to both herself and her mother, Doria Ragland. \u0027She has been so touched by how welcoming the Prince of Wales has been. So is her mother,\u0027 the source said. \u0027Honestly, they are touched beyond belief. It was important to her to make a point of thanking him publicly, although, of course, he knows privately how she feels.\u0027Another source said: \u0027It is often said that he always wanted a daughter and I think he has been really moved by how well they have got on. There is definitely a special connection there. Meghan\u0027s mother means more to her than anything, so it was lovely to see the way he was so welcoming to Doria too.\u0027          Meghan and Harry looked like movie stars after they changed for the evening reception at Frogmore House          Harry and Meghan travelled in a Jaguar converted to electric power, which had a numberplate with Saturday\u0027s datePrince Charles had also paid tribute to his \u0027darling old Harry\u0027 in an emotional speech that is said to have left the 600 guests, including Hollywood stars, in tears.Speaking at the afternoon reception at St George\u0027s Hall in Windsor Castle shortly after they married he Charles told of how moving it was to watch youngest son  get married.Charles, who walked Meghan to the altar, finishing by saying: \u0027My darling old Harry, I\u0027m so happy for you.\u0027Harry, 33, is also said to have given an \u0027off the cuff\u0027 speech about how happy he was.He is also said to have turned to his guests and asked: \u0027Can anyone play the piano\u0027 – before Sir Elton John played a medley of Your Song, Tiny Dancer, Circle Of Life and I\u0027m Still Standing.Harry also said Meghan had \u0027navigated everything with such grace\u0027, adding: \u0027We make such a great team\u0027. According to the Sunday Times. Wedding guest Peter Fearnhead, co-founder of African Parks, told the Sunday Telegraph: \u0027When Harry and Meghan came in they stood on the podium and Prince William introduced them.\u0027Prince Charles made a really gracious speech, it was amazingly endearing. He\u0027s got a wonderfully dry sense of humour. Prince Harry was charming about Meghan, they are so clearly in love. We all had a tear in our eye.\u0027 Later he whisked his bride away in an open-top Jaguar to head for a star-studded, champagne-fuelled, black-tie reception for the bride and groom at the opulent Frogmore House in Windsor Great Park on Saturday night.The newlyweds were cheered wildly as they took to the floor with the funky soul classic Land of a Thousand Dances for their first dance at the spectacular royal wedding reception.Comedian James Corden is reported to have launched a dance routine with Harry, his brother William and his father Charles, apparently refereeing a \u0027dance-off\u0027, while George Clooney danced with both Meghan and Kate. After a very modern take on the traditional royal wedding, the late-night revelry followed suit – and those fortunate enough to bag a place on the ultra-exclusive guest list were treated to a night of risque speeches, wild dancing and plenty of stodge to soak up the alcohol.  George and Amal Clooney were the among the huge stars to celebrate with Harry and Meghan with George dancing with the bride and Kate   From left: Priyanka Chopra, Serena Williams and Jessica Mulroney show off the dresses they wore to the royal wedding party          Revellers watch the fireworks display over George III\u0027s former stately where the reception of Harry and Meghan took placeExclusive details from inside the evening celebrations reveal that guests – including George and Amal Clooney, Sir Elton John and David Furnish and more glitzy actresses than an Oscars after-party – spent the evening sipping bespoke cocktails, tucking into \u0027dirty burgers\u0027 and candyfloss from outdoor stalls and dancing to a trendy DJ.It was, insiders say, \u0027the party to end all parties\u0027, with a carnival atmosphere in the grounds of the 230-year-old stately home, which once belonged to George III.  Record viewing figures made Harry and Meghan’s wedding the TV event of the year so far.It was watched by a peak of 13.1million just after 1pm on BBC1, making it the biggest peak figure so far in 2018, the broadcaster said. ITV’s coverage peaked at 3.6million.The combined average audience for BBC and ITV was around 11million. But this was lower than the figure for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding in 2011, which had a combined audience of 17.6million – although this included people watching on catch-up. Charles and Diana’s wedding was watched by more than 28million in 1981.Saturday’s FA Cup Final averaged 6.7million viewers and peaked at 8.7million on BBC1. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/09/4C6B70BB00000578-5752413-image-m-23_1526890066091.jpg","title":"Doria Ragland Oprah interview filmed England","story":"Doria Ragland is planning to film an interview with Oprah Winfrey while the pair are in London, it was reported today  Think pink like Oprah in a Stella McCartney midi dressShop the current line here!Achieving best-dressed guest status is no easy feat when you\u0026#39re attending the most anticipated wedding of the year, but we think Oprah Winfrey might be a strong contender for the title!The talk show host donned a custom Stella McCartney midi dress for Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s big day, topping off her look with a bespoke Philip Treacy concertina lace hat with a feather plume.

So, when you are doing embroidery, you need to keep your hands very fresh.‘There were many people involved in the workmanship and, obviously, it took an enormous amount of hours to do it.’The idea to embroider each of the 53 Commonwealth flowers on to the veil was the designer’s idea, after long discussions with Meghan, who wanted to include a tribute to the ‘Family of Nations’ that will be such a central part of her new life, working on behalf of the Queen.‘There was a conversation early on about the story that we were going to tell through this wedding,’ she said. ‘And the fact she and Prince Harry will be working a lot in the Commonwealth was something that could be built on.’It was Meghan, however, who came up with the idea for the simple, but utterly enchanting, little bridesmaids’ outfits.

This has improved boarding and punctuality, the airline said, but O’Leary added that “it is creating a handling issue, especially at peak periods” such as bank holiday weekends and during the summer.“There are many flights where we’re now having to put 100 or 120 gate bags free of charge into the hold,” O’Leary said in a video presentation. “If that continues to build, it’s something we may have to look at again.”However, O’Leary warned of a fall in profits this year, saying the outlook was “on the pessimistic side of cautious”. He said there could be strikes in some countries over Ryanair’s discussions to recognise trade unions, but the airline would face any action down.O’Leary said air fares were likely to be flat over the coming year, as it takes about 12 months for changes in fuel prices to feed through to fares. He added that he believed airlines that had not hedged oil prices, such as Norwegian, would struggle next winter and that this would “accelerate the shakeout” in the industry, with some carriers going bust.Ryanair averted widespread Christmas strikes by unilaterally recognising unions in December for the first time in its 32-year history, but it has struggled to formalise relations in some countries. “Being unionised means we will have occasional strikes,” O’Leary said.Ryanair repeated its warnings about the risk of a hard Brexit, and said it would scrap voting rights for non-EU shareholders if there was no transition agreement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b611449a1227eaaa4ece9443d720da9fc692a42/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65d64f8414a898b311368b432428b008","title":"big tech products silicon valley","story":"It’s years since Silicon Valley gave us a game-changer. Instead, from curing disease to colonies on Mars, we’re fed overblown promisesBack in 1999, Google hit 1bn searches a year. Wifi began to make an impact about two years later. Thanks to the pioneers of Facebook and Twitter, the age of mass social media dawned between 2004 and 2006 – and non-stop posting, messaging and following was soon enabled by the iPhone, launched in 2007. These things have changed the world and, in hindsight, the way they became ubiquitous had a powerful sense of inevitability. But the revolution they represented is old now, and nothing comparable has come along for more than a decade.Despite this, a regular ritual of hype and hysteria is now built into the news cycle. Every now and again, at some huge auditorium, a senior staff member at one of the big firms based in northern California – ordinarily a man – will take the stage dressed in box-fresh casualwear, and inform the gathered multitudes of some hitherto unimagined leap forward, supposedly destined to transform millions of lives. (There will be whoops and gasps in response, and a splurge of media coverage – before, in the wider world, a palpable feeling of anticlimax sets in.)It happened again a fortnight ago, when the Google chief executive, Sundar Pichai, addressed his company’s annual developers’ conference. Among his other tasks, he was there to rhapsodise about developments in artificial intelligence, and the ever-evolving application known as Google Assistant (created, he said, to “help you get things done”), and a new innovation called Duplex. “It turns out that a big part of getting things done is making a phone call,” he said. He then mentioned getting an appointment for a haircut: “You know, we’re working hard to get users through those moments.”The screens behind him lit up, and the sound system played a synthesised female voice, whose words were punctuated with authentic-sounding umms and aahs. The voice conversed with a human being at the other end of a phone line, who apparently had no idea she was talking to a machine, and the software seemed to quickly and seamlessly secure a 10am appointment. Pockets of the crowd went into raptures. “That was a real call you just heard,” said Pichai. “The amazing thing is, our Assistant can actually understand the nuances of conversation.”Now, when was the last time you came to book a haircut or restaurant table and concluded that the task was so onerous that you would ideally delegate it to a machine? And even if you can easily think of a scenario, would there not be something ethically questionable about doing so, if the person at the other end had no idea who or what they were talking to? In fact, might Duplex be a grim portal into a future in which high-flyers get digital “assistants” to do their chores, while poorly paid people have to meekly talk to computers, in constant fear that they are about to be automated into joblessness?Pichai also announced the introduction of a new feature of Gmail called Smart Compose: a kind of supercharged predictive text that offers you extended phrases as you type, which then build up into whole sentences. (To quote one report, the software will “tailor its predictions to each inidual user, based … on information that Google already knows about you”.) Pichai showed an email exchange in which Smart Compose understood that the matter at hand was “Taco Tuesday”, and suggested “chips, salsa, and guacamole”. Hearing more whoops of delight from the audience, I thought about a vision of the near future in which half the human race will converse in preordained cliches.The endless noise emanating from Silicon Valley essentially has two complementary elements. One is all about dreams so unlikely that they beggar belief: the idea that the Tesla CEO Elon Musk will one day set up a colony on Mars or that Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg can successfully marshal an attempt to “cure, prevent and manage” all diseases in a single generation. Whatever its basis in fact, this stuff casts people and corporations as godlike visionaries, and then provides a puffed-up context for the stuff the big tech companies shout about week in, week out: stuff we either don’t need or, worse, which threatens some of the basic aspects of everyday\u0026nbspcivilisation.Our phones are full of apps that gather digital dust, and the same fate has befallen many supposedly groundbreaking inventions. Though the idea of internet-enabled spectacles has potentially fascinating uses in such fields as autism, education and high-end manufacturing, Google Glass was never going to be a mass-market product in the way its inventors thought.Yet some people fall in love with these things. Among the great mountain of writing at the heart of the current so-called “techlash” is a great book entitled Radical Technologies, by the former tech insider Adam Greenfield. When he writes about people obsessed with the kind of internet-enabled devices that monitor sleep, heart rates and exercise levels, he nails something that applies to a whole array of allegedly cutting-edge innovations. “A not-insignificant percentage of the population has so decisively internalised the values of the market for their labour,” he writes, “that the act of resculpting themselves to better meet its needs feels like authentic expression.” What he says echoes a key passage in Guy Debord’s visionary text The Society of the Spectacle, published 50 years ago: “Just when the mass of commodities slides toward puerility, the puerile itself becomes a special commodity this is epitomised by the gadget … The only use which remains here is the fundamental use of submission.”Such ornate words speak an enduring truth. Amazing and sometimes life-enhancing innovations, I dare say, are being worked on by tech geniuses across the world. In fields such as driverless transport, virtual reality and blockchain technology, new inventions may eventually transform our lives, and fulfil the cliched big-tech promise about making the world a better place. But that is the not the nature of our current phase of history, nor the absurd and often dangerous creations we are now being offered on an almost monthly basis.Ignore all those whoops. If we do not want to live in a world in which “assistants” trick us into flimsy conversations, and human contact is a chore left to the bottom of the labour market, we do not have to. There is a basic fact about the future the figureheads of big tech too often forget: that what it will look like is actually up to us, not them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f5be77eb8940b3ddc5835ac692accda65b9b82b/0_0_4080_2448/master/4080.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=691f03f31546567bf548579ef059a63e","title":"jeremy corbyn values brexit detail labour ambiguous","story":"The Labour leader’s position on leaving the EU remains ambiguous. Maybe he just doesn’t care that muchAmbiguity on Brexit has spawned many Jeremy Corbyns, and they all lie in the eye of the beholder, depending on political allegiances, frustrations and hopes. There is the cunning Corbyn: secretly a hard Brexiter but who doesn’t want to alienate remainers. There is the craven Corbyn: pro-remain but too afraid of Brexit populism to be too open about it. There is also another pro-remain version: coy Corbyn, playing a game of political subterfuge, winking at remain Labour voters and waiting for the government to be completely worn down before he swoops in with a campaign for a second referendum. Then there is calm Corbyn: above all else, a democrat and a respecter of the will of the people, so he will grit his teeth and think of England.It is likely that none of these Corbyns exist. He has sent signals that can be interpreted in any of these ways. He has been a strong supporter of withdrawal from the single market, but still won’t come completely off the fence on the matter. He consistently denies interest in a second referendum but also indulges speculation, saying late last year that he would vote remain in a second round. When confronted, he won’t rule a second referendum out.Why all the uncertainty? Perhaps the more straightforward explanation is that Corbyn simply doesn’t care about Brexit enough to engage with it robustly one way or the other.But “indifferent Corbyn” fits no one’s narrative. He cannot be smeared by Blairites as a parochial anti-trade ideologue leading his naive young remain supporters down the Brexit path he cannot be lauded by the party faithful as a wise man with a plan, and he cannot be painted by the right as an open-borders-loving softie.Even his most consistent positions are not necessarily a smoking gun. Voting for article 50, sacking a shadow cabinet minister who called for another referendum, and urging MPs to abstain from votes that make the government’s life harder need not indicate covert support for Brexit. They may be attempts at asphyxiating a combustible issue, one which could be used against him by Brexit-supporting opponents.Sure, Corbyn is interested in Brexit, but only insofar as it is a tool with which to club Theresa May and the Tories. Like last week, where at prime minister’s questions he nailed her on the weakness of her negotiating hand given the isions within her own party.But he doesn’t always show up. In fact, he has received repeated criticism for failing to challenge May in parliament. And his on-off enthusiasm over Brexit exposes the things Corbyn really does care about: austerity, rampant capitalism and inequality. As a frontbench Labour MP told me, Brexit is quite far down his list of priorities. His view of challenging the government does not involve spending lots of time bogged down in technical detail about the Irish border.And that’s fine. Indifferent Corbyn is not necessarily a bad thing – the reason he became popular in the first place is because he had not been swallowed up by the dulling obligations of technocracy, nor did he have the detached tone of other Labour figures who lost the pulse of the party’s voters. These same figures, incensed by Brexit, still do little but scold leave voters for their ignorance and agitate for a second referendum – despite the fact that there’s little polling to suggest there is a popular appetite for one.Even if they are right about the impossible technicalities of leaving the EU, the “it’s all above your head” argument isn’t really a vote winner. There’s a reason it didn’t cut through first time round. Corbyn’s strength remains in his ability to focus on issues such as job security (job losses due to businesses relocating over Brexit uncertainty was his focus in last week’s clash with\u0026nbspMay). Brexit fatigue also works for him. In this month’s English local elections there was a distinct “bins over Brexit” vibe.But Corbyn’s changeability and inconsistent engagement on Brexit also plays into what could be seen as his greatest weakness: that he is only a flagship values politician, valuable on the back benches but not interested in the mundane daily grind of government. Corbyn is NHS, austerity, nationalisation, social housing. He is Stop The War and nuclear disarmament. As far back as the referendum campaign, Corbyn’s listlessness over Brexit fed the impression that he was lukewarm and not leadership material.I sympathise with indifferent Corbyn. Brexit came out of the blue, within a year of his election as party leader. It hijacked a space that could have been utilised for returning Labour to its socialist roots and mounting a credible challenge against the Tories, which was all he ever wanted. After all these years in the wilderness he finally had a clean shot, and Brexit got in the way. But now it’s here, he has a chance to burnish his leadership credentials, be forensic, adopt a firm stance (be it hard or soft Brexit) and prove he can do detail as well as drama."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/646862c53997537d13a7009da31c80fede44f4d1/2_299_3465_2079/master/3465.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc32407ec4642b916181f7480f8186ba","title":"drax power station to lead fresh carbon capture trial","story":"Biomass-burning unit to use pioneering technology that aims to cut emissionsDrax Group will lead a £400,000 trial to capture and store carbon at its north Yorkshire power station in an attempt to kickstart a technology that has repeatedly failed to get off the ground in the UK.The company was part of earlier efforts to build a £1bn prototype carbon capture coal plant, but pulled out in 2015 after it missed out on renewable energy subsidies. Now the firm will try again with a pioneering form of the technology, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), to cut emissions from one of its four biomass-burning units. Experts believe the project is a world first.In theory, BECCS can reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, as the trees for the power station absorb carbon dioxide as they grow, while the carbon dioxide released from generating electricity does not enter the atmosphere.Most of the UN climate science panel’s scenarios for stopping dangerous global warming assume the use of such “negative emissions” technology, though critics have said it would not work at scale. Drax has partnered with University of Leeds spin-off C-Capture for the project, which starts this month. The carbon will be stored in a compressed form on the site, which the firm hopes to sell to an as-yet-unidentified partner for industrial processes.Energy minister Claire Perry said the pilot was “hugely exciting”, while the Carbon Capture \u0026amp Storage Association called it an “important step”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4eeb97a1be0a94bb56c9e68bc58ee85bdfd69feb/0_0_2063_1238/master/2063.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bd8aeca88c2ea294efe0d9737c506e3","title":"alexis sanchez admits he has struggled to adapt at manchester united","story":"Alexis Sánchez has admitted he has struggled to adapt to José Mourinho’s style of play since joining Manchester United from Arsenal.The Chilean failed to make an impact during United’s 1-0 FA Cup final defeat to Chelsea at Wembley on Saturday and, in general, has only intermittently shone for United since arriving at Old Trafford in January as part of the deal that saw Henrik Mkhitaryan move to north London. Sánchez has managed only three goals in 18 appearances and is often on the periphery during matches.“I think that in every game I’ve played in I’ve maybe found it hard to adapt to the style of play and I’ve been getting to know my team-mates,” said Sánchez.The loss to Chelsea meant United ended the season without a trophy, but Sánchez, speaking before the encounter with Antonio Conte’s side, is optimistic about the future. “I believe that United really is a very big club on a worldwide scale and even more so in England where it’s the biggest,” the 29-year-old said. “They always want to win and to be fighting on all fronts and that’s the reason I wanted to come here.“I also had some great players alongside me at Barcelona, some highly experienced guys who had great quality. I think that United are not too dissimilar as a club to them in their size and stature. However, we still have areas where we can improve, and we can do this day-to-day and a game-to-game basis. I believe we need to improve in all aspects.”United finished second to Manchester City, their highest place since the title win in Sir Alex Ferguson’s last season five years ago. Yet their 81 points still left them 19 behind Pep Guardiola’s team. Sánchez believes the away losses to the three promoted sides – Huddersfield Town, Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion and Newcastle – ultimately proved costly.“We need to be focused and concentrated in the big games and the same in the so-called lesser games too,” he said. “That’s what the great sides do and I think United are a great side, so that’s what we need to do. Manchester United is a massive club that always aspires to win big trophies and that is what I’m trying to make happen. I want to try and keep improving so we can see the club winning trophies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/423fdc5e61480b928a3b8b2fc4b84b49c42c9a67/0_86_3296_1977/master/3296.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1482149d9c2be25241adbf21a87d4897","title":"jose mourinho targers summer move for toby alderweireld manchester united tottenham hotspur","story":"José Mourinho is targeting Toby Alderweireld as part of the Manchester United manager’s intended revamp of his defence this summer, with the Tottenham Hotspur centre-back open to a move to Old Trafford.Alderweireld is out of contract in 2020 and discussions over fresh terms have reached a virtual impasse. The Belgian is conscious he can leave Tottenham next summer for €25m (£22m) due to a clause in his deal, though only if an option to extend until 2020 is activated.United are aware any move to sign Alderweireld will be made difficult by the tough negotiating skills of Daniel Levy, especially as the Tottenham chairman will not wish to sell a prime asset to a direct rival. Should Levy be prepared to sell he would no doubt demand a sizeable fee from United, perhaps even more than the world-record £75m that Liverpool paid Southampton for Virgil van Dijk in January.Whether Ed Woodward, United’s executive vice-chairman, would countenance such a fee for a player edging towards his 30th birthday remains to be seen, with Alderweireld’s wage demands also to be considered. The player currently earns a basic £50,000 a-week at Spurs and would seek closer to treble that for what would be his last major contract.Alderweireld would fit into the profile of the experienced player Mourinho wishes to add as he seeks to challenge Manchester City next season, a requirement echoed by Nemanja Matic after Saturday’s FA Cup final defeat to Chelsea.While the interest in Alderweireld may put Chris Smalling’s future in the balance, the manager also wishes to add a fresh right-back, left-back, wide forward and at least one midfielder, Shakhtar Donetsk’s Fred is thought to be of interest to Mourinho in the latter position."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae3287885b5d0d30dc6d562659dcd022ee528d86/10_241_3490_2093/master/3490.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1dfb1208577e793c21459d3ba94c8feb","title":"fernando torres takes his leave as atletico madrids historic memory","story":"This time it really was the end for The Kid, taking his final bow with Atlético on an emotional evening at the WandaDefeat hit hard and so did the coach, apportioning blame and pointing the finger they had let everyone down, he said. It was 2001, Spain had been knocked out of the U17 World Cup, and during the flight home Fernando Torres and Andrés Iniesta, close friends since they had met at 14, decided to put their feelings into words. As they sat on the plane, they wrote a letter outlining everything that had gone wrong. They never posted it but the writing helped and when they touched down back at Barajas airport they swapped shirts, dedicating them to each other. On the shirt Fernando handed to Andrés, it read: “One day you and me will win the World Cup together.”Nine years later, they did. Eight years after that, they bade farewell together. Six hundred kilometres apart but on the same day – the kids, fathers now, who scored the two most important goals in Spain’s history, in Vienna in 2008 and Johannesburg in 2010, played their last games at their clubs. Their paths have not been the same, but their departures shared more than just a date and because there are two of them, friends, team-mates and popular idols, because they leave the country, the loss feels more significant still.Iniesta’s official send-off was on Friday. Samuel Eto’o and Xavi Hernández were among those there Real Madrid were represented by Emilio Butragueño, video messages were played, Pep Guardiola and Sergio Ramos appearing and Iniesta’s shirts sold with the number on its side, infinity instead of eight. On the same night, Torres had begun his goodbye from the statue of Neptune in central Madrid, thousands of fans before him, celebrating their Europa League success against Marseille 55,000 had gathered there where Torres said he had stood himself 22 years before, back when he was 11.But while their departures had been announced some time ago, even though they’d had moments that felt like farewells already, Iniesta dancing his last waltz in the Copa del Rey final, Torres lifting the trophy in Lyon, and although they’d been commemorated three days earlier, this time really was the end.Torres lifted the trophy, captain Gabi inviting him to join him, just as Antoine Griezmann had invited him to. With a couple of minutes to go, Torres was still on the bench that was when Griezmann ran across and told Atlético’s assistant manager, Germán Burgos, to send him on. In his penultimate game for the club, he won his first title. As he stood before fans the following night he insisted: “For all those kids who have dreams: nothing is impossible, and still less if you’re Atlético.” For years, though, winning anything seemed impossible, which is why they never blamed him for going. In fact, they encouraged him to they loved him, so they set him free. His only other title was the Second Division, 16 years ago – and that too helps to explain his impact, why Sunday mattered so much. When Torres returned, Diego Simeone insisted he had signed the footballer not the icon, but that is what he is. Just in footballing terms, his departure is not so traumatic. Torres, though, is not just a footballer. He is The Kid from Fuenlabrada, the youth product and fan, who appeared when they were relegated to the second ision, the embodiment of hope, their only hope. One little year in hell, Jesús Gil called it, only it turned out to be two but Torres led them back, became the youngest ever captain, and leaving took longer than anyone imagined. He turned down Real Madrid. He embraced and embodied Atlético’s identity, understanding and expressing it better than anyone, the pitch, tone and sentiment invariably perfect.He suffered but waited when he walked, it wasn’t just with their blessing but their gratitude. He was too good for this team, they knew they convinced themselves that it was as if he hurt more than they did and didn’t stop supporting him. Liverpool shirts appeared at the Calderón. When he returned with them, both sets of fans chanted his name. When he returned properly, they were delighted. At his presentation over 35,000 were at the Calderón. He was always acutely conscious that he hadn’t actually done very much, almost a little embarrassed at how well they treated him. “You made me the happiest person in the world,” he said on Sunday. “I remember that he asked what he had done to deserve that when he came back,” Gabi said this week. “Well, I ask what we have done to deserve having you as the greatest exponent of Atlético around the world.”A lot had changed since he had been away, since Simeone had arrived. When he scored his first goal Jean-Francois Hernández was among his team-mates when he scored his 100th, Jean-Francois’s son Lucas was. He’d been away and come back and in the meantime Atlético started to win. He surpassed 100 goals, but from his return until Thursday they didn’t win again. Mostly, he embraced a secondary role, although the sense he could offer more ultimately hastened his departure. He lifted the trophy, delighted, but had only been on the pitch a couple of minutes.Torres talked about the Champions League final in Milan as the game of his life they were playing Real Madrid, the club where, he once insisted, “they don’t feel their football”, and lost on penalties. But at least they had played in a Champions League final, and that was unthinkable before. Which didn’t hurt any less but shouldn’t be forgotten and he was a reminder, so important precisely because he had been there in the bad times as well as the good. As well? Instead.“Now that we win,” Iñako Díaz Guerra wrote, “we have to remember who we are. And that’s what Fernando’s there for. It’s not that he’s the veteran who came on to waste time and treated it like a gift it’s not that he’s the star who won the World Cup and the Euros but never felt so fulfilled as when he won the Europa League as a bit-part with Atleti, his Atleti it’s not a star saying goodbye, it’s our historic memory.”Raised on Germany Street, the country against whom he scored the winning goal at Euro 2008, first taken to the Calderón by his grandfather in January 1995 to see Atlético draw 1-1 with Compostela, Torres recalled going to school in Fuenlabrada, “almost always pissed off because we had lost”, feeling like a lone Atlético in a place dominated by them, wearing his tracksuit in defiance. On Sunday, he walked out, for his last ever game, knowing Atlético were going to finish ahead of Real for only the second time this century.Atlético have finished the season having let in just 22 goals in 38 games. He left after they let in more than a quarter of that in a single game. Things had changed, alright. “I never needed a trophy to feel like the most loved player in the world,” he said on Sunday. By then, at last, he had one, 17 years after his debut. Outside the Wanda politano, a giant shirt was there for fans to sign. Photographs were lined along the concourse outside, a blond kid with freckles, an open-air Torres museum. He walked on for the last time as captain, carrying Nora, Leo and Elsa with him, his shirt, like those of all his team-mates, embroidered with the slogan: from Kid to Legend. A huge mosaic delivered the same message. They chanted his name. They lifted from their seats when he raced into the area, only to hit the ball wide, and again when he put a shot into the side netting. Then it happened: they roared when Ángel Correa laid it on a plate for him to score. There was another roar when he got the second, racing through to finish. Running into the crowd, he disappeared under the bodies.On his last night at the Calderón, he had scored twice. On his last night as an atlético, here he was again: two goals, ahead of Real Madrid, a winner at last. But going now, just like Iniesta who was in tears in Barcelona. Even the DJ and his abysmal music couldn’t entirely ruin it. There was a guard of honour and a joint ceremony with Prieto at the start. At the end, after he departed with 10 minutes to go, almost ceremoniously handing over the captain’s armband to Leo Messi and sitting in tears on the bench, he was lifted by team-mates and thrown into the air. He took to the microphone to offer one last: “Visca Barca! Visca Catalunya! Visca Fuentealbilla!” “I’ll always tell the story of the day I was at Iniesta’s farewell,” Ernesto Valverde said.In Madrid, they’ll talk of the day the Kid left. Torres went down the tunnel, and returned, team-mates giving him a guard of honour. Opponents Eibar applauded him too. No one had left, the place packed, but there was silence as the video played, a freckled kid with a blond mop appearing on the screen, and as he took the microphone. “I’d like to start with those in the ‘third tier’,” he said, looking up beyond the stand in front, to the heavens, “especially Luis Aragonés, who showed us what Atletico Madrid is, and to my granddad …” His voice broke, tears appeared in his eyes. Gripping tighter, he pressed on: “… who gave his grandson the greatest gift you can give, which is to an atlético …”With every line – his parents, his wife and children, staff, team-mates – Torres seemed to swallow harder and the pauses grew longer, filled with song from the stands. “Today is the last day. It’s been over 400 games and it’s very hard knowing that this is the end,” he said. Then he started crying. As he circled the pitch one last time, they sang Atletico’s theme, a capella. And then, like Iniesta, he was gone.• All that and it comes down to this … nothing, really. For the first time, La Liga went into the final day with everything sorted. There was nothing to play for, unless you count the battle to be best of the Basques – Eibar for the first time. No relegation, no European places, no Champions League, and definitely not the title, which had been wrapped up early enough that they even managed to present Barcelona with their trophy in the season they actually won it.• Speaking of the Basque country, this is the second worst season in Athletic’s history.• It wasn’t just Iniesta, Prieto and Torres saying goodbye – already quite a hit in a single day. Among others, there was also Joaquín Caparrós, Asier Garitano and, although no one said so, Gareth Bale, scoring on what is probably his last game in Spain – at the stadium at which he scored his first."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cf9b04da6d9afeaf8cdc62884f8b2e541a1812f/0_231_2459_1476/master/2459.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47a337af3bd0384b1177ee3b2eda9a61","title":"lazios late implosion against inter could haunt the club for years to come","story":"Inter-bound Stefan De Vrij was at the centre of a wild collapse as Lazio surrendered a Champions League place to InterStefan De Vrij folded himself up small and hid his face underneath a training top, but he could not stop the cameras from honing in on him as he sat for the final time in Lazio’s home dugout. The curtain was coming down on the 2017-18 Serie A season, and the team whose shirt he was still wearing had just lost its Champions League spot to the one he will play for next year.A messy situation under any circumstances, but even more so for how events unfolded. Lazio had led 2-1 with 12 minutes remaining against Inter, in a game they only needed to draw. That was before De Vrij gave away a penalty, scything down Mauro Icardi. The Argentinian converted, and the Nerazzurri went on to win 3-2.Of course, there was more to it than that. Between Inter’s goals, Senad Lulić got himself sent off for a needless second yellow. Even before the penalty, Lazio’s manager, Simone Inzaghi, had ceded the initiative by taking off lone striker, Ciro Immobile, and sending on a full-back, Jordan Lukaku. There were echoes here of Inter’s collapse at home to Juventus last month.We might also point out that De Vrij was forced into his desperate challenge as a result of team-mates’ mistakes. Éder was granted too much space as he played a ball over the top to Icardi, whose run should have been tracked by Bastos. Thomas Strakosha could have been out quicker to close the angle too, but instead De Vrij was left scrambling.He might have been better served by keeping his feet, but would critics have been mollified if doing so had allowed Icardi to breeze past and bury a shot from open play? De Vrij, solid otherwise, was caught making a split-second decision for which there might not have been a right answer. The greater question is whether he ought to have been on the pitch in the first place.Then again, the dilemma facing Inzaghi was hardly straightforward. Lazio were without two key men – Luis Alberto and Marco Parolo have combined for 15 goals and 20 assists, before we even get into their broader contribution – and with Immobile only just back from injury. To deprive himself of De Vrij, his best centre-back, on top of that could hardly be done lightly.Inzaghi’s comments at the start of the week suggested he was considering his alternatives. It was only after a reported meeting between the defender and a group of the team’s ‘senators’ – senior players including Immobile, Parolo, Lulić, Lucas Leiva, and Ştefan Radu – that the final decision was made. The manager might also have considered how De Vrij saved Lazio from a potential defeat in their previous game, against Crotone, with a goal-line clearance.He refused to throw De Vrij under the bus, reminding reporters his team had opportunities to seal the deal sooner. Fourth place was theirs to lose after Inter lost at home to Sassuolo. If Lazio had just beaten Crotone – themselves relegated this weekend –Sunday’s match would have been a dead rubber.Instead, it is an occasion that may haunt this club for years to come. This has been an exceptional campaign for Lazio, whose 89 goals scored were both a club record and the most in Serie A. Inzaghi’s team also beat Juventus to the Supercoppa,reached the Coppa Italia semis as well as the quarter-finals of the Europa League.None of this was expected of a team whose budgetlags behind Inter, Juventus, Roma, Milan and Napoli. Credit is due to Inzaghi for forging a clear identity – that of a side who relinquish possession in favour of devastatingly direct counters – and sporting director Igli Tare, for building a squad so deep that Felipe Anderson, scorer of his team’s second goal on Sunday, can no longer hold down a regular starting spot.Lazio have, in Inzaghi’s words, “come one centimetre away from everything”. They exited the Coppa Italia on penalties, and the Europa League after blowing a three-goal aggregate lead in Salzburg – conceding three in five second-half minutes. Even in Serie A, they still finished levelwith Inter, behind them only by virtue of head-to-head results.Not that the Nerazzurri will feel much sympathy. The Stadio Olimpico will forever be the ground where they lost a title on 5 May 2002, with Lazio twice coming from behind to win 4-2 despite having nothing to play for on what was the final weekend. Inter, who began that day in first place, were overtaken by Juventus and Roma.Their fans, nevertheless, have a long-standing gemellaggio (twinning) with Lazio’s, which permitted a convivial atmosphere on Sunday. The number of Inter supporters attending the game was estimated at between 12,000-15,000.They celebrated long into the night, and will no doubt carry on into the summer. Inter have not played in the Champions League since 2011-12. To return to that competition is a critical element of the business plan drawn up by their Suning ownership group and might also have been the difference between hanging on to Icardi – who finished level with Immobile as Serie A’s top scorer on 29 – or seeing him depart.“Finally, all these goals are worth something,” said Icardi. He has scored 100 in five league seasons with Inter. Asked about De Vrij, he dismissed any suggestions of a conspiracy: “I don’t think he did it on purpose. Every professional tries to do things to the best of their ability, so if something like this happens it’s just fate.”Not everyone in Rome was feeling so generous, though De Vrij’s late substitution did not bring down the universal cacophony of jeers some might have expected. He has been a committed servant and key figure for Lazio these last four years. And now, in part thanks to his own foul, he is off to play in the Champions League for someone else.• Some way to sign off for Milan, who thrashed Fiorentina 5-1 to tie down sixth and spare themselves Europa League qualifying in July. It also guaranteed that Atalanta return to Europe, despite losing to Cagliari.• Crotone were unable to repeat last season’s great escape, losing 2-1 to Napoli. Walter Zenga appeared legitimately crushed, describing himself as “dead” and lamenting with understandable bitterness how direct rivals had put together runs of two or three wins at the end. • As for Napoli, victory meant they become the first team to break the 90-point barrier and not win a Scudetto. Whether Maurizio Sarri will still be in charge next season remains to be seen. The manager said he still needs to speak to his family, but owner Aurelio De Laurentiis indicated there was no more time for stalling.• And finally, farewell to Gigi Buffon – for Serie A, at least. There’s no way I could say everything that needs to be said in the few words left to me here, but this league will not be the same without the greatest keeper I’ve had the privilege to watch. Here’s hoping the next adventure proves as eventful and entertaining as the past 23 years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e765d7366cb4ab7b7941f2576d58cd282bf4c649/0_252_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0841c0a6796a5625d1f7bae75f35c53e","title":"fa cup cans of worms serie a drama and talking turkey football weekly","story":"Max and co talk the FA Cup final, dramatic scenes in Italy, club legend departures and a former Swan deciding the Turkish titleRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

He says his imprisonment means the delicate peace pact that his gang and others negotiated with the mayor of Quibdó is now dead.Since April, Cuesta, a key figure in the peace talks, has languished in the deprived Colombian city’s overpopulated Anayancy prison, alongside a dozen other ex-gang leaders. Cuesta’s list of convictions over the years is exhaustive, a catalogue of time in and out of prison for offences including extortion and, this time around, the alleged murder of his former lawyer. Yet it wasn’t always this way. Cuesta was once on track to realising his dream of becoming a professional footballer, until life took a turn for the worse and he resorted to criminal activity to make a living. “The peace process has no future here,” reflects the 29-year-old, under the watchful gaze of the guards.The problem is not unusual in Colombia, where the Bogotá government has struggled to enforce a national peace accord in parts of the country where it holds little sway. Quibdó, however, has previously bucked that trend.The city, where the authorities struggle to provide basic services, has long felt abandoned by the state. Its predominantly black population sought to deal with their own safety. The pact over Quibdó’s street warfare once distinguished it from other Colombian cities, riddled with violence and poverty.Now they find their reconciliation process threatened by the same question rocking Colombia as a whole: how should gang members who agree to turn in their arms account for their crimes?The Quibdó pact, signed in September, was an attempt to lower the crime rate before Chocó’s famous San Pacho festival. The gangs agreed to lay down their weapons in exchange for the promise of access to education and work opportunities. Murder rates and vandalism dropped dramatically. “There is one simple problem,” says Quibdó’s mayor, Isaias Chalá. “These kinds of processes usually start from the top and work their way down … from the presidency down. But we started it the other way round.”In April, the Colombian vice president, Óscar Naranjo, travelled to the region, applauding the pact for its success. Three days later, without warning, came the arrests. Chalá claims the order to jail Cuesta and the other gang leaders came from the national police, “as a restorative justice process needs to be carried out”.A former slave-trading hub on the Pacific coast, Chocó remains one of Colombia’s most impoverished and marginalised regions. “Chocó is a region that has been marginalised, stigmatised and abandoned by the government, since the time of post-colonisation,” says Edwar Calderón, a Colombian academic at the University of Edinburgh.Since the signing of Colombia’s peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia in late 2016, a power vacuum has been created in areas where the guerillas demobilised, allowing criminal armed groups to expand. “What has happened with the Farc leaving these areas are territories without control. What we are seeing now is the same violence as before, sometimes even worse, but without control,” says Calderón.Amid the renewed violence, he wanted to try find a way to stop young people from joining gangs. Calderón hit upon the idea of using funds from an academic project to create a workshop involving Colombian artists and musicians.With the help of Mr Klaje, a Colombian music group who create instruments from recycled materials, and a group of artists from Fundación Casa Tres Patios in Medellín, a week-long workshop was held in late April.Tatiana Gamboa, a 29-year-old mother from the impoverished Obrero neighbourhood, took part.“It’s important, because all of the people who are here have had some kind of issue with one another,” she says.Another participant, Luis Romaña, 26, talks about displacement in his hometown. “Quibdó has seen a big increase in population over the last decade, a lot of it due to the arrival of displaced people as a result of the armed conflict. The population began to grow, there was no control over this, and we lost security in the city.On the final day of the workshop, young people from a variety of backgrounds, and from rival neighbourhoods, took part in a parade. Old buckets and paint tins were transformed into drums and carnival costumes crafted from sequins and feathers as the participants called for an end to violence in the city.Yeiner Belalcázar Paz, 40, better known as Candyman, is a teacher and the frontman of Mr Klaje. He comes from a neighbourhood in the Colombian city of Cali, where he grew up surrounded by gang crime.“We believe that art has a power that can help with the kind of processes that are happening like the one in Quibdó. It is like a magic tool. The young people here like to dance and sing. They live through art. When they hear a drum it runs through their veins.”Among those taking part was a group of about 15 young people from Reposo 3, a neighbourhood taxi drivers wont go near. One was Baeron Palomeque. “We don’t have a football pitch, a community centre or anywhere to carry out recreational activities, so the dance group is the only thing we have,” he says. “It is helping to keep a lot of these kids off the street and has brought young people from rival neighbourhoods together. The government must do more though.Many of the workshop attendees told of their childhood in the Chocó region.Rosney Mosquera, 29, has just finished her high school diploma. “I’ve been a victim throughout my life. A victim of displacement, moving from neighbourhood to neighbourhood all my life. I’m a victim of rape and of armed conflict.“There is a lot of violence in the neighbourhood where I live. People have always been fighting and killing one another.”The organisers were pleased with the outcome of the event. “When the young people realised that they could work together, they started to integrate, and when this happened they said that they didn’t know why they thought about people from other neighbourhoods the way they did before,” says Candyman.“There were a few young indigenous people there, and the black population of Quibdó. Both usually kept to their own groups. But when we started to do the activities, they started to come together.”On the final day, as the parade made its way through the puddle-laden streets of the city, onlookers peered from balconies, tapping their feet to the infectious rhythms and listening to the young people as they chanted: “Our neighbourhood is your neighbourhood, our street is your street. No more violence, Quibdó.”At one point they went past the prison where Cuesta is being held, reflecting on the ruined pact he built."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4256122727c396cf654c561d8c9e97a9bb96e23e/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97d57f03b2a4823daf35621fa3f3942b","title":"malaria rates soar venezuela five times more cases than in 2013","story":"Shocking reversal for country once lauded for nearly wiping out the disease, reflecting wider problems in failing healthcare systemVenezuela is facing an escalating malaria crisis, even as the infection rates have continued to decline across most of the rest of the planet.The situation is a shocking reversal in a country that was once seen as a flag bearer for global malaria eradication. Once the Americas’ most malaria-infected country, the disease was almost wiped out between the 1960s and the 1980s. Now, however, while infection rates have been in decline across the rest of the Americas, malaria is exploding in Venezuela and cases are being exported across its borders as people flee conditions in the country.This weekend’s re-election of Nicolás Maduro – Chavez’s political heir – suggests that any imminent change of policies may be unlikely.Venezuela’s rising malaria rates are one of the most visible aspects of growing problems within the country’s healthcare system, with maternal mortality and cases of HIV and tuberculosis increasing as access to treatment has collapsed.And the bleak irony – say analysts – is that the alternative system of health clinics in the country’s slums, set up by the late socialist president Hugo Chávez to bring healthcare to Venezuela’s poorest, may have contributed to the country’s dire provision.“In the Americas, it’s not just Venezuela. We’re actually reporting increases in a number of other countries. Venezuela – yes this is a significant concern. Malaria is increasing … in a very worrying way,” said Alonso.Venezuela’s complex health emergency mirrors the country’s long-running political and economic crisis, and is marked by a shortage of drugs and materials for control of the disease, allied with a politicisation of healthcare and population movements driven by extreme poverty.Cases have been appearing in the capital, Caracas – traditionally an area with a low incidence of malaria – where they have been imported by people returning from jobs in mines in the country’s south. Writing recently in the journal Science, Venezuelan malaria expert Maria Eugenia Grillet outlined what was driving an “alarming” and “unprecedented” increase in cases of malaria.Grillet blamed “economic and political mismanagement”, which she said had “precipitated a general collapse of Venezuela’s health system, creating an ongoing humanitarian crisis with severe social consequences”.She added: “The malaria epidemic has been fuelled by financial constraints for the procurement of malaria commodities – such as insecticides, drugs, diagnostic supplies and mosquito nets – and surveillance activities, internal migration associated with illegal gold mining, and lack of provision and implementation of services.”Those issues, say other experts, have been exacerbated by the Venezuelan government’s refusal to acknowledge the scale of the problem.Most controversial will be the claim, made by health experts in Venezuela, of the contribution of the Misión Barrio Adentro clinic system established by Chávez and staffed by Cuban doctors – which is accused of undermining the country’s long established healthcare system.Marianella Herrera, head of Venezuela Health Observatory in Caracas, echoes Grillet’s observations. “Venezuela is one of four countries in the world, along with South Sudan, Yemen and Nigeria, where malaria is increasing sharply. “The question is – why is it happening in Venezuela, which was the first country to eradicate malaria?“The answer is that many of Venezuela’s health programmes have been weakened by the governments of the last two decades, in particular the prevention strategies for malaria, like DDT-spreading and health education.“When they built the Barrio Adentro they did not integrate the new health system … Now the combination of corruption, the lack of quality healthcare and the economic crisis has created a time bomb.”A second issue, according to Herrera, is the peculiarity of malaria-reporting in Venezuela, where many in the most affected areas suffer multiple reinfections. “If you are a person who had malaria five years ago and go again to a malarial region and get reinfected, that gets reported as the same case, with the risk you do not get treated.”A final issue is the way in which access to healthcare has become tied to the governing party via the carnet de la patria now being requested in addition to the traditional national ID.The problems in Venezuela’s failing health system were also highlighted by a report late last year by the Toronto-based Icaso, which focused on the “triple threat” to the country of worsening malaria, TB and HIV provision. Co-author Mary Ann Torres told the : “In large part, there is complete lack of government interest both because the current government has used healthcare as a political weapon and also because it does not want to admit that the first country to claim malaria elimination has a malaria crisis.“They have not declared an emergency because that would be to admit that the Chávez revolution has failed, and failed miserably.”Torres also warned that the nature of the crisis, which has seen up to 37,000 crossing the borders daily into other countries, had huge implications for Venezuela’s neighbours. Working on the report, Torres said they had come across shocking stories.She fears too that the scale may not actually be known. “The worst part of the epidemic is in the south-east at the border with Brazil, which is where the mines are.“It is very difficult to get data because everything there is so controlled. We have only heard rumours: that the military is selling nets or selling treatment, or exchanging treatment for other things.”While the government has said little, even pro-regime websites like Venezuelanalyis have begun conceding the scale of the problem, although it blames “recent sanctions imposed by the US, Canada and the EU” for hindering Venezuela’s ability to pay for imports of food and medicine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37a67274251425716bf563193826a9c9d2baf7a1/0_290_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=862704de10338e38d8374ab03efda3e3","title":"anna jones vegetarian barbecue recipes","story":"Vegetables shine when cooked on an open flame, whether that’s pepper and feta parcels roasted in the embers or a carrot and fennel salad charred on the grillThis week I bring you the two best things I ate last year at barbecues. One was cooked in my sister’s front yard in the LA sunshine the other in my British back garden, hurriedly, before the dark clouds descended. Both were unreasonably delicious and are now firmly on my summer lineup. I’ve edged the barbecue closer to the back door so we needn’t even wait for the sun.This is my take on Greek feta bouyiourdi, although I char my peppers first as it doubles the smoky hum. I use the pale yellow-green Turkish peppers: they are long and thin, sweeter and milder than their green pepper cousins, but, if you can’t find them, don’t worry. This is best done on the barbecue, but you can also char the peppers over a naked gas flame, then cook the parcels in the oven.2 fresh Turkish peppers or 1 green pepper1 x 200g block feta, cut into 5 slices1 handful cherry tomatoes, halved (I used different coloured ones)1 tsp coriander seed, bashed in a mortar1 pinch of dried oreganoOlive oilLight the barbecue. Once hot and still roaring, cook the peppers directly on the flame until they are blackened all over. Take off the heat and, once cool, peel away most of the black skin and cut the flesh into slices, discarding the stems and seeds.Put the feta slices on a piece of foil large enough to wrap around them. Top the cheese with the tomatoes, peppers, coriander, oregano and a drizzle of olive oil. Seal the foil at the top to make a little parcel.Once the barbecue flames have died down and the coals are white, put the packet on to them and cook for 10-15 minutes (you could also do this in an oven at 220C425Fgas 7).It’s ready when each slice of feta is soft, the peppers cooked-through and the tomatoes sticky and roasted.This is the kind of salad around which to build a meal: yoghurt, greens, charred carrots and fennel generously spiced and with a little sweet and sour. I used baby carrots here, but big ones work just as well.600g different coloured carrots, washed and scrubbed2 bulbs fennel1 tsp cumin seeds1 tsp fennel seeds1 tsp ground turmeric 1 tbsp maple syrup2 tbsp red-wine vinegar2 tbsp olive oil6 tbsp Greek yoghurtSalt and black pepper2 handfuls peppery lettuce leaves If you are using bigger carrots, cut them into halves, quarters or even thick coins. No need to peel. Fill a large pot with generously salted boiling water and blanch the carrots for seven to 12 minutes (depending on size), until they are cooked through but still holding their shape.Meanwhile, slice the fennel into thin wedges across the root and toss with the cumin, fennel seeds, turmeric, maple syrup, vinegar and olive oil and seasoning in a baking tray. Drain the carrots and add them, tossing again. Leave to sit for at least 30 minutes – ideally for a few hours or overnight.When you are ready to cook, heat the barbecue or griddle pan. If you are using a barbecue, cook the carrots and fennel slices on once the flames have died down but the coals are still red hot. Turn from time to time, until they are charred all over and soft throughout.Meanwhile, mix the yoghurt with a few tablespoons of the remaining marinade and a good pinch each of salt and pepper. Spread the yoghurt over the bottom of a plate, toss the leaves in any remaining marinade and scatter them over the yoghurt. Put the charred carrots and fennel on top and serve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45063def60a31d54dd090ee67b3eb2b3e886d74c/0_229_5122_3073/master/5122.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c7f52a32c5c2b5b16c417940686f71f","title":"seven ways to manage anxiety","story":"There is some evidence that herbal products such as kava, galphimia, German chamomile, bacopa, ginkgo, roseroot and others may reduce anxiety symptoms due to their sedative effects. The most researched of these is kava, which has been found to be effective in several placebo-controlled trials, and may compare favourably to benzodiazepines. However, for all these products, research studies remain limited. There have also been safety concerns regarding kava due to some reports of liver toxicity. If you are considering herbal medicines, you should discuss with your doctor, especially regarding any medication you’re already taking.A few studies have suggested that nutriceuticals can help reduce anxiety. One fairly large placebo-controlled trial found that magnesium decreased anxiety in patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms, while another study of 100 anxiety patients suggested that the supplement a-casozepine peptide could help. In patients with panic disorders, inositol has been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks. Again, as with herbal products, consult your doctor before taking supplements in case of adverse interactions with medications.In the past few years, a range of free apps have been developed to try and tackle anxiety. Flowy – designed with assistance from the Centre for Anxiety Disorders and Trauma at King’s College London – uses a game situation to reduce anxiety and panic, coaxing the user into practising breathing-control. In a 2017 study, the IntelliCare suite of apps – which teach users self-management skills for tackling anxiety based on psychological research – was found to significantly reduce anxiety symptoms.Caffeine is a psychostimulant and there are many decades of research to suggest it can both exacerbate the symptoms of GAD and also trigger panic attacks. Likewise, while many people with anxiety turn to alcohol as a calming sedative, that can trigger a vicious circle, where stress levels increase once the alcohol is processed and the initial effects wear off.Trying yoga, massage therapy or meditation can help keep anxiety under control, while practising various relaxation techniques for 30 minutes, two or three times a day, can also help with the muscle tension that anxiety can cause."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe9f5fc0305552e36b68e49c1bd90fbf72e9336d/400_122_2091_1255/master/2091.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=187ae1610febb3f45f835f23728c85a7","title":"russian broadcaster rt three new ofcom investigations","story":"Ofcom has opened three new investigations into the Kremlin-backed news channel RT for potential breaches of the broadcasting standards code, on top of the seven investigations it announced last month. The media regulator placed the 24-hour news channel’s output under additional scrutiny after the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, which has been blamed on Russia.The latest potential breaches identified by Ofcom include an episode of RT’s flagship CrossTalk discussion show broadcast on 20 April, which described all of the US government’s potential strategies in the Syrian civil war as “poorly thought-out options”.The regulator will also investigate two news items on the channel, originally known as Russia Today, for alleged lack of balance.One, captioned “Face of nationalism”, discussed the Ukrainian government’s position on nazism and the treatment of Roma Gypsies.The second was a report on the treatment of anti-fracking activists by the UK authorities, which included interviews with Bob Dennett, the co-founder of campaign group Frack Free, and Joe Corré, an anti-fracking activist.“We note the new investigations by Ofcom, and will work with the regulator through its processes,” said a spokesperson for the Russian channel.An Ofcom spokesperson said RT has historically had an acceptable record when it comes to breaches of broadcasting rules. However, when the regulator began extended monitoring of the channel after the Salisbury attack it discovered multiple potential breaches of the UK code. The regulator said that as a result it would continue to monitor the output for the foreseeable future, given the number of potential breaches.An 11th investigation into RT, dating from the end of last year, is continuing into the apparent use of fake tweets by the former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond on his eponymous show. In extreme circumstances Ofcom has the power to withdraw RT’s ability to broadcast in the UK for continuous breaches of broadcasting regulations, depriving it of the right to be distributed through Freeview, satellite and cable services. However, this would not necessarily be a disaster for the business. RT has delighted in its outsider status, holding up official criticism of its output as evidence that it is speaking truth to power and giving an alternative view. Prof Stephen Hutchings, of the University of Manchester, who is leading a research project into RT, said this month that the broadcaster’s future could lie in its successful and unregulated online operation. “They would love for Ofcom to ban them,” he claimed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bc7bcd53fa82a16f9a698e55b17778f61b90ec0/0_0_4352_2611/master/4352.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3905047d61546343ccd02f0d1a31f12a","title":"best reusable coffee cup waitrose","story":"Waitrose says I have to bring my own cup – what should I get, and is this a ploy to stop the freebies?Every week a  Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.My local Waitrose says I have to bring my own coffee cup from next week.

Annilese Miskimmon’s staging of Puccini’s Madama Butterfly, first seen during the 2016 tour, is new to the main festival. Richard Jones’s production of Strauss’s Der Rosenkavalier premiered in 2014. Both ided opinion when new, and both are essentially anti-Romantic in stance, stripping away the veneer of sentimentality that each work has accumulated over time.Miskimmon’s Butterfly is more a reworking than a straight revival, though the basic concept remains the same. She updates the opera to the closing years of the American occupation of Japan, and places the narrative in the wider context of an exploitative system that offers local girls the possibility of escaping poverty by becoming GI brides and allows US servicemen to take advantage of conveniently dissolvable marriages. Two years ago, Miskimmon’s anger rode roughshod over the opera’s humanity, resulting in a hardness of edge that sat uneasily with the score’s emotive force. This time round, greater subtlety of detail combined with striking performances allows the drama fully to hit home.Butterfly is played by the Moldovan soprano Olga Busuioc, whose exceptional way with dynamics and tone colour allows her to encompass both the naivety of the opening scenes and the tragic emotions of the later acts. We can completely understand her attraction to Joshua Guerrero’s handsome if weak-willed Pinkerton, and there’s a real sense of rapture in their love duet. But we also notice the telling streak of pride that lurks beneath her vulnerability in the way she loftily dismisses Simon Mechliński’s Yamadori and rounds on Elizabeth DeShong’s fiercely devoted Suzuki. Omer Meir Wellber’s conducting, meanwhile, has a tremendous, slow-burning intensity that draws us relentlessly into the opera’s unsettling world.Musically, Der Rosenkavalier is equally strong for the most part, although conductor Robin Ticciati got off to an awkward start on opening night with an uncharacteristically lacklustre account of the prelude. Rachel Willis-Sørensen is the outstanding Marschallin, sumptuous of tone, witty yet sad. Kate Lindsey makes a comparably fine Octavian, and is gauche, funny, extremely touching in moments of bewilderment. Elizabeth Sutphen’s Sophie sounds exquisite, while Brindley Sherratt’s Ochs combines louche charm with genuine menace.Jones’s staging, however, is by turns admirable and perplexing. As one might expect, he is strong on the class isions that underpin the opera, sharply differentiating between a declining aristocracy, an emerging bourgeoisie and an urban proletariat on the make. His treatment of the protagonists has great clarity. Ochs’s humiliation of Sophie in act two has rarely felt more uncomfortable, and time really seems to stand still in the Presentation of the Rose and the final Trio. Against that, however, must be set a quirkiness that sometimes gets in the way. The designs, surreally jumbling periods from the 18th century to the 1970s, sit uneasily with an opera that is essentially a realistic comedy of manners. The Marschallin muses on her past as a psychoanalytic patient on Freud’s couch, which strikes an awkward note. And there are moments when parades of servants and flunkies, endlessly shifting furniture, prove intrusive. It doesn’t quite add up to a theatrically satisfying whole, though it is unquestionably beautiful to listen to.• At Glyndebourne until 26 June (Der Rosenkavalier) and 18 July (Madama Butterfly).

Is it difficult having been an ex-member of such an influential band and not really having seen much financial reward (although I assume the new writing career is going OK)?I think often people who do something new, creatively, don\u0027t benefit finanacially from it - it\u0027s the people who come after and make them palatable that make money. But it was never a though t in our heads that we would make money - we were thrilled and delirious that we could live the lives we were living and could express ourselves, and have access to different countries, and a mouthpiece: that was absolutely way beyond our goals. I still feel now that if you\u0027re going to go out on a limb artistically, then young people have to accept the fact they\u0027re not going to make money - that\u0027s the price you pay for not having to wear certain clothes to work, to walk the path you\u0027ve taken. As for now, it took me three years to write the book - the advance was £8000 and I\u0027m bringing up a daughter, so no, I\u0027m not making money now either.When you’re writing, do you have an ideal reader in mind – someone you’re speaking to?I definitely had an ideal reader in mind for the first book, which was either myself when I was young, or my daughter who was then about 15, or young women between 15 and 25, and I wanted to give them an honest account of a girl growing up, and an honest account of what I had experienced growing up - all the obstacles and humiliations - because I don\u0027t think women tell the honest truth of the downsides of their lives. I was being called a legend and I don\u0027t think that\u0027s helpful for people coming up in the world because it\u0027s intimidating and excluding. I wanted to tear the whole idea of a legend to pieces, and show the truth: whether that\u0027s shitting yourself, getting the sack, being ridiculed, being lonely - it was like my alternative CV.With the second book I didn\u0027t have an ideal reader in mind as it developed quite out of my control, this detective novel of why am I so full of anger, why did I pick up a guitar when I was poor and uneducated. It started out as a novel, but I realised the woman was me, and I realised it was more interesting to write that, that the angry woman was me - in a way the second book might have been for me. But it didn\u0027t start out that way. And if you absolutely try and be honest about your feelings and actions, that the chances are it will resonate with other people - though sometimes I think oh god, I will have lost everyone here! To my amazement, every time, it does resonate with many others - even that fight with my sister, I\u0027ve since heard so many people come up and say that similar things happened with them.I loved your most recent book: it carried many echoes of my own family relationships. In particular it really made me consider my own personal blind spots. Do you feel that writing it taught you anything about your own?Yeah, writing it was like writing a detective story and finding clues asI went along - clues to my own and my own family\u0027s behaviour. Which was very illuminating. With knowledge, came compassion and understanding, so it definitely redemptive in a way I suppose. And helped me be less judgmental and narrow minded about my family and their actions. As to my own blind spots, it\u0027s revelatory really, when you suddenly realise you\u0027ve seen something completely wrong, because we trust out own version of events so completely. Same thing with a crime scene - five people can have completely different accounts. My account wasn\u0027t the definitive truth, we all had our own truths and they were all equally valid.What music do you listen to these days? Or have you stopped?After the Slits I found that I couldn\u0027t listen to music - it was a bit like the way you feel after breaking up after a long relationship, and it was just too painful. The sound of the instruments reminded me of what I lost, or the songs were too upsetting, or they were annoying because people weren\u0027t as good as we were! That hasn\u0027t gone away. I haven\u0027t found music comforting since the 80s, but it doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s not good - it just doesn\u0027t work for me. It\u0027s shocking to me because music was my religion from the age of 11, and it\u0027s like I don\u0027t believe in my god any more.How do you feel about the current tendency of people towards being outraged andor offended?I know it\u0027s annoying, but I think it comes from either people feeling they have no power, or a certain sense of frustration, or a sense of guilt. And also combine that with the way everyone has a platform now, it\u0027s been magnified. Frankly I get offended easily myself, and it\u0027s so easy to get it out there nowadays. It\u0027ll probably die down once the internet... it\u0027s still so new, and it\u0027s a phase. The 70s were a bit like that as well, and that went away again. Then again, capitalism came in - people were more interested in making money than moaning. But I think it probably is a phase.Have you ever had a favourite guitar or were you interested in them as things?My favourite guitar was - I can\u0027t remember if it was 50s or 60s - a pale wood Telecaster, and it made me a better player. It was beautiful, so easy to play. But then I was told it was stolen off Marianne Faithfull\u0027s boyfriend, he got in touch and obviously I gave it back to him - I was down a guitar and a couple of grand. The thief got away with a couple of grand, and I lost it. I\u0027m not really into fetishising guitars or guitarists, and as Mona Chalabi\u0027s girlfriend asked: why are white people so enthralled with guitars and guitarists?I was nearly your new drummer girrl in 1978 instead of Budgie and have some regrets about not running for it from my teen home life and jumping into a new life of music \u0026amp gigs. You lot were braver than me and we’re an immense influence on my girl gang of teenage friends. Been waiting for more stories from the women of Punk about their experiences.Can you recall any ‘magic ‘ moments when something unexpected happened?I\u0027ve probably exhausted all my anecdotes in my books to be honest!What piece of creative work you have done in music, film or writing are you the most proud of? Have you ever thought of doing a VLog?I\u0027m proud of everything I do, actually. I haven\u0027t done much, only three or four things, and I put three or four years into each. They\u0027re the best I can do at the time. I\u0027m very strict and vigorous with myself, so it would be cruel to pick any one thing - I always did my best at the time.No, I haven\u0027t thought of doing a vlog.I love it every time you’re on the radio … you’re incredibly articulate … admit it - you’ve had elocution lessons … wot is your favourite song from the punk era? and your favourite song ever?Thank you! It\u0027s funny, but up to six or seven years ago, I could barely speak - I had lost all my personality and confidence, due to years of illness,. and a marriage going wrong, and motherhood can be quite isolating. I\u0027m a different person now. I\u0027ve gradually taught myself to speak and have thoughts on subjects though I still feel quite nervous about it. I trained to speak again and have thoughts, when I was living in Hastings, and I would drive along the seafront interviewing myself to build back up my confidence. I asked myself what my favourite colour was, and why, and I had to build up a story about why. Asked about the buildings along the seafront, the weather... I just built up my confidence. My accent has changed, and when I hear old tapes of myself I had a very street accent now, it\u0027s just an amalgamation of growing up in London.As for my favourite punk song ever, I\u0027m not keen on listing musicians or songs as if they were breakfast cereals. But my favourite breakfast is French toast with fresh berries and maple syrup because I found that all breakfast cereals give me the shits.Why didn’t the Slits release a record until late 1979, long after punk was over?I’d have bought it.No one would sign them! Partly down to record company reticence to get involved with them \u0026amp them holding out for a proper record deal Punk was a word, it was not over by 79 but had changed. John Peel played the “punkier” versions of the Slits songs so when the album came out it took us by surprise in a good way.We didn\u0027t want to release an album until we could play what we could hear in our heads - and it took a year and a half to play out instruments well enough to do that. We did the Peel sessions which you can buy and they do capture that energy - they are incredibly tight even though the engineers laughed at us at the time. They\u0027re probably now dead and we have a top 50 album of all time at Island Records. So that\u0027s that.Your first memoir had a huge impact on me. I read it as I was about to turn 40 and found it completely inspiring, so much so that I’ve named a character after you in a play that I’m writing about some exceptionally cool and creative women. If you could choose your legacy and the lasting influence your lifecareer might have on other creative women, what would it be?I\u0027ll give an attempt to answer this but off the top of my head - to be creative rather than an entertainer involves being selfish, not only about your time but the impact your work will have on those close to you. It involves being an outsider to some degree and both those things are not how women are brought up to be, or made to feel comfortable. You have to face that you will probably be poor. All those things are uncomfortable, especially to women because of how they\u0027re brought up. But if you are that sort of person, you probably can\u0027t live any other kind of life, so you might as well get on with it.Who was your favourite teacher at Creighton school? Why?I think I had two. Mr Hasdell and Mr Reed. Mr Hasdell was my English teacher and brought Shakespeare alive for me Mr Reed was my art teacher and treated me - in a time when teaching was quite cruel in many ways - like a human being and let me spend all my time in the art room and asked me to lend him records. Without any flirting or sexuality, they were just really great teachers who cared about learning, and when they saw someone who was responsive to a subject, went out of their way to make you feel worthy of attention. I had failed the 11+ so I really needed that help.Have you ever had a job? What was it?I have spent my life trying not to have a proper job and have mainly succeeded! That\u0027s one of the reasons why people went to art school, because you were considered a dropout. I sold ice cream in Villiers Street, the Mr Whippy kind I was second assistant runner on commercials cleaner leaflet deliverer I did work at the Institute of Electrical Engineers for a couple of summers as assistant to the secretaries, and god knows how I got it because I turned up in an old Victorian petticoat, and this was not when people wore vintage! That was the only job my father was interested in, including my being a musician. I did have to pull a G string out of the arse of an actor on a commercial one, a man playing a sumo wrestler - that was the worst job I\u0027ve ever had. He actually asked me to do it. Nowadays I would say no because there\u0027s much more awareness of where the line stops in terms of exploitation or humiliation of underlings as he saw me - that\u0027s what\u0027s good about the MeToo movement, it\u0027s giving women an idea of when they can say no. I didn\u0027t feel particularly abused, but it took me a long time to get that makeup out of my fingernails - I think it was makeup anyway...Would it be unfair to think that many people in the punk scene had issues relating to dysfunction?Maybe dysfunction gives you the freedom to be a punk. That kind of raw, honest, original creativity could only erupt because of the bad experiences and lack of help or understanding that people had lived through.I think that\u0027s true, though at the time in 76 and 77 we didn\u0027t have words to describe social or mental difficulties, even things like Aspergers and ADHD, and I think that really was something we all had in common - we came from dysfunctional families or had mental health issues.

The foreign affairs select committee said the government’s lax approach to tackling international money laundering is putting money “directly into the hands of regimes that would harm the UK, its interests and its allies”. In a hard-hitting report titled Moscow’s Gold: Russian Corruption in the UK, the committee said the government was failing to follow through on the prime minister’s “robust rhetoric” in the wake of the Skripals’ poisoning. “These assets, on which the Kremlin can call at any time, both directly and indirectly support President Putin’s campaign to subvert the international rules-based system, undermine our allies, and erode the mutually reinforcing international networks that support UK foreign policy.”Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, the committee chair, said: “We can no longer allow ‘business as usual’. The UK must be clear that the corruption stemming from the Kremlin is no longer welcome in our markets and we will act.“The scale of damage that this ‘dirty money’ can do to UK foreign policy interests dwarfs the benefit of Russian transactions in the City. There is no excuse for the UK to turn a blind eye as President Putin’s kleptocrats and human rights abusers use money laundered through London to corrupt our friends, weaken our alliances, and erode faith in our institutions.”The report said the UK’s weakness to act to stem the flow of potentially questionable Russian money was exposed just days after the UK expelled two dozen Russian diplomats following the attempted murder of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury. “On 16 March – two days after the government announced the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats from the UK – Russia raised $4bn (£2.97bn) in eurobond issuances, nearly half of which were bought by investors from the UK,” the report said. A day earlier Russian energy company Gazprom raised €750m (£656m) in a bond sale, some of which were bought by UK investors according to VTB Capital, a Russian bank subjected to US sanctions.Following the sale, the Russian embassy in the UK tweeted:“The ease with which the Russian government was able to raise funds in London despite the strong measures that the government took in the wake of the Salisbury attack raises serious questions about the government’s commitment to combating Russian state aggression,” the report said. The committee also said the flotation of En+, a Russian energy company controlled by oligarch Oleg Deripaska on the London Stock Exchange last year, was also an example of “the contradictions inherent in UK government policy towards Russia”. Tugendhat said the government must be “clear that the Kremlin is no longer welcome in our markets. We must be united in our efforts to match rhetoric with action – in the City, through government policy and among allies in the US, G7 and EU,” he added.“We call on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to set out a coherent strategy on Russia that clearly links together the diplomatic, military and financial tools that the UK can use to counter Russian state aggression.”The committee recommended that the government close gaps in the sanctions regime that have allowed companies to use London markets while being sanctioned in other jurisdictions. It also suggested that sanctions be extended to target more iniduals who are closely linked to President Putin’s regime. Deripaska has previously described the grounds for including him on a US sanctions list as groundless, ridiculous and absurd.Speaking before the report’s publication, the Russian ambassador to London, Alexander Yakovenko, said: “We believe that the statements like ‘someone is a friend of somebody’ is not the legal basis for taking decisions against someone.” He warned that Russian citizens based in London “could go to the courts and put certain things in front of the courts. They are going to complain – some of them are preparing these moves and the government should think twice.”He added Britain had a reputation to protect as a believer in the rule of law.

Not this year. When it really counted Saracens and Exeter performed as well as they have done all season in their respective semi-finals on Saturday, paving the way for a rip-roaring Premiership finale at Twickenham.If Saracens were spectacular at times in their 57-33 destruction of Wasps, the Chiefs were even more dominant in crushing Newcastle 36-5 at Sandy Park. The two top teams in the end-of-season table have raised their play-off games and neither sounds inclined to settle for consolatory pats on the back on Saturday.It says a lot about Exeter’s consistency over the past 18 months that, on paper, Rob Baxter’s defending champions boast the slimmest of edges. Having finished eight points clear of Saracens in the regular season and beaten their north London rivals home and away, they play relentlessly to their strengths and will back themselves to fight to the finish just as they did in their extra-time victory over Wasps a year ago.One key statistic also suggests they are a club still on the rise. Of the XV who kicked off the final against Wasps last May, just four started Saturday’s semi-final despite virtually everyone being fit. Even popular elder statesmen like Gareth Steenson and Thomas Waldrom are on the bench these days, having been superseded by the Simmonds brothers from Teignmouth. Breaking into the Exeter line-up is increasingly as tough as the actual games.With Dave Ewers also returning to his best and Don Armand continuing to make a mockery of his exclusion from England’s summer tour party, the Saracens pack can expect a much heavier-duty contest than Wasps could supply. While Maro Itoje, Mako Vunipola and Vincent Koch are all finishing the domestic season in impressive fashion, the possibility of Billy Vunipola’s tight hamstring limiting his final involvement might just give the Chiefs further cause for cautious optimism.Armand, for one, feels the days of Exeter being overawed by big occasions are long gone. “We are not going to be starstruck by the fact it is the final,” he said. “We just have to pitch up and do what we do. We will take it in our stride, take the learnings of the last two years and hopefully make it work in our favour.”No team containing Itoje, Owen Farrell or the Vunipolas could ever be described as vulnerable, but their next opponents certainly do not view them as invincible. “They have certainly started hitting their straps but we have had very good results against them over the last three or four years,” said Armand. “We know how to play them, we know how to play our game and it is going to be an exciting match. We need to make sure we pitch up and bring what Exeter brings.”While Armand is doing his best to remain diplomatic on the England selection front – “Obviously I am disappointed but we are in a final and I have bigger things to focus on at the moment” – a second consecutive Premiership crown for Exeter would reopen the debate about England’s best options a year out from the World Cup. Henry Slade and Sam Simmonds are in outstanding form, Alec Hepburn makes other loosehead props look positively lethargic and the 21-year-old Joe Simmonds will approach Twickenham full of confidence despite never having played there before.The ultimate test, though, still awaits the young fly-half who kicked a nerveless 19 points against Newcastle to set alongside tries from Nic White, Olly Woodman and Armand. His opposite number Farrell knows Twickenham rather better and slotted 11 out of 11 kicks against Wasps in a display that impressed his team-mates and coaches alike. “The guy’s incredible,” said his Lions Test colleague Jamie George. “He just keeps getting better and better. From what we’ve seen here, the more leadership and responsibility he is given, the better he gets.”Coincidentally, Farrell is due to have his stag weekend on the same weekend as Dylan Hartley, from whom he has just inherited the England tour captaincy, and Saracens’ director of rugby, Mark McCall, feels Eddie Jones has an increasingly key decision to make at No 10 in South Africa. “Owen had a brilliant game and was outstanding for us,” said McCall. “It is going to be a big call for Eddie where he plays him in South Africa. For me his best position is at 10 but I know Owen is happy to play wherever is best for the team.”This week, though, will be all about satisfying Saracens’ ambition to avoid a trophy-less season for the first time since 2013-14. “This is our fourth final in five years and we have been in three Champions Cup finals in five years,” said McCall. “To have those kind of tallies is an incredible achievement from the whole group but we want to go and win it now. You saw in the first 20 minutes against Wasps – which was maybe as good as we have ever played – the real intent and desire in the group to do that.”Two seasons ago, Sarries defeated a slightly off-key Exeter 28-20 in the final, but this year’s rematch could be a modern classic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36b07dae73ca8f1b450b4dd18058f712ad23b68a/0_126_2709_1626/master/2709.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2b16d3647adb9427b70b2db2db83956","title":"own limited edition print sports photographer eamonn mccabe","story":"The award-winning sports photographer Eamonn McCabe, a former  head of photography, looks back at his favourite sporting images from the 1970s and 80s.

There are now nearly 2,000 cryptocurrencies, and millions of people worldwide are excited by them. What accounts for this enthusiasm, which so far remains undampened by warnings that the revolution is a sham?One must bear in mind that attempts to reinvent money have a long history. As the sociologist Viviana Zelizer points out in her book The Social Meaning of Money: “Despite the commonsense idea that ‘a dollar is a dollar is a dollar,’ everywhere we look people are constantly creating different kinds of money.” Many of these innovations generate real excitement, at least for a while.As the medium of exchange throughout the world, money, in its various embodiments, is rich in mystique. We tend to measure people’s value by it. It sums things up like nothing else. And yet it may consist of nothing more than pieces of paper that just go round and round in circles of spending. So its value depends on belief and trust in those pieces of paper. One might call it faith.Establishing a new kind of money may be seen as a community’s avowal of faith in an idea, and an effort to inspire its realization. In his book Euro Tragedy: A Drama in Nine Acts, the economist Ashoka Mody argues that the true public justification for creating the European currency in 1992 was a kind of “groupthink,” a faith “embedded in people’s psyches” that “the mere existence of a single currency…would create the impetus for countries to come together in closer political embrace”,Likewise, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels proposed that the central communist premise – “abolition of private property” – would be accompanied by a “communistic abolition of buying and selling”. Eliminating money, however, was impossible to do, and no communist state ever did so. Instead, as the British Museum’s recent exhibit, The Currency of Communism, showed, they issued paper money with vivid symbols of the working class on it. They had to do something different with money.During the Great Depression of the 1930s, a radical movement, called Technocracy, associated with Columbia University, proposed to replace the gold-backed dollar with a measure of energy, the erg. In their book The A B C of Technocracy, published under the pseudonym Frank Arkright, they advanced the idea that putting the economy “on an energy basis” would overcome the unemployment problem. The Technocracy fad proved to be short-lived, though, after top scientists debunked the idea’s technical pretensions.But the effort to dress up a half-baked idea in advanced science didn’t stop there. Parallel with Technocracy, in 1932 the economist John Pease Norton, addressing the Econometric Society, proposed a dollar backed not by gold but by electricity. But while Norton’s electric dollar received substantial attention, he had no good reason for choosing electricity over other commodities to back the dollar. At a time when most households in advanced countries had only recently been electrified, and electric devices from radios to refrigerators had entered homes, electricity evoked images of the most glamorous high science. But, like Technocracy, the attempt to co-opt science backfired. Syndicated columnist Harry I Phillips in 1933 saw in the electric dollar only fodder for comedy. “But it would be good fun getting an income tax blank and sending the government 300 volts,” he noted.Now we have something new again: bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which have spawned the initial coin offering (ICO). Issuers claim that ICOs are exempt from securities regulation, because they do not involve conventional money or confer ownership of profits. Investing in an ICO is thought of as an entirely new inspiration.Each of these monetary innovations has been coupled with a unique technological story. But, more fundamentally, all are connected with a deep yearning for some kind of revolution in society. The cryptocurrencies are a statement of faith in a new community of entrepreneurial cosmopolitans who hold themselves above national governments, which are viewed as the drivers of a long train of inequality and war.And, as in the past, the public’s fascination with cryptocurrencies is tied to a sort of mystery, like the mystery of the value of money itself, consisting in the new money’s connection to advanced science. Practically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work. That mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal. None of this is new, and, as with past monetary innovations, a compelling story may not be enough.• Robert Shiller is a 2013 Nobel laureate in economics, professor of economics at Yale University and the co-creator of the Case-Shiller Index of US house prices.

OnePlus has embraced what appears to be the smartphone trend for 2018, the “notch” – where the top of the screen cuts into the display to make room for sensors, the earpiece speaker and a 16-megapixel selfie camera.The 6.28in AMOLED screen is enormous, bright, colourful and crisp, with great viewing angles. Technically it isn’t as pin-sharp as some of Samsung’s top-end displays, which have a higher resolution, but you have to really try to see the difference.Also new for the OnePlus 6 is a curved glass back, available in both mirror and matt finishes, and with smooth, polished metal sides, the phone feels really nice in the hand. In fact the whole device feels like a significant step up in quality, matching that of Apple’s iPhone X and Samsung’s Galaxy S9+.There are downsides to a glass back. While it’s not slippery in the hand, it is on fabric surfaces, and the mirror finish picks up fingerprints like a magnet. Scratches are inevitable too, and it’ll be less robust if you drop it. Thankfully OnePlus is one of the few non-Apple manufacturers that makes really nice cases.There’s no getting over that this is a big phone firmly in the phablet category, but it’s not unmanageably wide or unwieldy, comparing well to Samsung’s Galaxy S9+.The OnePlus 6 ticks every box for a top-of-the-range smartphone in 2018: Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 845 processor, at least 6GB of RAM and plenty of storage.But it also feels like a top-end smartphone, absolutely flying along. When OnePlus claims there is “no lag of any kind” it isn’t kidding. The entire system is incredibly snappy all over, from switching apps to launching the camera. It’s delightful.Battery life is good, but not quite class leading. The OnePlus 6 lasted 29 hours between charges, starting up at 7am on day one and lasting until midday on day two.That was while using it as my primary device, with two sims in it, browsing and using apps for five hours while receiving hundreds of push emails and messages, 60 minutes of Amazon Video, around 30 photos and listening to around seven hours of music via Bluetooth headphones.OnePlus puts a customised version of Android on its phones called OxygenOS, this time based on Android 8.1 Oreo, which is the latest available right now, with Android P due in the summer.OxygenOS is a slightly refined version of so-called “stock” Android with small additions and tools, such as the ability to duplicate certain messaging apps including WhatsApp.OxygenOS 5.1 on the OnePlus 6 is the smoothest and most refined yet, matching that on Google’s Pixel 2 for speed, which is a very good thing. It lacks the Google Feed pane, instead having what OnePlus calls the “shelf” containing widgets, which is a shame.Customisation options include the ability to swap out the traditional Android navigation home, back and overview buttons for gestures similar to those used on the iPhone X and a choice whether or not to hide the notch by a permanently black status bar.OnePlus has long struggled to keep up with the likes of Apple, Google, Samsung and now Huawei when it comes to the camera.The OnePlus 6 has a 16+20-megapixel dual-camera system on the back. It uses both colour cameras to increase detail and low light performance, as well as provide a fairly good portrait mode.The camera is much improved, producing some really nice, well detailed and well coloured images in good lighting. Low light performance is also markedly better than last year’s phone, and the app is simple and easy to use. But the OnePlus 6 isn’t quite on a par with the Huawei P20 Pro or the Google Pixel 2. It may not have any real whiz-bang features, and lacks optical zoom, but most will be very pleased with the images for the money.The selfie camera is pretty good too, preserving a solid amount of detail, even in fairly poor fluorescent lighting. The optional beauty mode also manages to smooth skin without erasing beards, which is better than most.The OnePlus 6 lacks the 960fps slow-motion that 2018’s competitors have, but will record very good 720p slow-mo at 480fps for as long as you want, rather than just in bursts.The OnePlus 6 is available in three colours and three storage variants. It starts at £469 with the mirror black finish, 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The version with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage costs £519 in white, gloss or matt black, while an 8GB RAM, 256GB matt black version costs £569.For comparison, the 6.1in Huawei P20 Pro costs £799 with 128GB of storage, the 6in Huawei Mate 10 Pro with 128GB costs £699, the 6.2in Samsung Galaxy S9+ costs £869 with 128GB of storage, the 6in Google Pixel 2 XL with 64GB costs £799, the 6in Honor 10 View with 128GB costs £450, and the 5.8in iPhone X with 64GB costs £999.The OnePlus 6 is premium device that cuts the right corners in pursuit of a sub-£500 price. Starting at £469, it certainly isn’t a cheap smartphone but it is less than half the cost of Apple’s iPhone X and considerably cheaper than the top-end Android competition.It is as smooth and well made on the outside as it is high performing on the inside, which makes it one of the best smartphone experiences available at any price point right now.And while the camera is good, the screen is great, the battery life is good and it even has a headphone socket, there’s no real killer, stand-out feature to set the OnePlus 6 apart.Instead the OnePlus 6 demonstrates that despite what marketers might say, you really don’t need to pay £700 to £1,000 for a really great phone.Pros: good battery life, great screen, excellent performance, dual-sim, great camera, premium build and feel, Bluetooth 5Cons: glass is more fragile than metal, no wireless charging, no IP water resistance rating, no expandable storage"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb1e6ec09d824ce35eb2e8dc2c676afcd9db7afe/14_4_1522_913/master/1522.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3189f717954d27c33bb0bfc27b625851","title":"the handmaids tale series 2 review as intense as tv gets","story":"The dystopian drama has strayed beyond Margaret Atwood’s novel, but it still manages to find beauty in the darkest traumaWant to comment on the new series of The Handmaid’s Tale? Comments are open on our series recap blog.We begin where we left off: with Offred – or June, as she is becoming once more – being bundled, pregnant, into a van and driven away. Into the darkness within, or else the light we don’t – and she doesn’t – know.Light is streaming through a metal grille when a viewing hatch is opened, but it is slammed shut again. Audible clues offer no comfort: shouting, dogs barking. On the soundtrack – used sparingly and so effectively – is the signature falling glissando of doom.The hope drains from June’s eyes. Elisabeth Moss can say more with her eyes and her face than most actors can with 1,000 words. It is 10 minutes before she makes her first utterance, but in that time she displays hope, dread, defiance, defeat and strength again. She says very little in the whole episode (mostly in the flashbacks), yet she is mesmerising.June is pulled out by guards with snarling dogs. She – and the other handmaids – are muzzled and herded along a tunnel. What hell is this where the dogs are not muzzled, but women are? Well, Gilead. Fenway Park, to be specific, home to the Boston Red Sox a place of recreation in happier times. Now? A place of execution. Like Afghanistan under the Taliban, Iran, Guinea in 2009, Chile after Pinochet’s coup in 1973 ... the death knell resonates with reality and with history.A massive scaffold has been erected and a row of nooses are lined up. One is placed over each handmaid’s head, as This Woman’s Work by Kate Bush is played. It is one of those moments in this show that somehow manage to find beauty in the darkest trauma.It turns out to be a mock execution, a lesson to be learned. Aunt Lydia (Ann Dowd on song) shows up with her interpretation of the Christian message and her instruction to love God. “Walk with him and fear him and cleave unto him and you shall obey his word and the word of his servants here on Earth.”Finally, June speaks, offering her own prayer – in her head, at least. “Our Father, who art in heaven. Seriously? What the actual fuck!” It is a moment to gasp for air – of levity, even – and a reminder that humanity still exists. Because the opening is about as intense a TV experience as it is possible to have. I felt it physically, a tightness in the stomach.And that is not the end of it. After the first flashback, to a decision by June and Luke to try for a second child, it is straight back to the nightmare of the present. Aunt Lydia has the handmaids kneeling in the rain, holding rocks out in front as punishment for refusing to stone Janine to death. Filmed from above, it is more beautifully choreographed horror. Janine, incidentally, is on her way to the Colonies. We – the series – will be going, too. And further back, before Gilead, to see how it came about.The first flashback is not all about love and the joy of further procreation. There are warning signs of what is to come. Taking the pill is not a woman’s decision Luke has to sign off on it. “It’s ridiculous,” he says, casually, before signing. Next time – if they had not decided to stop – he would probably have said nothing and signed. There it is, the creeping normalisation.In the next flashback, June is getting a hard time for not picking up her daughter from school the moment she felt ill … for having a job, basically abandoning her child and her duties for her selfish pursuits. In the final flashback, it has begun to kick off: shooting from the gallery in the Capitol building, an explosion in the White House. You are left wondering just how big a leap it is from the Handmaid’s Tale flashbacks to the actual present.It may have been best to leave the show at one season, with Margaret Atwood, open-ended, a hint of better things to come. And with no chance of it becoming diluted or losing the plot. But that was never going to happen – successful doesn’t walk away from an audience.This is next best, exploring not only forward, but backwards, looking at how it came about. No dilution or loss of plot yet, in an extraordinary first episode that will ring on in your nightmares like Aunt Lydia’s bell. Also, think about what has happened since the first series: #MeToo, mass shootings, you-know-who still in the White House, an abortion referendum in Ireland this week … dong, dong, dong, dong. It is not just Aunt Lydia’s bell that continues to chime. While The Handmaid’s Tale continues to be relevant, it needs to be told. Praise be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a78fa85dfbf0c7d2c58df66cd7a644e47813f56e/0_138_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e31d70b3b836e73e610f268f67ff28d6","title":"centenarian women beauty youth aging love","story":"A glimpse into the lives and rituals of centenarian women, whose beauty is rarely acknowledged by Arianne Clément, for the GroundTruth ProjectA glimpse into the lives and rituals of centenarian women, whose beauty is rarely acknowledged by Arianne Clément, for the GroundTruth ProjectThis piece was part of the GroundTruth Project series Emerging Photographers.When I started shooting this story, I wished to talk about elderly women’s conditions in general, but I had no clear idea about what angle I was going to take. I took pictures of nothing and everything surrounding these centenarians from the Montérégie region in Québec, Canada. But one thing kept occurring: every single woman I photographed wanted to groom herself to make sure she would look good in my pictures. This is how it became a story about beauty.I became interested in the efforts that these women put (or didn’t put) into looking beautiful, and the challenges that they face in their old age. I asked them about youth, ageing, feminism, sexuality, charm, appearance, love, and I documented their beauty rituals. Visiting Marie-Berthe Paquette, the woman in the first photograph, was an unbelievable spectacle. She likes to be the center of attention and is willing to do just about everything to make her audience burst out laughing. Every time I visited her, she told me funny stories, sang and danced. In her portrait, she is dancing in a sexy and provocative way for the sake of her audience (myself and two family members). “I personally find myself beautiful, and when I don’t, I do my best anyways! I like to have my hair neatly styled and wear dresses, jewelry and other accessories. I’ve always paid attention to my appearance. In fact, I’m known as la frache (the trendy lady).” Marie-Berthe Paquette, 105 years old, in Montréal, Québec.“I actually care more about beauty today than when I was young. I like to dress rather well, in pretty, simple and practical dresses. I put on foundation and perfume in the morning, lipstick after each meal, and I go to the hairdresser’s every week. I’m also careful not to eat foods that are either too rich or too sweet. It’s important to not let oneself go. I used to enjoy wearing necklaces, but I can no longer attach them, so I gave up.” Solange Racine, 101 years old, in Granby, Québec.To me, the third photo (below) is particularly touching. Laure Saucier, the centenarian in the picture, was very sick and weak but also very peaceful and serene. She didn’t have the energy to move or talk, and even though she used to be a very stylish woman, I doubt she cared about the way she looked any more. But even though Saucier seemed distanced from the physical world, her daughter, Lise Provost, continued to make sure that her mother looked good: that her nails and hair were done and she had jewelry and lipstick on. She knew this used to be important to her mother and wanted to honor her. Since they couldn’t communicate verbally any more, these rituals were their way to stay close together.Through these portraits, shot in 2016, I want to question society’s obsession with youth and beauty standards, and to give a voice to these women whose beauty is rarely acknowledged.“She was very stylish and competitive. She was in love with my father and I think she worried about not being good enough. She always wore lipstick, blush, high heels, earrings, perfume and curled her hair. She’d rub baby oil on herself and bought Madame Avon’s rejuvenating creams. In the evening she went to bed with cotton strips wrapped under her chin and fastened on the top of her head, hoping to lift and tauten her chin and cheeks.” Lise Provost (right) talking about her mother, Laure Saucier (left), in Acton Vale, Québec. Saucier passed away in 2016 at 101 years old.“I definitely find myself as ugly. Beauty fades as we get older. Our noses and ears get bigger, our gait changes, we get hunched backs. Some are worse off than me, but I’m not beautiful at all. Still, I enjoy life and I look forward to the future, even if it’s a short one when you’re 100 years old.” Jeannette Ballard, 100 years old, in Granby, Québec.“When I was young I had long hair, nice legs and curves. Young ladies today all strive to be skinny, but I think that real beauty is natural beauty. We are who we are, and that’s all that matters.” Anne-Marie Pronovost, 100 years old, in Sutton, Québec. Pronovost died in 2017.“The word beauty invokes great classic French authors, and music. When I was young, I always had my nose in a book and I wrote. I don’t mean to brag, but people envied my writing skills. I like Mozart a lot, but it’s Beethoven who really makes my heart sing.” Madeleine Beaugrand Champagneage, 102 years old, in St-Bruno-de-Montarville, Québec. Beaugrand Champagneage passed away in 2017.“Even though we constantly told her that she was beautiful, my mom had always found herself ugly. She often said that she had a monkey face and that she didn’t like her plumpness. My mother regularly dieted. There were stretches where we went without potatoes, bread or desserts. She also tried different weight loss pills. She wore girdles and corsets that she’d buy at Mrs Dinovitzer’s store. I think her weight had always been her biggest fixation.” Provost talking about her mother, Saucier.“When I was young, like all women, I wanted to be attractive. I curled my hair, wore the beautiful outfits my mom made for me and suffered in high heels. Still, I never wore makeup I felt like it was fake. I married my husband because he was handsome, which I ended up regretting. He wasn’t a very good partner and I ended up kicking him out. Rather than maintaining physical beauty, which is vain, I advise young women to cultivate the beauty that surrounds them. You can tend a garden, draw, play music, etc. It’s important to be kind, independent and constantly educate yourself. ” Beaugrand Champagne.“As a young lady, I could not afford to be frivolous. We were poor and had to work all the time. We had to take part in day-to-day chores, pick the raspberries, take care of the babies, cook, help with the harvest, do housework and bathe the children … and all of that without electricity. We didn’t have time to think about beauty.” Solange Racine, 101 years old, in Granby, Québec.“My husband was a very good-looking man. He had beautiful curly hair, and was nicknamed ‘Willy la coche’ (Willy the good-looker). It was very important for him to be always well dressed. When he went out to work at the lumber camp, he’d sell his suit and buy a brand new one when he returned. On the other hand, he was a flirt and a bit fickle: he loved all women and drank too much. But it’s important to be able to forgive.” Anne-Marie Pronovost, 100 years old, in Sutton, Québec.“Of course I’d rather be good-looking rather than ugly! But back when I was young, I couldn’t be bothered with beauty. It was vanity. It was a sin. What really mattered was the family, putting food on the table and making sure that the children were bathed and clothed. I am blessed because my daughter is the one now taking care of me. She welcomed me in her home 20 years ago and I am still there. Family is all that really matters.” Isabelle Gagn (left), 103 years old, in Clermont, Québec, with her daughter (right).“I’m a very rational and level-headed person, and I’m not very sensitive to beauty or art. I come from a very poor family. Spending money at the hairdresser’s or on unnecessary beauty accessories was completely out of the question. I only sewed by necessity. For instance, I made dresses for my sisters using cotton pouches that had been used for storing sugar. Still, I’ve always paid a particular attention to my hair.” Alida Provost, 101 years old, Granby, Québec. Provost passed away in 2016.“My father was a painter and craftsman and he shared his love of art with me. I believe that everything that is artistic is beautiful: theater, picture frames, poems, paintings, flowers, songs. In a person, it’s the character, the silhouette, the smile and the eyes that count. That said, my biggest regret is not getting an education. Doors open for you when you’re educated. Otherwise you feel shame. Regardless of the situation, I would advise young women to educate themselves.” Marie-Berthe Paquette, 102 years old, in Montréal, Québec.Arianne Clément began dabbling in documentary photography while working as a journalist in the Canadian Arctic. Her work with the elderly has been exhibited internationally and has won many grants, prizes and awards.

In one, a Weibo user, referring to Donald Trump, said: “The madman won.” Another deleted post said China’s bid to get US sanctions lifted on the telecommunications equipment maker ZTE had been unsuccessful. “The other points of compromise – or kneeling, to put it more sharply – are small matters,” the user wrote, according to the project.On Saturday, Beijing and Washington released a statement saying they had come to a consensus of “effective measures” to narrow the US’s huge trade deficit with China.It was not clear exactly why the comments were censored. “One reason might be that the authorities are keen to tone down any suggestion of having been forced into concessions,” David Bandurski, co-director of the China Media Project, wrote in a blogpost. “Another reason might be the impulse to offset language that seems to suggest bilateral trade is not, as China now likes to say, ‘win-win.’”Qiu Yi, a former politician with Taiwan’s pro-Beijing Kuomintang party and a professor at the Chinese Culture University in Taiwan and Shanghai Jiaotong University, said his comments on the talks had been deleted within an hour of him posting them.Chinese officials on Monday were keen to show Beijing had stood firm in the talks. A researcher for China’s commerce ministry said in an interview that the country had demonstrated three “bottom lines”: it would not cut exports to the US in order to reduce the trade deficit, no target was set for reducing the deficit – Trump had previously pushed for a $200bn reduction, and China upheld its right to upgrade its industry. The White House’s threatened tariffs had targeted Beijing’s “Made in China” industrial programme.“Despite all the pressure, China didn’t ‘fold’, as US President Donald Trump observed,” the state-run China Daily said in an English-language editorial. “Instead, it stood firm and continually expressed its willingness to talk.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ebd1f9048c30e50860c5a274e643dd6daedfd85/0_187_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36cbad22ff7ffd1126d7859fc3ded965","title":"china dark side moon launch magpie bridge satellite","story":"Relay station will eventually let teams on the ground talk to a lunar probe that China plans to launch this year in world-first missionChina is one step closer to being the first country to land on the dark side of the moon.At 5.28am on Monday, the Queqiao relay satellite was launched from Sichuan province, according to Chinese state media. With Queqiao in place, China will be able to send a lunar probe to the side of the moon that never faces the Earth. No space program has ever reached that part of the lunar surface because of communications difficulties.In a few days Queqiao will enter the moon’s orbit, about 455,000km (282,000 miles) from Earth. Queqiao – which means “Magpie Bridge” and comes from a Chinese folk story in which an arc formed by birds reunites two lovers separated by the heavens – will then act as a bridge between ground stations and the lunar probe.China plans to send its lunar lander and rover, Chang’e 4, to the dark side of the moon by the end of this year. The lunar probe will carry seeds for growing potatoes and arabidopsis, a flowering plant related to cabbage, for a “lunar mini biosphere” experiment.“The launch is a key step for China to realise its goal of being the first country to send a probe to soft-land and probe the far side of the moon,” said Zhang Lihua, manager of the relay satellite project, according to state news agency Xinhua.A four-minute video of the assembling of the rocket and satellite, accompanied by dramatic background music, was posted by state media outlets on social media on Monday. “My country is awesome,” one internet user wrote on Weibo. “Our conquest is the sea of stars.”For the past decade, China has embarked on a space program aimed largely at catching up to space powers such as the US and Russia. In 2013, China became the third country to make a soft landing on the moon.Chinese space officials aim to attempt a human landing in 15 years. The China National Space Administration released a video in April showcasing its planned outpost, a “lunar palace” on the dark side of the moon, with cabins for scientists.Queqiao will also carry a radio antennae that researchers will use to study the early universe, what astronomers call the “cosmic dark ages” after the big bang and before the first stars in the universe were formed. Being in the shadow of the moon blocks electromagnetic interference from Earth, offering a better view of radio signals in the universe and enabling researchers to “listen” to the cosmos, according to Liu Tongjie, deputy director of China’s Lunar Exploration and Space Program Center."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/700aaed5bc224d3d08ad7bccdece728e43c84732/0_233_4943_2965/master/4943.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=422a230aaee98876e1647a74d8f0d20e","title":"germany to roll out mass holding centres for asylum seekers","story":"‘Anchor’ camps will undermine country’s reputation for being welcoming, say criticsMass holding centres that Germany’s interior ministry wants to roll out across the country will stoke social tension between locals and migrants and undermine the welcoming image the country has gained in the eyes of the world, aid organisations have said.So-called anchor centres – an acronym for arrival, decision, return – are designed to speed up deportations of unsuccessful asylum seekers, by containing large groups of people and the authorities who rule on their claims inside the same holding facility.Until now, Germany’s policy has been to embed new arrivals in communities across the country. But Angela Merkel’s government is seeking to reverse its strategy, as a populist backlash builds against the chancellor’s handling of the refugee crisis. “We all know how difficult it is to deport people without protected status after they have been spread out across the country and put down roots in our cities and communities,” the interior minister, Horst Seehofer, told the German parliament last week.“In the future the end of an asylum application will coincide with the start of the deportation procedure,” said the leader of the CSU and former Bavarian state premier, adding that he wanted to see states set up the new centres this autumn.But the transit centre in Seehofer’s home state that is meant to work as a prototype for the scheme has experienced high crime rates, mass protests and rising tensions between asylum seekers and security forces, the  found during a visit to the Max-Immelmann barracks in Manching.The converted army compound is part of a complex outside Ingolstadt, Upper Bavaria, that holds about 1,100 people, mainly from the west Balkans, Ukraine, Nigeria and Afghanistan.“It is like a prison,” said Lucky Raphael, 24, from Nigeria, who said inmates were not allowed to lock their rooms, cook their own food, or go outside to seek work or attend school. “We can go outside, but always in the fear that we could be arrested,” said Raphael, who said he left his home country because of his dire economic and social circumstances, and arrived in Bavaria via Italy.Raphael said had been living in the Manching transit centre for 11 months, though authorities say the average length of stay for people who have arrived here since September 2015 is four-and-a-half months.Bavarian authorities hope to speed up the checking process with technology. They analyse metadata on smartphones and run speech samples through a “voice geometry” programme to determine the travel route and ethnic background of applicants who do not have passports.They are reacting to an increasingly heated political debate about Germany’s failure to deport asylum seekers whose applications have been rejected. Anis Amri, a Tunisian who in December 2016 killed 12 people by driving a truck into a crowd at a Berlin Christmas market, had been rejected but not deported. In 2017, about half a million unsuccessful asylum seekers remained in the country.Anchor centres “send out a signal to people who have low chances of being allowed to stay,” said Daniel Waidelich of the Upper Bavarian government. “It’s not worth coming to Germany, because your claim is processed very quickly here.” Since September 2015, the centre in Manching has carried out 1,000 deportations, while 2,500 inmates have left voluntarily.Critics say the new centres create an absurd double-bind on those inmates at the transit centres who have realistic chances of being granted asylum: while they are actively hindered from integrating into German society while their application is pending, they are expected to immediately integrate as soon as they get the all-clear.“Integration is like a four-legged table,” said Willi Dräxler of the Catholic aid charity Caritas, which has four people doing regular voluntary work at Manching. “Language, contacts in the local community, a job and a home are all vital ingredients. If you saw off one leg, the table is going to wobble. Within these transit centres, however, integration isn’t happening at all.”Inside the centres, frustration with long waits often boils over. “We are not told why we are here,” said Kelvi Batin, also from Nigeria. “It would be better if they told us straight away when we arrived that we cannot stay”.While Manching has not seen incidents like the one at a centre in Ellwangen, Baden–Württemberg, where 200 asylum seekers tried prevent the deportation of one inmate, police have to intervene at the compound on a daily basis. In 2017 the police were called 355 times to the Manching transit centre complex.During a recent media tour of the premises, a group of Nigerians staged an impromptu protest, chanting “We want our freedom” and holding up handmade signs reading: “We’re tired of living in camps. Please, we need transfer.”Dräxler said: “Protests about seemingly small issues like food are often actually protests about the conditions in these centres as a whole. The main source of troubles is that the people inside have no perspective and aren’t allowed to work.”The inability of the migrants inside the centre to engage themselves in the community was also stoking resentment and prejudice among the local population, said Gabriele Störkle of the Caritas centre in Pfaffenhofen. “These transit centres are like black boxes the local population isn’t allowed to go inside, so they project all their greatest fear into what is going on inside them.”“Three years ago, Germany was globally admired for its welcoming culture – the pictures from train stations in Munich travelled around the world,” said Dräxler. “What has happened to that culture? Now there is only fear of refugees.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6869e945a422bef73b6c34f51038d701b77d21bf/0_226_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9112b27823ad5477e9ad2762bb5632d","title":"venezuela elections nicolas maduro wins second term","story":"Main rivals both declare poll, which was boycotted by the opposition, illegitimate due to alleged widespread irregularitiesVenezuelan president Nicolás Maduro has shrugged off international condemnation and allegations of vote buying and electoral fraud to claim a second six-year term at the helm of his crisis-stricken nation. “This was a historic day! The day of a heroic victory! The day of a beautiful victory - of a truly popular victory,” Maduro shouted.Tibisay Lucena, the head of Venezuela’s electoral commission, told reporters Maduro had received more than 5.8m votes compared to the 1.8m of his nearest rival, Henri Falcón.  As results came out, Maduro supporters reportedly let off fireworks in poor Caracas neighbourhoods and danced to Latin pop around the downtown Miraflores presidential palace.But even before Maduro’s victory speech, domestic opponents and much of the international community were denouncing the election as a “fraud foretold”. Henri Falcón claimed widespread vote buying and electoral irregularities meant the election was “illegitimate”. “We do not regonize this electoral process as valid,” he told reporters. “As far as we are concerned there has been no election. There must be new elections in Venezuela.” “All Venezuelans know what happened today,” tweeted Henrique Capriles, who narrowly lost to Maduro in the 2013 election and was subsequently barred from running again. “Our beloved Venezuela must have truly free and democratic elections where the will of our People is reflected in the result.”Luz Mely Reyes, a prominent Venezuelan journalist, tweeted: “Today is a sad day for democracy. The government clings on and manipulates, the opposition is ided and lacking a strategy. And voters are without guides or leadership.”The United States’ mission to the United Nations indicated it would reject the result. “Today’s so-called election in Venezuela is an insult to democracy ... It’s time for Maduro to go,” it tweeted.The president of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, said that his country, “like the majority of democratic countries”, would not recognise the vote. “Venezuela’s elections do not meet the minimum standards for a true democracy. They are not clean or legitimate elections and they do not represent the free and sovereign will of the Venezuelan people,” Piñera wrote.“You have put your trust in me and I will pay back this infinite, loving trust,” he said. To cries of “Vamos, Nico!”, Maduro added: “Today I love the Venezuelan people more than ever before!” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/762365d533459b490c594fcf4d1bff0b849353b2/0_0_6346_3806/master/6346.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85cd6c87ff1695c4ff720c333984561f","title":"sanja matsuri festival yakuza day in pictures","story":"Sanja Matsuri festival is a celebration of the three legendary founders of Sensoji Temple in the Asakusa neighbourhood, with nearly two million people visiting during the three-day event.

Photograph: Trevor McBride. “When I’m in Muff we pray for the President, and when I’m in Culmore we pray for the Queen.”For Archdeacon Robert Miller, that is the only difference between his parish in Donegal and his three in Derry.The rector of Christ Church, St Peter’s and Culmore in Derry City, and Muff in Co Donegal, Archdeacon Miller laughs at the idea of having an “international ministry” given the cross-Border nature of his work.With Brexit looming, he admits there is uncertainty among some in his parishes around what may come, but he says that for the church “the Border doesn’t really exist”.“I have joked that I hope I won’t need my passport to go to Muff on a Sunday morning,” he says, “but the reality is that we’ve been here before with Border checkpoints and crossings and during that time Muff and Culmore related and worked together, so I would be hopeful that whatever happens, we’ll manage.”Culmore is about 3km from Muff. The journey between the two takes less than five minutes and only the changing road signs and a poster erected by the Border Communities Against Brexit campaign group, marking the Border’s location, suggest that you have moved from Northern Ireland to the Republic.There may be complications down the line if a political agreement on Brexit is not reached but Archdeacon Miller says the Church of Ireland existed long before there was any Border.“We predate partition, and the reality then was that the Church of Ireland had to negotiate something that was imposed upon it and which put a Border between some of its dioceses,” says Archdeacon Miller.“But the Church of Ireland is a church of the whole island, and whilst obviously we acknowledge the secular way in which the island is ided, the Church of Ireland operates as a whole-island church.“If you talk to people they’ll say that the reality of the matter is that at partition a line was drawn on a map – and especially during the Troubles things were very, very difficult – but the relationships existed and persisted.”Archdeacon Miller ministers to about 330 families across the four parishes. He says his responsibility is to provide pastoral support for his parishioners throughout the challenges posed by Brexit.“I don’t do down the uncertainty, because certainly for people who are farming, or people whose business causes them to go back and forth across the Border, or even those who work in one or both of the currencies and then have to cross the Border, all of this causes uncertainty for them,” he says.“Each generation will have its own challenge, and in some ways our challenge is Brexit.”The archdeacon says that while it is not the church’s role to have an opinion on Brexit, its responsibility is to react to people’s concerns.“In terms of peacebuilding, you’re always aware that a change in the status quo at the minute could be a difficult thing,” he says. “For people who have lived on the Border for 40-plus years of troubles, that would be a concern if there was an attempt to reimpose it, but it does seem that it will be a soft Border.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3502193.1526838811!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"voters in north would support remain more strongly in second referendum","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe survey was carried out for the Economic and Social Research Council which is funding the UK in a Changing Europe project.  Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA Wire People in Northern Ireland would vote more strongly to remain in the European Union if another Brexit referendum was held, a new study suggests.A total of 69 per cent would favour remaining if there was another vote compared to the 56 per cent who voted to stay in the union in June 2016, the survey by the UK in a Changing Europe project found.Catholic respondents were much more likely to support a united Ireland if there was a “hard exit” in which the UK left the customs union and single market.Some 28 per cent of Catholics would vote for a united Ireland if the UK changed its mind and remained in the EU while 53 per cent of Catholics would vote for a united Ireland if there was a hard exit in which the UK left the customs union and single market.The Irish Border is one of the most difficult questions facing negotiators who aim to strike a deal by the autumn ahead of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU next year.Brendan O’Leary, Lauder Professor of Political Science at the University of Pennsylvania, who also holds a visiting position at Queen’s University Belfast (QUB), said: “The proportion wanting to Remain has risen since the 2016 referendum as more people have become aware of the possible costs and inconveniences of leaving the EU, as citizens and as employees or employers.”The survey was carried out for the Economic and Social Research Council which is funding the UK in a Changing Europe project. It said it provided an authoritative, non-partisan and impartial reference point for those looking for information, insights and analysis about UK-EU relations that stands aside from politics surrounding the debate.Some 61 per cent of the North’s population favoured the UK as a whole remaining in the customs union and single market.The survey also found there were strong expectations that protests against checks at the Irish Border or between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would quickly become violent.Meanwhile, a British government working group including Brexit secretary David Davis, business secretary Greg Clark and Northern secretary Karen Bradley visited Belfast yesterday for what was described as a “customs fact-finding mission”.A statement from the Department for Exiting the European Union said the visit was “part of their working group exploring potential future customs arrangements, focusing on the proposed Highly Streamlined Customs Arrangements”.The department said the working group met representatives from the freight industry, cross-Border businesses and community stakeholders to “further explore how the highly-streamlined customs model could address the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland”.

The sisters removed all of the others months ago, unable to bear the sight of their skeletal, malnourished frames. Five years ago, after the last presidential elections, the sisters were five-and-a-half stone heavier, living healthy middle class lives as paramedics. Today, with their salaries decimated by an economic collapse, their clothes hang off them uneasily, their bones protruding.As Venezuela prepares for fresh polls on Sunday, much of the population like the Perez twins are increasingly destitute and hopeless as they endure an economic crisis that seems to plumb new depths with every new day.“We don’t plan to vote and we’re not interested in elections,” said Lamski. “What we need is food.” As a country that relies almost exclusively on oil income for export revenue, the dramatic drop in global oil prices sparked Venezuela’s downward spiral in 2015 but in its path it revealed a political system rife with corruption and a socialist production system decimated by government interference and mismanagement.Just this week Kellogg\u0027s became the latest multinational to announce it would close its operations in the country, fed up with complicated price controls and shortages of raw materials.Boxes of corn flakes made by Kellogg are seen on a shelf inside a local shop in Caracas, where basic foods and other good are regularly A recent study conducted by several of the country’s top universities showed that in 2017, the average Venezuelan lost 11 kilograms and that 87 per cent of the country now lives in poverty, compared to only 48 percent who lived in poverty three years ago.Venezuelans who fall ill are met with a collapsing public health system, with most hospitals unable to stock items as simple as gloves. Moreover, the national pharmaceutical association estimates 90 per cent of the drugs needed to treat chronic conditions are unavailable.  “We’re seeing more HIV patients daily catching opportunistic infections, and many are dying,” said Mauricio Gutierrez, an advocate who warns of an AIDS crisis on par with the original 1980s outbreak due to a shortage of life-saving antiretroviral medication.As a freelance nursing assistant and paramedic, the Perez twins’ monthly salaries equate to less than $5 per month. They struggle to buy enough food for two meals daily and Tatsienlu has stopped taking medication for a chronic back injury.“Sometimes we even split an egg between the two of us,” Lamski said.But despite leading his country down an unprecedented economic collapse, President Nicolás Maduro is the favourite to win reelection Sunday, buoyed in part by a population dependent on him to survive the very crisis he helped create.The cost of coffee has jumped over 16,400 per cent in one yearMr Maduro has responded to widespread food and medicine shortages by creating a system of food handouts and subsidies on which a majority of the population now depends. On Sunday he will leverage those benefits to get out the vote. Central to the government’s new system of subsidies is an identification card known as “Fatherland Cards,” which Mr Maduro introduced in 2017. Venezuelans use the cards to receive periodic cash bonuses, sometimes spontaneously announced by Mr Maduro at political rallies, and sometimes to register for and receive food handouts.On Sunday they’ll also be asked to scan those cards outside of polling stations at government campaign tents known as “red spots”.While there’s no evidence to suggest government officials will know how cardholders vote, a running list of those who showed up at the polls will be maintained.  And Mr Maduro has suggested at several rallies that he’s “considering a prize” for those who vote.“The government has essentially created its own clientele,” said Trino Martis, a sociologist at the Central University of Venezuela.  “Public funds will be used for those who show up and vote for them, he added, dismissing the scheme as nothing short of “extortion and blackmail.Mr Maduro has campaigned with his wife Cilia Flores as he rallied his supporters ahead of Sunday\u0026#39s voteBut Mr Maduro will also be favoured thanks to an opposition in disarray, left fractured and squabbling after bloody anti-government protests left over 160 dead last year and mostly failed.  With many of its most popular politicians disqualified, the largest parties have called on supporters to boycott the vote.Instead Mr Maduro will face former governor and socialist party dissident Henri Falcon, along with former evangelical pastor Javier Bertucci. While some polls have given Mr Falcon a slight edge over Maduro, critics say a pro-government electoral board will tilt the results in favor of Mr Maduro.Mr Falcon has railed against the government’s use of Fatherland Cards and “red spots” as a thinly veiled vote-buying scheme. His campaign introduced a formal demand with the country’s supreme court to prevent the system.“This means that public money is being used for something shameful, to buy votes using ‘red spots\u0027,” his campaign manager Claudio Fermin told local paper El Nacional.Javier Bertucci speaks to supporters, during his campaign closing rally. Despite an unexpected surge in support he is unlikely to trouble Mr MadusoBut some government supporters like Jennifer Lizarazo deny Mr Falcon’s claims that the government has leveraged Venezuelan’s hunger to increase vote totals. As a longtime supporter of Mr Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chavez, Ms Lizarazo sees the Fatherland Cards as another social programme from the government to help the poor.“This has helped me a lot,” she said, scrolling through her cell phone using a government created application showing all of the cash bonuses she has received using the card. “Of course, we should ideally be able to get food in the supermarkets.”She has friends who receive food handouts but vote against Maduro, she said, and government campaigners register the cards just to “keep a control and get people to vote.” For Ms Lizarazo, the claims that those who don’t vote won’t receive food bags is “another opposition media show”.Others like the Perez twins say that they’ve already lost benefits as non-cardholders and longtime government opponents. While their community doesn’t receive government food handouts, they wouldn’t receive them anyway, they said, because they don’t hold Fatherland Cards. Tatisenlu also stopped receiving regular food tickets because of her anti-government stance, she claimed.A dog rests on the ground in a makeshift camp for Venezuelan migrants at Simon Bolivar square in Boa Vista, Rondonia state, BrazilBut despite their weight loss and need for medicines, they have no plans to turn to government programmes or register for the cards.Instead, like many others, they plan to emigrate as soon as they can gather the funds. By some estimates, a million Venezuelans like them have left the country in the past two years to escape the crisis. Neighbouring Colombia has called the influx of Venezuelan refugees the most serious immigration problem it has ever faced.Eldery Alfonzo, who plans to vote for Mr Bertucci, said he’s considering leaving the country with this two small children to join his wife in Chile, who has already emigrated.“We don’t know if our vote really counts or not, but as least in our conscience we know we tried to do something for the country.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health SecurityPlease review our commenting policyRoyal wedding latest news: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry delay honeymoon to go straight back to workInside the royal wedding evening receptionMeghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding speeches: The most moving lines and best jokesMeghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding dress: Clare Waight Keller of Givenchy designs the royal bridal gown of the yearTube drivers to strike in row over new timetablesUS justice department expands probe into origins of FBI’s Russia investigation after public pressure from Donald Trump Only \u0026#39one per cent\u0026#39 of Japan’s biggest coral reef is in a healthy condition due to climate changeIs it safe to visit Hawaii?Meghan Markle to fight for feminism: New Duchess of Sussex given palace blessing to champion women\u0026#39s rightsRoyal wedding latest news: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry delay honeymoon to go straight back to workBritish mother jailed in Iran for spying now faces fresh \u0026#39spreading propaganda\u0026#39 chargeLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowControversial plan to cull Australia\u0026#39s wild Brumby horses abandonedNottingham Cottage: The Kensington home where Meghan and Harry will live as a married coupleBunnies, badgers, and the bizarre truth behind episode one of A Very English Scandal Almost 200 athletes seek asylum in Australia after Commonwealth GamesGrenfell inquiry to open with victim tributes after venue changed to prevent survivors being traumatised by Tube journeyDozens of dogs stabbed and clubbed to death in Chinese village amid rabies fearsHundreds of patients lose battle over allegedly \u0026#39defective\u0026#39 hip implantsMike Pompeo to demand EU pressure on Iran as he reveals ‘Plan B’ nuclear dealSpecial report: Why Ireland\u0026#39s abortion referendum is a matter of life and death for both sidesSafaa Odah: The perils of being a viral Palestinian cartoonist in GazaRoyal protocol goes out the window as celebrity guests reveal wedding secretsMeghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding speeches: The most moving lines and best jokesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis erupting kilauea volcano pictures","story":"Hawaii\u0027s Kilauea volcano spewed ash nearly six miles into the sky on Thursday and scientists predicted that hotter, fresher magma from Kilauea\u0027s summit would run underground and emerge some 25 miles east in the lower Puna district.

yourself through the eyes of others. But, like eavesdropping, it can also be dangerous. For you may discover, sadly, that you have been totally misunderstood. And when you do find out, that can be infuriating. “No,” you want to interrupt, “you’ve got totally the wrong end of the stick.”So it has proved with the wedding of – as they then were – Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. To us, on this side of the Atlantic, their marriage was a flawless demonstration of the very best of Britain, an effortless combination of ritual and relevance a twinning of an institutional genius of monarchy honed over a millenium and...To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeView all subscription options\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp|LoginRoyal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarklePrince Harry and Meghan MarkleDuchess of SussexDuke of SussexRoyal wedding latest news: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry delay honeymoon to go straight back to workInside the royal wedding evening receptionMeghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding speeches: The most moving lines and best jokesMeghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding dress: Clare Waight Keller of Givenchy designs the royal bridal gown of the yearTube drivers to strike in row over new timetablesUS justice department expands probe into origins of FBI’s Russia investigation after public pressure from Donald Trump Only \u0026#39one per cent\u0026#39 of Japan’s biggest coral reef is in a healthy condition due to climate changeIs it safe to visit Hawaii?Meghan Markle to fight for feminism: New Duchess of Sussex given palace blessing to champion women\u0026#39s rightsRoyal wedding latest news: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry delay honeymoon to go straight back to workBritish mother jailed in Iran for spying now faces fresh \u0026#39spreading propaganda\u0026#39 chargeLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowControversial plan to cull Australia\u0026#39s wild Brumby horses abandonedNottingham Cottage: The Kensington home where Meghan and Harry will live as a married coupleBunnies, badgers, and the bizarre truth behind episode one of A Very English Scandal Almost 200 athletes seek asylum in Australia after Commonwealth GamesGrenfell inquiry to open with victim tributes after venue changed to prevent survivors being traumatised by Tube journeyDozens of dogs stabbed and clubbed to death in Chinese village amid rabies fearsHundreds of patients lose battle over allegedly \u0026#39defective\u0026#39 hip implantsMike Pompeo to demand EU pressure on Iran as he reveals ‘Plan B’ nuclear dealSpecial report: Why Ireland\u0026#39s abortion referendum is a matter of life and death for both sidesSafaa Odah: The perils of being a viral Palestinian cartoonist in GazaRoyal protocol goes out the window as celebrity guests reveal wedding secretsMeghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding speeches: The most moving lines and best jokesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/21/TELEMMGLPICT000159931980_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqO2wBkCq2Mm4bNdLs0EhrYyQynkOUP7jc1iwm7BKtzoM.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"almost 200 athletes seek asylum australia commonwealth games","story":"The Men\u0026#39s 100 metres final of the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games. More athletes have claimed asylum than at the London 2012 OlypmicsAuthorities in Australia revealed that almost 200 athletes and officials who visited for the Commonwealth Games have sought asylum— a sharp increase from numbers at other recent events.Since the games in the Gold Coast ended last month, there have been various sightings and reports of missing athletes around the country, mostly involving competitors from African countries such as Rwanda, Uganda, Sierra Leone and Cameroon.Australia issued 13,600 visas to athletes and team officials for the event. Immigration authorities told a parliament committee that 8,103 people arrived on the visas but only 7,848 have since left. Of the 255 who appear to have remained in the country, 205 are on temporary bridging visas after applying for other visas. Malisa Golightly, from the department of home affairs, said about 190 of these people had already applied for asylum. “My understanding is that anybody who is onshore can apply for protection legally once they are here but then of course they are considered against the criteria for that visa,” she said.They will be assessed according to the standard criteria… We will give them priority as far as we can.The number of asylum seekers at this Commonwealth Games appears to be much greater than other similar events. A year after the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, the Home Office said 21 athletes or officials applied for or were granted political asylum and another 39 were unaccounted for, noting this “does not mean that they did not leave”.Following the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, 45 people overstayed their visas or claimed asylum. And, following the London Olympics in 2012, in which some 70,000 visas were issued, 54 athletes and officials were granted political asylum.Last week, Peter Dutton, the home affairs minister, said generally about half a per cent of those who attend major events in Australia tend to overstay their visas.But the amount following this year’s Commonwealth Games came to about 3 per cent.Refugee advocates said many of those who sought asylum were from African countries and were homosexuals who feared persecution at home.Please review our commenting policyRoyal wedding latest news: Meghan

How appropriate then that the new Duchess of Sussex’s Givenchy Haute Couture and Stella McCartney wedding gowns should encapsulate this look so elegantly.... Meghan Markle’s wedding looks will not only become a go-to bridal trend reference for years to come, but will influence many other brides to veer away from glitz and look instead to sophisticated simplicity.The pristinely plain, silk cady material and architectural silhouette of Clare Waight Keller’s design was painstakingly constructed in one of the world’s finest ateliers, so the exact look will be impossible to achieve.

But I think particularly when it all comes together, I think, is tremendous. She was absolutely radiant.Asked if there was any tears from the bride, she said: No, she was incredibly composed. It was really quite extraordinary. She\u0027s just the most beautiful person.Asked what the Duchess\u0027s mother, Doria Ragland, had thought of her daughter, Ms Waight Keller said: As she went into her car, her mother was already sitting in the car and you just could see there was so much love between them.The Queen was later seen being driven back to Windsor Castle soon after the service at the Royal Chapel of All Saints in Windsor Great Park.As a few Windsor Farm shop regulars watched, her Range Rover swept into a side entrance onto the castle estate.The Queen is driven into Windsor Castle after a Sunday trip to churchThere has still been no sight yet today of the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex who are expected to leave Windsor Castle, where they stayed overnight.

The couple spent their honeymoon at Broadlands House in Hampshire – although that would be no guarantee of favourable weather. Kensington Palace said the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex will continue to live in Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of the palace, but they are also reported to be moving to a bigger apartment.They have been been living in the cottage since their engagement in November 2017.Reportedly referred to as Notts Cotts, the property - only yards from the Duke\u0027s childhood home within Kensington Palace itself, has been a base for both the Duke and his brother, Prince William, over the past decade.  As the previous occupants, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge spent two and a half years at the cottage after their royal wedding in 2011, before moving to a permanent apartment inside Kensington Palace to accommodate their growing family. Harry moved into Nottingham Cottage shortly after. An aerial view of Kensington PalaceIt is the smallest of Kensington Palace\u0027s multiple residences, residing in a part of the grounds that once housed important members of staff. There are two rooms and a private garden. In the long term, the Duke and Duchess are expected to vacate Nottingham Cottage for a 21-room Kensington Palace apartment, adjacent to that of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.The apartment\u0027s roof and windows have recently been refurbished, while the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester moved out of it last November - giving legs to rumours the newlyweds will move there.As neighbours, the royal brothers could inhabit what was once a single suite of apartments at Kensington Palace, before it was split in two in the 1950s. The apartments are even suspected to share a secret door.The royal brothers will remain as neighbours at Kensington PalaceInitially however, the new Duke will have a cousin for a neighbour: Princess Eugenie and her fiancé Jack Brooksbank recently took-up residence at Ivy Cottage after announcing their engagement in January this year.That wedding will also take place at St George\u0027s Chapel, in Windsor, on October 12.Among the 200 guests invited to the evening reception at Frogmore House were senior members of the Royal family. The Duke of York was pictured driving his daughters to the event, as was Prince Edward.

He writes: The Corporation’s anchors were Kirsty Young (a reassuring voice as ever) and Dermot O’Leary (was he on the wrong channel?). This unlikely pair tag-teamed with Huw Edwards (solid, dependable, a bit boring), who appeared to have been on a pre-wedding diet.

Speeches, including from Meghan herself, were also expected at the evening reception where the couple were to take their first dance.Leaving for the evening reception earlier in the evening Prince Harry proved he was the perfect gentleman as he opened the door of a vintage car to let his bride step in.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex in a classic E-Type Jaguar heading off to their wedding receptionMs Markle wore a sleek Stella McCartney dress with a halter neck, showing off her shoulders and back with her hair up in a chic bun.The dress was described as a “bespoke lily white high neck gown made of silk crepe”, with satin shoes from Aquazurra with soles painted in baby blue: her “something blue”.Her hair had been styled by George Northwood especially for the more relaxed evening. The couple travelled from Windsor Castle to Frogmore House in a silver blue Jaguar E-Type Concept Zero. The number plate was E19 05 18, marking their wedding date. This vehicle was originally manufactured in 1968, and has since been converted to electric power, suiting the couple’s eco-credentials.Prince Harry opens the door to the Jaguar allowing his wife to get into the passenger seatPrince Harry appears to have given his bride a poignant wedding day gift -

But he soon could face a far bigger test – maintaining his grip on a country that is fast becoming a failed state.Since Maduro took over from Hugo Chavez – his mentor, who died in 2013 – Venezuela’s crisis has steadily intensified as a result of lower oil prices, corruption and a socialist system plagued with mismanagement. But as Maduro has sought to further consolidate power in the past 12 months, the economy, public services, security and health care have all but collapsed. Armed gangs and Colombian guerrilla groups are operating unchecked on Venezuela’s borders. Pro-government militias are terrorising urban areas, while police stand accused of extrajudicial killings. Four of the 10 most dangerous cities in the world are now in Venezuela, according to a 2017 study by the Igarape Institute, a Brazilian think tank that studies violence.Venezuela halts air and sea traffic with three neighbouring countriesHundreds if not thousands of members of the armed forces are deserting, in part due to meagre rations, according to military analysts.Power and water grids and the transportation systems are breaking down. In just the first three months of the year, Venezuela suffered over 7,000 blackouts.Saddled with a soaring inflation rate that has put food out of reach, weakened and thin Venezuelans are falling ill. Doctors say cases of diseases once thought largely eradicated – malaria, diphtheria, measles and tuberculosis – are not only resurfacing but surging. A child stands in front of water containers in Guarenas, VenezuelaIn a nation that lives off oil, production is collapsing as plants break down and the bankrupt government cannot fix equipment. Venezuela’s unpaid creditors are beginning to tighten the financial noose, moving to attach the country’s offshore assets. At the state oil giant, 25,000 workers – more than a quarter of its staff – quit last year in a mass exodus. Fleeing workers are joining a flood of humanity, at least 5,000 people a day, exiting the country. The outflow has left schools without teachers, hospitals without doctors and nurses, and utilities without electricians and engineers. “A failed state is one that cannot meet the most basic functions of government,” says Jean Paul Leidenz, an economist at Ecoanalitica, a Caracas-based analytical firm. Leidenz continues: “Venezuela now certainly has that characteristic.” Buses have become scarce along a Guarenas roadDuring a campaign stop in the eastern Guayana City on Wednesday, Maduro conceded his government “had made mistakes”. But he blamed the country’s crisis mostly on outside forces and domestic enemies and proclaimed the nation’s socialist revolution would see Venezuela through to better days.“Thanks to the social system created by the revolution, the people are protected and prepared,” he says. “We have a lot more to do, and that’s why we need victory.”In her cement block home in eastern Caracas, Zulay Perez, 63, walked into her kitchen and turned on the tap. “See? Nothing,” she says. “No water. No water at all.”For Venezuelans like Perez – the wife of a factory worker – life was never easy. But in the past, she says, the couple would get running water at least a few days each month. This year, they have had water once – and even then for just a few hours. The shortages have spread in 2018, reaching into middle-class and wealthy neighbourhoods, prompting hundreds of spontaneous, if small, protests.Venezuela\u0027s Maduro bids to be new ‘Christ of the poor’ with help from ‘Hand of God’Venezuela\u0027s Maduro bids to be new ‘Christ of the poor’ with help from ‘Hand of God’Argentina\u0027s football legend Diego Maradona takes part in the closing rally of the electoral campaign of Venezuelan acting President Acting Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro greeting his supporters during his campaign closing act in Cabimas, VenezuelaVenezuela\u0027s opposition leader and presidential candidate Henrique Capriles speaks to supporters during a campaign rally in Caracas Supporters of Henrique Capriles RandonskiSupporters of opposition presidential candidate Henrique Capriles cheer during a campaign rally in Merida, VenezuelaSupporters of  Venezuelan acting President and presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro wear a moustache during his closing campaign rally in CaracasVenezuela\u0027s acting President Nicolas Maduro holds his grandson as he stands with his family on stageSupporters of Venezuelan opposition candidate for  president, Henrique Capriles Radonski, cheer during his campaign closing act in BarquisimetoA portrait of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is held by a supporter of  Venezuelan acting President and presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro during his closing campaign rally in CaracasVenezuela\u0027s acting President Nicolas Maduro greets supporters holding Cuba\u0027s and Venezula\u0027s flags with during his closing campaign rally in Caracas, VenezuelaVenezuela\u0027s opposition candidate, Henrique Capriles, holds a dove as a sign of peace during a campaign rally in BarquisimetoAn Henrique Capriles\u0027 supporter holds a dove besides a photo of the candidate during a campaign rally in BarquisimetoSupporters hold a toddler wearing a Maduro-style mustache at the closing campaign rally for Venezuela\u0027s acting President Nicolas Maduro Supporters of opposition presidential candidate Henrique Capriles cheer for him at his closing campaign rally in BarquisimetoA supporter of Venezuelan opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski attends a campaign rally in CaracasVenezuela\u0027s opposition leader and presidential candidate Henrique Capriles greets supporters during a campaign rally Supporters of Venezuela\u0027s ruling party presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro, one dressed as Fidel Castro and the other as Cuban revolutionary hero Ernesto \u0027Che\u0027 Guevara, stand on a bus before the start of Maduro\u0027s closing campaign rally in Caracas, VenezuelaA sign poking fun of ruling party presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro is seen during an opposition campaign rallyA supporter of Venezuelan opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski shows a poster that reads \u0027my mom wants to be your mother-in-law\u0027The government blames a drought, as well as electricity outages partly attributed to sabotage by opposition activists. But community groups say the cause of the damage is more systematic – a combination of corruption, the flight of specialised workers from the country and the difficulty of buying imported spare parts in a nation were the currency is so worthless that you could wallpaper a building with money notes for less than the cost of paint.In past years, Perez says, water would run frequently enough to fill up the big blue tanks the couple keep in a corner. Now she goes outside, to a gutter where stray dogs defecate, to collect water that she boils and uses for cleaning. For drinking and bathing, her husband carries empty bottles to the home of her sister, who has larger cisterns and has been somewhat more fortunate with service.The road to Caracas – where cargo trucks have become a novel way of travelThe water crisis is one symptom of the failing state around her. Another is the lack of food. Perez’s daughter, a public school teacher, collected back wages last week. The family used the money to buy a rare treat – a dozen eggs. Skyrocketing inflation means they cost 480,000 bolivares – the equivalent of nearly one week of her husband’s salary. Perez, nearly emaciated, has lost 17 pounds in the past year.“I feel hopeless,” she says, adding that she fears the government will ensure a Maduro victory on election day, no matter what voters do. “We want change, but I don’t think we’ll get it.”Inside Caracas University Hospital – one of the capital’s largest – the first thing that hits you is the smell.“We’ve had no water for two weeks, and it just came back today,” says a 29-year-old doctor who guided two journalists through its dim halls. The doctor spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals, since the hospital’s administration is pro-government. “For a while,” she says, “some toilets couldn’t be flushed.” Medical shortages have gripped Venezuelan for several years. But things have markedly worsened over the past few months as water and power have become more intermittent. Three weeks ago, the electricity went out for a whole weekend, with generators able to power only the emergency ward, surgery rooms and the intensive care unit.As Venezuela has rocketed into hyperinflation, drugs and supplies – almost all of them imported – are increasingly unaffordable.Malaria was once rare here. Now the hospital is receiving almost 40 infected patients a day. The worst cases end up in the infectious disease ward, which on the recent visit was loaded with patients suffering from preventable or treatable illnesses that have run amok in a weakened population.Lethargic measles patients filled a room marked “isolation”. There was a round hole in the door from a missing knob, allowing the air inside to easily filter into a hallway. The corridors echoed with the coughs of skeletal HIV patients, some of whom are suffering complications from tuberculosis.A child carries a plastic container on the outskirts of CaracasThere will be fewer and fewer doctors to treat them. “A big part of our newly graduated medical students are leaving the country right away. I’d say 90 percent of them,” says Oscar Noya, a doctor who heads the hospital’s malaria department. On a recent afternoon, Leon Avila, a 54-year-old security guard, was waiting at a bus stop at the bottom of a hill in Guarenas, a slum 18 miles east of Caracas. To reach his home at the top, he would normally travel by public bus.But of the 25 buses that used to ply the route five years ago, all but two are out of commission because of a lack of affordable spare parts. In Venezuela these days, a single tyre can cost 100 times what a bus driver makes in a month. Even the two buses currently running are suffering from breakdowns – so frequent that residents have been forced into a relatively novel type of transit – cargo trucks, whose drivers charge them a fare.Zulay Perez has only had running water once in the past year“Travelling like cargo is now our day-to-day life,” Avila says.In Caracas, 70 per cent of the city’s 18,000 buses are not operating. The rest work only intermittently, says Hugo Ocando, a transportation union leader. Ten to 15 per cent have gone out of order this year alone, he continued. After a midsize cargo truck pulled up to Avila’s bus stop, he piled into the back with a mob of others. “Stop boarding people! We’re getting asphyxiated!”, someone shouted in the back.In moments, more than 30 people were crammed inside, holding on to ropes to keep from falling. Much of the cabin’s interior was dark. There were no windows, with the only light and air funnelling through the open back doors.“It’s like we’re animals,” Avila says. The mainstream opposition is boycotting Sunday’s vote, citing a lack of guarantees of a free and fair election. Maduro’s government has banned some key opposition figures from running, kept others behind bars and prompted at least one to seek asylum at the Chilean Embassy in Caracas. Maduro, 55, will still face two main challengers: Henri Falcon, a former governor, and Javier Bertucci, an evangelical pastor. But despite growing international pressure, including an escalating list of US sanctions, few here believe that Maduro is prepared to lose. The government was widely accused of fraud in an election last year for an all-powerful legislative body. Venezuela blocks opposition candidates from presidential electionVenezuela’s opposition refuses to recognise surprise win for MaduroEvidence of ‘crimes against humanity’ in Venezuela conflict, says UNYet with so many Venezuelans expected to skip the vote, Maduro may genuinely edge out his opponents Sunday. According to the Delphos polling firm, Maduro and Falcon are neck and neck among likely voters, with Maduro at 38 percent compared with Falcon at 37 percent. Bertucci is polling in third, with 20 percent support.Critics say some Venezuelans may vote for Maduro out of fear – of losing state jobs or government-subsidised food baskets. Maduro says they will vote for him out of national pride. “When you ask Donald Trump who’s going to win in Venezuela, even he says, ‘Maduro,’” the Venezuelan leader said at a rally last week. “And why are we going to win? Because we are the fatherland, of history, of dignity.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Applied to the country as a whole, that layer of protection would have covered many thousands of very vulnerable people.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesBrackley Town celebrate after winning The Buildbase FA Trophy Final after they beat Bromley on penalties at Wembley Stadium.Actress, Meghan Markle, reaches Prince Harry at the altar in St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle for their wedding service.Workers from the Covent Garden branch of TGI Fridays on a picket line outside the restaurant as they strike in a dispute over pay.

The ditching of the yellow card scheme comes as the number of sanctions starts to rise again, driven by an explosion in the number of punishments imposed on claimants of universal credit.Mr Sharma said the 2016 trial, in parts of Scotland involved 6,500 claimants – which would mean almost 850 challenged a decision to dock their benefits.However, he wrote: “Given the low proportion of cases in which claimants provided further evidence and the even lower proportion of cases where decision outcomes were changed, we do not consider that the benefits of the approach are sufficient to justify the extra time and cost it adds to the process.”The minister did say he was “exploring the feasibility of an alternative process” to try to reduce the number of people being sanctioned.However, he gave no details, which would “be made available once we have progressed with the design work”.Child poverty up by one million since 2010, study findsAxing mortgage benefits \u0027leaves thousands at risk of homelessness\u0027Food bank use in UK hits highest rate on recordGovernment \u0027falls short\u0027 in response to disability benefit inquiryMr Field added: “What ministers decide on next will be crucial in determining how many of those people will be pushed to the brink of destitution in the years ahead.“Justice demands that measures like these are looked at seriously, with a view to testing them as soon as possible.”One constituent of Mr Field, the MP for Birkenhead, was recently docked benefits for missing an appointment to receive universal credit because he was in an operating theatre at the time.In another similarly alarming case, a man in the Merseyside constituency was sanctioned for missing a job centre appointment while he was in A\u0026ampE.Typically, if conditions are not met, benefits are docked for four weeks, which can mean a loss of £300 for a claimant over the age of 25 - but a sanction can last for three months, or even a year.In a damning report in 2016, the National Audit Office castigated the DWP for failing to monitor people whose benefits had been docked and suggested the system cost more money than it saved.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

US investigators have accused Mr Najib\u0027s associates of stealing and laundering $4.5bn (£3.3) from the fund, some of which allegedly landed in Mr Najib\u0027s bank account and was used to buy a $23m pink diamond necklace for his wife. Ms Rosmah is known for her lavish spending on designer handbags, watches and jewellery when she travels abroad. Mr Najib’s critics have previously accused his wife of financing her expensive shopping habit with public funds.Mr Singh declined to say who the raided apartment belonged to but he confirmed that the search was “conducted in relevance to our 1MDB investigations. Anti-corruption police also carried out simultaneous raids at several other locations, including his former office as prime minister, an official residence and Mr Najib’s own home, where police seized more handbags and clothes following a 20-hour search.  Mr Singh said police were trying to crack open a safe in Mr Najib’s house.  Police search former prime minister Najib Razak\u0027s home in Kuala Lumpur as part of a corruption probe after billions of dollars were siphoned off from a state fund (REUTERSLai Seng Sin)Mr Najib has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer denounced the long search at his home as harassment.The police raid marks an extraordinary turn of events a week after Mr Najib’s coalition was defeated in a general election he was expected to win – putting an end to the coalition\u0027s 60-year rule. After leading an opposition alliance to victory in the 9 May election, the new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad re-opened the investigation into the state fund’s missing money.

The US legislation allows the targeting of Russian state personnel who are deemed to have been involved in Mr Magnitsky’s death.The UK parliament is in the process of passing a version of the Magnitsky Act under which Russian nationals responsible for human rights violations as well as engaging in activities against Britain such as the Salisbury poisoning can be prosecuted.The Foreign Affairs Committee points to the London flotation of EN+ an energy company part owned by VTB, a Russian state-owned bank which has been sanctioned by the US and EU. EN+ was owned by Oleg Deripaska, an oligarch who is close to Mr Putin, who has since stepped down from the board of the company in an attempt to lift American sanctions.The report charts how, just days after the UK expelled 23 Russian diplomats following the Salisbury attack, the Russian government was able to raise £3bn in Eurobond issuance and the Russian energy multinational Gazprom PJSC made a £500m sale followed by the Russian embassy in London tweeting “business as usual”.The Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill is currently in the final stages of passing through the Commons after going through the Lords. The MPs state: “We welcome the bill’s broad definition of the purpose of sanctions regulations, which will give the government the power to introduce sanctions for a range of reasons...” But the MPs want a register of overseas owners of properties in this country to be brought forward from the proposed date of 2021 and naming and shaming of iniduals “comparable to the US Magnitsky List” to be made public and updated by the Foreign Office.The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeThe committee’s chairperson, Conservative MP Tom Tugdenhat, said: “We must be united in our efforts to match rhetoric with action – in the City, through government policy and among allies in the US, G7 and EU. We call on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to set out a coherent strategy on Russia that clearly links together the diplomatic, military and financial tools that the UK can use to counter Russian state aggression.”The report, however, does not reveal any new information about Russian money and corruption in the UK, drawing instead on existing public material, and statements by journalists, academics and researchers. There is a degree of scepticism about whether Theresa May’s government will rush to investigate and prosecute on this issue near future laws which already exist to do so have not been much used.Successive British governments have actively encouraged rich foreigners to come to this country and a slew of prosecutions, which, to apply the law equitably, would mean targeting of other nationalities as well as Russians is likely to result in money being moved out, capital flight, at a time of economic uncertainty and trepidation following Brexit.Widespread international support for further punitive action is also unlikely. The British government has suspended senior level interaction with Moscow, but other Western states have not.

This is something which should be open to them, after all we keep being told that the UK is a country of laws.”Mr Yakovenko wanted to stress that although the British government had chosen to break off high level liaison, other heads of state have maintained “links which are so essential” in the troubled international political climate.

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The two had been lovers after meeting in 1960 when being gay was banned.Scott, who worked as a model, was said to have had a full blown affair with the politician and even had liaisons in Thorpe’s Commons room.But after they parted, Thorpe was said to have viewed Scott as a dangerous blackmailer intent on revenge - something that could have wrecked his political ambitions.For while homosexuality was legalised in 1967 it was still taboo for people in the public eye.Scott had been lured on to Exmoor by a hitman, who was allegedly a part-time pilot called Andrew Newton who had been hired as part of the plot.He shot the model’s dog before turning the gun on Scott – but it jammed. Effing and jeffing, he sped off.After managing to hail down an approaching car, Scott blurted “Jeremy Thorpe” to the driver.A police investigation lead to a trial in the Old Bailey with the Liberal leader accused of conspiracy to murder along with three other men. But the jury did not feel convinced that Thorpe, a man of hitherto unblemished reputation and a national figure with a very distinguished public record could be capable of the crime. And he was acquitted along with the others.But Scott maintains Thorpe wanted him dead and said he only felt safe when the politician died in 2014.His younger self has been played by actor Ben Wishaw in the new BBC drama starring Hugh Grant called Very English Scandal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004074715332.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle prince harry diverse wedding sun says","story":"With the mix of old and new, tradition and modernity, British reserve and American enthusiasm, todays ceremony may have been the most important, ground-breaking Royal wedding ever.It would have been inconceivable just decades ago for a mixed-race American actress to walk down the aisle, mostly unaccompanied, to join the Royal Family.And who could ever have thought that Meghan’s mother, the dignified Doria Ragland, would stand arm-in-arm with our future king, Prince Charles, atop the West Steps of Windsor Castle?Harry was resplendent in a military uniform he has earned many times over.The talented, independent, headstrong Meghan looked magnificent.In their snatched conversation we saw a couple deeply in love, and we couldn’t be more thrilled for them.It was a day that will live long in the memory — and was a wonderful symbol of the country we have become.Proud of our history.

She could easily have become trapped in the web of regal traditions.But Meghan navigated the intricacies with aplomb to pull off the most contemporary and delightfully multi-cultural royal wedding Britain has ever seen.There was a gospel choir, a bride’s mother with a nose stud and a star-studded guest list that was far more Soho House than Buck House. And of course, the aforementioned preacher Michael Curry.He milked his moment at the pulpit with a relentlessly repetitive call to love that went on . . . and on . . . and on, and clearly tickled some royals so much they looked fit to burst.The younger, modernising royals are now regarded more as celebrities than figureheads and this was a highly public melding of the old and new.After all Meghan, 36, is a divorcee with life experience, not some privileged ingenue straight out of finishing school.In Suits, the US telly series she starred in, her character married in a dress Meghan herself chose and described as “classic and fairytale and the culmination of everything she’s been waiting for”.The same could be said of yesterday’s creation by British designer Clare Waight Keller.In a nod to history, Meghan topped it with Queen Mary’s 1932 diamond bandeau tiara.And her “glam squad” of make-up artists, hairdresser, eyebrow shaper and skin guru worked their magic to accentuate a naturally radiant glow without looking overdone.She walked into the chapel alone, a break with form spun as a “bold, feminist statement” but really borne from sad necessity by her father’s absence.Meghan passed her Suits co-stars and the majority of the other celebrity guests in the Nave — what might be described as the cheap seats. Even Patrick J Adams, who played Suits love interest Mike Ross, was there.Yet curiously, celebrity royalty George and Amal Clooney were placed in the Quire alongside the Royal Family. Go figure.As Meghan reached halfway, she took the arm of her now father-in-law Prince Charles.He was to “accompany” her to the altar, rather than “give away” the woman who, let’s face it, he’s only just getting to know. For Charles the last-minute role was perhaps a godsend, placing him centre stage where the presence of his ever-strong mother might have eclipsed him.Not to mention the ghost of his ex-wife, always painted as the touch-feely parent to his seemingly more remote style.For, although it’s been 20 years since Diana’s death, how could anyone in the same situation not think of their mother and muse and how she would have savoured being there?And how could even the ­hardest of Republican hearts not have felt a small pang of regret she wasn’t?After all, in the middle of it all was the very human story of a young man who stole the nation’s hearts when forced to walk behind his mother’s coffin at the tender age of 12.On his engagement, Harry was asked what Diana would have thought of Meghan. He smiled and said: “They would have been thick as thieves. I think she would have been over the moon — jumping up and down, so excited for me, but then, as I said, she would have probably been best friends with Meghan.”Indeed she would. Diana always took great pains to make sure her sons knew not everyone’s life was as privileged.So she would have adored Harry’s choice of bride for her normality and independence.He could have had his pick of socialites but he chose a normal woman who has grafted and earned everything she has.The downside is that, unlike poshies who are as badly behaved as the rest of us but keep it to themselves, Meghan’s unedited life is ripe for scrutiny.Diana would have understood and done her utmost to support her. In addition, the media-savvy Princess of Wales would have brought Meghan’s father into the fold weeks ago, knowing a mix of estranged family and lack of disposable income is a potentially damaging cocktail.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKBut all that was forgotten yesterday as Meghan’s 61-year-old mother Doria Ragland, a yoga teacher, watched her daughter (who she calls “flower”) from a front-row pew, compellingly regal in her solitude.Meghan is reportedly maternal herself apparent during their engagement interview, throughout which she guides Harry rather than the other way round.In Angela Levin’s book Harry: Conversations with the Prince, she quotes historian Dr David Starkey as saying: “She mothers him a bit, but he needs it and some women like to do it.”Harry says his mother’s death left him in total chaos and Levin feels his “air of vulnerability and sadness” has brought out Meghan’s mothering instinct.Good.

But we have also watched him grow up.He is no longer the pampered prince surrounded by chinless sycophants, who got it horribly wrong at fancy dress parties and Las Vegas swimming pools.He has grown into an Afghan war veteran, a doer of genuinely good works that make a real difference to lives that have been shattered by combat.He has grown into the son that Princess Diana would have been incredibly proud of.Twenty years on from the death of Diana, this country desperately wants Harry’s life to have a happy ending.A wedding — even a royal wedding — is not the same as a marriage, of course. And a day — even a special day like yesterday in Windsor in the blazing sunshine — is not the same as building a successful relationship that endures a lifetime.But the wedding of Prince Harry to Meghan Markle felt like the start of Harry’s happy ever after.Many of us, I suspect, were caught off guard by the raw emotion of the day. Hardened old hacks who have covered their share of royal events do not usually shed a tear among all that pomp and circumstance.But it is 20 years since I watched William and Harry mourn their mother in Westminster Abbey, and I saw them grieve when the cameras were pointed away. And I could not watch this wedding without a lump in my throat. And I suspect there were millions like me.Windsor is not really built to host the wedding of the century. This ancient market town is more used to low-key royal nuptials — Charles marrying Camilla and Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones — and having Meghan and Harry’s wedding in the shadow of that 1,000-year-old castle was like ­throwing the Rio carnival in a telephone booth.But it worked. This was Woodstock for royalists, whatever part of the world they came from.The mood was good-humoured, stoic, polite and it all felt fantastically British. A lot of people brought their dogs.And there were Americans everywhere, like Fulvia Brooks, 52, of Washington DC, visiting the UK for the first time.“As an African-American, and a woman, and an American, this day means a lot to me,” Fulvia told me. “Most of all it means love is real.”Her sister Julietta Simmons, 54, said: “I wanted to be a part of history. And it’s amazing! Wonderful! Yeah!”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKHarry and Meghan have lit a fire under the special relationship. There are 1,000 graduates of Meghan’s old university, Northwestern of Chicago, living in the UK and it felt like most of them had come to Windsor.“She is a smart, powerful, sophisticated woman,” said Ellen Bencard, a Northwestern alumna. “She is going to be able to do so much.”Some things about the crowds were unchanging, such as the presence of servicemen and women, the backbone of these events. But this was noticeably a different crowd from William and Kate’s wedding in 2011.There were more black faces, more brown faces, and more of a sense the entire nation felt included in a way they never did in the past.“She will modernise the Royal Family,” said Val West of Staines, Surrey. “There are millions of us who have been living in mixed-race families for years. The Windsors have joined us in the 21st century.”The last time an American divorcee married into the Royal Family, the British monarchy had a meltdown.This time, it might be the American divorcee who saves them.But you had to wonder if Meghan Markle TRULY understands what she’s getting into. She will be scrutinised like no other woman for the rest of her life.The fact she is 36 and has had a life — Diana was 19 when she wed Charles and died at 36 — will hold her in good stead, as will marrying a man clearly crazy about her.But there will be unimaginable pressure on Meghan to keep smiling, to keep hugging, to make the fairytale come true and — oh yes — produce a baby before she turns 40. So, even on this happiest of days, you had to fear for the bride.Because on Saturday we watched a once-obscure actress cement her place as without ­question the most famous woman on the planet.And you have to worry, just a ­little, about Harry. Like his brother, Harry sometimes seems a tad sulky about the constant, never-ending interest in his life.Behind the charming smiles, the younger royals too frequently seem to lack the stoic sense of duty the Queen has displayed for a lifetime, as though being born into the Royal Family is a heavy burden — when of course it is also a fantastic privilege.And you can’t dream of the quiet life when you just married the Grace Kelly of the 21st Century, a woman who blends regal charisma with Hollywood va-va-voom like nobody else alive. But this was not a day for nagging doubts.This was a day for believing Meghan and Harry will have the happy-ever-after they deserve, that the boy and girl from broken homes will build a home that lasts.The build-up to this special day has been difficult.Arranging your wedding day is never easy when you come from a dysfunctional, divorce-riven family full of bat-crazy relatives — and that’s just Harry!But thoughts of the sad past melted away in the sunshine. In 1947 Churchill called the Queen’s wedding “a flash of colour on the hard road we travel”.Windsor on Saturday made you believe we have not changed as much as we may have feared. The last was George V when he married Princess Victoria Mary of Teck at St James’s Palace in 1893.Harry had to get special permission from the Queen to keep his facial hair.As he is no longer a serving officer, Her Majesty had to give the OK for him to wear his military uniform.Since it is customary to be clean-shaven when in uniform, it is believed that her permission also covered Harry’s facial fuzz.Historian Hugo Vickers said: “Theoretically the Army don’t like it.”Along with brother Wills, Harry was in the frock coat uniform of the Household Cavalry’s Blues and Royals.They were hand-tailored by royal outfitters Dege and Skinner, of Savile Row in central London.A Royal Crown on his shoulder indicated Harry has been promoted to Major since leaving the Army as a Captain in 2015.He would have had the honour bestowed on him by The Queen, who can promote members of the Royal Family in line with their peers because they hold military appointments.On his left chest Harry displayed his Pilots’ Wings, awarded when he served with the Army Air Corps as an Apache helicopter pilot.His medal ribbons were the Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order Afghanistan with rosette The Queen’s Golden Jubilee and Diamond Jubilee. These were our people on the streets of Windsor. Men like Ray Brown, dressed as Uncle Sam — his friend Janet Butterfield was in a Union Jack dress — who had travelled all night from Yorkshire to cheer on the Long Walk.And Grace Gothard, from London out of Ghana, who wore a homemade dress she wore to Kate and William’s wedding.And you had to admire their patriotism, their good-natured humour, the quiet fortitude it took to be on those streets for hours.And this is our country, you realised, the real country that exists beyond the soft, sneering elite in Westminster. These decent, patriotic, polite people who are so often ignored are the best of us.We are often told this country is bitterly and permanently divided.But on Saturday in the spring sunshine of Windsor, it felt like those cheering crowds held up a mirror to the nation’s soul. And we did not seem divided at all.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So is her mother.Honestly, they are touched beyond belief. It was important to her to make a point of thanking him publicly, although, of course, he knows privately how she feels.Another source told the newspaper: It is often said that he always wanted a daughter and I think he has been really moved by how well they have got on.There is definitely a connection there. Meghans mother means more to her than anything, so it was lovely to see the way he was so welcoming to Doria too.Charles is said to have spent a lot of time with his son and Meghan choosing the music to be played at their service.The Royal Wedding has been dogged by Meghans family speaking out against her.She has faced criticism from her half-sister Samantha Markle, who claimed their dad Thomas was alone and upset in hospital following his surgery for a dangerous heart condition.And she also slammed claims Kensington Palace was helping him - revealing she had to wire him cash to survive.Meghans brother Thomas Markle Jr has also hit out at the former actress - telling Prince Harry not to marry her.He wrote an explosive open letter telling Meghan to call off the upcoming nuptials, blasting it as a fake fairy tale.But he has now backtracked on his scathing comments - branding it a moment of madness.Meghan and Harry married on Saturday in front of a celeb-filled congregation at St Georges Chapel in Windsor.The ceremony was a modern affair - with the couple hailed for their multicultural ceremony. Their nuptials featured a rip-roaring sermon from an American preacher and a moving rendition of Stand By Me by a black gospel choir.The loved-up pair gazed at each other during the ceremony, with Meghan wowing in her spectacular gown by designer Clare Waight Keller of Givenchy.She teamed it with a dazzling Mary Diamond Bandeau tiara – lent to her by the Queen.Meghan expressed the wish of having all 53 countries of the Commonwealth with her on her journey through the ceremony.Harry greeted his beautiful bride at the altar and told her: “You look amazing.”Meghan was walked down the aisle by Prince Charles — standing in for her absent father Thomas.Harry, 33, who had nervously fiddled with his cuffs while waiting, turned to Charles and said: “Thank you, Pa.”They followed the ceremony with the evening reception in a £300,000 glass marquee in the grounds of Windsor Castle paid for by Prince Charles.Harrys dad left guests in stitches with a speech about changing his nappy, while the groom delighted everyone when he referred to Meghan as his wife.Jubilant guests were later treated to an incredible firework display that could be seen for miles around Windsor as the Royal Wedding was brought to a close."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403242458.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"some tories are preparing for a snap election this autumn amid brexit tensions","story":"Some politicians think that a series of defeats in the Commons could infuriate hard-line Brexiteers into triggering a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister.Sources said that there was no Brexit compromise that would be acceptable for both Leavers and Remainers, and speculated that they would trigger a leadership battle and possibly another election.One MP told the Sunday Times that they were already getting leaflets ready, and speculated that the poll could come as early as the autumn.They said: The numbers are against us and if we face repeated defeats when the withdrawal bill returns to the Commons, the only alternative will be to kick over the table and trigger a vote of no confidence in the prime minister, which will likely lead to another general election.But other MPs were quick to pour cold water on the plans, and said the reports were just a ploy to try and pressure the Prime Minister over Brexit.One MP told the Sun the reports were nonsense and disgruntled MPs were trying to blackmail the PM again.And another added: They are not united on this. The Prime Minister would trounce any challenge.We are four points ahead of Labour and the PM is miles ahead of Corbyn.And another said: I doubt the PM would lose a vote of confidence.Many MPs think a fresh leadership battle could risk a less popular leader replacing Theresa May, and even throw up the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn getting into Downing Street -

even though the couple are funding it themselves.She called on them to stump up the bill for the extensive policing operation too. She stormed: “I remember Diana, the Princess of Wales taking her young sons out at night to see the street-sleepers.“This week we have had stories of Windsor’s street cleaners cleaning the street homeless, who had their possessions compounded, while keen monarchists sleep out in their clothes so they can cheer on the Royal parade.“I can’t believe she would have remained silent on £30m spent on security for a Royal carriage ride around Windsor while street homeless are so cruelly displaced.”And pointing out that Kensington is the joint poorest ward in London and that their health is getting worse, she added: “what does her youngest son think of that?”The Kensington MP, whose constituency covers Grenfell tower, accused the Royals of not doing enough to help those affected by the tragic blaze which killed 71 people last summer.Ms Dent Coat said it was a “lovely idea” to use the hundreds of rooms in Royal palaces to house the homeless.It is estimated that the Royals help Britain take in £500m every year in tourism revenues from their estates and buildings.And they spend their time helping dozens of deserving charities, including Help for Heroes, organising the Invictus Games and promoting mental health campaign Heads Together.Ms Dent Coad sparked uproar last September for pouring scorn on Prince Harry’s military record – saying “Harry can’t actually fly a helicopter”.Speaking at a fringe event at Labour Party conference, she said: “He tried to pass the helicopter exam about four times and he couldn’t get through it all – so he always goes for the co-pilot.

Well, Harry’s acted.They all talked about modernising the Royal Family. Harry has actually done it with a bride and a wedding service like no other.“Love,” Bishop Curry told us in his extraordinary sermon — which spoke in accents unheard of in polite English churches — “love can change this world.”It’s sure changed the Royal Family. Ms Markle, it is worth repeating, is mixed-race, American, of uncertain religion, an actress, divorced and with a sexual history.In the past any one of these would have rendered her deeply doubtful as a royal bride and the combination would have ruled her out entirely. But the times they are a’changing.The stigma of divorce was still powerful as late as the 1990s, which is why it took so long to dissolve the disastrous marriage of Harry’s parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana.But their divorce, and Charles’s subsequent remarriage to Camilla, acted as a sort of earthquake which brought all the remaining conventions of royal marriages — virginal brides, nice English girls, no divorce — tumbling down.Which, in a nutshell, is how the Royal Family came to get Meghan.But why did Meghan want to become royal? The short answer is that she wanted Harry. But so did lots of other women, who all baulked at the prospect of becoming royal.Not Meghan. Indeed, she seems to have embraced it as passionately as Harry himself.As an actress, of course she wasn’t fazed by the publicity that had so put off Harry’s earlier girlfriends. But there’s more to it than that.At university she took a double major in theatre and international studies — which was her real love.She became an intern in the American embassy in Argentina. She took the exam to enter the US State Department, which is the equivalent of our Foreign Office.It was only when she failed the notoriously difficult test that she turned to acting.Moreover, the moment she enjoyed success and fame with Suits, she used it to leverage her entry on to the international stage as “Global Ambassador” for World Vision Canada, among many other good causes.In other words, acting was not her vocation. It was only a means to an end.And that end is much better served by her marrying Harry, becoming royal and using her fame — and his — to serve the issues, particularly women’s issues, she is so keen on.So you could say that Harry — the eternal boy-man — is marrying his mother, since Diana used her fame too.But Diana did it in opposition to her estranged husband. Meghan aims to do it in partnership with Harry and at the very heart of the Royal Family.And she’s proving astonishingly adept — is it those actressy skills again? — at winning over the British establishment.Back in the 1930s, the Archbishop of Canterbury was the deadly foe of Wallis Simpson, King Edward VIII’s divorced American bride, and led to his abdication.Today, Archbishop Justin Welby is Meghan’s best friend. Indeed, he’s practically three in a bed with the couple.There’s chemistry, of course. But there’s also calculation on both sides.Welby wants to use Meghan, who as an American does religion as well as touchy-feely, to spearhead a religious revival among the young.The Royal Family also want to buy into her as an international brand.Which is why the Queen appointed Harry Commonwealth Youth Ambassador.Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKKeeping the Commonwealth going in the face of the overwhelming indifference of British politicians of all parties has been the greatest personal achievement of the Queen’s long reign.And she capped it by ruthlessly stage-managing Charles’s acclamation as her successor as Head of the Commonwealth at the most recent Commonwealth Conference.That was the constitutional bit sorted out.Harry’s appointment addresses the equally important question of PR.Meghan and Harry are the model modern couple: Mature (well, she is), bi-racial,bi-cultural, international, do-gooding, fashion-conscious and media-savvy to their fingertips.They are the perfect face of a modern monarchy at home and ideal Global Ambassadors for Brand Windsor abroad.And, come to think of it — which I’m sure the Queen and her advisers have done — they are the perfect Global Ambassadors for post-Brexit Brand Britain as well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It showed this country is world class.The sub-plot, of course, was the emotional union between the damaged children of two broken families.Fans have long yearned for Prince Harry to find happiness after the roller-coaster life and shocking death of his fabled mother, Princess Diana.They have warmed to a young man who transformed himself from a mixed-up kid to a likeable soldier, helicopter pilot and champion of war-damaged Invictus casualties.As for his bride, Meghan Markle is the glamorous star of hit TV series Suits, who dreamed as a child of becoming a princess.Best of all in this age of right-on political correctness, she is the daughter of a charming African-American mother and an Emmy-winning Hollywood lighting specialist.The House of Windsor is now truly multicultural.It is also hip.Our amazing sovereign, at 92, and doughty Prince Philip, 96, both heading for their royal telegrams, are the Queen and King of Cool.Where else in the world would you see an Elton John double act with Windy City preacher Bishop Michael Curry?This was a truly uplifting occasion, worn lightly by a once-stuffy Royal Family.Nobody does it better when it comes to choreographing mounted cavalry, trumpets, banners and horse-drawn carriages with an electric-powered E-Type and a vintage Rolls-Royce.All underscored by a sense of humour, as Harry and his supportive brother William exchanged banter at the altar of Windsor’s historic St George’s Chapel.Even the weather turned out in tribute, bathing Windsor Great Park’s glorious greenery in spring sunshine.There may have been some muffled coughs over Markle family squabbles but they were nothing compared with the torrid dramas leading to the Queen’s own “annus horribilis”.The world has become used to British pageantry.But this Royal Wedding was a timely reminder that Britain is not just a small island with a fading history on the edge of Europe.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex ride in a carriage down The Long Walk back towards Windsor Castle after getting married in St Georges Chapel, WindsorThe 21st-century United Kingdom is an unrivalled brand on the global stage.The world was witnessing more than mere pomp and circumstance.This was UK plc on international parade, joining hands with the global community in a way no other nation can match — even the mighty USA.Had Meghan married into the family of a French or American president, a German Chancellor or a Kremlin tsar, would anyone have tuned in?Neither China nor Russia could captivate so many friendly eyeballs.The Olympics might do it.But London 2012 revealed Britain is best on these occasions, too.On Saturday, Britain proved it is capable of reaching out to a world beyond borders.Harry and Meghan’s marriage bonded the UK indelibly with the US.If the new Duke and Duchess have kids, they will be American citizens — as well as British due to Harry’s lineage — and will eventually be liable to American tax.Importantly, this wedding had special significance for the 2.5billion citizens of 52 Commonwealth countries, especially in Africa and the Caribbean, who swear allegiance to the Queen.My Australian in-laws were constantly on the phone from Sydney this weekend, all thoughts of becoming a republic abandoned, to discuss the finer points of royal protocol.But this event was watched from lands with no current ties to Britain — South America, the Far East and the Gulf States.It was a showcase of modern Britain forever adapting to change, the key to our success as an outward-looking nation.There was a clear hint of defiance, too. This steely couple were doing it their way.Our Brexit negotiators — on both sides of the argument — should take note.That big wide world, viewing us in high definition on Saturday, is where Britain’s future lies.These are our markets.The audience liked what they saw and they want some of what we’re having.In marketing terms alone, it was priceless.Too often we underestimate our strength and standing.We have developed an absurd inferiority complex.We’ve been led to believe we are too weak and puny to stand alone on the global stage.Yet we are among the world’s greatest economies, second only to Germany in the EU.We are a nuclear power with a real professional army which has helped keep the peace in Europe, and have an envied place on the UN Security Council.Republican lefties despise all this stuff.They smear Britain’s record as a brutal colonial power while ignoring our global lead in abolishing slavery.Disturbingly, some Conservatives seem to agree the UK is washed up and past its prime.Since we cannot run our own economy, they say, we should hand the job to unelected bureaucrats in Brussels.These, remember, would be the same Brussels flunkies who created the euro, wrecked the economies of member states and put millions of unemployed young people on the scrap heap.Most of those workless youngsters gratefully upped sticks and moved here.I wonder why?Saturday’s Royal Wedding showed we are in the Premier League.Now the world is watching, perhaps with slightly less enthusiasm, as another British saga lurches towards its climax — another broken family consumed with jealousy and bent on revenge.The cast is familiar — the statutory drunk, a bully who prefers to talk with a gun in his hand, some characters who would prefer a car crash to a happy ending.Can we stop the bickering and reach a good Brexit deal?Why can’t the Leavers and Remainers put the country first, join hands, bury their differences and take a vow to work together to serve the national interest?Inspired by the Royal Wedding, by the poem Invictus, we can rise above petty differences.“We are the masters of our fate: We are the captains of our soul.”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Oh well.Most married couples leave it 18 months before they reach that arrangement.But on that bombshell it was on with the Royal Wedding, which normally divides the nation into two distinct camps.There are the royalists, who have great fun watching all the pomp and pageantry on television.And the republicans, who have great fun hating all the pomp and pageantry on television.So the only real choice to be made, for all of us, is: Which channel?Personally, six hours of a photobombing Kay Burley giving it the full Partridge on Sky News was a punishment that’s way beyond me, as was five hours of the E! channel gang ­yelling: “Oh my God. Wow!”ITV was never going to be anything less than thoroughly professional in the hands of Julie Etchingham and Phillip Schofield, once he shut up about Holly Willoughby, so I went with the Beeb, where Naga called it a night shortly after announcing Prince Harry was now: “The Duke of Essex.”Oi! Oi! “Sussex rather.” Oh. Pity.The real surprise for some of you, though, might have been discovering that to give it an informal vibe, ­alongside Kirsty Young, BBC1’s 9am-and-beyond coverage was now being fronted by the strangely contorted ­figure of Dermot O’Leary — the former host of ITV’s The Marriage Ref.A show that may have been the ­perfect rehearsal for most royal ­weddings, but probably not this one.They weren’t alone, obviously.The Beeb had the joint surrounded, in fact, by among others Huw Edwards, ­fashion expert Jo Elvin, who was “across the dress” (as clueless as the rest of us), Alex Jones, Ore Oduba and Anita Rani, who performed the ­essential task of repeating what the other person had just said.Ore: “First glimpse of the dress, it’s going to be a moment.”Anita: “It’s going to be a moment.” Traditionally, of course, on these great state occasions, the moment TV crews start interviewing other TV crews is the cue for the coverage to descend into flannel, repetition, idle speculation, cliche (“Excitement’s ­building”), imponderable questions and outright stupidity.On Saturday, by slight contrast, the trigger was actually the arrival of Oprah Winfrey and the first trickle of celebrity guests, who had a clearly ­nervous ­Dermot asking: “When the invite says ‘hats’, does that mean hats are an absolute given?”“Absolutely, it does,” said Kirsty, slapping him down testily.It got progressively worse with each arrival as well.So by the time Amal Clooney wafted in alongside husband George, who was dressed as one of Modern Romance, even basic motor tasks seemed beyond some of the BBC team.Kirsty: “It can be difficult to wear a hat, can’t it?”Jo: “I think so, yes.”In fairness, it should also be stated this idiocy was certainly not restricted to the BBC.I switched over to ITV during the ­arrivals and heard Meghan’s old drama teacher, Gigi Perreau, say: “This is incredible and we’re right there. Well, we’re here but we’re also there, so it’s fabulous.”It’s just the nature of the beast.With so much time to fill, everyone will say these things.Only the BBC, though, could possibly leave me feeling queasy with the choice of one of its Royal Wedding experts.This was left-wing “social commentator” Afua Hirsch, who was privately educated and has led a life of unimaginable advantage, compared to most of us, but is also a professional victim who thinks pretty much ­everything is “racist”, wants Nelson’s Column torn down and wasn’t about to drop her agenda with such a large audience at her mercy.“While I have felt alienated by the inherited privilege,” said Afua, who’s enjoyed more than most, “my own struggles with identity have made me appreciate the need for cultural ­continuity.“So while I didn’t relate to the Royal Family, I did relate to that need for a sense of tradition.”Quite a brass neck, isn’t it, speaking out against the whole concept of the Royal Family, while simultaneously using them to increase your TV profile, as Afua had been doing all week.Instead of telling her so, or pointing out Harry’s ex Chelsy Davy had arrived while she was guffing away, a nodding Dermot said he could listen to Afua “all day”.A claim I doubt, frankly.Indeed, I reckon he’d have been throwing himself off Windsor Castle’s ramparts before breakfast if he’d tried.No one else, I suspect though, was listening to a single word she said.Nor will they have needed Afua’s lofty approval to enjoy a day filled with so many memorable events, including Bishop Michael Curry’s fiery address to the congregation, the ­reappearance of the Duke of Edinburgh and Meghan’s Rolls-Royce ­hurtling up the Long Walk past 100,000 Union Flags like it was being driven by Richard Hammond.These are all magical moments you’ll possibly want to watch again — and if you do, having sat through both start to finish, I’d probably recommend the ITV version.It had the better ­historic detail, was never in any danger of missing Chelsy Davy’s arrival and rounded everything off nicely as well.Over on the BBC, meanwhile, Kirsty did it by searching for profundities and going where angels feared to tread.“Something has travelled between Harry and Meghan that might be the next page of the story, where they give us a gorgeous little product of their union which we might enjoy too . . . ?”Though not if Naga’s honeymoon arrangements are to be believed, they won’t.Obviously.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a day of history.And as the couple kissed on the steps of St George’s Chapel, Windsor, it felt like a new beginning.Here, we celebrate the day in words and pictures.It will always be remembered as the day worlds collided – and changed the course of the monarchy for ever.In St George’s Chapel, Windsor, surrounded by the long-buried kings and queens of England, British ceremony and American soul were put centre stage, blending centuries- old tradition and a forward-looking future.But for all the spectacle, for all the significance of a blue-blooded prince marrying a mixed-race divorcee, it boiled down to a lovestruck young couple who couldn’t keep their eyes off each other, who pledged themselves to each other like they just couldn’t believe their luck.As fiery Episcopal preacher Michael Curry later said in his soaring sermon on the power of love: “Two young people fell in love and we all showed up.”And didn’t we just.Across the country, in homes and pubs and parks, huddled around TVs or crowded in front of big screens, the British gathered to do what we do best.Armed with bottles of prosecco and supermarket sausage rolls, patriots prepared to swell with pride while cynics expected to laugh at those silly posh people and their stuffy old manners.In the event, of course, one and all were blindsided with emotion as a lovely young couple publicly declared their love.In Windsor the well-wishers stood 20 deep. They hoped to glimpse that cheeky prince who had lost his mum and lost his way, but who had grown into a fine young man — and had now found his soulmate.Bigwigs at the local tourist board must have been rubbing their hands in glee as pictures of the Berkshire town, looking resplendent in the dazzling May sunshine, were beamed around the world to a TV audience of 1.9billion.In fact, it was the kind of morning that couples who plan to marry in England — in the springtime — don’t dare to dream of.Perhaps Meghan is too American to have made the much-voiced wish of all British brides: “I don’t mind if it’s not sunny as long as it’s dry.”But if she did, her wish was more than granted.It must have been a relief to the VIP guests — and the handpicked normos who Meghan and Harry had invited to stand in the chapel grounds — that the weather had decided to put on its wedding best.It meant there were no umbrellas to ruin a fashion parade which would give the Oscars and the Met Ball a run for their money.The great, the good and the downright unexpected from the worlds of showbiz and sport joined bonafide aristocrats on the walk to the chapel, which was only missing a red carpet.Who on earth would have expected Chloe Madeley — daughter of Richard and Judy, and who insists she and rugby-player fiance James Haskell have sex every single day — to wangle an invite to a royal wedding?But there she was, alongside America’s very own version of the queen — Oprah Winfrey — as well as Idris Elba, Carey Mulligan and Marcus Mumford, James Blunt and the assorted cast of Suits.The male guests wore new suits, new shoes, new shirts, new ties. One, Mike Tindall, even had a new nose.The women had put as much thought into their hats as their outfits, and there were plenty of creations that you’d not have been happy to sit behind in the chapel for fear of them blocking your view.Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie turned up in disappointingly subdued hats — determinedly sidestepping a repeat of the furore over the outlandish designs they wore to William and Kate’s 2011 nuptials.Instead, Eugenie looked like a Fifties air hostess, while Beatrice channelled a Tudor peasant.Chelsy Davy, who dated Harry on-off for seven years, wore the kind of facial expression you would expect of any woman about to endure the wedding of her ex.At least she had moral support from another of Harry’s former flames, Cressida Bonas, and the two girls apparently arrived together.Britain’s alternative royal couple — the Beckhams — were naturally in attendance, with Posh accessorising her funereal navy shift dress with the sort of scowl that only someone who hasn’t eaten a carb since 2001 can really pull off.To Victoria’s undoubted dismay, she and David were upstaged by one of the few celebrity couples who can eclipse the Beckham star power – George Clooney and wife Amal, who was resplendent in mustard yellow Stella McCartney.While the likes of Jonny Wilkinson, Tom Hardy and even Sir Elton John had to sit behind the rood screen in the nave — which could be cruelly deemed the “cheap seats” — Amal and George were ushered into pole position in the quire, alongside the Royal Family.Was this Meghan, previously a relatively obscure star of a middling cable drama, pulling off the ultimate power move to cement her new status on the Hollywood A-List?As the guests took their seats — some more quickly than others, with Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson working the room like Tom Cruise — Meghan was preparing for the most nerve-racking drive of her life.Nine miles away at sumptuous Cliveden House, she was folding herself into the Queen’s 1950 Rolls-Royce Phantom IV, alongside her mum, Doria Ragland.When she was a youngster voraciously devouring Andrew Morton’s book on Princess Diana, or posing on the railings outside Buckingham Palace aged 15, could Meghan ever, even in her wildest moments, have imagined it might lead to this?When she was toiling to get a foot in the door in the acting profession, constantly boxed in by her so-called “ethnically ambiguous identity” — could she have dreamed that one day she’d be one of the most famous women in the world?Who knows what went through her head on the 26-minute drive to the chapel, and who knows what she may have said to her mum, who had raised her alone and who was at her side as she has always been?All we got was a glimpse of Meghan’s veiled face, looking remarkably composed as she waved to the crowd.Her American dream was about to come true — proof you really can be anything you want.Meanwhile, back at the chapel, Meghan’s beloved was arriving — in a laughably understated people carrier.Harry and best man Wills piled out — it really is impossible to get out of one of those cars elegantly — and the crowd whooped at the first glimpse of them in their dashing Blues and Royals uniforms.Harry looked nervous, but seemed to relax a little when his brother joked: “My trousers are too tight.”Those who remember the same princes as solemn young boys, walking grief-stricken behind their mother’s coffin, will have thrilled to see their easy intimacy as grown men, born from supporting each other through so much. Diana would have been delighted.With William and Harry in their seats at the front of the chapel — William keeping up a steady flow of whispered banter, just as Harry did when he was his best man — it was time for the mother of the bride to make her entrance.Doria, in mint green Oscar de la Renta, offset by her nose ring and dreadlocks, looked overcome with emotion as she took her place at the front of the church.Things don’t get much more surreal than arriving shortly before the Queen of England to watch your daughter marry a prince.But Doria also looked alarmingly alone – the only member of Meghan’s family to attend following a turbulent week which had ultimately resulted in the no-show of Meghan’s dad Thomas.Then Harry caught Doria’s eye and gave her a reassuring nod, and it was clear that she didn’t need anyone with her because she had a new family right here. That family could surely never have imagined that someone like Doria — a yoga teacher from California — would one day be their in-law.And yet here were Charles and Camilla — wearing what looked like a dead flamingo on her head — ready to cement that relationship.Finally, the Queen arrived, wearing lime green, accompanied by her ever steadfast husband, Prince Philip, who displayed the best of British stoicism by walking himself unaided down the aisle in his first public appearance since hip replacement surgery six weeks ago.Her Majesty was here to preside over the marriage of her grandson to an American divorcee — and it was down to another American divorcee that the Queen is the monarch at all.When Edward VIII fell in love with Wallis Simpson the Royal Family went into meltdown and the nation lost a king to exile and ignominy because tradition and the powers-that-be deemed it impossible he could marry such a woman.Yet here was Edward’s niece, 82 years later, ready to welcome Meghan with the closest the British upper class get to open arms.By her side was Philip, a man often seen as the old guard, but who has in fact spent his life fighting the whispering, back- stabbing traditionalists who had often treated him as an outsider too.If that parallel shows how far the Royal Family has come in embracing modern life, then they were about to get dragged further forward still by the arrival of the most modern bride in royal history.But first, the entrance of an adorable gaggle of page boys and flower girls, mainly children of Harry and Meghan’s closest friends — and of course four-year-old Prince George and his sister Princess Charlotte, three, who stole the show by sticking her tongue out at the crowds.The Duchess of Cambridge, generously in a cream Alexander McQueen coat dress she had worn three times before to make sure all eyes were on Meghan, was an earth mother in sharp tailoring as she ushered the children inside.Miraculously, the charming band of under-sevens all behaved themselves impeccably.Then finally — the moment the world had been waiting for.The bride stepped from her car and took away the collective breath of 1.9billion television viewers.After months of speculation, she revealed her gown to be the sort of showstopper that takes extortionate amounts of planning, time and money to make, but somehow manages to look effortless.Designed by British Givenchy boss Clare Waight Keller, the £200,000 ivory white gown demurely showed off Meghan’s figure to perfection.The look was completed with Queen Mary’s bandeau tiara, loaned to Meghan by the Queen, and a 16ft organza veil and train.It was embroidered with flowers from all 53 Commonwealth countries, as well as Meghan’s two favourite plants, the California poppy and wintersweet. Watching at home, her dad Thomas Markle declared: “My baby looks beautiful.”With her hair swept back in an elegant bun and a boat neck that showed off her delicate clavicles, Meghan had more than a little Audrey Hepburn about her. Which was appropriate, given that she was about to embark on the greatest screen moment of her life.Meghan was to become the first royal bride to walk herself down the aisle — before meeting Prince Charles half way for the final steps up to her betrothed. Before she set off on her momentous journey down the aisle, Meghan took a breath and gave a small smile, a picture of poise and composure.Who else in the world could have been so calm, so elegant, at such a moment?Watching Meghan’s progress on the arm of his dad, Harry – reddening with nerves – bit back tears, then met her eyes with a massive grin.As she reached the altar, Harry turned to Charles and murmured: “Thank you, Pa.” Then gazing at Meghan, he told her: “You look amazing, absolutely gorgeous.”Eagle-eyed viewers on Twitter were convinced that he added “I’m s***ting it” — easy to believe of a prince famous for his irreverent sense of humour.But it seems he actually told her “I missed you”, in reference to the night they had spent apart.Holding each other’s gaze, the air between Meghan and Harry crackled with chemistry that you could almost taste through the TV.It was as if they were the only people in the world — while across the globe, viewers at home found their eyes pricking with tears of joy.The tension was broken by the Dean of Windsor’s opening address: “The gift of marriage brings husband and wife together in the delight and tenderness of sexual union and joyful commitment to the end of their lives.”To their credit, the congregation managed to keep a straight face at the words “sexual union” — the rest of the British public, watching at home, were not so composed.There was further levity when the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, asked the couple if they knew of any reason why they could not marry. As is practically the law at British weddings, this provoked a wave of nervous laughter.Then it was time for the vows. Harry lifted Meghan’s veil to reveal her beautiful face, flawless in restrained make-up that showed off those trademark freckles, her eyes filled with wonder that this was actually happening.In the quintessentially English setting of St George’s Chapel, it felt almost incongruous — but wonderfully refreshing — to finally hear Meghan proclaim “I will” in her soft American accent.The couple promised to love, comfort, honour and protect each other with the sort of sincerity which would move even the hardest heart.If you weren’t bawling already, then surely the sight of Lady Jane Fellowes, sister of Harry’s beloved, lost mum Diana, arriving to deliver the reading would set you off.Taken from the Book of Solomon, the passage proclaimed that “love is strong as death, passion fierce as the grave”.Then the vaulting voices of the St George’s Chapel Choir delivered Thomas Tallis’s If Ye Love Me, British choral tradition at its finest.But traditions are there to be broken, and that’s where the Most Reverend Michael Curry came in.Theatrical, fire-breathing and entirely unrestrained by time, the man chosen to give the sermon was about as un-British as they come.The first African-American bishop to lead the Episcopal Church in the US, 65-year-old Curry was reportedly recommended to the couple by the Archbishop of Canterbury.He had described him as a “brilliant pastor, stunning preacher and someone with a great gift for sharing the good news of Jesus Christ.”This, it transpired, was an understatement.In a barnstorming address which ran to more than 13 minutes, Curry waxed lyrical about “harnessed fire” and “the redemptive power of love.” He quoted Martin Luther King and referenced justice, poverty and slavery in a room full of some of the planet’s richest and most privileged people.His passionate delivery was hailed on social media as the highlight of the service, but inside the chapel the faces of the senior royals, not used to this sort of unrestrained thundering, were a sight to behold.Beatrice and Eugenie got the giggles, Camilla and Charles seemed to be stifling laughter, and Kate looked like she had swallowed a wasp.The Queen was impassively stoney faced while Zara Phillips was open-mouthed.Meanwhile, the congregation were being wowed by a sublime cello performance from Sheku Kanneh-Mason.Young, gifted, British and black, and playing some of the most beautiful classical music ever written, Sheku epitomised how effortlessly Meghan and Harry had pulled together the old world and the new.The bride and groom returned for a rousing rendition of the National Anthem, then it was out into the dazzling sunshine as the choir sang the Etta James version of Amen/This Little Light Of Mine and the crowd whooped and hollered.On the steps of the chapel, underneath an Instagram-worthy floral arch, Meghan turned to her new husband and asked: “Do we kiss?” No prizes for guessing that he replied with an enthusiastic: “Yeah!”And just like that, there it was, sealed with a kiss — proof that fairytales really do come true. Everyone wanted a taste of the magic, and the newlyweds obliged with a thrillingly romantic carriage ride through the streets of Windsor, aboard the 13ft-long Ascot Landau.Meghan couldn’t quite believe the sea of people all there to wish them well, repeatedly mouthing “Wow.” Harry, meanwhile, told her: “I’m ready for a drink now.”It was a spectacular sight — the open-topped carriage, pulled by four Windsor greys and flanked by the household cavalry Blues and Royals.British pageantry at its best, but in typically British fashion most viewers were distracted by a rather lively looking horse at the front, which seemed ready to make a break for it.Thanks to the efforts of its rider, the horse’s behaviour remained just on the right side of disastrous.The feelgood atmosphere was infectious, with crowds singing “Harry and Meghan sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g.”Those thousands of well-wishers may not have been invited to the wedding reception, but you can be certain they carried on the party for many hours to come.Meghan and Harry were headed for St George’s Hall state room in Windsor Castle, where they treated 600 guests to a spread of canapes including Scottish langoustines and croquettes of Windsor lamb.Charles gave a speech praising how Harry had grown into “a big man with a big heart”, while Harry provoked cheers when he introduced Meghan as “my wife.”In a speech that had his guests in stitches, Harry gently ribbed the Americans by warning them not to steal the swords, and implored them to leave quietly so as “not to wake the neighbours”.Speaking from the heart, he praised Meghan for “navigating everything with such grace” and added: “We make such a great team.”Few would disagree with that sentiment.Later, a privileged 200 friends and family were invited to an evening reception compered by James Corden at nearby Frogmore Hall, on the grounds of the Windsor estate.Harry and Meghan were pure Hollywood glamour as they made their journey to the do in an open E-Type Jaguar, she in stunning Stella McCartney halter neck gown and he in sharp tuxedo.Their ride is said to be the world’s most sought-after car, a blue 1968 model that has been converted to electric.With the number plate E190518 — the date of their marriage — it was the perfect transport for the world’s most sought-after couple.There was one guest missing from the day who Harry will surely have longed to be there, but she made her presence known nonetheless.Princess Diana would have loved the deeply personal touches the couple brought to their wedding, and the way they breathed new life into centuries of tradition.When Diana married into The Firm, the monarchy was still living in the past, and she was suffocated by the pomposity and stuffiness.Her legacy was to leave her sons with the thirst to modernise and humanise the institution they were born into, and that desire was writ large across this unique Royal Wedding.On his engagement to Meghan, Harry said that his mother and his fiancee would have been “best friends.”She may not have been there to share his joy at marrying Meghan, but Diana was there in spirit. Meghan and Harry — now the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, thanks to new titles bestowed by the Queen — are back to reality tomorrow.They return to work undertaking their first royal engagement as man and wife, co-hosting a garden party at Buckingham Palace alongside Prince Charles.It may have been brief, but their wedding was the shining moment that we all needed amid the troubles and challenges of a world seemingly more divided than ever.For one glorious weekend we came together and felt good, celebrating the love and hope of two people at once so different to us, and so much the same.Across the country, on buses and in supermarket queues and in sunlit parks, it was all anyone could talk about.It was the same infectious cheerfulness and celebration of our common decency that Britain last experienced at the 2012 London Olympics.How strange that it took a royal wedding to prove that the values of tolerance and optimism are alive and well.Curry, ignoring his prepared text on the iPad in front of him, ploughed on undaunted.At one point he seemed to be coming to a close, saying “we’re gonna sit down, we gotta get y’all married” — before continuing for a further three minutes. Meghan liked it, though — she turned to Harry and mouthed: “Wow!”Just when you thought it couldn’t get less British, the address was followed by a spine-tingling rendition of Ben E King’s soul hit Stand by Me, by the London-based Kingdom Choir.The message was clear — Meghan and Harry intend to do things their way, and that includes looking forwards, and embracing Britain’s multicultural identity.Improbable as it may seem, Meghan and Harry are uniquely placed to do this. With Meghan, a proudly bi-racial woman, inside the fold, the Royal Family is finally starting to look a little more like the nation they represent.More than this, Meghan knows what it is to strive, to graft, to have a career and to have a marriage that doesn’t work, just like tens of thousands of Brits.Harry, while immensely privileged, is the most human face of the Windsors. He has known great personal tragedy but maintains his mother’s easy charm with ordinary folk.We’ve all watched him make very public mistakes — the booze, the hot-headed temper, the naked japes, the distasteful fancy dress.But it is precisely because of his flaws that Harry is our most beloved royal after the Queen — because it seems like he’s one of us.Together Meghan and Harry can make real changes — you need look no further than the rapt faces of the guests listening to the gospel choir to know this is true.Apart from former PM Sir John Major, who was appointed William and Harry’s special  after the death of Diana in 1997, and Winston Churchill’s grandson Sir Nicholas Soames — there on virtue of being a close family friend rather than his political career — there were no staid politicians in attendance.Instead, Harry and Meghan invited the representatives of causes they cared about, in a signal of what they plan to prioritise once they were married.Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKThere was Karl Lokko, a former gang leader turned youth community activist, Suhani Jalota, whose Myna Mahila Foundation attempts to improve women’s menstrual health hygiene in India, and Dave Henson, who helped Harry build his Invictus Games.It is an exciting taste of things to come — and do not doubt the power of this extraordinary couple. When Harry publicly took an HIV test, self-testing increased by 500 per cent. The impact he and Meghan may have is boundless.But they are more than a power couple — they are starstruck lovers, too. Nowhere was this more apparent than at the moment they swapped wedding bands, when Harry tenderly stroked Meghan’s finger as he slipped a Welsh gold ring on it.The delight on their faces when the Archbishop finally pronounced them husband and wife would be familiar to giddy newlyweds everywhere.After Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer — Diana’s favourite hymn, which was played both at her funeral and at William and Kate’s wedding — Meghan and an emotional Prince Harry slipped off to sign the register.How they must have treasured those few private moments. All of us who had witnessed them unable to tear their eyes off each other were hoping they put the privacy to good use, by indulging in some passionate snogging.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Later, I went back with him after he had built a night school for the boys, and asked over a cup of tea: “Why are you doing this, Harry?”He replied: “This is the most important thing I do.”It tells you everything about who his mother was.Inside the Chapel, the hymn was Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, which was played at Princess Diana’s funeral and one of her favourites.Di’s sister Lady Jane Fellowes delivered the only reading. Listening to it was Sarah, the Duchess of York, who had not been invited to other recent royal weddings.Inviting Fergie was a brilliant thing to do. During Diana’s troubled times every Sunday she would drive down to Berkshire to have lunch with Fergie, spending the afternoon talking about their divorces.Outside in the Chapel courtyard were 2,000 people from Harry and Meghan’s charities, including servicemen who have lost limbs.Harry is following Diana’s hugely successful campaign to stop landmines by working with those who have been wounded by IEDs.When Harry was flying back from one of his tours of Afghanistan he shared the plane with three soldiers who were in a coma.He realised these soldiers, if they recovered, would have limbs missing and facing a life of misery — which is why he inspired them with his support for the Invictus Games.And Harry and Meghan asked guests to make donations to the Children’s HIV Association.Harry has clearly never forgotten how his mother took the stigma out of Aids by embracing sufferers, including babies in Brazil.And then there was the ring.

She is making big money with an exclusive TV interview.”Samantha regularly tweets about her half-sister, and her Twitter profile includes candid photographs of them growing up together.Meanwhile, Doria Ragland, 64, has remained largely silent after it was revealed her daughter had fallen in love with a Prince, with the American mum jetting into the UK to be by Meghans side ahead of the wedding.The mum was quickly welcomed by the Royal Family, with the bride even thanking her new in-laws for their kindness to her mum.But Samantha appears to be unimpressed at Doria, who is believed to be filming an interview with Oprah Winfrey while they are both in London.Oprah, 64, arrived at the wedding alone after securing the landmark chat with Meg’s mum. The US talkshow icon later described the day as “extraordinary”.A royal source revealed: “The plan is for Doria to film part of her interview while Oprah is in London. That’s why she was invited to the wedding. There’s huge secrecy about what the interview will involve and when it will air.“But both Doria and Meghan felt it was critical for Oprah to be at the wedding to really understand.“Oprah is an icon in the US media and a role model to African American women. She has an untouchable status and is becoming a key adviser to both Meghan and Doria.”Samanthas criticism comes after she was compared to the Middletons, with one Twitter user saying: It would be nice if you would take your cues from the Middleton family-or any family members of the royal’s spouses for that matter-who NEVER sell them out to the press or on social media.Samantha hit out, saying: They don’t have to speak to the media they have royal money and legal protection even members of the family who did not speak it were preyed upon by media vultures and photographers.To refrain from self defense is ridiculous.Samantha was recently labelled a vulture by Piers Morgan.She also claimed to have been in a car crash, despite police saying they had found no evidence of it.Samantha recently wrote an autobiography called The Diary Of Princess Pushy in which she claims to tell-all about her half-sister.The title of the book has since been changed to A Tale Of Two Sisters.Her agent Linda Langton told The Mirror: The book is extremely well written and is a dynamic and sympathetic portrayal of two sisters, one of whom is soon to be a real live princess.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000407898641.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"london tube map 80 per cent underground","story":"It shows 198 miles out of the total 250-mile network, or 79 per cent, is open to the elements.That means just 52 miles or 21 per cent lie under the city’s streets, The Evening Standard Reports.It’s the brainchild of mapping analytics firm Esri UK, and also shows the exact geographical route of the network.They have used pink to indicate the parts of the network below ground and blue for over ground.The pink lines are concentrated in the centre of the city while the blue ones stretch far out into the suburbs.They also produced a map which where the individual lines are shown by the colours they appear on the standard Tube map.Research carried out by the firm discovered that the only line to be entirely underground is the Waterloo and City Line.

Going well.Another said: So @GNRailUK have been badgering us for weeks about the timetable changes. Obligingly, I get up and out earlier to catch altered train and oh look. Cancelled. As is the one prior. Bravo @GNRailUKA GTR spokesman said: We are introducing the biggest change to rail timetables in a generation and, as we have been informing passengers, we expect some disruption to services in the initial stages.This is a significant logistical challenge as we make rolling incremental changes across more than 3,000 daily services.We apologise to customers for any inconvenience caused during the initial stages of the timetable change.The improvements we are making will lead to a significant boost in capacity with a 135 increase in services across the GTR network immediately.Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary Mick Cash described the chaos as Meltdown Monday.He said: The union is picking up reports from both Northern and GTR of a hopeless lack of planning, combined with a shortage of crew and fleet, which has reduced the Monday morning journey to a nightmare for many passengers.It is our members dealing with the anger at the sharp end, not the well-paid top brass from Arriva and Govia who are responsible for this Meltdown Monday on our railways.Both of these companies have sought to compromise safety and access by hacking back on critical staff and it is no surprise to RMT that they cant be trusted with the massive logistical challenges of bringing in new timetables.Frankly I wouldnt trust the private train operators to run a bath, let alone our vital rail routes. After Virgin/Stagecoach were kicked off the East Coast last week, its time for the rest of these racketeers to be sent packing as well and for our railways to be run by the public sector as a public service.More than four million trains across Britain were rescheduled from Sunday in the largest timetable change in living memory.The number of alterations is seven times larger than normal due to the introduction of new trains and services following billions of pounds of investment.The shake-up is designed to increase overall frequencies and reliability, but some passengers will find their regular journeys are no longer possible.The new GTR timetable was developed from scratch and was designed to tackle existing issues by extending stop times at busier stations and increasing turnaround times at destination stations.Many of the timetable changes are a result of the £7 billion invested in the Thameslink programme in the South East, including rebuilding London Bridge station, new trains and track improvements.There will be almost 400 additional GTR trains every day.Some passengers in a number of locations complained they will be served with fewer or slower services, including in Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Kent, East Sussex and Surrey, where many people pay several thousand pounds for annual season tickets to London."},{"url":null,"title":"audi stops middle m53 motorway","story":"The cocky driver of the Audi convertible brakes repeatedly in front of the recovery truck, before making obscene gestures on the M53.Footage filmed by a passenger in the recovery truck driven by Bill Houghton sees him finally lose patience and scream at the Audi driver: Ill smash you to f****** bits.The dispute, which took place on Saturday afternoon between junctions 8 and 10 in Cheshire, is thought to have been caused by the Audi driver becoming enraged at the slow speed of the recovery vehicle.In the video, the Audi driver cuts in front of the recovery truck and gestures for him to pull over.He then moves back in to the fast lane and which point an enraged Mr Houghton yells threats and calls the Audi driver a b*****d.The Audi gets in front of the recovery truck and brakes sharply before accelerating away.Incredibly, the Audi then stops completely in the left hand lane.

they mimic marine food.If they go into the atmosphere they blow up, become shredded and end up falling down in fragments.They end up in the stomachs of seabirds, turtles, whales and dolphins.We know that plastics in the environment attract pollutants.To get to nanoplastics, they have to be in the marine environment for months or years.Nanoplastics are so small that they could be absorbed through the gut walls of humans.It is a ticking time bomb.The passionate conservationist, who lives in Bournemouth, Dorset, said the three components of a balloon pose a risk.He added: They are a lethal form of airborn litter.Most other litter does not have the ability to travel hundreds of miles.What I can say for certain is that British balloons are the biggest problem.John has written to the British CEO of McDonalds, Steve Easterbrook, to raise his concerns.He added: The Happy Meal balloon promotion is the gateway for McDonalds to hooking kids into fast-food and for some reason they seem abnormally attached to the idea.My personal feeling is that they think the balloons are an integral part of their marketing.They could easily change this with their global profits.I think they could come up with an idea that is more appealing to children than balloons.An activist from the Danish island of Fanoe, on the west coast, wrote: On our beach we can easily find 10- 15 happy meal balloons every day.Wildlife could be seen in some of the pictures, including seals and puffins.A spokesman for McDonalds said: Helium balloons are no longer in use in the majority of our coastal restaurants.We strive to be a good neighbour in all the communities we operate in and work closely with our suppliers to ensure all of our balloons are made from biodegradable materials.We have taken a number of steps to encourage customers to dispose of litter responsibly, and are currently in the process of replacing all helium balloons with stick balloons in coastal restaurants.Our priority remains to provide our customers with the correct messaging on waste disposal and ensure we play our part in keeping the environment litter free."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000405501884.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"cheeky princess charlotte recreates uncle prince harrys tongue photo 30 years on","story":"The adorable three-year-old, a flower girl at her uncle Harrys wedding to Meghan Markle on Saturday, joined bridesmaids in cute white dresses and floral headbands for the ceremony.She was earlier seen confidently waving to the crowds outside St Georges Chapel -

I got the tattoo because that’s exactly how I feel.“Luckily I’m still here, I’m not number 23. It was horrific.”Piotr told how he was nearly killed as he texted wife Ewa, 46, and daughter Amelia, 12, while waiting to collect them at the end of the US star’s concert at Manchester Arena.He arrived at the venue around 10.30pm and stood next to a pillar on the right side of the exit foyer as concert goers began to filter out.Moments later, Abedi, 22, deton-ated his rucksack bomb packed with nuts and bolts — ripping holes in Piotr’s jeans and trainer.Piotr, who emigrated from Poland 13 years ago, said: “I sent a text to my wife saying ‘I’m here’. I was in the middle of texting where I was when suddenly, bang.“My phone shattered, I thought it had exploded. My first thought was ‘bloody phone’. Then my vision went in my eye a fraction of a second later — there was shrapnel flying everywhere.“I didn’t feel any pain, the first thing I did was hit the deck and crawled between the pillar and wall for safety. I was in the army in Poland and I was trained for this — it was instinct.”Piotr then recalled the harrowing aftermath as he drifted in and out of consciousness.He went on: “After the boom was silence. Then the screaming came and smoke and people running away and panic.“There were people lying all around me and nuts, bolts and metal everywhere. It was obvious it was a bomb.“I remember paramedics bringing a young girl on a spinal board.“They laid her on the ground and were pushing on her chest. There were people screaming her name and shouting ‘Come back’.“Then I saw the black bags, the body bags. It was horrific. I was really scared for my life because I’d started to feel pain in my stomach.“I was struggling to breathe — they had an oxygen mask on me. I was also worried about my family.“My phone was shattered, we weren’t in contact. All I could think was what had happened to my wife and daughter?”Security staff rushed to stricken victims’ aid and grabbed T-shirts to help stem the bleeding from Piotr’s left eye and body wounds.The maintenance engineer added: “I kept saying I couldn’t see out my eye, I thought it was just blood in it.“A police officer called John then turned up and said he could see it, he then stayed with me for a while.“Another cop Pete came and spoke to me to keep me conscious.I recognised the nuts because I work with them every day. I took one from my chest and kept hold of it. It turned out I had seven nuts in my body and legs.”Distraught Ewa and Amelia believed Piotr — also father to Kacper, 16, was dead before they were later reunited in hospital.He’d been moved to the entrance foyer where paramedics were triaging victims.He arrived in hospital at 2am — three-and-a-half hours after the explosion.He was whisked for an MRI scan but before cops took away a nut he was gripping on to.Piotr added: “I wanted to keep it but they said the police needed it.”He was rushed straight to theatre where his eye and wounds were operated on.Piotr had six operations on his eye, torso and legs during his month in hospital in Manchester.He also had numerous tests on his left eye but two weeks after the bomb, doctors broke the news that they couldn’t save it.He recalled: “That was the first time I felt sad. I felt a piece of me had been taken away.But I’ve always tried to think positively and I had a prosthetic eye put in.”WIFE Ewa revealed how she feared Piotr had been killed for an agonising 15 hours.The mum, 46, knew her hubby was waiting for her and daughter Amelia, 12, in the foyer where the explosion took place.And she was distraught at being unable to contact him — unaware his phone was shattered and he’d been taken to hospital.But she told of the amazing moment they were reunited.Ewa said: “I thought he was dead — we didn’t hear anything for 15 hours.I heard a bang at the end of the gig and someone said ‘this is a bomb attack’.“We weren’t able to get out the exit where Piotr was. At 2pm the next day, the police came to our hotel room and said I had to come to the hospital.“They took me into the ward and asked if this was Piotr.“I was so happy to see him, even though he was sleeping.”Piotr said he roused to see his wife, daughter and two pals who had draped a had a Scotland flag over his bed.He said: “I woke and they were all there. Bizarrely, the first thing I asked for was my nut, the one I’d taken out of myself.“We were only able to talk a short while before I was put in an induced coma for five days.”The dad still faces at least three operations on his jaw and injured eye in the coming months.And the attack has taken its toll emotionally on him and his wife.Piotr admitted: “When I hear a noise now, I’ll jump. I work in an industry where you hear bangs all the time, but it affects me now.“I’m not back at work yet but that’s because I still have operations to go. But my job is still there for me.My wife is suffering from PTSD so she is going through treatment. My daughter is okay though, she’s back to being a typical teenager.”Piotr revealed the harrowing events as he prepares to return to Manchester for a service where the 22 victims will be remembered.But in a sign of defiance he said: “Abedi tried to kill kids, including my own — but I don’t give him a second thought now.

The \u0027yellow card\u0027 system meant some people on Jobseekers\u0027 Allowance got a warning before their benefits were sanctioned, often for simple offences like missing an appointment. But the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is dropping the idea after a short trial involving 6,500 claimants. MPs demanded the reform back in 2015 after warning sanctions - which can stop payments for months - were causing severe financial hardship. In a written statement today, however, the DWP said its trial appeared to make little difference to the outcomes of claimants. Ministers are now going back to the drawing board to draw up an alternative process to warn claimants before dishing out a sanction.  The trial, between April and September 2016, meant claimants who faced a benefit sanction were instead given a \u0027sanction warning letter\u0027. This gave them an extra 14 days to submit evidence of a good reason for why they should not have their benefits docked. The DWP, however, said only 13% of those who received a warning letter replied to it within the two-week period. And in half of those cases the evidence did not contain a good reason for the sanction to be cancelled, so it was applied anyway. Work and Pensions Minister Alok Sharma said: Given the additional burden placed on the Departmental resources and marginal gains achieved, the trial did not appear to be an effective use of the Department’s resource.

Hours after the former actress exchanged vows with Harry, the royal site had been updated to reflect its newest member. And a poignant quotation from Meghan takes centre stage - I am proud to be a woman and a feminist. The biography also highlights her lifelong commitment to a range of causes, including those promoting social justice and women\u0027s empowerment. It reflects on the royal bride\u0027s work aged just 11, when she successfully campaigned for the wording on a TV advert to be altered after it used sexist language to sell washing-up liquid.    Her Royal Highness also volunteered at a soup kitchen in Skid Row, Los Angeles from the age of 13-17, it adds. She continued to volunteer at the soup kitchen when she would return home to Los Angeles until the age of 22. Meghan\u0027s work with charities such as UN Women, for whom she became Women\u0027s Advocate for Women\u0027s Political Participation and Leadership in 2015, and as a Global Ambassador for World Vision are also noted. The newly married Duke and Duchess of Sussex will have little time to recover from their fairytale wedding as they head straight back to work this week. Unlike other newlyweds, Harry and Meghan will not be jetting off on a honeymoon straight away, and will instead be back on royal duty, carrying out their first official engagements as husband and wife.  The couple, who exchanged vows in a ceremony watched by millions across the world on Saturday, are due to attend a Buckingham Palace garden party on Tuesday as part of the Prince of Wales\u0027s 70th birthday celebrations.

Meghan is reported to have broken with tradition to give a speech of her own at the wedding reception. A visit to Australia is in the diary for October, for the 2018 Invictus Games, while other trips abroad this year are said to be in the pipeline.

This miniature house, located deep in the tunnels approaching Liverpool\u0027s Lime Street station Lime Street station from Edge Hill, was built more than 100 years ago by track workers taking their breaks.   The historic hut can only be accessed when trains aren’t running – but the Liverpool ECHO was given an exclusive close-up look.  The second phase of an upgrade allowing Lime Street to welcome more and longer trains will take place from June 2 to July 29 – but the hut will remain untouched.  Graeme Whitehead, Network Rail project manager, said: “In years gone by track maintenance gangs would have come here, they’d have had their lunch, a cup of coffee, lit the fire, and waited in between trains. “We have no plans to do anything with it, it will stay here, it’s protected beneath the tunnels and will remain locked in history forever more. “It’s difficult to see if you’re a passenger on a train. “If the light’s in the right place you can just about see the outline of it but it’s a little gem that’s locked away and kept in the dark.”  Network Rail says the hut is believed to be more than 100 years old and was built as a “mess hut”. The house has been disused for at least 50 years and parts of the floor have crumbled away, but evidence of its previous use remains. Benches run down both sides, with a table in the centre and a fireplace used by workers to keep warm between trains in the winter months. Engineers also found an old kettle, a cup and tongs used to move materials in the fireplace. Last year Lime Street saw three weeks of full and partial closures so engineers could build two new platforms and upgrade the tracks. Around 2,000m of track has been replaced, new steel gantries installed and new signalling fitted.

But in the last few years it\u0027s gained a new lease of life thanks to the young royals, and it now seems to be an appealing place for many of them to call home. The Cambridge gang now live in a lavish home on the site, and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will be moving in next door after their wedding. The couple lived in the small two-bedroom Nottingham Cottage, but they are due to be upgraded to Apartment 1 after their wedding. It\u0027s the second biggest on the site, and work is already underway to get the lavish 21-room wing all ready for them.  But the Cambridges won\u0027t be their only royal neighbours, as Kensington Palace is full of members of the royal family - 15 to be exact. So let\u0027s take a look at all Harry and Meghan\u0027s neighbours. The Cambridges - Apartment 1A Wills, Kate, George, Charlotte, baby Louis and Lupo the dog now live in the biggest home on the site - Apartment 1A.  It boasts six-bedrooms and was once home to Princess Margaret. After their wedding Kate and Wills spent \u0026pound4.5million doing it up. Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank - Ivy Cottage The engaged couple are the newbies in KP, having moved in just last month.  They live in Ivy Cottage, which is just around the back from Harry and Meghan\u0027s current home. Eugenie is Prince Harry\u0027s cousin, and they\u0027re said to be good pals who enjoyed partying together. The couple will marry in St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle, the same venue as Harry and Meghan, in October. The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester - Apartment 1 (for now) Prince Richard, the Queen\u0027s cousin, currently lives in Apartment 1 however he\u0027s about to be booted out to make room for Harry and Meghan.  The couple\u0027s children have now all grown up and flown the nest, so they\u0027ve agreed to move out so the new couple can have more space. But don\u0027t worry, they\u0027re not being turfed out into the street. According to the Daily Mail, they\u0027re moving into the Queen\u0027s private secretary Sir Christopher Geidt\u0027s old apartment. It\u0027s a lot smaller, but apparently they don\u0027t mind... The Duke and Duchess of Kent - Wren House Prince Edward is also the Queen\u0027s cousin and he lives in an apartment with his wife Katharine.  We don\u0027t know much about their home and they\u0027ve always kept the details very private. Prince and Princess Michael of Kent - Apartment 10 Michael is another of the Queen\u0027s cousins, but their living situation caused a bit of controversy back in 2001 when it was discovered the couple were paying peanuts to live in KP.

And her beloved beagle proved to be one of the highlights of the night as he entertained guests at the royal wedding evening reception.  The pet pooch had revellers in stitches as he caused chaos, running all over the place lapping up any spilled canap\u0026eacutes. Meghan, the new Duchess of Sussex, brought Guy to Britain with her last year when she relocated from her home in Toronto.  The decision was heartbreaking for Meghan as her other dog, Labrador-shepherd cross Bogart, was deemed too old to travel and had to be left behind. Meghan was also left devastated late last year when Guy reportedly suffered two broken legs. He was reportedly treated by TV supervet Professor Noel Fitzpatrick.  Prince Harry and Meghan told their closest friends of their love for one another at the late reception party after their spectacular wedding. Both of the newlyweds gave short informal speeches. Harry said how honoured he was to have such special people there with him. And he added: “You are the people that make me me in my Harry life, which as you know is the backbone to Prince Harry.” Then he gave way to his bride Meghan with the words “now I’m going to hand over to my far better half.”  An excited Meghan spoke for about four minutes about the big day, before she ended with the most emotional words of the night, telling her guests: “I have found my prince.” Guests arrived at 6pm for the most relaxed event of the night. One guest who was there said: “As we walked in there were ladies dressed in black, serving us fizz and Pimms, as well as canap\u0026eacutes from the palace staff. “That bit was a little formal with a bit of a line-up led by Charles and Camilla, with Wills and Kate to one side and Harry and Meghan in the middle of it all.” But after that, the party became a lot more relaxed. The guest said: “It was all very very informal, and had a lovely atmosphere. The whole evening had a really chilled, festival vibe.” The newlywed couple took to the dance floor inside Frogmore House for the first dance to Meghan’s favourite - Whitney Houston’s classic I Wanna Dance With Somebody. “It wasn’t traditional in the slightest,” said the guest. “They went into a bit of a jive and a lindy hop.”  But Harry was not the most popular dance partner... that was one of the sexiest men on the planet, Hollywood star George Clooney who danced with both bride Meghan and her new sister-in-law Kate. But to the amusement of many guests, the very first woman George asked to dance, Fergie, the Duchess of York, turned him down. Meanwhile some of Harry’s closest friends including ex-Para Jaco van Gass who suffered life-changing injuries in Afghanistan and became a Paralympics cyclist, along with guests such as Emily Sheffield - former Prime Minister David Cameron’s sister-in-law, hardly left the dance floor. Many TV viewers had remarked during the day on a sour expression on the face of Harry’s former girlfriend Chelsy Davy as she watched him tie the knot with Meghan. But at the party, she was all smiles and even seen embracing Meghan.  Big names like James Corden and Idris Elba happily chatted to fans but the guest said David and Victoria Beckham were “really aloof”. In honour of Harry’s time in the armed forces, the evening was lubricated by cocktails with military names such as the Apache, the Brimstone, the Rapier and the Hellfire. To the amusement of guests Madame Tussaud’s waxworks of Meghan and Harry were on display in a side room which caused all kinds of hilarity and mistaken identity as the night went on.

Standing nearly 460ft (140m) high beside the River Tyne, the developers say it will be 16ft (5m) taller than the London Eye, and will create up to 550 jobs and see more than \u0026pound100 million invested in the city. The wheel will include a 11,960 square yards (10,000 sq m) LED digital screen in the middle, which will be used to communicate information about local culture and events as well as adverts. The proposed site is at the east end of the Quayside, on the site of the former Spillers\u0027 Flour Mill. Artist\u0027s impressions show the wheel standing far higher than other famous landmarks such as the Tyne Bridge and the Angel of the North.  Included in the experience would be bars and restaurants and a visitor attraction called Giants of the North, which would celebrate the achievements of the region\u0027s sports stars and business people through history. The plans were announced by the World Wheel Company, which has built and operated giant observation wheels and family entertainment centres around the globe. It said visitors would be taken on a 30-minute flight on the Whey Aye - the company\u0027s phonetic rendering of the enthusiastic Geordie phrase why aye. It hopes to attract 800,000 visitors in the first year. A detailed planning application will be submitted later this year.

They’ve been living in the Kensington Palace cottage for six months and leading a relatively normal life - cooking cosy chicken roasts or dining in trendy restaurants. Meghan could slip out for yoga, shopping or to walk her dog. But the moment they left the chapel as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, their lives – and Meghan’s in particular – were changed for ever.  The couple, who love camping under the stars in Africa, may regret putting off the honeymoon for royal duties. Meghan wanted to “hit the ground running” with her charity work too, but their hectic schedule could prove a challenge. On Tuesday they attend a Buckingham Palace garden party for Prince Charles’s 70th birthday. Meghan’s expected to join the Queen at the Chelsea Flower Show, then the newlyweds visit Ireland before a tour of the Commonwealth.

The new Duke of Sussex made friends with Mutsu Potsane, then four, while on a gap year in Lesotho, a landlocked nation encircled by South Africa, in 2004. Harry is said to have stayed in touch with Mutsu over the years. The orphan is now 18 and his given name is Relebohile.  In 2006, the prince, with Lesotho\u0027s Prince Seeiso, co-founded Sentebale, a charity that works to combat the spread of HIV. The royal duo founded the organisation in their respective mothers\u0027 memory, both of whom spent time in the kingdom working to fight HIV. Lesotho has the world\u0027s second-highest rate of HIV.  Around 200 representatives from various charities were among the 2,460 members of the public invited to celebrate inside the grounds of Windsor Castle on Saturday.  Among them was Sentebale. Its chairman Johnny Hornby said 18-year-old Mutsu was among the first group to greet the newlyweds, the Express reports.  He’s a bit shy now, but he’s doing really well, Johnny said. He’s just finishing school. The charity shared a photo of some of its members at the royal wedding.   Congratulations to the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex, from everyone at Sentebale.  We were delighted that some of our Lesotho team were able to join in the very special celebrations in Windsor today! Harry and Mutsu were introduced at the Mants’ase Children’s Home for orphans near Mohale’s Hoek, outside Lesotho’s capital Maseru, more than ten years ago. Harry visited the centre to help children affected by HIV and Aids and quickly bonded with Mutsu. The prince returned to the orphanage in 2006.

No \u0026shyunauthorised videos or pictures were to emerge of the raucous party to end all parties. Only the couple\u0027s \u0027inner circle\u0027 - an exclusive 200-strong group - was invited to the Frogmore House knees-up. But here is a rundown of every last detail to escape the English country mansion. Guests reportedly supped on When Harry Met Meghan cocktails, played drinking games, danced with George Clooney and giggled at Meghan\u0027s overexcited pet dog. Meanwhile, prankster Prince William teased Harry over his thinning hair and attached a ladder to the couple\u0027s wedding car in a hilarious royal gag. Here is how Harry and Meghan celebrated in true A-lister style.  Who danced with who? Chat show superstar James Corden, who was compering the event, reportedly instigated a dance routine which featured Prince Charles, William and Harry. A source told the Sun: James \u0026shyCorden did his best to entertain and it went down an absolute treat. He even compered a dance-off between Harry, Charles and William. Everyone was laughing because it’s something no one expected. Meghan and her mum also joined in. Then everyone danced, which really kicked off the party.  The royal couple chose the Whitney Houston classic I Wanna Dance With Somebody as their first dance at the wedding bash. One of the 200 guests said: It wasn\u0027t \u0026shytraditional in the slightest. They went into a bit of a jive and a lindy hop. Hollywood actor George Clooney, 57, is also reported to have whisked Meghan and the Duchess of Cambridge away for a dance. But despite being one of world\u0027s the sexiest men, he did not get his own way with Fergie, who snubbed him when he asked for a quick spin on the dancefloor. Guests were given slippers to wear when their feet were tired from dancing. Actress Troian Bellisario, wife of Meghan\u0027s former on-screen husband Patrick J Adams in Suits, posted on Instagram: How amazing is this? Because these shoes have come off. They have slippers for us. \u0026shySlippers! I’m so ready.  What food and drink was served? The black-tie evening party was a sit-down dinner for 200 people. To provide the food, Harry and Meghan hired Clare Smyth, Britain\u0027s top chef and the first woman to hold three Michelin stars. The sit-down dinner was organic, sourced at the request of Prince Charles, and the light-bite canapes were themed \u0027spring meets summer\u0027. Guests were told to dress to the nines for a night of old-fashioned glamour and gallons of Pol Roger champagne.  A source told the Sun: There was a glass marquee for the dinner, festival-themed stalls and bars outside, with different themed drinks. There was a gin vermouth cocktail created for Charles and Camilla, who are both massive gin fans apparently. Also on the menu were candyfloss and \u0027dirty burgers\u0027 as midnight snacks, while one source reported a cocktail featuring ginger and rum was on the menu as a cheeky nod to Harry\u0027s red hair, named \u0027When Harry Met Meghan\u0027. Dozens of pizza boxes were spotted being hauled into in Windsor Castle on the night of the reception - but it later emerged they were for press accredited crew on the grounds. Who won the drinking games? The bride\u0027s US heritage was marked with the American drinking game beer pong, where players throw table tennis balls into cups of beers which their opponents then have to consume, according to reports. A reception insider said Serena Williams played the game like it was tennis.  What music did guests dance to? Celebrity DJ Sam Totolee, who was hired by Rod Stewart and Uma Thurman for their wedding receptions, was on the decks. Actor Idris Elba also took a turn at DJ\u0027ing, with a playlist filled with soul classics, 1960s R\u0026ampB and 1980s dance hits. A DJ who slipped his business card to Harry during a visit to Brixton also hinted that it worked and he secured the coveted commission to play at the do. Jevanni Letford posted a photograph Windsor with the caption: Calm before the excitement. At one point a grinning Harry is said to have turned to his guests, asking: \u0027Can anyone play the piano?\u0027 before Sir Elton John gave a moving medley of four hits - Your Song, Tiny Dancer, Circle Of Life and I\u0027m Still Standing.  Who gave a speech? Harry is reported to have told friends: You are the people that make \u0027me\u0027 me in my Harry life, which as you know is the backbone to Prince Harry. Now I’m going to hand over to my far better half… Meghan then gave a speech in which she thanked Prince Charles for walking her down the aisle and for such a warm welcome into the royal family. In Harry\u0027s speech, he said he was looking forward to spending the rest of my life with Meghan. But it was brother William, 35, who brought the house down in a joint speech with Harry’s best pal Charlie van Straubenzee.  They teased the groom about his thinning hair and told Meghan she was the best thing that had ever happened to Haz. One guest told the Sun: William managed to strike just the right balance between hilarious and solemn. He did mention their late mother, Princess Diana, and said how proud she would have been of her younger son. He said he was proud of Harry too and welcomed Meghan as the sister he never had and the best thing that had ever happened to Haz. But when he and Charlie got going, it was hilarious. They teased Harry about his growing bald patch and Wills said it would become as bad as his. It was some bash.  Proud dad Charles gave a speech at the earlier reception at St George\u0027s Hall in Windsor Castle. Talking about the man his son had become, he said: My darling old Harry, I’m so happy for you. Harry also gave a speech at the earlier reception. He moved guests to tears as he enthused about his beautiful wife, saying: We make such a great team. He is also said to have told Meghan, whose father could not attend the wedding because he was ill, that she navigated everything with such grace. Guest Suhani Jalota, who founded Mumbai charity Myna Mahila Foundation that Meghan visited last year, told Glamour Magazine the prince said: I’m so lucky to call this beautiful woman my wife now.  Was Meghan\u0027s dog at the reception? Meghan made sure her Guy played a part in her big day yesterday. And her beloved beagle proved to be one of the highlights of the night as he entertained wedding reception guests. The pet pooch had revellers in stitches as he caused chaos, running all over the place lapping up any spilled canapes.

Titles within the royal family were limited by Harry\u0027s great-great-grandfather King George V, who issued a Letters Patent in 1917. It read: ...the grandchildren of the sons of any such Sovereign in the direct male line (save only the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales) shall have and enjoy in all occasions the style and title enjoyed by the children of Dukes of these Our Realms. This means Harry and Meghan\u0027s children, should they have any while Elizabeth II is on the throne, will not be HRHs or princes or princesses, but will be known instead as Lord or Lady (forename) Mountbatten-Windsor.   However the Queen could issue a new Letters Patent to change this - just as she did for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s children.  George was always entitled to be HRH Prince George of Cambridge as the eldest son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. But HRH Princess Charlotte of Cambridge would have been Lady Charlotte Mounbatten-Windsor. In December 2012, when Kate was around three months pregnant, the Queen issued a Letters Patent under the Great Seal of the Realm declaring all the children of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales should have and enjoy the style, title and attribute of royal highness with the titular dignity of Prince or Princess prefixed to their Christian names or with such other titles of honour.

But of course, being a Prince, he couldn\u0027t just have a normal account and had to set it up using a fake name. And rather than picking a boring normal old name, he went for something a bit more unusual - Spike Wells. He had about 400 friends on the social networking site.  But there\u0027s no point trying to have a cheeky Facebook stalk of the Prince, who will marry American actress Meghan Markle in May, as he was forced to close the account down back in 2012. It\u0027s believed he made the decision to avoid any more bad press, after becoming embroiled in several scandals.

Despite nearly two billion people across the world tuned in to see Prince Harry and Meghan Markle marry at Windsor Castle on Saturday - the event was censored by Russian media outlets.  Russia Today, a state-run media outlet, even went as far to attack the celebrations, branding the wedding a \u0027manic frenzy\u0027.  The news channel has come under fire in the past after being accused of serving as a propaganda tool for President Vladimir Putin .   Continuing their criticism of the big day, Russia Today said the great unwashed were force-fed a celebration of the petrified leftovers of a bloody empire with a disgraceful history. It has been suggested the reasons for refusing to broadcast the wedding were down to poor political relations between Russia and the UK following the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. Both Yulia and Sergei are recovering in a top-secret MI5 safe house, deep in the English countryside.

Joy, amazement, pride and excitement... but tinged with a hint of fear. Because as Doria, 61, accompanied her daughter on her final journey as a commoner, the \u0026shyenormity of the occasion hit home. She and Meg used to drive around Los Angeles in her car with the number plate Megnme. Now they were in a Rolls-Royce Phantom, heading to Windsor Castle amid all the pomp and ceremony the British monarchy could muster.  Every mother of the bride feels a twinge of sadness at “giving” their girl to their husband. But Doria must have felt a huge sense of loss. She was giving her “Flower” to a Prince, a royal family, a country and an entire Commonwealth. And she had to do so alone, in a foreign country, possibly still jet-lagged and with two billion people around the globe watching on TV. Doria was the only member of the Markle family to attend the wedding. The bride’s half brother and sister were snubbed along with other \u0026shyrelatives after criticising Meghan.  Her dad who’d been due to walk her down the aisle had to pull out for a heart op. Thomas Markle, 73, watched the nuptials on TV as he recovered in Rosarito, Mexico. He later said: “I’ll always regret not being able to be there to hold my daughter’s hand. “My baby girl is a Duchess and I love her so much. Now I pray that Harry and Meghan can go on a nice honeymoon... and all of my \u0026shyrelatives will just shut up.” But Doria conducted herself with such quiet dignity and strength that everyone realised why Meghan calls her: “My rock.” And her unconcealed emotion during the wedding service also won her huge affection.  Sitting opposite the Queen and other reserved royals – still wearing her trademark nose-stud – Doria, wept openly and appeared to live every moment with Meghan as she said her vows. At one point she sighed deeply and shook her head as if she couldn’t quite believe what was happening. And dreadlocked Doria, descended from African slaves who chose the surname “Wisdom”, listened intently as US preacher Michael Curry talked of the civil rights struggle. As he said: “When you’re loved, and know it, it feels right,” she mouthed: “That’s right!” The royal “firm” clearly warmed to Doria, with Prince Charles seeming particularly smitten.  He held her hand during the service as they went to sign the register, supported her as they left the chapel and was seen with his arm around Doria several times at the reception. Now royal watchers are wondering if Doria will give up her life as a yoga teacher and social worker in LA and move to the UK to support Meghan. One royal insider said Meghan has an incredibly close bond with Doria and values her wise counsel. The insider added: “When she and Harry start a family it’ll be incredibly hard if her mum is 5,500 miles away.” Doria’s whirlwind visit will probably seem like a fairy tale when she gets home, believed to be next week.

Then she will be back to work at the mental health services unit where she is a “free-spirited clinical therapist” working with geriatric clients. Doria’s work ethic has always inspired Meghan.

Kiln Quay House in Cornwall is a 16th century home which was literally moved from its original Sussex location in 1919 when its owner Joan Beech met and fell in love with a Cornish sea captain. She asked her husband to move the home, which is about 400 years old, when she could not bear to leave it.  In the 1970s part of its roof was ruined by fire but the house, which is also known as Wealden House, was later restored before being listed in 1986, reports Cornwall Live.  So every brick and timber of the stunning property was moved the 280 miles from Sussex to Flushing, in Cornwall.  When the dream home was put on the market in 2006 it was valued at \u0026pound2m. The property, which comes with an outside swimming pool, its own croquet lawn, plenty of land and easy access to the sea, is now worth more than \u0026pound2.8m. And that price tag is set to increase further now that its current owners have spent an undisclosed fortune on hiring one of the best craftsmen in Cornwall to do it up inside. Led by expert craftsman Samuel Walsh, the artisan team transformed the kitchen, utility room, boot room, bedroom and study inside the house. The project involved making bespoke painted tulipwood, oak and oak burr cabinets for the kitchen, creating a curved island section to divide the cooking and dining areas and fashioning an oak burr counter top pantry that includes internal spice racks, curved doors and open bookshelves.  The solid oak drawers are dovetail jointed and run on soft-close runners, a tall section incorporates a large, America-style fridge, a pull-out larder and a built-in microwave and a double Belfast sink that has instant, boiling water from the tap. Mr Walsh said: It was a real privilege to work in such a beautiful property. Our clients were very involved throughout the entire process and we’re all delighted with what has been achieved.

The disease is increasingly infecting people across the globe, with cases in both Europe and Australia, international health agencies say.  It is reportedly becoming more and more difficult to treat - and could eventually become impossible to cure with current drugs .  Last month, it emerged that a British man with a highly-resistant strain of gonorrhoea - dubbed the \u0027world\u0027s worst\u0027 - had been successfully treated. The patient had a regular female partner in the UK.  However, he picked up the infection following a sexual encounter with a woman in south-east Asia, Public Health England (PHE) said. It was believed to be the first time globally that the disease could not be treated with first choice antibiotics.  Dr Gwenda Hughes, head of PHE\u0027s sexually transmitted infection (STI) section, said at the time: We are pleased to report that the case of multi-drug resistant gonorrhoea has been successfully treated.  Investigations have also revealed there has been no further spread of this infection within the UK.” However, elsewhere, there have been other reported cases of the disease. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control warns there has been a rise in global reports of “extensively drug-resistant” gonorrhoea.   There were reportedly three new documented cases of the STD in Europe and Australia between February and March, according to IFL Science .  In a statement earlier this month, the ECDC said: Within a matter of weeks, three cases of gonorrhoea that are resistant to the recommended first line antibiotic treatment have been detected in Europe and Australia. These are the first global reports of Neisseria gonorrhoeae with high-level resistance to azithromycin and ceftriaxone resistance that also show resistance to several other vital antibiotics. At a time with limited alternatives to the current dual therapy, lack of a vaccine and insufficient surveillance capacity in some regions, these cases highlight the growing threat of drug-resistance – which could lead to untreatable gonorrhoea. The Australian Government\u0027s Department of Health said two cases of the disease had been diagnosed in Queensland and Western Australia.  In a statement on April 17, the department said: Two cases of multi-drug resistant gonorrhoea have been recently detected in Australia. One case was diagnosed in Western Australia and a second case diagnosed in Queensland. It added: Evidence suggests that one of the Australian cases acquired their infection in Southeast Asia. The situation is being closely monitored by public health authorities. Gonorrhoea, which spreads through sex, is known to cause symptoms including unusual discharge and inflammation. It can lead to infertility if left untreated. After chlamydia, the disease is the second most commonly contracted STD in Europe, with 75,000 case confirmed in 2016. In the British case of multi-drug resistant gonorrhoea, the man had visited sexual health services earlier in the year.

The heir to the throne took on the job as Meghan Markle\u0027s own father was unable to attend because of poor health. And what he said to her proves that he was the right man for the job. As she walked into St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle, according to lip readers the prince said: You look lovely, are you OK? MirrorOnline reported yesterday how as Meghan appeared through the doors of the chapel, sunlight streamed in behind her and there were gasps from guests.  She initially walked alone, with one of her page boys caught by TV cameras stifling a yawn. Meghan was then met by Prince Charles at the organ screen, halfway down the chapel - who took her to her bridegroom Prince Harry. The groom told Meghan “you look amazing, I missed you” as he set on eyes on her for the first time on their fairytale wedding day. He was left open-mouthed when she saw his American bride walking down the aisle in her stunning British-designed dress. Harry also told Prince Charles “thank you pa” after he stepped in at the last minute to walk Megan part-way down the aisle.  Meghan and Harry are set to postpone their honeymoon so they can attend a birthday celebration for Charles this week. The newlyweds are expected to return to normal life and bid farewell to the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh after spending the night at Windsor Castle. Meghan has already spoken of her desire to hit the ground running as she becomes a full-time royal. On Tuesday the couple will join Charles and Camilla on the lawns of Buckingham Palace for a Prince of Wales 70th Birthday Patronage Celebration. The outdoor event marks the heir to the throne\u0027s milestone birthday - which falls in November - by recognising Charles\u0027 patronages and military affiliations as well as others involved in charities supported by the royal.  Now the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, the couple will not immediately leave for their honeymoon but remain in the UK for a period before taking the traditional break. Countries like Botswana - which offer stunning wildlife, breathtaking scenery and, importantly, privacy from prying eyes - could be top of the list.

The driver repeatedly \u0027brake-checked\u0027 the recovery truck and made obscene gestures before slamming his car to a halt in a lane on the M53 im Cheshire.  The shocking incident was filmed by a passenger in the recovery truck driven behind by Bill Houghton - who can be heard screaming at the Audi driver: I\u0027ll smash you to f *** ing bits, you f***ing bell-end.  The dispute on Saturday afternoon between junctions 8 and 10 is thought to have been caused by the Audi driver becoming enraged at the slow speed of the recovery vehicle. In the video, the Audi driver cuts in front of the recovery truck and gestures for him to pull over.  He then moves back in to the fast lane and which point an enraged Mr Houghton yells threats and calls the Audi driver a b ***** d.   The Audi gets in front of the recovery truck and brakes sharply before accelerating away. Incredibly, the Audi then stops completely in the left hand lane. The recovery truck can be heard screeching to a halt. Marriane Houghton, who is filmed, yells: F***ing k***head. The Audi driver waves before zooming off into the distance. Marriane said: “We overtook a big truck but as we are speed restricted it takes a little time to complete. “The Audi driver was speeding down the outside lane so came up on us fast, flashing his lights and gesturing. We pulled in and he cut straight in front of us and slowed down. We tried to move lanes but he moved too. That’s when I started to video.” “There was an articulated truck behind us so if we had hit him or stalled when we had to stop, it would have mounted the flat bed and crushed our cab. “Total disregard for anyone.

Ashta Monogue, 33, and her husband Ash, 36, from Georgia, USA, met seven years ago at a street fair, and have been married since 2013. Ashta has been polyamorous for a decade and throughout their marriage and Ash has explored the concept since they were married and met Rowen, 28, online in May 2016. For Ash and Ashta, forming a triad relationship with a third person wasn\u0027t something that was planned, but after the three of them met and clicked, they all fell in love.  The three are now joyously expecting their first child in October this year, as Ashta is pregnant. We\u0027re pretty complete as a family of three, and I think we would be happy even if we never had kids. But Ash and I have always wanted children, so when Rowen came into our lives, we decided to make a go at parenting as a triad, said Ashta. The pregnancy was very planned. We had begun treatments at a fertility clinic when we found out that I was pregnant naturally. All three of us were very excited and we still are. Rowen had decided that they (Rowen is gender queer and prefers neutral pronouns) would have a baby for us if I couldn\u0027t, but they are happy that I got pregnant. It\u0027s possible that they will have a child someday, but that will be a conversation for later. We\u0027re all very focused on this baby.  For the triad, polyamory means the freedom of being able to love more without restriction, and Ashta, Ash and Rowen all agree this has meant that there is a community within their home. For the triad, any feelings of jealousy that may arise don\u0027t affect them as they function as a group, and they discuss and resolve any emotions that may arise. We\u0027re all geeks and have lots of common interests. We love animals, board games, hiking, and trying new food. Ash and I met at a street fair in 2011 and were married in 2013. Ash met Rowen on an online dating site and we all three clicked really well, said Ashta. Ash and I were not really looking for a triad situation, it just kind of happened. Ash dated Rowen for a couple of months and then the whole group clicked well together.  Falling in love happened after about four months after everyone met. We\u0027re not restricted in our relationships, so we\u0027re not restricted to whom we can spend time with, or who we can date or love. Being in a triad means having a community built into our home. There\u0027s always someone around to help you, or to talk to. I don\u0027t know how to answer how our relationship works. It just does. We\u0027re mature and we talk about our issues and discuss our feelings. We\u0027re each delegated chores and responsibilities so that the house runs smoothly. We\u0027re pretty well past the point of jealousy. We function as a group so if someone has feelings of jealousy, we talk about it and address any issues that come up.  We occasionally have disagreements, but usually about how to decorate the house or what colour pillows to buy. Once the baby arrives the Ashta will be a stay-at-home mum to look after their child and Ash and Rowen will continue working as a customer support engineer and transcriptionist respectively. They intend to raise their baby in a happy and healthy environment and have lots of adventures as a family of four. However, Ashta says that the three won\u0027t force their child to be polyamorous and will encourage them to be whoever they decide.

Children “screamed” as oxygen masks came down and the plane dived rapidly.  The Onur Air Airbus 321 with 226 passengers and eight crew made a successful emergency landing at Volgograd airport in southern Russia. Some passengers needed medical and psychological help after the “horrible” incident, said an airport source.  The Turkish plane was en route from Antalya to Chelyabinsk in the Russian Urals region when it got into trouble. Unconfirmed reports said there was an engine failure. A woman passenger said: “It was so scary. People on board panicked. “Everyone was asleep when oxygen masks came down, children started to scream.” Another passenger said: “Flight Antalya to Chelyabinsk. Loss of cabin pressure.  “Descending from 10,000 metres to 500 metres within five minutes, very scary!!!” On one video, a man says to another“happy birthday!”, then turns to the camera saying: “This is horror”. In the second video a stewardess is believed to ask: “Are there doctors on board?” A woman says: ‘We have arrived.  The man filming the video looks into the camera and says: “That was horrible”. The airport in Volgograd - where England play their opening group stage match in the World Cup next month - confirmed the emergency landing. Passengers were ushered to an airport terminal. Those with children were taken to a hotel, said a source.

Tele revealed this week that the local authority had told residents in Mill o’ Mains that large recycling containers on Eriskay Drive would be taken away.It followed a spate of complaints from locals about bags and boxes filled with non-recyclable rubbish being dumped next to the bins.The council had claimed it couldn’t find a new location for the bins and they would simply be taken away in a bid to curb the fly-tipping – which sparked criticism and fears the problem would only get worse.But Councillor Kevin Cordell, convener of the council’s neighbourhood services committee, has now said there are “no firm plans” to move the bins.He continued: “We are keen that people can dispose of their waste and recycling in their neighbourhood, close to their homes.“But we need to ensure that any community does not suffer the blight of fly-tipping when people leave unsuitable items at the bins.“I share people’s frustration that this is happening in their local area.“I have asked officers to

Drive.“Unfortunately, the incidents of fly-tipping that blighted the previous site have continued with complaints coming in to the department on a frequent basis.“Therefore, with regret, we are recommending the removal of the site.”The council revamped its waste collections earlier this year, leading to the removal of wheelie bins dedicated to collecting glass, with residents instead encouraged to take bottles and jars to communal “bring sites” – which led to an accumulation of glass items at some recycling points.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee in bid to keep hold of mark

My first melodies I learned through my dad were traditional Polish folk tunes.\u0026#8221Miroslaw, who was born in eastern Poland and moved to Dundee in 2007, represented Poland at the Eurovision Song Contest in 1998 and said his siblings also encouraged his passion as they were very musical themselves.\u0026#8220We would spend countless nights jamming along to music together as a family, and sometimes played a few melodies for guests here and there,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220I can recall one night I had to step in for a drummer that did not show up at my dad’s gig, petrified of messing up, though the encouragement from the crowd got me through it.\u0026#8220I was ecstatic at the applause I soon received and the thrill of live music. Still, to this day, I find it hard to believe I was actually able to do it. It was the overwhelming feeling that really appealed me to music.\u0026#8221Music was very connected to his Christian belief, Miroslaw said, and he often played piano or guitar and sung during prayer and worship.\u0026#8220Playing music for me is a very natural way of expressing myself to those around me,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220Music connects me with other people in a very unique way.\u0026#8220I met many friends and started relationships through my music.\u0026#8220I even met my wife, Monika, as a young adolescent in a music boarding school back in the 1990s.\u0026#8220Music is a unique, universal language and can be used as a tool to express our feelings or to put a message across that can influence others in various ways.\u0026#8220It definitely can be very therapeutic. I’ve experienced this when working with my young students with special needs or disability. This helped me to understand a different perspective on teaching and helping others.\u0026#8221Miroslaw, who is also known as MIREK, is one of 14 tutors at the newly-created Dundee Music Acadamy, which this weekend is offering free lessons in guitar, singing, bass, piano, keyboard, sitar, saxophone, flute, accordion and more.\u0026#8220I always wanted to share my music experiences, tips, knowledge, fancy chords, and how I managed to solve my own musical set backs with others,\u0026#8221 Miroslaw said.\u0026#8220I saw myself becoming a teacher the minute I left the music school, and was surrounded by others alike.\u0026#8220My accordion instructor, Mrs Śliwkiewicz-Cisak, set an example of how much a teacher can help and improve the musical experience for someone else.\u0026#8220It’s a treasure to have this kind of teacher who encourages you to become an independent learner and is able to motivate you to keep going in difficult times. She was the main factor that really pulled me into teaching others.\u0026#8220As a teacher or instructor I not only help students to progress in their musicianship or instrumental skills , but also have a huge impact on their personality and help to shape their character. Seeing my own student’s progress and a smile on their face is the biggest reward any teacher can get.\u0026#8221\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5afc0004b7cc0-745x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people nurses across dundee and tayside celebrate international nurses day","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNursing staff across Tayside marked International Nurses Day.

Ross County to secure Fraser Fyvie on a two-year deal.The 25-year-old missed the second half of the season with a serious knee ligament injury.Even so, with his contract up at the end of the month the Staggies had been keen to poach him from Tannadice as they battle to get back up to the Premiership next term.The Tangerines, however, have persuaded the former Aberdeen, Wigan and Hibs man to stay with them.They recognised it was with him anchoring their midfield they played their best football this season and were determined to keep him.“Fraser’s performances and professionalism were clear to me when I became manager and he is an important player for us,” said gaffer Csaba Laszlo.“Him signing is excellent news as we build our squad ahead of the 2018/19 season.”Fyvie himself made it clear his first option was always to stay where he was.“I am delighted to continue my career here at United.“I was enjoying my football last season, and the club has been excellent during my rehab,” he said.“As I continue towards full fitness again, I cannot wait to get back out playing for United.”Fyvie’s stats for last season show why United were so desperate to hang on to him.Fifteen of his 17

Tangerines.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5afe9b8f2158c-e1526636734395-837x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united signing spree set to kick off this weekend","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United are closing in on the first of what could be as many as 17 signings over the summer.Such is the extent of the planned overhaul of the Tangerines squad, they’re set to continue beyond the start of the season in July.So far no clues as to who’s on the wanted list have been forthcoming from Tannadice.But the Tele understands talks with at least two targets are at an advanced stage and deals could be struck over the weekend.Dunfermline pair Fraser Aird and Nicky Clark could be on the verge of joining up.While United have declined to confirm their interest in Clark, the 26-year-old’s proven scoring record at Championship level is something of which they are aware.And despite interest in him from the Premiership – St Mirren have also been linked – a determined effort to get him to Tannadice appears to be ongoing.Ex-Hamilton defender Ziggy Gordon is also on their radar and he could be fixed up soon.With other identified targets, the process could take longer.While the departures of 14 players means replacements are needed, and soon, as much time as is needed to ensure the right quality is obtained for next season will be taken.With the season just over, a number of players and agents are on their summer break and that will delay some business. In other cases, the calibre of those involved means United will battle with other clubs to get them.The fact they are remaining outside of the Premiership for a third season running makes that task harder – but it’s not being seen as an insurmountable one.And the number of players who’ve expressed an interest in hearing what the plans for the new-look squad are has been encouraging.There will be action at Tannadice tonight as Dave Bowman’s annual match to raise cash for skin cancer and dementia charities takes place.It will see a string of other past Tangerines greats turning out in the home ranks.“We’ve got the usual list of suspects and Sean Dillon and Jon Daly will be back in United strips as well,” said Bow.“We’ve even got your columnist in the Tele, big Lee Wilkie, playing. Before he agreed to turn out he did check we have XXXL shorts for him to wear.”The opposition is made up of fans who’ve bid to play against their past heroes. The action kicks off at 6.30pm and entry is free.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united stick by crocked keeper mehmet","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United have offered crocked keeper Deniz Mehmet the chance to stay with them as he battles for fitness next season.The 25-year-old suffered a serious knee problem when he picked up a bizarre injury in the Premiership play-off quarter-final victory over Dunfermline at Tannadice earlier this month.He suffered knee ligament damage as he jumped in delight to celebrate Scott McDonald’s equaliser early in the second half of the second leg that United went on to win 2-1.With the one-year contract he signed when joining up from Falkirk last summer up at the end of the month, that put a question mark over his future with the Tangerines.But manager Csaba Laszlo is sticking by the man he made No 1 late in the season.He has been told a new deal is waiting for him to sign.Even if the former Turkish youth international decides his long-term future lies elsewhere, United will see he is put through his operation and provide the facilities for him to complete his rehab programme.That process is likely to take until the end of the year at least but he did enough in 13 first-team games this season for United to be more than happy to keep him.With the other first-team goalie, Harry Lewis, returning to parent club Southampton at the end of his season-long loan, at least one of the as many as 17 signings made this summer will be an experienced No 1.Meanwhile, the latest discount period for season tickets for the 2018/19 campaign comes to an

goalscoring prowess in his fourth appearance for the top team, netting an important goal at Hamilton in a 2-1 victory.That strike also spelled the end of his season, however, as he was caught on the knee by Accies midfielder Darian MacKinnon, who hurt himself in the process.Curran, meanwhile, was a real stand-out for the U/20s all season as they finished second in the Development League.The

attempt","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAmbitious plans to turn this year’s Westfest into a world record-breaker have been revealed.The city’s biggest outdoor gala day is aiming to beat the current Guinness World Record for the number of people wearing sunglasses in one location – using #SunnyDundee specs.Sizzling plans to put the current record in the shade have been backed by the campaign group.Organisers of Westfest approached the group about the idea of using the yellow sunglasses emblazed with #SunnyDundee.Campaign manager Jennifer Caswell, from Dundee – One City, Many Discoveries, said she would never have thought about making a record-breaking attempt when the campaign started in April.She said an estimated 5,000 #SunnyDundee glasses have already been distributed.Dundonians wearing the glasses have been pictured basking in the sun both at home and abroad, including New York, Singapore and Austria.Westfest, which is expected to welcome more than 10,000 revellers on Sunday June 3, could be the ideal location for the record attempt.Jennifer added: “Westfest organisers approached us about the idea.“Given there are more than 5,000 shades out there, we would certainly encourage revellers who have a pair to bring them along.“The campaign has been incredible so far.“Dundee has really got on board with it, especially taking pictures and uploading them online.“We’ve seen pictures from Austria recently on social media.“Throughout the whole campaign, I would never have envisaged a record-breaking attempt.“I’ve been down to Westfest in previous years and it’s a great atmosphere and a great idea.”A Westfest spokesman said: “All of us are hugely excited by the prospect of attempting to break a record for wearing sunglasses.“We can confirm we are investigating the possibility and are in the process of contacting Guinness World Records to find out the exact world record as it stands as we try to arrange an official attempt.“Westfest has previously basked in sunny weather. It would be a joy to see 5,000 bright yellow sunglasses on the day.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Everything drivers need to know about today s Race for Life road closures","story":"                          GLASGOW will be transformed into a sea of pink today\u0026nbspas the annual Race for Life event gets underway."},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle become Earl and Countess of Dumbarton","story":"                          Prince Harry has been made the Duke of Sussex\u0026nbspon his wedding day by his grandmother the Queen, Buckingham Palace announced."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7812353.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Gers fan s tweet goes viral after he posts picture of Kenyan local in old football shirt","story":"                          A Rangers\u0026nbspfan\u0026nbspwho\u0026nbspposted a picture of a Kenyan local sporting one of his team\u0027s\u0026nbspold\u0026nbsptops\u0026nbsphas seen his tweet go viral.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7812621.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Married life begins for Harry and Meghan after fairytale ceremony","story":"                          Newlyweds\u0026nbspHarry\u0026nbspand Meghan begin their first day as a married couple after tying the knot during an emotional wedding ceremony that captivated the nation."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7813739.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"What do drivers need to know about the MOT change ","story":"                          The way the\u0026nbspMOT\u0026nbspworks in Britain has changed.

But the Courier understands the \u0026pound370,000 art installation, still branded by Highland Council as the Gathering Place, will be divided into two sections positioned on either side of the river. The installation is thought to be a mix of stone and wooden construction.There is great excitement among city councillors who have seen two-dimensional design work, and there is apparent consensus that it is aesthetically pleasing and will easily blend into the local, tranquil environment.The \"pier\" project, proposed for a spot by Eden Court, was aborted two years ago due to the scale of public objections to the design.The location for the new proposal is believed to be nearby, slightly further upriver, at the most shallow point on the edge of the Ness Islands.The council\u0027 Inverness city committee delegated powers of approval to the Inverness city arts working group. Its current chairwoman, councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, said she had closely scrutinised the fresh concept adding that it was \"within budget\".Giving little away, she added: \"I can see it appealing to the local community.
