Here, he tells Sophie Goddard how he’s keeping not only his pub afloat, but is helping out the people – and animals – around him, too ...For thousands of small business owners, the global pandemic has flung their futures – and those of their staff – into uncertainty. That’s certainly true for Graham Blaikie, and his pub the Mercat Grill in Whitecraig, Scotland. “I’d been watching the news about Covid-19 since December and luckily we’d prepared,” he explains. “Even before we closed, we had contactless hand sanitisers and I was always wiping down handles and menus. I’d also removed items from tables, so there weren’t as many touch points.” But when Boris Johnson’s March announcement saw pubs and restaurants close to the public, the business that had taken Blaikie nine years to build was suddenly forced to adapt for survival.The first step was ensuring customers could still enjoy the food they loved. “Prior to the shutdown, we’d been talking about what our strategy would be – I bought containers and had our takeaway menu prepped, so we were ahead of the game”, he says of being ready for business the next day. “We had a lot of fresh food in the pub, so on the Saturday we started the takeaway system.” But it wasn’t without its problems. “It’s not as easy as you think doing takeaway food, especially restaurant-style. When people order with us they’re having haggis cigars, patties, fish and chips, pepper beef with rice and my mum’s desserts ... that’s six different containers at least. We spent about £2,000 on takeaway boxes initially, that’s a lot of money. But it’s hopefully keeping us going.”With the government support package now in place – and extended until October – Blaikie has turned his attention to helping local people. Launching his Soup(er) Hero campaign in April, he is now making soup and sandwiches for those in need. With help from the community council, a community hub – where food is dropped off and distributed by local volunteers – was born. The feedback keeps him going. “There’s an older couple and the wife’s got cancer and every day they get their soup and sandwich,” he says. “They have the soup at 12 o’clock, then the man drives his wife to the hospital for her treatment and when they come back, they enjoy the sandwich. That’s what makes it worthwhile.”It’s not just people benefiting, either – residents of Edinburgh zoo are also tucking into the pub’s surplus wares. “I had a massive box of bananas left over and my mum said: ‘You should take this to the zoo.’ So I got hold of all my leftover fruit and knocked on the zoo door – and that’s been it ever since.” Now Blaikie’s weekly deliveries of fruit, vegetables and fish help to feed the animals at a time when visitors – the zoo’s main form of income – have come to a standstill. “You’d probably choose not to eat some of the bananas, for example, because they don’t look as good, but they’re perfectly fine for the animals. When we’re making sandwiches, not everybody likes the heels of the bread either, so I freeze them and take them along – nothing’s getting wasted. And if I see something for a good price at the wholesalers – apples, cabbages, broccoli - I’ll pick that up, too. We need to keep zoos going, they’re all under a lot of pressure.”While it’s difficult to ascertain when exactly businesses such as Blaikie’s will open again, for now, he is focusing on adapting the way they work to ensure business is possible. “We have an isolated table in the front vestibule area, so people can come in and collect food safely, using contactless on the card machines for takeaways. We have separate areas for drivers to sit in too, so we’re doing everything we can.” And plans are already afoot for when pubs are finally allowed to reopen. “I’m looking at adding an area to the outside, so people can sit there the whole year round and I’m hoping to put in a little microbrewerydistillery, so I could eventually make hand sanitiser further down the line.”Why focus on helping others when keeping his own business afloat requires such effort? “I believe in helping people. I know this virus is a horrible thing, but it’s bringing out a lot of good in people as well. Neighbours are looking after neighbours, people are helping others with shopping or taking dogs for a walk. For so long, I didn’t like the way the world was going ...”What does Blaikie hope will come out of this situation? He pauses, then says: “That people start to work together a bit more, being more thoughtful of what’s going on around them. And of course, that they come to the Mercat for a meal.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

On weekends he would travel into Manhattan to watch shows by the likes of glam-rock veterans the New York Dolls and aspiring punk poet Patti Smith. That summer, he rented an apartment in the West Village and began working as an assistant to a commercial photographer, a job that allowed him to “go out every night and take photographs”.That April, the Ramones released their eponymous debut album, the first signal of the seismic shift in pop culture that was punk. Green was a clued-up music fan with a camera in the right place at exactly the right time. He began shooting in venues like CBGB on the Bowery, where a scene was coalescing around groups such as the Ramones, Television, Blondie and Talking Heads. Green took his photos to the music paper New York Rocker, he says. “The editor, Alan Betrock, gave me my first assignment, which was to photograph this young rockabilly-obsessed singer, Robert Gordon. It all started from there.”It has taken 44 years for Green’s monochrome photographs of New York’s punk and post-punk scene to see the light of day with the publication of When Midnight Comes Around. It is a book filled with familiar faces – Smith, Joey Ramone, Richard Hell, Johnny Thunders – and now legendary and long-gone places such as CBGB, Max’s Kansas City and the Bottom Line. What sets it apart is the sense that Green was both an insider – for a time, he shared an apartment with Sylvain Sylvain of the New York Dolls – and an acute social observer who understood that he was witnessing an important pop-cultural moment driven by outsiders and misfits.His photographs of the soon-to-be-famous are punctuated by portraits of anonymous iniduals who caught his eye with their style or attitude. The result is a democratic portrait of an emerging New York punk scene that looks both distant and timeless.“I thought what I was doing was a kind of social documentary. I had seen Diane Arbus’s work and would later take a class with Lisette Model, who had taught Arbus. I think this accounts for my straight-on approach, but also my desire to shoot people who weren’t famous,” he says. “Also, I was never a fan of live photography. I preferred to turn away from the stage and look at what was going on around me.”The book opens with two scene-setting shots: a pair of bohemian-looking women selling secondhand clothes on a sidewalk in Manhattan’s East Village and a ground-level view of the sleazy porn cinemas that once dotted the streets on Times Square. This is another New York, grittier and edgy, a city close to financial bankruptcy. Its more neglected neighbourhoods, where rents were low and crime rates high, drew artists and musicians attuned to an emerging punk aesthetic that fed off and was energised by the surrounding seediness. “The lower East Side is trendy now, but back then I didn’t go there unless I really had to. Even the little kids there were tough and threatening.”Green’s early photographs from 197677 evoke the ad-hoc atmosphere of what was then a small, evolving downtown scene, just as his later ones reflect the shift towards a more self-consciously stylish milieu as punk mutated into post-punk, the music becoming more arty and angular. Alongside New York scenesters such as Anya Phillips, co-founder of the Mudd Club, Green also snapped a young, dapper Tom Waits, a lonesome-looking Alex Chilton in CBGB, and Lou Reed with Andy Warhol at an early solo show by erstwhile New York Doll David Johansen at the Bottom Line.“People were there in those clubs to be noticed,” he says, “so it was never that difficult to get access. Despite the look of everyone – cool, detached, tough – it was a fairly friendly scene.”It is the unknown faces that most intrigue. Some, like Babette and Katrina, denizens of the Chelsea Hotel, he remembers well: “They were both French and ‘danced’ for a living.” The names of others, he cannot recall. In one photo, taken in what looks like someone’s kitchen, a young Green, looking smart in a crisp white shirt, stands next to Sylvain Sylvain and two members of his post-New York Dolls group, the Criminals. I know it’s him, because Green told me there are no identifying captions in the book.“Given that many of the people who can’t be identified were not famous, it democratises the series by giving everyone the same treatment,” he explains. “I would rather people have too little information than too much. It means the pictures stand up on their own.”For a short time in the early 80s, Green worked as a jobbing music photographer, shooting album covers for Robert Gordon and Link Wray as well as editorials for Rolling Stone, Downbeat and SoHo Weekly News. In 1986, he left the city and attended graduate school a few hours north of the city in an attempt “to really rethink and reinvestigate photography anew”. One of his teachers was Stephen Shore, under whose influence his practice shifted towards landscape and the built environment.Green is now an academic and an established photographer, with three other photobooks and his work bought by several US art institutions. He looks back on his punk photographs with fondness and a degree of melancholy. “So many people in the book have died or grown so much older,” he says. “It was my youth, it was my music, and so much of me is tied up in that work that it was quite a challenge to immerse myself in it.”Yet he claims to only have one regret about that period: “Why the hell didn’t I photograph the really seedy bathroom in CBGB?”• When Midnight Comes Around is published by StanleyBarker."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/559e117af990b96574fcaff70548945ae20f8c70/0_461_3075_1845/master/3075.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a44b0a5b767cdb26b99848923c7b268","title":"great british art quiz pier arts centre orkney","story":"The Pier Arts Centre in Orkney sets today’s quiz – which enables you to explore the art collections of museums closed due to Covid-19 while answering a few brain-teasersThis quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from over 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists.

With expectations of a synchronised global recession of the kind unseen since the Great Depression, the Covid crisis watch will also weigh how the UK is faring compared with other countries.Illustrating how Britain has reached a crossroads in the crisis after more than two months of harsh government restrictions, data combed from iPhone users’ searches on Apple Maps now points to the lockdown fraying at the edges.Although still significantly down from the start of the year, daily trips on Britain’s roads are gradually climbing. Economic activity should recover as more people leave their homes.Surveys of business activity suggest the low point for the UK economy probably came in April, during the first full-month of lockdown, with a slight improvement detected in May.Despite warnings that City investors are ignoring the outlook for jobs and risks to growth, global stock markets have rallied.However, the early results suggest companies are bracing for a protracted recovery as lockdown measures are only gradually lifted and consumer confidence takes time to return. Analysts have also warned the lack of a vaccine and continuing health risks will keep a lid on consumer demand, while a second wave of infections could force harsh new lockdown controls.The flash IHS Markit and Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply purchasing managers index – compiled from surveys of business activity – reveals a steeper pace of economic contraction than at the worst point of the global financial crisis has persisted in May. Firms told surveyors they expected customer demand to take a long time to recover.In a reflection of the scale of the damage and only tentative steps to lift controls, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has played down the chances of a swift bounce back. Pouring cold water on hopes of a V-shaped recovery, Sunak said last week that Britain faces a “severe recession, the likes of which we haven’t seen”.Faced with a lengthy recovery and gradual easing of lockdown after Boris Johnson announced non-essential shops could reopen from the middle of June, business groups have called on ministers to maintain the emergency financial support unveiled in March to smooth Britain’s economic reboot.A third of the British workforce is now receiving government wage subsidies, with more than 8m jobs protected on the Treasury furlough scheme and more than 2 million self-employed people claiming grants for lost profits.However, in the coming days Sunak is expected to unveil steps to scale back the support from August given the spiralling price tag attached to the support schemes. Government borrowing surged by £62bn in April, more than was previously anticipated for the whole of 2020-21.Experts have warned that focusing on the deficit and slashing the support too soon could choke off the economic recovery and trigger more job losses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7716fd94c4bba4816e53829504dedd6ac6f42cde/0_77_1173_704/master/1173.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c792f3e2cfa6be4a6c41e90b3761343","title":"ryanair worst airline for flight cancellation refunds finds which uk customers coronavirus","story":"Ryanair is the worst major airline for refunding British customers whose flights have been cancelled during the coronavirus pandemic, with more than eight out of 10 people still waiting for their money back, according to figures from Which?.Ryanair has been widely accused of confusing customers, with numerous changes to its approach to refunds and vouchers.“Despite initially telling customers it was processing refunds at the beginning of the crisis, customers reported that Ryanair provided refund forms that didn’t work, before attempting to force vouchers on passengers who had specifically requested refunds. It also repeatedly changed the timeframe for receiving a refund, suggesting at one point customers may have to wait up to 12 months for their money back,” Which? said.Correspondence seen by the ’s consumer champions team also reveals how some Ryanair customers are being told that refunds are not possible because of physical distancing and payment systems rules.In one online chat, a Ryanair representative told a customer: “Our claims and refunds team should do the refund procedures but they are working from home from where they are not allowed to process any refunds due to payment security regulations.”In mid-May, the Civil Aviation Authority warned airlines that the law was clear and that they had to offer refunds if requested, rather than offering a voucher or credit note.The CAA said: “Under the law, consumers are entitled to receive a refund for their cancelled flights, despite the challenges the industry is currently facing … it is important that consumers are given a clear option to request a cash refund without unnecessary barriers.”In a statement, Ryanair said it would offer refunds – but customers may have to wait until the coronavirus crisis was over.“The process time for cash refunds is taking longer due to the fact we are having to process 10,000 times the usual volume of cancellations and have fewer staff available due to social distancing measures,” the airline said.Easyjet added: “Customers may request a refund by submitting a claim in writing via a dedicated refund webform, online.

But will he improve the party culture? The appointment of David Evans as Labour’s general secretary represents another win for Keir Starmer. The leader was sticking his neck out when it was briefed to the press that he had a preferred candidate for the post – but the gamble has paid off. Jennie Formby, an ally of Jeremy Corbyn, has been replaced by someone who is heavily praised by activists on the right of the party. The Labour left has been thoroughly defeated, and the end of Corbynism is complete.When it first emerged that the leader’s office had a firm favourite for general secretary and his name was David Evans, most of the members on the left of Labour’s national executive committee – the ruling body that interviews and votes on the applicants – hadn’t heard of him. They were introduced to the former assistant general secretary by journalists who themselves knew him primarily as the author of a 1999 report. This report described local constituency parties as “dysfunctional” and argued for a “radical overhaul” of the party that could “empower modernising forces within the party and marginalise Old Labour”.\u0026nbspAlthough the intention was apparently to weaken the power of MPs and other stakeholders who had a tight grip on local parties but couldn’t be bothered to show up to meetings, the proposals were interpreted at the time by left activists as “elitist”. The context of the leak was that Margaret McDonagh was at the helm as general secretary soon after the report was published, Evans became her assistant. According to the left, she brought in a period during which trade unions were “sidelined” and “often treated with contempt”, as expressed in a briefing that circulated among NEC members last week.Affiliated trade unions on the party’s left were incensed by the news that this man was Starmer’s pick. The\u0026nbspFire Brigades Union general secretary Matt Wrack warned colleagues against Evans, describing him as a “factional figure” and “likely to be extremely isive”. Since his appointment, one local party representative on the NEC has tweeted that Starmer and Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, have “shown their pledge to end factionalism to be a sham”, while other furious reactions have been offered as anonymous comments. “If Evans now takes us back to the toxic culture in HQ, purges of leftwing members and stitch-ups of selections exposed in the leaked report, his appointment will be the worst mistake of Keir’s leadership,” one said.It is worth pointing out that many in the party – across the political spectrum – believe that there is already a toxic culture in HQ, and that parliamentary selections were being stitched up during the Corbyn era too. It is also worth noting that friends of Evans dismiss the portrayal of a Blairite driven by factionalism and anti-union sentiment. They counter that the internal report actually demanded more resources for constituency parties and for members to be empowered. It advocated all-member meetings rather than local committees, for example – a move that would later be championed by the left under Corbyn.Evans is hailed by former colleagues as an excellent organiser who oversaw the campaigns that enabled Labour to beat the BNP in Barking in 2010 and regain control of Croydon council in 2014. They say he was instrumental in efforts that led to Labour’s 2001 general election win. Like Starmer and his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, Evans sees working with local government not as a nice-to-have but as a key way of securing power at a national level. His ability to connect with voters, described by friends such as Barking and Dagenham council leader, Darren Rodwell, will have to manifest itself through party staff and an enthused activist base.Starmer took a risk and did well to get the finely balanced NEC to approve his first preference – the appointment went through by 20 votes to 16, according to well-placed sources. The two GMB representatives provided the votes that swung in Starmer’s favour, making the trade union a key player under the new leadership. The narrow NEC result also offers a stark reminder to the Labour left that it needs to get its house in order, and fast. If Corbynites had put forward a united slate for the recent by-elections, they would have been well placed to win the two members’ representative places, and Evans would probably not be general secretary now.It was a close call, but the new leader now has an ally in control of the party machine as well as a clear personal mandate from members. That means he has no reason not to deliver on his key campaign pledges from the leadership election: unity, professionalism, electability. In a recent Zoom meeting alongside Starmer and Rayner, Evans reportedly expressed his desire to professionalise HQ, and said that the party must get back to winning elections. Was picking Evans over a compromise candidate the right decision? The proof will be in whether party culture improves over the coming years, in its ability to respond well to the findings of the Equality and Human Rights Commission investigation expected shortly, and in electoral tests starting with the 2021 local contests.• Sienna Rodgers is editor of

infection rate too high second wave","story":"Test and tracing is launching today but, as the lockdown eases, it will need to be massively stepped up to have a significant impactWe all now know the basics – the R is the average number of people someone infected with Covid-19 passes the virus on to.\u0026nbspIf it is greater than 1.0 the epidemic will grow exponentially.\u0026nbspIf it is less than 1.0 it will eventually disappear.\u0026nbspThere are several types of R: the R0 that applies to a naive population with no immunity or interventions and the “effective R” or Re (also called Rt) that the politicians are talking about, and that measures how we are doing in controlling the virus.\u0026nbspWe calculate the R in several ways.\u0026nbspWhat it was two to four weeks ago can be back-calculated by the changes in Covid-19 hospitalisations or deaths.\u0026nbspThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) is now doing national swab surveys to estimate the proportion of people who carry the virus and how that changes over time but these take a week or two to process and report.\u0026nbspThus, we cannot be very confident about the precise value of the R day to day, and can be even less confident about regional variations that are inevitably based on less data than the national numbers.The amount of virus each inidual\u0026nbspcarries may be partially responsible for this, but his or her opportunities to contact others – at parties, in the workplace, in restaurants or religious services – is important too.\u0026nbspThus, one man may have infected more than 90 clubgoers in South Korea, and one member of a choir in Washington State may have infected 52 out of 61 fellow chorists at a single rehearsal.Early estimates of R0, the original infection rate, for Covid-19 were in the range of 2.0 to 3.0, but more recent estimates have come in at 4.0 or more.\u0026nbspThis is substantially higher than the usual estimate for influenza of about 1.4 to 2.0.\u0026nbspThe infection rate dropped incrementally with the series of recommendations that started on 12 March, but did not drop precipitously until the full lockdown was announced 11 days later.\u0026nbspThe epidemic grew much faster prior to the lockdown than it has diminished afterwards.\u0026nbspTo decline at the same rate, the R number would now have to be about 0.25 – and no one thinks it has declined to that level.\u0026nbspAs Harvard epidemiology professor Bill Hanage has put it: “A fire burns fast at first but the embers take a long time to die down.”So where does this leave us over the next few months?\u0026nbspWith Re so close to 1.0 there are basically two options.\u0026nbspFirst, we could try to accelerate the decline in the number of infected people – bringing Re down further – so that efficient test, trace and isolate measures combined with the quarantine of new arrivals might give us a chance of suppressing the virus to the point of virtual elimination, as has been done in South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand and perhaps China.\u0026nbspIt became clear from the prime minister’s announcement on 10 May on easing the lockdown that the government has chosen instead to open up the economy when there are still large numbers of infected people who do not know they carry the virus – guaranteeing ongoing infections and the inability to suppress the virus.\u0026nbspAs a consequence, the Covid-19 death rate will stabilise but may not drop much lower, and the threat to older people and those in care homes will remain serious.Even to achieve stabilisation in the context of the “back to work and school” decisions already announced, three key control elements must be put in place.\u0026nbspIndoor gatherings of any sort must remain limited in size to prevent super-spreading events, and those who encounter many people each day, such as shop workers, care workers and bus drivers, should be given protective equipment and be tested regularly.\u0026nbspOn trains and buses, there are obvious implications for how many people can be commuting.\u0026nbspAnd the use of face coverings should be the new normal – including at government press briefingsAnd travel from one part of the country to another should be minimised, so infected travellers do not spark new epidemics in lower-risk regions.\u0026nbspThere are ominous signs that the mixed messages from the government have already led to more gatherings and crowded trains, and, in backing No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings, it has given the green light to long-distance travel.Stabilising the epidemic only buys time to find an effective treatment or vaccine.\u0026nbspPerhaps the warmer temperatures will help, if we responsibly socially distance outdoors while the epidemic rumbles on.\u0026nbspBut when the colder weather pushes us indoors, without a vaccine, and unless contact tracing is stepped up, there will be a second wave: the epidemic will resurge. Not because it had to, but because we did not push the virus closer to extinction, we did not plan properly for the rebound, and thus gave the virus a second lease of life. And all of this will guarantee more Covid-19 deaths in the UK.•\u0026nbspDavid Hunter is the Richard Doll professor of epidemiology and medicine in the Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6df1a6f5a3a517f0a929db86dc949399a311c669/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc73a700d115d2b5487b7768fe601c54","title":"i have made a thing of great beauty and all it took was wire wool and elbow grease","story":"Restoring an old frying pan may not be everyone’s idea of a good time.

From Normal People to Angela Rayner, DIY bangs are the new normalAs our contact with the outside world shrinks to the size of a screen, once-private things have been pushed to the fore.Our bookshelves, formerly unseen by our co-workers, have become pregnant with meaning. Our tired faces, once optimised for the workplace with concealer and a fancy neckline, are beginning to crack after one too many Zoom meetings. For those of us working from home, headshots are the new hemlines.Then there is our hair: our rubbish, 10-week too-long hair that we can’t really improve without breaking the law – or at least a headband (although according to the Freelance Association of Hairdressers, clients are trying, “offering thousands of pounds” for an illicit trim). There has recently been further uproar over Dominic Raab’s plans to not open salons until July.Like so many successful things in 2020, the lockdown fringe began on social media and, also like so many things, was consolidated in Britain by the TV adaptation of Normal People. Connell’s silver chain might have spawned its own social media account and be “comparable to what James Dean did for the simple white T-shirt” (according to its costume designer), but so, too, has Marianne’s evolving fringe, which came with its own story arc – choppy when young, flourishing during her sexual prime, and so on – and now its own Instagram account, @Mariannesbangs, with 5,000 followers and counting. Earlier this month, Vanity Fair even published an essay in homage, called Fringe Watch. Sandra Kelly, the show’s hair designer, describes the online reaction to Marianne’s bangs as “Fringemania”.Still, a sharp, face-framing fringe on Zoom has become yet another impossible beauty standard to add to the list, and one that reflects self-improvement over pandemic restriction. While Bella Hadid cut hers in lockdown to match Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday with surprising deftness, and Anna Wintour seems to have a live-in hairdresser, it appears deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner has chosen not to touch hers in her last television appearance on The Andrew Marr show, she had swept it artfully to one side.If hair has become a talking point of lockdown – and further proof that personal grooming is key to our welfare regardless of what is happening in the outside world (the re-opening of beauty salons in Italy this month allegedly outranked restaurants and shops in demand) – then DIY fringe cuts are a distillation of this new normal. Lengths vary, but the sentiment remains – a good fringe is proof that the wheels of professionalism are working nicely, even if they are coming off.We’re now 10 weeks into lockdown and well past the sweet spot of a recommended trim – “which is absolutely six to eight weeks”, according to Northwood, the man who coined and cultivated The Alexa (Chung) and The Claudia (Winkelman). As for the fringe, “it generally has a four-week shelf life. So if you went into lockdown with one, chances are you will have given yourself one trim already”. Northwood has been guiding clients such as Winkelman into cutting hers at home, using clips, point cutting and texturising scissors, videos of which have been uploaded on to social media. He says most of his work right now is on YouTube.“Cutting your hair now is mostly born out of necessity, and yes definitely a way to feel like you are in control, that you are not losing yourself,” says Rachael Gibson, a hair historian. To many people, the thought of going to a hair salon represents a return to normality after a long, destabilising period – in lieu of this, cutting our hair is as close as we can get.In these screen-focused times, and with mask-wearing soon possibly to be mandatory, could we be on the cusp of a Fringe Index?The pandemic has plunged us into deep uncertainty. The twist, says Northwood, is that people are also after fringes when salons re-open in July. “It seems that cutting your hair is one thing, but focusing on the fringe is more like a mood change, something that marks a new beginning.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5632ab60b5290e7a7822171fd8c17617eeb9eac/0_186_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3900e452c95d5f849d0dc400aba16ff0","title":"intuition review argentina netflix","story":"A laughably maverick detective may or may not be a killer in this pedestrian prequel to 2018 crime thriller PerdidaThe Argentinian thriller Intuition begins where most thrillers end. Renegade detective Francisco Juanez (Joaquín Furriel) is dragging his skeptical colleagues deep into a dark forest where he believes a serial kidnapper of young girls will be. He’s following his, ahem, intuition, despite the recommendations of those around him. Juanez is an almost parody-level embodiment of the type that has propped up the crime genre, the type who burns the rule book, before chucking the ashes out of the window of a fast-moving car while smoldering directly at the camera. But as his fellow cops roll their eyes at his latest antics, he proves them wrong yet again by leading them directly to the bad guy while saving the only surviving captive in a dramatic shootout. But credits don’t roll and instead the film, from writer-director Alejandro Montiel, splinters off into two new cases.This week on Intuition, maverick Juanez leaves one investigation and heads straight into another – this time it’s the murder of a spoilt society girl. He’s working with rookie Manuela “Pipa” Pelari (Luisana Lopilato) who has also been asked by her superior to investigate Juanez over any involvement he might have had in the death of a local youth who killed Juanez’s wife. What’s most surprising about Intuition is that the three cases don’t really have much connective tissue, other than the characters investigating them, making it feel like you’ve just started watching a show mid-season. The film is in fact a prequel to 2018 thriller Perdida, also directed by Montiel.It’s a plodding watch, not uninteresting, exactly, but missing a jolt of energy or something original enough to justify its existence. The character of Juanez is such an unintentionally comic creation that what Montiel might think is mysterious ultimately comes off as silly. He’s styled like a male model mid-shoot, and he breaks just so many rules that he swiftly transforms from handsome rebel to smug bore, doing everyone’s job way better than they could ever manage. The dynamic between him and his younger colleague is both cat and mouse as well as teacher and student, but the sparks don’t really fly despite a committed performance from Lopilato, whose story continues in Perdida.What propels us past the cliches of Intuition is a desire to see just how it all ties together, an assumption that a story as busily plotted as this must have an ace up its sleeve. But the last act is all fizzle, played out predictably with a mundanity that no amount of sweeping aerial shots can disguise. There’s no remarkable reveal to make the previous two hours feel like time well spent, just a shrug of an ending instead. Hardcore crime fans are the prime audience, but they’re already heavily catered to elsewhere by writers with far more ingenuity. This is everything they’ve seen before."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45b3be5649a41ef157503a7947148fce1c240a0a/0_216_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=c7cbcca1cbd24c55b66506c996231af3","title":"screened out review","story":"Parents of locked-down kids might be advised to steer clear of this compulsive look at the smartphone and its ruinous effectsWith this enthusiastic, info-taining documentary Jon Hyatt runs the risk of stating the bleeding obvious by elaborating on facts everyone is already aware of: staring at your phone for too long is bad for your mental health, evidence is growing of the harmful impact of screens on children’s brains, tech companies design apps to exploit our cravings (and give them our data). Hyatt pushes his folksy voiceover too far – “Gee, do I love my phone” – as he goes cold turkey from social media (and cuts his kids’ screen time), but he’s an affable presence.The film is a zippy 71 minutes, featuring interviews with numerous psychologists and mental health experts whose book-filling theories are condensed into 60-second snippets. (Ideal, since we’re told attention s are down from 12 seconds to eight, one less than a goldfish’s.) A lot of the information here feels anecdotal rather than scientific Hyatt repeats the agonising story of the screen-addicted parents in South Korea who were arrested in 2010 after their three-month-old baby starved to death while they raised a virtual child online.Hyatt focuses a chunk of the film on children’s wellbeing. One psychologist frets that boredom and mind-wandering, so important for nurturing creativity, are disappearing from kids’ lives. There’s a visit to a $40,000-a-year school in California popular with Silicon Valley execs, where technology is banned for under-14s and children are instead encouraged to climb trees. Psychologist Jean Twenge, who coined the phrase “iGen” to describe kids born after 1995, has studied the correlation between smartphone use and rising levels of depression, self-harm and suicide among adolescents.

There’s a curious satisfaction in teasing off every last morsel of meat before reaching those sticky fingers out for more. No cut seems so perfectly designed for this express purpose as ribs.2 racks baby back or loin ribs1 tbsp Marmite1 tbsp English mustard2 tbsp tomato ketchup1½ tsp smoked paprika2½ tbsp dark muscovado sugarTry to get loin ribs for this recipe: sure, meaty spare ribs may be bigger, but this way you can serve whole racks, which look way more impressive. They’re also easier to cook to the requisite tenderness and, in my opinion, at least, have a superior flavour too. Note that they’re also occasionally sold by their American name, baby back ribs.You could ask your butcher to do this for you but, failing that, you’ll need to start by removing the membrane that holds the rack together or you’ll be chewing until doomsday. If you’re not sure whether it’s still there, turn the racks over curved side down, with the wider end facing you. If there’s a pale pink, translucent layer over the bones, that’s it.Fortunately, this layer is pretty simple to remove, if not always easy – use a small, sharp knife to peel a little bit of membrane off the smaller end of the rack, and use this as a tab to grip on to, pulling it sharply towards you and holding the rack steady as you do so – it should come away in one clean piece – and discard.Mix the remaining ingredients in a bowl until you have a smooth paste – I find it easiest to beat together the wet ingredients first, because Marmite can be quite thick – then stir in the paprika and sugar. The Marmite gives the ribs a savoury flavour, but if you’re not a fan, don’t worry you could use Bovril or soy sauce for a similar effect, if you prefer.Lay the ribs in a shallow baking dish, then pour or spoon roughly half the marinade on top (you’ll be using the rest later). Rub the sauce into the meat on both sides – I find it easiest to use my hands – then refrigerate for at least an hour, and ideally a bit longer, turning the ribs occasionally and rubbing the marinade into them as the sauce drips off.An hour or so before you want to cook, heat the oven to 160C (140C fan)325Fgas 3 and take the ribs out of the fridge to come to room temperature. Though this is a barbecue classic, the barbecue in question is the American kind, in which meat is cooked for hours at a low temperature – throw raw ribs on a hot British grill, and they’ll be tough as old boots, so it’s worth slow-roasting them first.Cover the dish of ribs tightly with foil and cook for about two and a half hours, basting the ribs once or twice with any marinade that’s run off into the bottom of the pan, until the meat is very tender. Once they’re done, remove the foil and cook for another 15 minutes the racks should be floppy.At this point, if you’re working ahead, you could refrigerate the ribs for a couple of days just remember to get them out to come to room temperature before finishing them off. Heat a barbecue or greased griddle pan to cooking temperature, brush the ribs with the reserved marinade and cook until hot, caramelised and beginning to char.Two other marinade ideas: coat the ribs in a mixture of four tablespoons each of soy sauce, honey, Shaoxing rice wine (or dry sherry) and four teaspoons of Chinese five-spice. Or dress them in a sauce made with a small handful of finely chopped woody herbs, a tablespoon of lightly crushed fennel seeds, a teaspoon of coarse salt and two teaspoons of chilli flakes mixed with four tablespoons of olive oil: if you go down this latter route, brush the ribs with balsamic vinegar before their final grilling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f49fac91bba70afef0d9d457e47dc42aebdb0b90/0_106_3605_2164/master/3605.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9215b2a35dc9cbfa2d70dd8dc25d8a15","title":"one punnet of strawberries 17 fantastic ways to use them from cake to ketchup","story":"There is more to strawberry recipes than just cream and sugar. Try pairing them with tomatoes, avocados, basil or harissa – if you dareIf you are not going to get out there and pick strawberries, the least you can do is eat them. Britain, farmers tell us, is facing a huge strawberry glut, thanks to the cancellation of major events such as Wimbledon (where 33 tonnes of strawberries were eaten last year), along with thousands of weddings and summer parties. As civic duties go, eating loads of strawberries isn’t that taxing, but they won’t sit around waiting for you to come up with new ways to serve them. Here are 17 delicious ideas to help you manage your personal stockpile.Maceration is step number one in a lot of the recipes below. At its simplest, macerating consists of hulling and halving a quantity of strawberries, tossing them in a bowl with a couple of tablespoons of sugar, then leaving them to sit in the fridge for half an hour or longer, but not long enough for them to turn into mush (meaning not overnight). Additions to the basic formula may include juice (orange or lemon), balsamic vinegar or alcohol.A basic strawberry tart, however, requires no maceration. You just make – or otherwise obtain – a shortcrust pastry case, fill it with whipped cream or pastry cream (I have had some success with this fail-safe Youtube tutorial by Thomas Joseph) and sink sliced strawberries into the top in an orderly spiral. You can get very fussy about sizing fruit for a neat look or, alternatively, not bother.Felicity Cloake’s strawberry tart is slightly more sophisticated, in that you have to be the sort of person who has rosewater to hand, but it is no more difficult to produce. It also contains a handy recipe-within-a-recipe, for an incredibly useful no-roll shortcrust pastry: you just press the mixture into the tin with the base of a cup.Yotam Ottolenghi’s strawberry and basil tart has an intriguing combination of strawberries, pistachios and basil-infused pastry cream. It also calls, thankfully, for store-bought puff pastry. Life may not be too short to make your own puff pastry, but the British summer definitely is.Strawberry shortcake is the traditional American way to keep on top of a strawberry glut, but Cloake’s reclaimed British version is excellent. As you will see, strawberry shortcakes are not cakes at all, but inidual assemblages of macerated strawberry, whipped cream and large biscuit. However, it is not uncommon in America to make one large one and slice it like a cake. The ingredients are the same, although the amounts might differ since you will probably want three layers for height. This version has the right proportions.In terms of actual cake, a strawberry and olive oil breakfast cake fits the bill, while Cassie Best’s strawberry and almond cheesecake sponge could be more accurately described as a sponge with “cheesecake blobs” in it.If you are like me, it might take you a while to get your head round the idea of using strawberries in salads, especially salads that sound as if they would be just as good without them. But let us not forget why we are here: to level Britain’s massive strawberry mountain before it collapses and buries us all.Here is what I would suggest: before you commit to a whole salad, try a few bites of the relevant flavour combinations first, to see if they work for you. Some will be delightful from the outset others may be tastes longer in the acquiring. I haven’t yet made Ottolenghi’s strawberry and tomato salad, but I did put a tomato and a strawberry in my mouth at the same time, and I can testify that they have a surprising affinity. Now I just need to convince my family.Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall recommends a strawberry and avocado salad, dressed with parmesan and a simple honey and lemon dressing. Mark Bittman’s strawberry and rocket is another rather startling combination to experiment with, as is Erin Clarke’s spinach and strawberry salad.I am always drawn to ice-cream recipes that don’t require an ice-cream maker, because I don’t own one and I don’t want one. This straightforward freezer recipe from Tom Hunt, chef at Poco in Bristol, has just four ingredients: strawberries, sugar, double cream and mascarpone. Mine didn’t turn out quite as rippled as his, but it disappeared very quickly.Jeremy Lee’s strawberry granita is simplicity itself, and should really be kept that way. As he says, cream is not required, “and the addition of a sprig of mint is absolutely forbidden.”A surplus of ripe strawberries can quickly turn into an embarrassment of overripe strawberries: bruised, soft, leaking. Compotes and preserves are the perfect way to rescue them. Strawberry jam is the most obvious route, and, as always, Felicity Cloake supplies the winnowed-down, optimal version. The major issue with strawberries is their lack of pectin, which causes jam to set. You need to add some, either in the from of other, pectin-rich fruit (lemons, say), or by using jam sugar, which already includes pectin.Strawberry compote is even simpler and keeps in the fridge for about two weeks. If you are looking for something more adventurous, try Ottolenghi’s frankly counter-intuitive strawberry and harissa ketchup, which he recommends as an accompaniment to grilled meats. After the thing with the tomato and the strawberry, I am willing to take his word for it.Strawberries are, for many people, just smoothies waiting to happen, either alone or in combination with numberless other fruits. You can begin with the basic format (strawberry, banana, orange juice) and experiment by adding elements –cranberries, chia seeds, oatmeal – until you realise you have gone too far. Then pull back a little.For something a bit stronger, Tom Hunt’s strawberry daiquiri is a respectable way to use up any final stray strawberries, or any leftover vodka. Hunt recommends macerating the berries in grappa beforehand, but if you don’t have grappa, a little more vodka makes a decent substitute. If you don’t have a proper blender, you can use a hand blender in a tall jug, although you might have to break up the ice a little first. If you haven’t got a jug, just wash out a large vase. You can see I really wanted to make this work. And it did, in the end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c435224a41bbc32a033c66a14ab3079f40bc9bf2/0_90_3945_2367/master/3945.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=364b1d89e86ca037c7f8bba327f1d767","title":"julien faubert to madrid the surreal transfer tale inspiring a tv drama","story":"Yvan Le Mée recalls how his client somehow switched West Ham for the Bernabéu, a move that landed the agent the nickname David CopperfieldThere were only two days of the 2009 January transfer window remaining when Yvan Le Mée answered his phone. At the other end of the line was a representative from Real Madrid inquiring whether it would be possible to take his client Julien Faubert on loan from West Ham for the rest of the season.Le Mée, already a veteran of what is known in Europe as the “mercato” having started as an agent representing Arsenal’s Gaël Clichy, could scarcely believe what he was hearing. Faubert, capped once by France in 2006, was an injury-prone winger who had made only eight appearances for West Ham since joining from Bordeaux in 2007 and was not the type of player who usually attracted the attention of one of Europe’s most famous clubs.“I called a friend in Spain,” says Le Mée, taking up the story of one of the most infamous transfers of all time. “I said: ‘Look, somebody from Real Madrid called me about Faubert. It’s so strange.’ He called the sports director to check and phoned me back. ‘Yvan, it’s true. They want to see you at 7am tomorrow at Heathrow airport.’”Even Faubert could not believe it, having also received a call from a man claiming to represent the Spanish club while on the team bus before a match against Fulham. “I told him I had to prepare for an important game and I had no time for this shit,” he said in an interview with the Athletic in March. “I turned off my phone.”“He thought it was a joke,” adds Le Mée, chuckling at the memory. “But the mercato can be crazy sometimes.”The next morning they arrived at Heathrow to begin negotiations, only to be told the transfer was now in the balance. “Real Madrid wanted to sign Antonio Valencia but Wigan wanted £25m, which is like £80m in today’s market,” Le Mée says. “The second option was Faubert, the manager’s choice. Juande Ramos had been at Tottenham the year before and Julien played two fantastic games against them for West Ham. That was the reason he got this chance – sometimes miracles can happen.”When negotiations with Wigan broke down, Faubert’s dream move was back on. “At that point I started to negotiate with West Ham,” Le Mée says. “At the time it was chief executive Scott Duxbury and sporting director Gianluca Nani who were in charge of transfers and they were very tough negotiators. They wanted a lot of money because it was Real Madrid, even if he wasn’t playing much at the time, but we managed to make the deal. For a few weeks everybody was calling me David Copperfield because they couldn’t believe it had happened.”West Ham eventually received £1.5m for the loan as Madrid also included an option to sign Faubert on a three-year contract, although that never materialised. The Frenchman made only two appearances in Spain, making headlines for missing training after mistakenly thinking he had the day off and being accused of falling asleep on the bench against Villarreal – he later admitted closing his eyes for a split second because he was “bored”.Faubert returned to West Ham and spent three more years there before being released. Le Mée has since represented Mario Lemina and Sofiane Boufal in their moves to Southampton, negotiated Ferland Mendy’s £43m transfer from Lyon to Real Madrid in 2019 and is working on a television series called Mercato inspired by his experiences of transfers such as Faubert’s.With input from the former Marseille president Jean-Michel Roussier, the journalist Messaoud Benterki and Romain Alessandrini – a former teammate of Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s at LA Galaxy – the fictional series focuses on the life of an agent, Vincent Berman, and his efforts to help his client, the Argentina forward Ruben Maltelli, win the Ballon d’Or by getting him a €300m move from Juventus.“The main story is about a young agent who becomes the biggest in the world,” Le Mée says. “The idea was to mix all the operators in the market to give it authenticity. It’s not autobiographical but more or less it’s based on my life.”Starring the Italian actor Salvatore Esposito, who played Genny in the crime series Gomorra, three series comprising 10 episodes have been written and Le Mée is negotiating with several broadcasters over the rights to begin shooting.“Salvatore is a big football fan and I wanted someone who knows how to speak and behave like an agent. It’s a crazy adrenaline-filled industry and I want people to see what the reality is like. We are also planning to have guest stars playing themselves. For example, when the agents go to Juventus to discuss a transfer maybe the president is Andrea Agnelli or the sporting director is Fabio Paratici?“I know a lot of people in football and hopefully it will not be difficult to convince real players, agents and sporting directors to make an appearance. Everyone wants to be in the movies after all.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1879b4454f5210f3eef425c6559f609a6fa3cb4d/623_334_3813_2289/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fcdbbb0784f5e9f3fd1f9f8e538e189","title":"liverpool among clubs argue against paying 330m rebate broadcasters premier league","story":"A group of clubs, led by Liverpool, will argue against paying a £330m rebate to Sky and other broadcasters at a meeting to discuss the matter on Thursday, despite the Premier League’s recommendation that it should be accepted.The finance directors of all 20 clubs were informed on Wednesday of the sum by the Premier League, whose head of broadcasting, Paul Molnar, is leading negotiations. Sky is the prime broadcaster with rights to show 128 live matches a season, followed by BT Sport with 52, and Amazon with 20.Liverpool’s chairman, Tom Werner, questioned the rebate at a previous conference with the Premier League executive and he will do so again when the meeting commences on Thursday at 11am, with growing dismay at the size of sums involved.A rebate is being sought because of contractual obligations going unfulfilled following the suspension of football in England in mid-March. The broadcasters also argue that given the remainder of the season will be behind closed doors should it, as hoped, be played out next month, the value of the product they have paid many millions for will be devalued.Liverpool, along with a number of other clubs – Tottenham and West Ham among them – dispute this idea. They believe fans not being able to attend games will increase the premium on live televised matches, with interest in any game shown heightened by the paucity of other live sports. The temporary lifting of the 3pm blackout on matches in the UK means the broadcasters will be able to show more live and clubs believe the value of their investment will increase.As things stand, Sky and BT have rights to 47 remaining games – the other 45 will be shared, with Sky wanting to broadcast 32, BT Sport wanting to show eight and the remaining five being split between Amazon and the BBC.The desire of broadcasters to leverage dressing-room and technical-area cameras will also receive pushback from the clubs, with the stance being that if agreed now it will be difficult to deny similar access when the next rights sales occur.Despite opposition from some clubs to paying the £330m rebate, David Kogan, who was the Premier League’s chief media rights adviser from 1998 to 2015 and a key architect of its global financial success, insists the full amount will have to be met. He told the : “The clubs are going to have to pay it whatever it is and there will be a formula that will be followed. Sooner or later they’re just going to have to pay the money out. They’ll have insurance, I imagine, to do that.”Clubs will already be more concerned, Kogan believes, over whether or not the next round of TV rights, due to be negotiated this year, will match the £9bn generated for the three-year period up until 2022 given the fallout from the current crisis. “What is the Premier League’s capacity to earn another £9bn-£10bn over a three-year period?” he said.“If the Premier League isn’t going to bring in that money, where is the flexibility to find new cash? Ticket sales? Clubs are already costing their fans a fortune. Hospitality? It’s already been priced to the max. So the only way that clubs can then survive is by looking at costs. And the massive costs are agents’ fees and players, and at that point you’re affecting the product.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/688a24442c9411d1157ed5812bf5f82f1c85eaff/0_1406_5091_3055/master/5091.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b95f961cda39f5cd603009936a69dff","title":"denmark returns fans virtual stand zoom agf aarhus randers","story":"Fans will be visible on pitchside screens as AGF try to make the best of playing a vital derby game behind closed doorsOn Thursday night, Denmark will become the second country in mainland Europe to restart their league season after neighbouring Germany. In the opening fixture AGF Aarhus welcome local rivals Randers but it is on the sidelines where history will really be made. In front of one stand a giant screen, 40 metres long and 3m high, will be filled with fans watching via video link.Supporters have signed up for free tickets to take part and can even choose their preferred section of the “virtual stand”. Two smaller screens will allow for neutrals and away fans to be there, too. The concept, created in partnership with Zoom, has taken weeks of preparation. “I’ve never been so busy before a game, which is funny when there are no spectators,” says AGF’s head of media, Soren Carlsen. “My colleagues, to put it bluntly, have been working their arses off to get everything working.”The screens are the final piece of the puzzle, dropped into place on Wednesday at Ceres Park. The fans will form a digital backdrop for watching TV viewers, but sound has proved a stumbling block. “Imagine a big Zoom meeting, 10,000 people with their microphone on, it would just be white noise,” Carlsen says.On Thursday night, fans in different sections will be encouraged to sing in unison. “We’re trying to create an atmosphere around the game. Players will be able to see the supporters and we hope they will be able to hear them chanting. They think it’s great that we’re trying something new.”Last weekend a warm-up game was used as a test event with 50 fans invited to watch. Although the initiative has grabbed global attention, local supporters are still at its heart. The system allows season-ticket holders to head for their usual section and catch up with neighbouring fans. “When fans log in, they’ll see some faces they recognise,” Carlsen says. “Fans they normally see at the game, who they haven’t seen for three months.“When you go to football, it’s a community experience. That is lacking right now because of coronavirus. This is a chance for people to get together.”Life under lockdown inspired the idea, with Carlsen and his colleagues keeping in touch with furloughed colleagues via Zoom. “We thought: ‘Could we use this technology in stadiums?’” The club have had enquiries from all over Europe about replicating the idea and Carlsen can see potential for it to feature across a number of different sports. The derby could become a historic starting point but for the club it already carries huge significance. Aarhus were third in the table and in the cup semi-finals when the shutters came down. Victory would seal AGF’s place in the championship play-offs – another reason to get fans involved.“This is a very important game,” Carlsen says. “It’s hard for footballers to play without fans. How can we make sure that in an empty stadium the team remembers they are playing for a whole city?”A team of more than 20 will try to make sure the game goes off without a hitch, including moderators who will tackle any fans causing offence.AGF are not the only Danish club to try something different – the league leaders, Midtjylland, will set up big screens outside their stadium for fans to watch their first game back on Monday. AGF will be at home again on that day, against Odense.Will the “virtual stand” still be in place? “We will see how it works tomorrow,” says Carlsen. “Is it fun for people? Is it a good experience? If so, then why not?”The long-term goal is to have fans back in the ground and there are still faint hopes that small crowds could return before the end of the season.The club has a history of blazing a trail – they played in the first European Cup – and Carlsen already has one eye on his next big idea. “We could have 1,000 fans, picked in a lottery and safely distanced. What an exciting day that would be. I would rather have 10 fans here than an empty stadium. It makes the world of difference.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25273b6341cfb9e538ae6f0d6ee78737016b41ec/0_344_5120_3073/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23053d736e73513a3a09d40fe490c6ba","title":"walk this way how to optimise your stride and focus your mind to get the most from your daily stroll","story":"Lockdown has reminded us of the pleasures of walking. But making small changes can boost its benefits to our health, mood and creativity, tooAs a form of physical activity, it is easy to dismiss walking as, well, pedestrian. But now its benefits, both physical and mental, are being appreciated once again. Under lockdown, daily walks became sacred. Now they are the safest way to commute, and, for those stuck at home, there is little place else to go other than to wander the streets, forests, towpaths, cemeteries and eerily deserted business quarters.We have become nosy tourists in our own neighbourhoods. We seek out less-travelled backwaters, eyeing curiously the fragments of human and animal lives that we pass, gazing on seasonal changes like besotted new parents. But are we walking to the best of our abilities? Possibly not. Sports scientist Joanna Hall has dedicated her career to coaching people in how to walk the way their bodies were designed to, which no longer comes easily in this sedentary, screen-based era.“I approach this as you would do if you wanted to get better at tennis,” she says. She developed her Walk Active programme to enable people to ease their aches and pains as they exercise, rather than exacerbate them. Lifestyle, ageing and injuries mean that when we put one foot in front of the other, the way we use our muscles may be, she says, “suboptimal for improving our posture, or reducing joint strain and getting the most out of walking”.According to Hall, there are four common aspects we get wrong, and each has knock-on effects on the body. Firstly, instead of propelling ourselves forwards by pushing off with the back foot, like an ice-skater, we try to use our stepping foot to power us along. This is because sitting down too much has made our hip flexor muscles short and tight. Hall describes the necessary adjustment as the subtle difference between stepping into a space (wrong) and pushing off from a space, which will recruit the right muscles up the backs of your legs. “You use your glutes and you open up the core,” says Hall.The second problem is what Hall calls a passive foot strike. The movement provided by the joints in our feet offers suspension and balance but we often plod along flatly instead, leaving us compromised. “That’s what causes knee discomfort,” says Hall. “It can create slight misalignment of the back, stiffness of the shoulders.”The third thing to watch out for is letting your head hang forwards. Screens, reading and desk work have made this the default position, which is a bit of a disaster. “When the head is slightly forward,” says Hall, “the muscles of the upper back and the shoulders have to contract to hold it there. The shoulders come forward and can stiffen. Back mobility becomes restricted and you will not be able to rotate your spine from the hips.” Try lifting your head before looking over your shoulder and you may discover, as I did, that you can turn your head much further all of a sudden.Finally, our arms tend to hang awkwardly or we force them into tense, power-walk movements, when what they want is to dangle freely. If you get steps one to three right, this should happen naturally. Hall has devised various drills to help correct these bad habits, such as measuring with your hand the gap between your bottom rib and your hip, and between your collarbone and your earlobe, and then adjusting your posture to lengthen those gaps. Walking with her tips in mind has made me feel lighter more gazelle than galumph.Now that lockdown rules have eased, we can get some desperately needed time with friends or family members. Yes, not being allowed to hug is painful, but physically distanced walking together is the next best thing. This is because when two people walk together, they unconsciously fall into step. As a 2012 study by US and Japanese researchers found, when people move in sync together, their neural activity synchronises too. The more in sync we are, the deeper our social connection, so walking in step is pretty much a physically distanced hug.Walking has long been hailed as an aid to creativity, too, by big thinkers from Aristotle to Wordsworth to Stanford University behavioural scientist Marily Ann Oppezzo. In 2018, Oppezzo and her colleagues, who study creativity, published research that set out to demonstrate this lightbulb effect. Participants who brainstormed while walking thought of significantly more valid ideas than those who tried to do the same while sitting.So if you have to attend a (socially-distanced) brainstorming meeting, says Oppezzo, “go think about ideas beforehand while walking.” Brainstorming in groups, she says, is far less productive.If you need to maximise the potential of a creative walk – perhaps you are finally starting that novel while quarantining – she suggests picking a problem or topic beforehand and thinking about potential new perspectives on it while you walk. Rather than taking a “deep e”, she says, walking is great for taking a stroll around a subject, seeing it from different sides and coming up with new ideas.She recommends travelling at a comfortable pace, so your physical exertion needs minimal attention, and coming up with as many ideas as you can, rather than trying to lock on to the first one you have. And if the ideas aren’t flowing, don’t force it. Come back to it another time.Crucially, in the study, she had participants record their ideas, rather than write them down, “because the idea of writing something down is already a filter – is this good enough to write down? You can put your headphones on and record through your phone.” And if you are feeling self-conscious, the headphones allow you to pretend to passers-by that you’re having a phone conversation.As well as percolating the cerebral juices, there are powerful mental-health benefits to be gained from walking. Half an hour of walking per day has been found to be as helpful as more intense 20-minute workouts in treating depression. Hugh O’Donovan, a psychologist based in Cork, wrote about the beneficial effects in his 2015 book Mindful Walking: Walk Your Way to Mental and Physical Well-Being. Walking provides what he calls “natural meds”, and there are no rules. Do you want to walk alone or with others? Do you listen to music or the outside world? Right now, enjoying the variety of options is key. “You have different locations and different routes,” says O’Donovan. “You can pick up the pace when you like, or you can slow down and be a bit more mindful. It doesn’t really matter. It’s just the fact that you’re doing it.”To reinforce the positive effects, he suggests “experimenting with noticing how you’re feeling. Is it lifting my mood? Am I meeting people and socialising a little?” However you prefer to walk, he invites you to “come to your senses. This is profoundly important because much of the time we’re on autopilot. We’re unconscious, unaware of what’s going on around us. There’s magic all around us all the time but we’re too busy.” Coronavirus has slowed life down, perhaps making it a little easier to pay attention. “What are you seeing, smelling, tasting?” he asks. “The world looks like a completely different place when you bring this quality of curiosity to everything you do. People underestimate its value.”While walking helps oil the cogs of the mind, and can help you get perspective if you’re struggling with something seismic such as grief, a job loss or the uncertainty of life under Covid-19, it pays to be aware of the risks of rumination. Namely, says O’Donovan, “the error and bias that’s associated with thinking, which lead us down a slippery slope into catastrophising and predicting the future negatively.” How can you avoid repeating the unhelpful and yet perfectly natural response, “why me?” or “why this?” Ask instead, says O’Donovan, “what now?” Walking can help with this. “The world opens up in a different way when we lift our mood, when we don’t fall into the hole.“Your best chance to stay in contention, as I call it, is to be mindful about what’s going on in the world,” he continues. “It might seem like it’s very dark at the moment, but there’s lots of good stuff going on too. Focus on what kind of a story you choose to tell. And, by getting out, moving and keeping your energy up, you have the possibility of telling a more positive story.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3305b6524f9cbb7232423dd361344b478390872/0_0_4240_2545/master/4240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f51c3e44df093e26fa6cc9117d22aeb","title":"bbc switches emily maitlis in newsnight episode over cummings remarks","story":"Katie Razzall stepped in after BBC reprimanded host over ‘breach of impartiality rules’Emily Maitlis was replaced as host of Wednesday night’s episode of Newsnight by another member of the programme’s team after BBC bosses reprimanded her over a monologue in which she attacked the government’s handling of Dominic Cummings’ lockdown trip to Durham.News bosses at the corporation said the BBC2 programme’s lead presenter breached impartiality rules with her opening remarks on Tuesday night. She had been due to host the show on Wednesday night, but the Newsnight reporter Katie Razzall presented it instead.Maitlis later tweeted she had “asked for the night off”.Amid growing criticism of the reprimand, Newsnight’s editor, Esme Wren, wrote on Twitter that Maitlis “hasn’t been replaced tonight in response to the BBC statement”.In the monologue Maitlis told viewers: “Dominic Cummings broke the rules – the country can see that and it’s shocked the government cannot.“The longer ministers and the prime minister insist he worked within them, the more likely the angry response to the scandal is likely to be … He made those who struggled to keep to the rules feel like fools, and has allowed many more to assume they can flout them.”Talking of Johnson’s “blind loyalty” in the face of plummeting poll ratings, she expressed bafflement: “The prime minister knows all this and has chosen to ignore it.”Maitlis finished the programme by telling viewers: “I’ll be back tomorrow.” Clips of the sequence went viral on social media, attracting millions of views – many more than tune in to Newsnight on a typical evening. However, it caused fury among both Conservative politicians who have largely parked their longstanding criticism of the BBC during the pandemic, and also some journalists in and outside the public broadcaster who felt it went against the corporation’s approach to journalism.BBC news bosses agreed with the criticism of its own show, swiftly issuing a statement distancing themselves from the monologue. BBC sources said Newsnight’s editor, Esme Wren, worked on Tuesday night’s episode.“The BBC must uphold the highest standards of due impartiality in its news output,” the corporation said in a statement. “We’ve reviewed the entirety of last night’s Newsnight, including the opening section, and while we believe the programme contained fair, reasonable and rigorous journalism, we feel that we should have done more to make clear the introduction was a summary of the questions we would examine, with all the accompanying evidence, in the rest of the programme.“As it was, we believe the introduction we broadcast did not meet our standards of due impartiality. Our staff have been reminded of the guidelines.”Keith Brown, SNP deputy leader, said:\u0026nbsp“This statement is a gutless capitulation by BBC bosses.\u0026nbspNewsnight should be commended - not slapped down - for\u0026nbsptheir serious investigative work on Cummings, that’s not something you could say about\u0026nbspthe BBC News at 10.\u0026nbsp“Pandering to\u0026nbsp10 Downing Street\u0026nbspby curbing journalists from being able to hold the UK government to account is of serious concern.”\u0026nbspAn SNP spokesperson added: “It’s ironic that the only apology over the whole Dominic Cummings lockdown breaches scandal comes from the BBC.”\u0026nbspMaitlis’s profile, already high, has risen further since she was made lead presenter of the nightly current affairs show last year, shortly after publishing her book Airhead on life as a television presenter. She received global acclaim after confronting Prince Andrew about his connections with the deceased paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. In April she had a viral hit with another monologue of hers which dismissing the idea that coronavirus is a “great leveller” given its disproportionate impact on poorer people .The BBC has faced heavy criticism over the issue of maintaining impartiality in its news coverage, particularly over its handling of complaints about comments that BBC Breakfast’s presenter Naga Munchetty made about Donald Trump. It also struggled to deal with the enormous levels of criticism from both Labour and the Conservatives during the 2019 general election."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd3e04672a60a15ae1d481c288c430b99187ceec/70_21_5290_3174/master/5290.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d261943548794e5cf6f40a8cc814bf1","title":"local radio regional stations england bauer rebranding national network","story":"Bauer rebranding will scrap regional identities and replace them with national network Dozens of towns and cities across England will lose their own distinctive local radio stations later this year, after the commercial group Bauer announced plans to fold almost 50 regional outlets into a national radio network.Stations such as York’s Minster FM and the West Midlands’ Signal 107 will lose their identities and be rebranded under the Greatest Hits Radio name from September.Rather than producing their own shows, the stations will largely carry syndicated programmes made in London featuring national presenters playing classic pop music.The stations will still be obliged to broadcast some regional content in order to meet the requirements of their licences. However, this quota will be fulfilled by producing a small number of a regionally produced programmes covering large areas such as the whole of the nort-west of England, rather than on a local station-by-station basis.Bauer would not comment on the number of jobs that would be affected by the decision, although the industry news site Radio Today estimated about 160 of the 200 on-air presenters across the stations were facing redundancy, without taking into account off-air support staff and producers.The current state of the media industry means it could be difficult for staff to find jobs elsewhere, with many of the affected stations located in mid-sized settlements where there are no other stations.Local journalist and travel reporter roles on the stations are likely to be largely unaffected by the decision, with the national programmes cutting away to offer local news bulletins. This is in line with the industry belief that local news updates are what is really valued by listeners, rather than knowing that a presenter on a music station lives near them and can talk about local events in between songs.Bauer said the decision would provide the “optimum mix of local content that listeners highly value alongside content from nationally known presenters, while also providing significant scale for advertisers”.The industry-wide move towards consolidating local stations into de facto national outlets has been under way for years, with the move exacerbated as Britons increasingly listen to the radio via DAB radio and smart speakers such as Amazon’s Echo rather than FM radio.The consolidation approach was pioneered by Bauer’s rival Global, which turned Capital and Heart into national brands by buying up regional stations and slowly reducing the amount of local content.Combining stations into national outlets has generally been a success when it comes to boosting listenership, although it usually comes at the expense of hearing regional accents on air and substantially reduces the number of media jobs outside London.The shadow culture minister, Chris Matheson, raised concerns about the decision. He said: “This kind of erosion of local independent broadcasting, with stations\u0026nbspassimilated into larger groups, means they lose\u0026nbsptheir distinctive and important voice.“We are still waiting for the government to confirm what support will be provided as advertising revenues plummet across the industry. Without it, more independent stations will fall away and communities will lose out.”Most of the stations affected by Wednesday’s announcement were bought by Bauer last year and were often founded in the commercial radio boom years of the 80s and 90s.The company said a small number of stations with particularly strong local followings – such as Cornwall’s Pirate FM and Lincolnshire’s Lincs FM – will keep their existing line-ups.Other outlets such as Bradford’s Pulse 1\u0026nbspand Swansea’s The Wave will be allowed to keep their branding and local breakfast shows before becoming part of Hits Radio for the rest of the day.BBC local radio stations are seizing on this consolidation in the commercial radio market to reposition themselves around personality-led local programmes, with the corporation’s 40 local outlets across England increasingly presenters from former commercial rivals.Bauer-owned stations rebranding as Greatest\u0026nbspHits\u0026nbspRadioThe Beach (Great Yarmouth \u0026amp Lowestoft)The Breeze (Alton, Petersfield, Haslemere \u0026amp Bordon)The Breeze (Andover)The Breeze (Basingstoke)The Breeze (Bath)The Breeze (Bridgwater \u0026amp West Somerset)The Breeze (Bristol)The Breeze (Cheltenham)The Breeze (Newbury)The Breeze (Reading)The Breeze (Shaftesbury)The Breeze (Torbay)The Breeze (Warminster)The Breeze (Weston super Mare)The Breeze (Yeovil)Compass FM (Grimsby)Dearne FM (Barnsley)Dream 100 (Tendring)Eagle Radio (Guildford)KLFM (Kings Lynn)Minster FM (Northallerton)Minster FM (York)Mix 96 (Aylesbury)North Norfolk Radio (North Norfolk)Peak FM (Chesterfield)Pulse 2 (Bradford \u0026amp Huddersfield)Radio Norwich (Norwich)Ridings FM (Wakefield)Rother FM (Rotherham)Rutland Radio (Rutland)Sam FM (Swindon)Signal 107 (Kidderminster)Signal 107 (Shrewsbury \u0026amp Oswestry)Signal 107 (Telford)Signal 107 (Wolverhampton)Signal 2 (Stoke-on-Trent)Spire FM (Salisbury)Spirit FM (Chichester)Stray FM (Harrogate)Swansea Sound (Swansea)Tower FM (Bolton \u0026amp Bury)Trax FM (Bassetlaw)Trax FM (Doncaster)Wave 96.5 (Blackpool)Wessex FM (Weymouth)Wire FM (Warrington)Wish FM (Wigan)Yorkshire Coast Radio (Bridlington)Yorkshire Coast Radio (Scarborough)Bauer-owned stations retaining their name and own breakfast shows but broadcasting Hits Radio during the rest of the day:Pulse 1 (Bradford \u0026amp Huddersfield)Signal 1 (Stoke-on-Trent)96.4 The Wave (Swansea)Fire Radio (Bournemouth)Bauer-owned stations remaining as standalone outlets:Lincs FM (Lincolnshire)Pirate FM (Cornwall)Sam FM (Bristol)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d999d78c367891690c375cd67573f8726a9916e/33_122_2455_1474/master/2455.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b811ae0839abcedc3ff8d13874c11bc7","title":"anywhere but westminster online covid 19 uk","story":"In lockdown, our series is using footage sent in from around the UK to tell the story of the world outside the political bubbleThe day after the 2019 general election we were on an early-morning train from Stoke-on-Trent to London, feeling as if a long and messy chapter of recent British history had at last come to some kind of full stop. Brexit was a certainty, the Conservatives had won a big parliamentary majority, and the Labour party was more estranged than ever from its old heartlands. Having covered a country in mounting political ferment since 2010, we thought we could at least put Anywhere but Westminster on pause.But in March, everything changed once again. As the Covid-19 crisis reached the decisive point of lockdown, we decided the series had to be reawakened. But if we were as subject to the new restrictions as anyone else, and just as scared of the virus, how could we do it?The answer has defined our experience of the past two months. Instead of travelling to places, we have issued call-outs for information about what people are living through, and footage of their lives, usually shot on their phones. In addition, often using contacts we have acquired over the past 10 years, we have approached old and new sources, and asked them to participate. A mountain of video has arrived, which we and our team have spent long days and nights combining with our own material and turning into finished films. The result, by a mixture of accident and design, has been an ongoing series of videos that tells the story of this crisis from the core of people’s actual experience.We’ve chronicled the lives of a 26-year-old man whose arthritis medication suppresses his immune system, meaning he has to live in complete isolation, and an intensive care nurse who facilitates people saying their last goodbyes via Zoom. We’ve spoken to families whose experience of lockdown is light years away from any “bake cakes and learn Spanish” cliches, and people who have spoken movingly about losing loved ones. Crucially, we have also gone out of our way to explore how communities have come together, and provided new kinds of support to friends and neighbours.Unintentionally, it feels like what we’re doing is true to most people’s experience of the crisis – and, in particular, the mixture of an often lonely world suddenly mediated via the internet, and an unexpected sense of common purpose and togetherness. It sometimes feels as if encouraging people to document their own experiences is sparking a change in the way we feel about our journalism, and presenting us with a new challenge we will have to face when the crisis recedes: how to push even further beyond the standard approaches of the media, and give an even more authentic sense of where the country is going.For now, one thing seems particularly clear. The convulsive political events of the past 10 years were at least partly about rising inequality and insecurity, and people’s sense that power was too distant. Covid-19 has highlighted those things to the point that they are even more inescapable than before – which, for us, means that the work has to go on.Stay at home, keep your distance from people and don’t mix with anyone outside of your circle: the rules of lockdown are almost the polar opposite of the rules of Anywhere but Westminster.Our process has been to get out there to places the media doesn’t normally visit, get close to people, and talk to those outside our bubble. Seeing a political media that was too socially distant, we wanted to counteract it with a kind of journalistic gap-closing.Through the ruptures of Corbynism, Brexit, and the rise of populism, the idea that there was a gap between the way politics was presented in the news and lived in the world became accepted, and even a cliche. After 10 years, I sometimes felt like one of an ageing pair of small-time bank robbers, always coming back for one last job.But coronavirus and the resulting lockdown brought us new purpose – or a new version of our old purpose. Once again, the news was dominated by images from government briefings from Westminster and political journalists trying to hold them to account – this time over Zoom. There was also a blizzard of figures: infection rates, deaths, jobs lost, workers in furlough. We wanted to give more space to ordinary people to speak – putting human stories to those numbers and policies, but also capturing the ways in which communities were coming together to help each other.Same old problem, then: the difference is that we are working from our bedrooms and putting the films together using footage sent to us by people around Britain. Like everything else about this moment, it’s been a journey of discovery, with highs and lows. I will not miss wrestling with hundreds of clips shot in different formats, sent to me along with a constant stream of messages, questions, and pinging alerts. But I have also found moments of emotion in the footage that it would be hard to match in anything I shot myself.A paradox has become clear: while the issues we cover have always been bottom-up, the process of making a film that has a narrative viewers will watch and engage with is a very top-down process, requiring lots of control in the hands of the person filming and editing. Normally we videographers film with great attention to detail, trying to get each shot just right, and capturing every aspect of a scene in sequences of shots. Now I’m in collaboration with people who don’t even hold the camera the right way round (hint: it’s not vertical). But what they lack in technical skills they have made up for in authenticity.So, in many ways, this has been a process of letting go – of the old standards that we thought were so important, and of the visual “grammar” we have taken for granted. Instead we have found value in a new kind of intimacy and sincerity that comes from people having filmed their own stories, and the greater sense of control they have in the process. And we have tried to lay open the process to the viewers. In some ways this version of Anywhere but Westminster is the most true to its original vision. Hopefully it will open up new ways of thinking about how we do our video journalism and share power with the people we report on, and at the same time encourage people to see the power in capturing and documenting these times in video for themselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e60efe287d1477c1d28411ae3f6dc099a6841771/83_0_3405_2043/master/3405.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f18b0acf514602c15e6b0036683204a","title":"what are your experiences of debt during the coronavirus pandemic","story":"We’d like to hear from people about how they are managing existing debts during the coronavirus pandemicSince the lockdown thousands of people have found themselves grappling with significantly reduced finances.

The issuing agent was Travel Trolley. Like thousands of others, we have been impacted by the coronavirus travel ban when my flights were cancelled. Travel Trolley has offered a credit note for the full amount and when I requested a refund it demanded a £75 admin fee to pass on the money already repaid by the airline! It can’t be legal to hold me to ransom like this.SB, LondonOther readers have written in with the same complaint. Travel Trolley, owned by multi-millionaire tycoon Kuljinder Bahia has insisted all passengers pay £75 if they want a cash refund rather than a credit note, despite the fact that its terms and conditions only mention the charge if a passenger, rather than the airline, cancels a flight. Skyscanner has publicly condemned the policy. “We’ve been supporting travellers who contact us and have been working closely with providers to try and ensure that any admin fees for refunds are reasonable,” it says. “We’ve seen success in some partners changing their policies as a result, and will continue discussions with providers to ensure travellers are being treated fairly. We’re asking Travel Trolley to treat cases from Skyscanner referrals as priority.”Travel Trolley failed to respond to requests for a comment. The trade association, ABTA, of which Travel Trolley is a member, says: “Travel agents may charge an admin fee to cover the cost of the work they have done in relation to a cancelled booking. However, these fees must be reasonable and clearly set out in their terms and conditions. If they have not reserved the right to do so, they should not charge a fee.”It referred the company to its legal team after the Observer alerted it. A notice has since appeared on Travel Trolley’s website announcing that it will cancel its fee and refund customers who have already paid it. “Whilst this is of significant financial loss to our business, our customers are of paramount importance to us,” it says. “As customers are facing huge financial difficulties, we hope that removing the fee will go in some way to ease their personal burdens.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a8965695d924a224e918a2ddc98b713cffc8daf/0_140_2416_1449/master/2416.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce4d69a4871b8a447fd00dc111e93540","title":"the 100 greatest uk no 1s no 7 the human league dont you want me","story":"Phil Oakey might have hated it, but his hook-laden hit about sexual power politics brought synth-pop in from the cold Sometimes you can’t quite trust artists to tell the truth about their best work. Speaking to Smash Hits around the time of Don’t You Want Me’s release and subsequent rise to the top of the charts in 1981, Human League singer Phil Oakey enthused: “It’s the best song I’ve ever written. It’s a proper song like the kind that Earth, Wind and Fire or Abba would write.” Producer Martin Rushent claimed that Oakey actually hated the eventual hit so much that he tried to stop it being released. Whatever the truth of the matter, Oakey’s public pronouncements were correct – this is aspirational music that chimed with the times yet had none of the ruthless, cynical avarice of the decade, and pop, to come.Don’t You Want Me was to crown the breakout year for electronic pop music – Soft Cell had hit the top of the charts in the same year as the Human League, but Tainted Love had the sneaky advantage of being a cover. Depeche Mode were bubbling up in Basildon, OMD had released the arch yet sumptuous Architecture and Morality, but with 2m record sales, the 1981 Christmas No 1 under its belt, and a US No 1 to boot, Don’t You Want Me is arguably the first synth-pop smash hit.Yet it was one that nearly never happened, even without Oakey’s alleged attempts to block it. After two moderately well received albums of hip, Kraftwerk-inspired post-punk austerity, founding Human Leaguers Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh had departed in 1980 to form Heaven 17. “Director of visuals” Philip Wright and singer Phil Oakey – a man with an asymmetric fringe so extravagant it looked as if it was making a bid for freedom under his elbow – were left with the name, and also the group’s debts to label Virgin.In need of a bigger lineup to fulfil tour commitments and pay off some of the money owed, Oakey brought in two teenagers he had seen dancing in Sheffield’s Crazy Daisy nightclub to take on the road as backing singers. The addition of best friends Joanne Catherall and Susan Anne Sulley might have looked like an act of desperation, but it ended up proving a masterstroke. It changed the dynamic of the band and Sulley’s vocals made Don’t You Want Me the hit it became. Pushed to the limits of their musical abilities, Wright and Oakey recruited an actual musician, keyboard player Ian Burden, and went into the studio with Rushent. Reflecting on the aims of the newly rehabilitated Human League, Oakey said: “We wanted an album full of singles, like a Michael Jackson or Abba LP … we’ve moved away from textures to tunes. It’s tunes every time.”He wasn’t wrong. Blessed not only with a solid gold chorus but also a synth bass riff and more hooks than the long line of a Cornish mackerel fisherman, Don’t You Want Me is one of those brilliant, breezy songs that carries a twisted subtext, taking subversion to the top of the charts. While most who heard the song might have perceived it as a lament between two lovers in a relationship that’s no longer firing, Oakey said that it’s instead “a nasty song about sexual power politics”. He plays the character of a svengali who appears to be warning the starlet he plucked from obscurity in the cocktail bar of the opening line that if she doesn’t continue their romantic relationship, her career is over, or maybe worse. In the age of #MeToo and the exposure of exploitative practices in the music industry, Don’t You Want Me is lyrically more relevant now than when it first caused a stir in 1981.Given the subject matter of the song, the presence of these two young women plucked from obscurity to find stardom was hardly going to go unnoticed, and the tabloids duly had a field day, speculating that the waitress from the cocktail bar was either or both of them. Catherall and Sulley constantly found themselves under misogyny-laden attack from press and industry alike. In a happier counterpoint to the complex sexual power play of the song’s lyrics, Oakey always stuck up for his colleagues and the decision to put them on a proper salary. In a 1986 NME interview, he blasted their detractors: “The musos have never liked them, they’ve never understood them. There’s no one sounds like Joanne and Susan. They make it a Human League record.”Don’t You Want Me stands as a shining example of what can happen when a bunch of relative amateurs with a point to prove and a keen aesthetic eye get down to work. And after all, part of the charm of the Human League and the moment they encapsulated, the experimentalism of post-punk meeting the new possibilities of electronic music technology, is that it was so refreshingly carefree, the sound of synth pop coming in from the cold."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4eb6918fad719d74c29cfce407b182bf7162582c/0_136_4089_2453/master/4089.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b1f6798d055eb8cf8d516227fdd916d","title":"cummings and not goings","story":"The prime minister’s senior adviser has provoked national outrage by admitting travelling hundreds of miles to stay with family at the height of coronavirus lockdown. ’s Matthew Weaver reveals how he helped break the storyDominic Cummings has given his version of the events that have dominated the news for the past five days.

The large observational study analysed data from nearly 15,000 patients with Covid-19 who received the drug alone or in combination with antibiotics, comparing this data with 81,000 controls who did not receive the drug.The study, led by the Brigham and Women’s Hospital Center for Advanced Heart Disease in Boston, examined patients in hospitals around the world, including in Australia. It said researchers gained access to data from five hospitals recording 600 Australian Covid-19 patients and 73 Australian deaths as of 21 April.But data from Johns Hopkins University shows only 67 deaths from Covid-19 had been recorded in Australia by 21 April. The number did not rise to 73 until 23 April. The data relied upon by researchers to draw their conclusions in the Lancet is not readily available in Australian clinical databases, leading many to ask where it came from.The federal health department confirmed to  Australia that the data collected on notifications of Covid-19 in the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System was not the source for informing the trial. Australia also contacted the health departments of Australia’s two most populous states, New South Wales and Victoria, which have had by far the largest number of Covid-19 infections between them. Of the Australian deaths reported by 21 April, 14 were in Victoria and 26 in NSW.Victoria’s department confirmed the study’s results relating to the Australian data did not reconcile with the state’s coronavirus data, including hospital admissions and deaths. The NSW Department of Health also confirmed it did not provide the researchers with the data for its databases.The Lancet told  Australia: “We have asked the authors for clarifications, we know that they are investigating urgently, and we await their reply.”\u0026nbspThe lead author of the study, \u0026nbspDr Mandeep Mehra, said he had contacted Surgisphere, the company that provided the data, to reconcile the discrepancies with “the utmost urgency”.\u0026nbspSurgisphere is described as a healthcare data analytics and medical education company.In a statement, Surgisphere founder Dr Sapan Desai, also an author on the Lancet paper, said a hospital from Asia had accidentally been included in the Australian data.He said the error did not change the overall study findings. It did mean that the Australian data in the paper would be revised to four hospitals and 63 deaths,.Dr Allen Cheng, an epidemiologist and infectious disease doctor with Alfred Health in Melbourne, said the Australian hospitals involved in the study should be named. He said he had never heard of Surgisphere, and no one from his hospital, The Alfred, had provided Surgisphere with data.“Usually to submit to a database like Surgisphere you need ethics approval, and someone from the hospital will be involved in that process to get it to a database,” he said. He said the dataset should be made public, or at least open to an independent statistical reviewer.“If they got this wrong, what else could be wrong?” Cheng said. It was also a “red flag” to him that the paper listed only four authors.“Usually with studies that report on findings from thousands of patients, you would see a large list of authors on the paper,” he said. “Multiple sources are needed to collect and analyse the data for large studies and you usually see that acknowledged in the list of authors.”He stressed that even if the paper proved to be problematic, it did not mean hydroxychloroquine was safe or effective in treating Covid-19. No strong studies to date have shown the drug is effective. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have potentially severe and even deadly side effects if used inappropriately, including heart failure and toxicity. Other studies have found the drug is associated with higher mortality when given to severely unwell Covid-19 patients.In a statement Surgisphere said it stood by the integrity of its data, saying all information from\u0026nbsphospitals “is transferred in a deidentified manner” but could not be made public.\u0026nbsp“This requirement allows us to only maintain collaborations with top-tier institutions that are supported by the level of data-integrity and sophistication required for such work,” the statement said. “Naturally, this leads to the inclusion of institutions that have a tertiary care level of practice and provide quality healthcare that is relatively homogenous around the world. As with most corporations, the access to inidual hospital data is strictly governed. Our data use agreements do not allow us to make this data public.”Scientists have reiterated the need to wait for the results from rigorous randomised control trials, considered the gold standard of science, and the Australian Department of Health has warned the drug should not be given to patients other than in clinical trials.Cheng said it would be a mistake to stop strong, well-designed clinical trials examining the drug because of questionable data. The Lancet study findings have prompted the leaders of an Australian hydroxychloroquine trial, known as the Ascot trial, to review the future of their study. The outcome of that review has not yet been announced.The Ascot study has been recruiting patients in more than 70 hospitals in every Australian state and territory, and 11 hospitals in New Zealand. The randomised control trial is exploring whether hydroxychloroquine in combination or on its own can treat Covid-19 patients and prevent deterioration in their condition. The leader of the trial, Prof Josh Davis, has written to the Lancet study authors asking for an explanation of the data.In the meantime, patient recruitment for the study had been put on hold, an Ascot spokeswoman said. “Following an\u0026nbspobservational study published in\u0026nbspthe Lancet\u0026nbspAscot has paused patient recruitment pending deliberations by the governance and ethics committees overseeing the trial,” she said. “We expect these deliberations to occur rapidly and will provide further information as they arise.”Questions about the paper’s statistical modelling have also come from other universities, including Columbia University in the US, prompting Surgisphere to issue a public statement.Last month Australia’s chief scientist, Dr Alan Finkel, urged the public to be cautious about findings and interpretations from studies in the race to find cures and treatments for Covid-19.Serious concerns have being raised by bioethicists, clinicians and scientists that scientific rigour and peer review is falling by the wayside in the race to understand how the virus spreads and why it has such a devastating impact on some people.Do you know more? melissa.davey@the"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d193cafe03cb28e7d6b0afb142d84d7e5a1e2ecc/0_20_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da5a25c53e848dd3e8915b1f8ddcedf6","title":"lgbtq community how have you been affected by the lockdown","story":"We would like to hear from LGBTQ+ people about their experiences during the pandemicWhile the pandemic lockdown has raised significant concerns for everyone, we want to know whether it has brought additional difficulties for the LGBTQ+ community.Being able to embrace your sexuality or gender identity has a positive impact on wellbeing and resilience.

But, like in life and any sport, when there’s a breakdown of trust the only healer in that is time. It’s only been 13 months since the incident. Given that it could have derailed a World Cup campaign, it will take more time“It’s not about performance with Alex, he’s a fantastic player and it’s never been discussed as to whether he’s good enough to be in the squad. It’s about on and off the field and values we adhere to. Alex showed complete disregard for them and he needs to build that up for as long as he can and, hopefully, an opportunity will present itself along the line.”After a proposed three-match ODI series versus Ireland in late July and three Twenty20s against Pakistan a month later, the schedule for England’s white-ball team looks uncertain. On Wednesday\u0026nbspthe International Cricket Council moved\u0026nbspto play down reports of the T20 World Cup in Australia in October being postponed but such talk remains rife and Morgan said he would be surprised if it went ahead.The\u0026nbsp33-year-old had been targeting that tournament, and the following edition in India in 2021, and remains hopeful he will lead England for both. Energised by the current break and feeling ready to pick up a bat once more, he even hinted at being around for the next 50-over World Cup in 2023, even if this will hinge on his value as a batsman and the longstanding back injury he manages.England are expected to prioritise the intended Test series against West Indies and Pakistan selection-wise, something that could present opportunities for younger white-ball players such as the Somerset opener Tom Banton or Phil Salt, of Sussex, another power player at the top of the order.\u0026nbspMorgan said he will continue to ask members of the setup for their thoughts on Hales returning one day, given his obvious pedigree. “Teams in the past wouldn’t have been strong enough to make decisions like we did pre-World Cup and then continue to stand by them post-World Cup.“And that says a lot about the group. They feel as if they’re completely a part of something that they can take ownership of, because they’ve seen the work that they’ve put in and they’ve seen results. They also have seen instances where a player coming back into a group has the ability to take a lot of energy away and have impact on a lot of other players.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2b3337548d182d5ff0ddffc0f18ba5ef0ae169c/0_306_5538_3323/master/5538.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99ab9e3c7a41487e51a556f18fa77871","title":"sports fans missed most during lockdown coronavirus football","story":"What are you most looking forward to when sport returns to normal and will you be as passionate as before?In a parallel world, the FA Cup final was contested at Wembley on Saturday and attention is now turning to the Champions League final in Istanbul this coming weekend.

The much-maligned decisions to go ahead with the Cheltenham Festival and Liverpool’s Champions League match against Atlético Madrid in March “caused increased suffering and death”, according to the scientist leading the UK’s largest Covid-19 tracking project. Well, colour all those who foresaw that particular revelation coming down the pipe surprised.In much the same way that you don’t need to be an optician to appreciate that loading the family into the car for a 60-mile pre-journey journey is not the best way to test your eyesight, an intimate working knowledge of Bunsen burners, pipettes and Erlenmeyer flasks was never going to be a prerequisite for forecasting that hundreds of thousands of sports fans rubbing shoulders in close proximity during a pandemic would result in unnecessary illness and fatalities.It now seems beyond much doubt that since Liverpool last played a match, their game against Atlético added to an excess UK death toll that has now risen well above Anfield’s 54,074 capacity. Sadly, it cannot be proved beyond all doubt and it is this lack of total certainty those responsible for not just allowing but encouraging people to attend these mass gatherings have chosen to cling.Let’s hear what they have to say. “There are many factors that could influence the number of cases in a particular area, including population density, age, general health, and the position of an area on the pandemic curve,” said a government statement issued to BBC Radio’s File On 4 – Game Changer, its author apparently affronted by the very notion that cramming 250,000 punters on to a provincial racecourse across four days for a glorified booze-up may be among the more obvious ones.This official unwillingness to countenance the results of meticulous scientific research seems all the more galling when we recall various government ministers repeatedly using – you’ve guessed it – science of the weirdest variety as a shield with which to defend themselves against critics of what were quite obviously very bad decisions. Decisions taken, the government insist, on the back of “continuous consultation with scientific and medical experts”. Experts such as their own chief scientific officer, Sir Patrick Vallance, who at the time was referencing the idea of herd immunity that could scarcely have been more ill-advised.Speaking specifically about events in the Cotswolds and at Anfield, Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London, said data collected from millions of volunteers revealed cases of Covid-19 “increased several-fold” in both areas and the reasons were abundantly clear. “Sporting events should have been shut down at least a week earlier,” he said. “Because they’ll have caused increased suffering and death that otherwise wouldn’t have occurred.”Not content with having giddily boasted about shaking hands “with everybody” in a hospital on the same day his scientific advisers warned against doing anything of the kind, Boris Johnson’s presence at Twickenham for a Six Nations rugby match a few days later would go on to be cited by Cheltenham Festival organisers as one of the main reasons they decided to press ahead with four days of racing despite widespread public misgivings. At the time, the decision looked baffling. With the benefit of the kind of 20-20 hindsight you can only develop on a trip to Barnard Castle, it now seems insane.This was back in the days before Johnson and his cabinet were portentously urging us to stay at home and save lives. In mid-March, assorted frontbenchers were whistling an entirely different tune, insisting mass gatherings in sporting amphitheatres were just what the doctor ordered.“There’s no reason for people not to attend such events or to cancel them at this stage,” said the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, in response to increasingly loud calls to call off Cheltenham and top-flight football, while the Tory MP for Tewkesbury, Laurence Robertson, was also extremely vocal in his support for the lucrative racing festival that takes place annually in his constituency.A noted racing enthusiast who subsequently came under fire for failing to declare in time all of the £4,000 worth of hospitality he received over the four days of Festival, Robertson put his tardiness down to an oversight. This month he lost his father to coronavirus and on Tuesday said being unable to visit the 89-year-old in hospital as he fought for his life would “haunt me for the rest of my days”. The MP spoke out as he called on Johnson to sack Dominic Cummings for his well-documented lockdown escapades.Robertson may or may not regret the enthusiasm with which he lobbied for his constituency’s annual cash cow in March, although his entirely reasonable pre-Festival caveat that “a change of policy would be introduced if the scientific and medical evidence points in that direction” suggests the personal grief he has since endured may have prompted regrets.The current scientific and medical evidence appears to leave us in little or no doubt mass gatherings at major sporting events should have been banned much earlier, even if our leaders remain predictably unwilling to listen to the kind of independent expert testimony it doesn’t suit them to hear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1abc777a08cf370249a794f682a5782275f979b8/84_0_667_400/master/667.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72ed45b9e8ba5e51f7f439c01a319ff0","title":"scenes for survival review brian cox zoom inspector rebus national theatre of scotland","story":"Available onlineIan Rankin’s stalwart detective struggles with self-isolation in one of six quarantine-themed short films from the National Theatre of ScotlandThere’s a special joy in seeing a familiar character in an unfamiliar place. Take John Rebus. Solitary curmudgeon he may be, but\u0026nbspIan Rankin’s Edinburgh detective is a man engaged in his world, be it the city mortuary or the Oxford bar. Take him out of that world, as Rankin does in John Rebus: The Lockdown Blues, and you have a character in search of definition.\u0026nbspSelf-isolating during the Covid-19 crisis, this Rebus is left with nothing but memories, beer bottles and his record collection to fill the time between socially distanced visits from protege Siobhan. It’s simultaneously funny and sad.\u0026nbspPlayed by\u0026nbspBrian Cox with the haunted look of a man in search of the microphone switch on Zoom, he hovers on the edge of existential despair. His whiskery beard is not a lockdown thing, he says, it’s “a cannae be arsed thing”. Like so many of us, he is someone whose very sense of self has been called into question by an isolation that reminds him all too much of a prison cell.The short film is one of an initial six Scenes for Survival produced by the National Theatre of Scotland as part of the\u0026nbspBBC’s Culture in Quarantine season. There are more than 40 in line to be released in batches three times a week. Like the\u0026nbspAbbey theatre’s Dear Ireland series, they are already showing characteristics of the emerging form of lockdown monologue: the loneliness, the self-absorption, the pressures of living at close quarters with family members, the bittersweet reflections of people removed from the drama of public life.Breaking the mould is\u0026nbspFrances Poet with A Mug’s Game, which, despite being about face masks, takes us into different territory. An extract from her 2019 play\u0026nbspFibres, it is about a shipyard electrician paying the price for having had to work with asbestos at the start of his career. Reviving his original role, Jonathan Watson performs with tremendous sensitivity, giving a vox-pop realism to a character whose love of life trumps his bewildered sense of injustice. He is touching, tender and true.The acting in all six instalments is first-rate.\u0026nbspMoyo Akandé gives a living-room rhythm to the rhyming poetry of Stef Smith’s The Present, playing a woman mourning the loss of human touch and compensating with an unseasonal Christmas ritual.In Morna Pearson’s Clearing, Ashleigh More\u0026nbspis at once bolshie and vulnerable as a teenager bounced between separated parents, each too wrapped up in their own lives to care about her needs. Written in vivid Doric, it has Pearson’s characteristic qualities of the bleak, the abusive and the comic.Kate Dickie brings a feverish intensity to\u0026nbspJenni Fagan’s Isolation, writhing on her sickbed as her focus ranges from the personal to the global. “I’m embarrassed by how ill I am,” she says, making mental connections between the herd of plastic animals at her feet and the dreamlike stories of creatures entering our cities.Janey Godley’s contribution is called Alone, but hers is the closest we get to a two-hander thanks to the double act she performs with her sausage dog. The comedian celebrated for her\u0026nbsptell-it-like-it-is voiceovers of political speeches, gives a clear-eyed view of domestic oppression and feminist awakening in that rare thing: a lockdown monologue with the prospect of a happy ending."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/085b0f9e284e01edbc98b28bf7f1e68f8a5a4291/0_67_4095_2457/master/4095.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe83451c4229570db63f4630e7ca7e01","title":"larry kramer life in pictures","story":"The playwright, author and activist Larry Kramer has died aged 84 after a storied life.

It’s an opportunity for everyone from tourist boards to tour operators to reset and to look at how things can be better – for the planet, for local communities and for travellers.”In Venice – one of the most overtouristed cities, with an estimated 25 million foreign visitors a year – officials are using the pause to rethink “an entire Venice system”, with sustainability and quality tourism at its core, said Paola Mar, the city’s councillor for tourism. Part of the plan is to lure locals back to live permanently in the city. The mayor is in discussions with universities, aiming to offer tourist rentals to students, and old buildings are being restored for social housing. Measures to control visitor numbers – including a tax on day trippers, which was due to be introduced in July – will go ahead next year, while the debate around cruise ships continues.“Our goal is to trigger a renaissance of the city,” said Mar. “We want to attract visitors for longer stays and encourage a ‘slower’ type of tourism. Things can’t go back to how they were.”City authorities in Amsterdam – which was struggling to cope with an estimated 18.3 million overnight tourist stays in 2019 – are also quietly hopeful that the pandemic will be a catalyst for change. Last week the mayor urged extreme caution in reopening to tourists, while nonprofit group Amsterdam\u0026ampPartners believes the tourist hiatus pushes to the top of the agenda plans to cut numbers, give Amsterdam back to locals and attract the “right” kind of visitor , and has launched a sustainability taskforce to map the way forward.“We are working with partners to discuss how we can restart in a more sustainable and responsible way,” said Amsterdam\u0026ampPartners spokeswoman Heleen Jansen. “The main focus is that we want a sustainable visitor economy that doesn’t harm the livability of our city. If you have the right balance between living, working and visiting, you can have the right visitor economy. That’s what went wrong in the last years in the old city centre, and we have to entice locals to discover their city centre again.”Meanwhile, the suddenly empty streets of Barcelona have made local businesses and the tourist board re-evaluate their priorities too. “While we couldn’t continue at the speed things were, this is showing us that no tourists is no good either – there needs to be a more moderate way,” said Mateo Asensioof the Barcelona tourist board. “Our first task is getting locals back out into the city, then the domestic market and our neighbours. When the international market returns, we’ll focus more on specific sectors. It’s an opportunity to change the rules.”With the world’s “new normal” including social distancing, an increased fear of crowds and busy places – and the future of airlines in the balance – over-tourism may not be a pressing issue for some time.Other changes in cities around the world include  reshaping in favour of cyclists and pedestrians: Athens is accelerating plans for a car-free historic centre, Berlin is introducing 14 miles of new bike lanes, and Paris is also significantly increasing its bike lanes, to ease potential overcrowding.Destinations likely to see the first surge in visitor numbers are remote coastal and rural areas, places seen as “safe”, said Patricia Yates, acting CEO of Visit BritainVisit England. It will be longer before cities bounce back.“Our weekly consumer sentiment surveys show that the domestic market is very nervous – so we will be focusing initially on reassurance,” she said. “But beyond that we will be looking at promoting areas outside the honeypots. What is needed is destination management to rebuild tourism more slowly and keep residents, visitors and businesses that depend on tourists happy – it’s quite a balancing act.”Some of the progress made on sustainable tourism is likely to go into reverse at first, she added – with people eschewing public transport in favour of car travel and infection control measures leading to more single-use plastic.Many tour operators, however, believe the pandemic could engender a positive change in client behaviour. Intrepid Travel CEO James Thornton said: “During this hibernation period we’ve seen the benefit to nature and the climate – fish spotted in Venice’s clearer canal water, the Himalayas visible in India – and people have had time to reflect. I think customers will be more aware of the impact of travel on the environment and the communities they visit, and make more considered choices.”A renewed focus on slower travel, including train journeys and cycling, as well as keeping experiences as local as possible and offering more off-season departures are part of Intrepid’s post-Covid plans, with wilderness and wellness trips tipped to be of most interest.Launching new adventures in even more remote destinations to assist with economic recovery is on the agenda for Much Better Adventures when tourism opens up again. “The crisis has shown just how much communities in less-developed parts of the world rely on tourism,” said Sam Bruce. “We will look to spread tourism to areas that would genuinely benefit. But it has to be done in the right way. We risk a flood to remote places that aren’t prepared and could be taken advantage of.“I’m hopeful that a new, slower tourism will emerge – but the recovery needs to be slow enough for the industry to make the right decisions as it rises from the ashes.”G Adventures founder Bruce Poon – who has just published Unlearn: The Year the Earth Stood Still, an e-book looking at the impact of the pandemic on tourism – believes the industry can emerge as a stronger force for good.“People will travel again. We don’t yet know when, but we know that they will. I want to challenge everyone who travels to ‘unlearn’ what they think they know. We have the opportunity to use this reset to be more conscious about how we can improve, as iniduals and as a wider travel community.”With the pause likely to be temporary, campaigners from Greenpeace to Flight Free are demanding that airline bailouts come with strict conditions on their future climate impact and say Covid should be the catalyst for greening the world’s airlines.But in a race for economic recovery, rebuilding the industry quickly could sideline climate change and aviation issues, said Justin Francis of Responsible Travel, who is calling for a “green flying duty”, with more regulation and tax revenues invested in renewable fuels.The cost of flights is likely to rise in the long term, he added. “Short term, the where and how we travel has had to change. But new, more entrenched, norms could form from that. Many people were hooked on frequent short breaks, but key to more sustainable tourism is taking far fewer flights – we may now see a return to longer, less frequent holidays, with more time spent getting to know a place, and a rise in slower forms of travel.”Whatever happens, it’s unlikely travel will ever be the same as in pre-Covid days. An industry known for its resilience will find a new way forward, adapting to an unknown global market, but whether sustainability can be at the heart of a new model of tourism is hard to predict.“Tourism will be smaller, and so more sustainable per se. Fewer flights means less C02, fewer guests means less waste, and there will be much more focus on localism, at least initially,” said Graham Miller, professor of sustainability in business at the University of Surrey.“How the nature of the product changes, however, remains to be seen. There are huge vested interests to contend with – like the cruise industry in Venice and big businesses – but it feels like the moment we have been waiting for. If we are going to redesign tourism, this is about the best chance we can wish for.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e09fa7d03791a4f85195905bb2187f3403b59cc2/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0915975e10b62cd903a35eff0a72d94c","title":"honest elections project conservative voting restrictions","story":"Honest Elections Project, part of network that pushed supreme court pick Brett Kavanaugh, is now focusing on voting restrictionsThis story was reported in collaboration with OpenSecrets.A powerful new conservative organization fighting to restrict voting in the 2020 presidential election is really just a rebranded group that is part of a dark money network already helping Donald Trump’s unprecedented effort to remake the US federal judiciary, the  and OpenSecrets reveal.The organization, which calls itself the Honest Elections Project, seemed to emerge out of nowhere a few months ago and started stoking fears about voter fraud. Backed by a dark money group funded by rightwing stalwarts like the Koch brothers and Betsy DeVos’ family, the Honest Elections Project is part of the network that pushed the US supreme court picks Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, and is quickly becoming a juggernaut in the escalating fight over voting rights.The project announced it was spending $250,000 in advertisements in April, warning against voting by mail and accusing Democrats of cheating. It facilitated letters to election officials in Colorado, Florida and Michigan, using misleading data to accuse jurisdictions of having bloated voter rolls and threatening legal action.Calling voter suppression a “myth”, it has also been extremely active in the courts, filing briefs in favor of voting restrictions in Nevada, Virginia, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota, among other places, at times represented by lawyers from the same firm that represents Trump. By having a hand in both voting litigation and the judges on the federal bench, this network could create a system where conservative donors have an avenue to both oppose voting rights and appoint judges to back that effort.Despite appearing to be a free-standing new operation, the Honest Elections Project is just a legal alias for the Judicial Education Project, a well-financed nonprofit connected to a powerful network of dark money conservative groups, according to business records reviewed by the  and OpenSecrets.“These are really well-funded groups that in the context of judicial nominations have been systematically, over the long term but also the short term, kind of pushing an agenda to pack the courts with pretty extreme right wing nominees,” said Vanita Gupta, the president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. “The infrastructure that they’ve built over the years has been a really important vehicle for them to do this.”The Judicial Education Project is also closely linked to Leonard Leo, one of the most powerful people in Washington who has shaped Donald Trump’s unprecedented effort to remake the federal judiciary with conservative judges.The organization has deftly hidden the changes to its name from public view. In December, the Judicial Education Project formally changed its legal name to The 85 Fund, a group Leo backed to funnel “tens of millions” of dollars into conservative causes, according to Axios. The Honest Elections Project is merely a fictitious name – an alias – the fund legally adopted in February. The change was nearly indiscernible because The 85 Fund registered two other legal aliases on the same day, including the Judicial Education Project, its old name. The legal maneuver allows it to operate under four different names with little public disclosure that it is the same group.The Judicial Education Project is closely aligned with the Judicial Crisis Network, a group with unmatched influence in recent years in shaping the federal judiciary. The Judicial Crisis Network spearheaded the campaigns to get Gorsuch and Kavanaugh confirmed to the US supreme court, spending millions of dollars in each instance. It has also spent significantly on critical state supreme court races across the country.There is a lot of overlap between the Honest Elections Project and the Judicial Crisis Network. Both groups share personnel, including Carrie Severino, the influential president of the Judicial Crisis Network. Both groups have been funded by The Wellspring Committee, a group Leo raised money for until it shut down in 2018. Both have also paid money to BH Group, an LLC Leo once disclosed as his employer, that made a $1m mystery donation to Trump’s inauguration.“This is a small community that is really trying to push forward these more suppressive tactics that will be challenged in court and having those judges on the bench, they’re really hoping it’s going to continue to rig the system in their favor,” said Lena Zwarensteyn, who closely follows judicial nominations at the Leadership Conference. “By changing the rules of the game and who the referees are, they’re trying to change the landscape.”Neither the Honest Elections Project nor the Judicial Crisis Network responded to requests for an interview.The Honest Elections Project has become active as Republicans are scaling up their efforts to fight to keep voting restrictions in place ahead of the election. The Republican National Committee will spend at least $20m on litigation over voting rights and wants to recruit up to 50,000 people to help monitor the polls and other election activities.Gupta said seeing a group that has been extremely successful in pushing judicial confirmations turn its attention to voting rights was alarming."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c04ba12e9eb982bcfd25b22727fa425c3212747/0_142_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06fedc59e0896a5e77f118ddf8019f4f","title":"new york summer coronavirus covid in pictures","story":"Photographer Jordan Gale was curious to see how New Yorkers would adapt to a post Covid-19 summer.

Furthermore, we are acutely aware of perhaps an even greater impact, socially, educationally and economically, BAME communities could face as we confront an unprecedented economic downturn.“Our demand is for a Covid-19 race equality strategy that will not only deal with the immediacy of saving lives, but also fundamentally rebuild many of our institutions that this disease has exposed as having huge racial disparities.”Black people are more than four times more likely to die of Covid-19 than the white British population, according to analysis by the Office for National Statistics. People of Bangladeshi and Pakistani, Indian, and mixed ethnicities were also found to have raised mortality risk relative to white people.A Public Health England (PHE) review into how different factors – including ethnicity, gender and obesity – can affect people’s health outcomes from coronavirus is due to be published this week. But the signatories to the demand for a race equality strategy say that a wider-ranging review is needed in order to “build something positive and long-lasting from this deadly Covid-19 crisis” amid fears of a deep recession.Lord Woolley, who is chair of the government race disparity unit’s advisory group, said he had had conversations with No 10 about such a review being instigated across Whitehall.“It gives us a unique opportunity to tackle those deep-seated inequalities, which existed even before Covid-19, that could get very much worse, without dramatic action, without radical action,” he said.Woolley expects hundreds if not thousands of people to back the demand, which will be posted on the OBV website.

That starting point is a Covid-19 race equality strategy, and it is something that we believe will form part of a new social and race equality contract.”A government spokesperson said: “This government is committed to levelling up, unleashing potential and increasing opportunity for all.“We have pledged to improve the quality of data and evidence about the types of barriers faced by people from different backgrounds to help drive effective and lasting change.“The\u0026nbspgovernment’s race disparity unit, which is a world first for publishing data by ethnicity, also publishes data by age, gender and geography wherever possible.\u0026nbspIt continues to work across departments and their agencies to identify and address adverse variances in outcomes where they are found.“We’re also aware that the coronavirus sadly appears to have a disproportionate effect on people from BAME backgrounds.“It is critical we find out which groups are most at risk so we can take the right steps to protect them and minimise their risk.“That’s why we have commissioned PHE to better understand the different factors, such as ethnicity, that may influence the effects of the virus and explore the possible reasons for disparities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abbde0f73a70a18f41b58d258674764065fcbf28/0_436_5670_3404/master/5670.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=298bd97fec4a9b9d93b430bbc9ba94af","title":"dido harding super driven to make track and trace scheme work","story":"With UK’s route out of lockdown dependent on success, Dido Harding faces a huge challengeThe ex-TalkTalk chief executive Dido Harding is facing one of the biggest moments in her eventful career, as she leads the government’s new track-and-trace programme upon which the country’s path out of lockdown depends.Lady Harding, 52, the chair of NHS Improvement, was brought in to shoulder the responsibility of this significant new strategy, personally risking the fallout if it does not go to plan.Sources close to her say she has made a great start on the detail and is “super-driven” to succeed. She sees things from the “customer experience” and is passionate about getting it right, one source said.She is one of the most high-profile women involved in the coronavirus response, and it is likely the health secretary, Matt Hancock, will look to her to provide the details and direction of the scheme, which has endured a bumpy journey so far.Hancock faced weeks of criticism for the government’s decision to abandon initial contact tracing efforts on 12 March.Harding confidently presented the rules and “new principles”, as Hancock described it, in her first appearance at the Downing Street press conference, drawing a line under past efforts.Such was her confidence in the new strategy – which involves 25,000 contact tracers – she said: “If anything I’m worried that many of my brilliant contact tracers are not going to be very busy as we start to encourage more people to get a test.” She said there were “easily enough to trace down the contacts today when the vast majority of us are in lockdown”. The Isle of Wight contact, track and trace app trial provides a major challenge. Beset by delays, a version of the app has yet to be rolled out nationwide.Harding was made a peer in 2014 by David Cameron. Just a year later she was at the eye of the storm in the TalkTalk hacking scandal in which the details of 156,959 customers – including names, emails and phone numbers – and 15,000 bank account numbers were accessed by hackers with the company receiving a record £400,000 fine from the information commissioner.About 18 months later she resigned saying she wanted to focus on “more activities in public service”.She is married to John Penrose, a Tory MP and former minister, and has previously worked in management for Sainsbury’s and Tesco.

Not only is it destroying their employment, but it is also disrupting education and training, and placing major obstacles in the way of those seeking to enter the labour market or to move between jobs,” the report said.Ryder added: “The Covid-19 economic crisis is hitting young people – especially women – harder and faster than any other group. If we do not take significant and immediate action to improve their situation, the legacy of the virus could be with us for decades. If their talent and energy is side-lined by a lack of opportunity or skills it will damage all our futures and make it much more difficult to rebuild a better, post-Covid economy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c838201bbf856e019515e42d4d759ad41f0c20a/0_164_7470_4482/master/7470.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac6266b2a084b1ec009b47676f9e23b9","title":"englands coronavirus tracing plan beset by conflict and confusion","story":"Scheme marked by alienation of local public health officials and cursory training at contact tracing centresIt was meant to be the system that would allow the country to emerge confidently from lockdown. But the development of the NHS tracing system has been characterised by missteps, conflict and frustration behind the scenes.At the heart of the difficulties have been tensions between central government and local public health officials, or as one insider complained: “There has been control freakery from start to finish by the NHS and the Department of Health.”Public health officials say systems and protocols to manage so-called “complex cases” involving central and local cooperation, such as the outbreak in Weston-super-Mare, have not yet been fully worked out days before schools start reopening on 1 June.“I think councils will be told who will need extra help because they are vulnerable in a shielded category, and that’s about it,” the official added, saying there had been difficult meetings between officials from both sides.Contact tracing is one of the most basic planks of public health responses to a pandemic\u0026nbsplike the coronavirus. It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was – and always will be – central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure – originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The\u0026nbspWorld Health Organization\u0026nbspsays it should be the “backbone of the response” in every country.Tensions came to the fore after it became clear that a mobile phone app trumpeted by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, as being ready to launch nationally “mid May” was beset with technical difficulties. There is now no set date for its launch.That switched attention to what was intended to be a supplementary system of national call centres, where 25,000 people, including more than 6,000 clinicians, had been hastily recruited to interview people testing positive for coronavirus and ask who they had been in contact with.Public health experts believed they had the expertise that people who had been trained with the help of a script did not have. But they claim that for weeks during March and April they were sidelined and only became actively involved in May after “a massive campaign behind the scenes” to get them on board.Working within local councils, contact tracers have been employed for decades, tackling infections such as tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases. It is an interview-based process that requires experience and tact to obtain sometimes sensitive information from sick iniduals, and employs dozens of people in large councils scattered across environmental and sexual health teams, although the services have been hit hard by spending cuts.Meanwhile, some of those hired for the national contact tracing centres have had relatively cursory training. One told the  that the guidance on doing the job simply consisted of watching videos and reading scripts. “I have not been given any details of who to call if I have problems. Only an email address has been provided which largely goes unanswered.”Others warned that they had little experience of using computer systems intended to help them talk through cases. Another worker talked of being “thrown in the deep end”. He added: “The online system is really complicated and I want just a couple of days once it goes live to navigate it.”Last week, Rupert Soames, chief executive of Serco and brother of the former Conservative MP Sir Nicholas Soames, posted a video message saying the recruitment process was “an unprecedented achievement”. But he also conceded there had been problems with the training process. “Inevitably, I am afraid, we will have made some mistakes along the way and if it has all felt a bit clunky and rushed, I apologise.”Insiders have been reluctant to go public because they want the tracing system to succeed but some have told the  they would have liked more time and that a three-month joint effort, including local public health experts from the start, could have created a comprehensive system for England.On Tuesday a letter from Public Health England to councils’ directors of public health asked for information on the “current resources” devoted to managing the more serious outbreaks, an audit that could have happened weeks ago.Once it became clear the system would be entirely reliant on patient interviews at launch because the app was not ready, ministers were keen to link up with local authorities.Last Friday it was announced there would be a new £300m fund for local authorities in England to support test-and-trace services, with a promise that data on the spread of the coronavirus would be shared with local authorities.Dido Harding, chair of the NHS Test and Trace service, said that the role of public health officials was hugely important in tackling a game of virus “whackamole”. The Conservative peer added: “Where we see an outbreak, or the signs of an outbreak, the best way that we contain it will be through local, public health professionals, and local authority leaders, going in and understanding what’s really happening.”Sally Brinton, the Liberal Democrats’ health spokeswoman in the Lords, said it was “a relief” to hear that Public Health England was now working with local directors of public health. “However, it is also worrying that this has only happened in the last few days,” she added.With just hours until the launch of the NHS Test and Trace service, on Thursday,\u0026nbspeveryone involved is keen to make the coronavirus tracing system for England work, although the exercise has laid bare long-established tensions between central and local government.“This has been an exercise in people above my position telling me they know better and in almost every circumstance they turned out not to,” said one senior public health official. “That’s what this whole pandemic has been like – and I won’t forget that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b45822fcda061755581db97cecf10f9d9d200675/0_302_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d75f8ca8268083fed4def2e442a5eeb9","title":"glampsite worker to lorry driver meet the covid 19 job swappers","story":"People have thrown themselves into new work in lockdown to make ends meet and to keep busyWhen Boris Johnson announced a lockdown that closed businesses across the country, millions of workers were uprooted from their jobs and facing loss of income.To make ends meet, people have turned to work they would never have considered before. Meet some of the coronavirus job swappers, who have thrown themselves into a new line of work during the pandemic.I work on Mamma Mia! in the West End in ensemble, and I cover the Dynamos, doing eight shows a week. Before that I’ve done Les Mis, Cats, lots of stuff. I love acting through song. I’m more of a singer than anything else, so I love getting up and singing for people.When the theatres closed down, a lot of people were left in the lurch, and being a single mum of three, I panicked and got a job at Sainsbury’s. It sounds ridiculous but I’ve always wanted to work at a grocery store. When I was a kid I thought it would be fun.A lot of the time I’m doing the advertising side, but I fill in on the tills and the door to help keep the queues in order. As silly as it sounds, it’s really nice when somebody asks you a question – you can help them right there.Supermarket workers are very underappreciated. We are working at two o’clock in the morning so there are things for people so they can live and eat, and I feel proud to be part of that.I’m a British Airways short-haul co-pilot, flying from Heathrow and going all around the UK and Europe. We will sometimes do up to four flights a day, so it’s quite hectic. We can be away for days in a row with each night in a different city. I could wake up in Newcastle one morning and go to bed in Lyon.It’s weird, it’s my life now really. It’s been a good distraction but obviously there’s also been some pretty grim stuff. Sometimes you’re taking patients away from their loved ones who are probably not going to see them again.Tonight I’m going to go out on an ambulance with someone I’ve never met before. You just have to get on with each other – and that’s basically what being a pilot is. In the crew room I’ll meet a captain I’ve probably never met before – it’s such a big airline – and then we’ve got to operate a 70-tonne Airbus and fly it around Europe together.I work as operations manager on the Sedgewell Barn Holidays site, making sure the wigwams are ready, letting people know which one they’ve been allocated and doing bookings.When the lockdown was announced the site shut down. I’d recently got a HGV licence, so I have been redeployed on the sister company, Tweddle Transport, delivering potatoes. My dad and my brother both drive wagons, and I’ve always wanted to do it. I’ve been taking them to supermarkets and crisp factories all over the country.I’m very grateful to still be working. Yes, the time at home would have been lovely, but it’s nice to be a key worker and help things carry on as normal.I’ve got horses and dogs so it’s not practical for me do it all the time, but for the time being – and thanks to the help of my mum – it’s been fantastic. Although I do miss the physical side of my normal job, instead of being stuck in a hot, sticky wagon.Obviously being a girl and being a wagon driver is quite hard work. With the current coronavirus restrictions, I often have to go in the men’s toilets which are not pleasant and it can be difficult to get hot food with a lot of services closed. And wherever you go people are always watching you because they think: “You can’t do that, you’re a girl.”I’ve been furloughed from an indoor ski slope in Milton Keynes. I work on the reception desks, in the management rooms and in the cafe a mixture of hospitality stuff. I worked there full-time before uni, now I work weekends.My furlough pay is based on my salary over the past 12 months which, because I moved to working part-time, is not quite enough to live off. A family friend said they knew a construction site that was hiring because they had this big job to do, so I went for it.I’m not doing anything unsafe or skilled work, just stuff like, as boring as it sounds, heavy lifting, shovelling and making cement. The first day I hated it – I’ve always been more into academic stuff and hospitality work, so coming in as a labourer was a bit tough, especially as, although I’m really tall, I’m not that strong. Honestly, I’m the last person you’d ever expect to see lifting slabs.It’s difficult, but I need the money and it’s a safe way to get it – everything we do is socially distanced. I miss my normal job, but I wouldn’t want to go back. If they were to say, we’ll open it tomorrow, I’d feel hugely unsafe, especially because the household I’m in has vulnerable members.I’m a freelance musician, so I do a bit of trumpet teaching at a school but I work mostly on West End shows, covering when people want time off. This year I was on tour with Everybody’s Talking About Jamie, but after Boris Johnson’s announcement, all the theatres closed pretty much instantly.I used to race bicycles and I’m a member of a cycling club, and someone in our WhatsApp group said Zedify were expanding their business and needed more cycle delivery drivers so I applied. It was a bit alien to me because I haven’t had to do that kind of paperwork for a long time, and I didn’t have much relevant experience.It’s been really, really fun. You’re out on your bike all day and you’re getting paid. Other delivery companies take the parcels to the depot and we load up the trikes and utility bikes, and then do the last bit of the journey, because it’s often quicker on a bicycle than in a truck.One of the main reasons I was interested is because it’s zero emissions, and I don’t think it’s going to be an area of work that will disappear. It’s something that I’m definitely interested in continuing even when the lockdown is over.Until it starts hammering it down with rain, I think it’s going to be really fun. I’m also really enjoying my trumpet practice because there’s no pressure to practise for specific work now – I’m doing a lot more jazz and transcription, which is something I’ve been meaning to do for a long time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5a11d36f02af2f66a5f1eb9f5bce99320e72f80/0_105_2300_1381/master/2300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc98918ab2a4b498ea6c1d93fa9210ad","title":"venezuela us funded rock bands hugo chavez","story":"Partially redacted grant application shows scheme involved paying 10 groups to write songs promoting ‘freedom of expression’The United States funded rock groups in Venezuela to record songs promoting democracy – and undermine the rule of Hugo Chávez – according to documents released after a Freedom of Information Act request.More than 10 bands were contracted in 2011 to produce new songs promoting freedom of expression in the oil-rich nation. The $22,970 scheme, which was to culminate in a battle-of-the-bands style concert, was approved by the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a non-governmental agency responsible for promoting democracy abroad.The partially redacted grant application was uncovered by Tim Gill, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina Wilmington, and shows the efforts of US officials “to promote greater reflection among Venezuelan youth about freedom of expression, their connection with democracy, and the state of democracy in the country”.Gill said the revelations were unorthodox but unsurprising. “The NED supported many causes in order to promote democracy, not all of them nefarious,” the academic said. “But the issue is that it has the ability to fund some voices instead of others.”Successive US governments sought to unseat Chávez, whose self-styled Bolivarian revolution was in part built on anti-American sentiment. The populist leader was briefly unseated in 2002 by a military coup. It later emerged that the administration of George W Bush had known about the coup beforehand, although Washington distanced itself publicly from involvement.\u0026nbspBy 2011, US officials were apparently exploring less dramatic measures to undermine his leadership.“I can’t imagine they thought this alone was going to bring down the government,” Gill said. “But is music important and does it shape people’s views? I could draw a straight line from listening to punk rock to reading Noam Chomsky and learning about stuff about revolutions and interventions that they don’t teach in schools.”It is not the only time the US has attempted to spark unrest through music in adversarial Latin American countries. In 2014, it was revealed that USAid, the American development aid organisation, had been\u0026nbspsecretly attempting to infiltrate\u0026nbspCuba’s underground hip-hop scene.\u0026nbspNeither plot appears to have yielded many tangible results. Nor was it clear why the Venezuela plan focused on rock music in a country whose airwaves are dominated by salsa, merengue and reggaeton.Chávez died of cancer in 2013, bequeathing a collapsing economy to Nicolás Maduro, his successor. And attempts to oust Venezuela’s leader have continued apace.A 2019 plot to trigger a military uprising in support of the opposition leader Juan Guaidó fizzled out within hours, and earlier this month, American mercenaries led a botched raid to capture Maduro.The latest plan quickly fell apart with two Americans captured, allowing Maduro to appear triumphant on state TV."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc1a16ebd9f35044b85c026e86c039d01aac141a/0_0_4928_3280/master/4928.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a03574ead59092c7f3364a0cd3f6cbfb 720w","title":"uk coronavirus live test and trace gets under way in england and scotland","story":"Council leaders warn they lack powers to make local lockdowns work, as Tory MPs resist PM’s call to move on from the Dominic Cummings furoreThe 10th weekly Clap for Carers event may be the last, after the woman behind the idea said she will no longer take part. Millions of people across the UK have lined their thresholds, gathered - while socially distancing - on pavements, and stood in their gardens at 8pm every Thursday to demonstrate their support for care staff and frontline workers. But the ritual has been criticised by some for becoming “politicised”, while others, including NHS staff, have said some people who take part in the clap then wilfully ignore the plea to stay at home and avoid gatherings in an effort to ease the strain on the healthcare system. politan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick was filmed leading dozens of officers in the weekly applause for key workers on a crowded Westminster Bridge. Annemarie Plas, 36, last week told the PA news agency she has no problem with people continuing to gather at 8pm each week to clap, but said she will not be among those taking part in future. She said: “To have the most impact I think it is good to stop it at its peak. “Without getting too political, I share some of the opinions that some people have about it becoming politicised. “I think the narrative is starting to change and I don’t want the clap to be negative.” Plas, from Streatham in south London, told ITV’s Good Morning Britain she will clap on Thursday evening, and will return outside at the same time next week to “check in” with her community, without applauding. Matt Hancock said “outside is safer than indoors”. Talking about the possibility of pubs opening, the health secretary told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The good thing that we’ve learned from the science of this virus in the last few weeks is that the risk of transmission outdoors is much lower – it’s not zero, but it is much lower than indoors. “So, during the summer in particular, a lot of the changes that you can expect to see will be based on the principle that outdoors is safer than indoors.” has today launched an interactive, to pay tribute to those who lost their lives to coronavirus.Contact tracing could be undermined by continued government support for Dominic Cummings, the shadow health secretary has said.Jonathan Ashworth voiced support for NHS test and trace launched in England on Thursday morning as “the only way we can safely ease out of this lockdown”. But he added that the health secretary Matt Hancock’s support for Boris Johnson’s chief adviser could “undermine” public cooperation with the scheme.Under the new system, people who come into close contact with a coronavirus sufferer will be told to self-isolate for 14 days, while an accompanying app is still delayed by several weeks. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Ashworth said: “We need everybody to cooperate with this because it’s in all of our interests that this works, and I’m sorry, I’ve got to say it, it’s why I think Matt Hancock’s support of Dominic Cummings is really irresponsible. “My worry is some people will think ‘Why should I stay at home for two weeks on my own when I feel fine, while this guy who’s Boris Johnson’s big pal in Downing Street can get away with travelling across the country to Durham?”’Health secretary Matt Hancock said people will not receive penalties for not abiding by the NHS test and trace self-isolation period “in the first instance”. Pushed on people’s concerns about fraudulent NHS calls, Hancock told LBC: If anybody calls they will be calling from the number 0300 0135 000, if you get a text it will come from NHS and they will never ask you for any form of payment or purchase or details of your bank account, and also you will then be given, if you’re online, a QR code to be able to confirm those details online.Asked whether he himself, having had coronavirus, would have to self-isolate again if told to do so, Hancock said: Unfortunately, yes. It is very frustrating but the reason for that is we don’t yet know whether people like me who have had it still transmit it if they come into contact with it a second time.On employers covering the wages of employees told to self-isolate, Hancock said “it is very important work constructively with their staff”. He added: “It is better to have this sort of targeted isolation than the blanketed measures we’ve got in place at the moment.”Hello everyone. I am running the ’s news feed this morning, bringing you all the latest information. Please do share any news tips or information with me as I work.Brian Strutton, general secretary of the pilots’ union Balpa said: EasyJet staff will be shocked at the scale of this announcement. Only two days ago staff got a ‘good news’ message from their boss with no mention of job losses so this is a real kick in the teeth. Those staff have taken pay cuts to keep the airline afloat and this is the treatment they get in return. EasyJet has not discussed its plans with Balpa so we will wait and see what impact there will be in the UK. But given EasyJet is a British company, the UK is it’s strongest market and it has had hundreds of millions in support from the UK taxpayer I can safely say that we will need a lot of convincing that EasyJet needs to make such dramatic cuts. Indeed, EasyJet’sown projections, though on the pessimistic side, point to recovery by 2023 so this is a temporary problem that doesn’t need this ill-considered knee-jerk reaction.We realise that these are very difficult times and we are having to consider very difficult decisions which will impact our people, but we want to protect as many jobs as we can for the long term. We remain focused on doing what is right for the company and its long-term health and success, following the swift action we have taken over the last three months to meet the challenges of the virus. Although we will restart flying on 15 June, we expect demand to build slowly, only returning to 2019 levels in about three years’ time. Against this backdrop, we are planning to reduce the size of our fleet and to optimise the network and our bases. EasyJet announced that by the end of next year it expects to have reduced its fleet size by around 51 aircraft to approximately 302. This will be achieved through measures such as deferring new aircraft arrivals. Bookings for winter are “well ahead of the equivalent point last year”, partly due to some customers rebooking flights which were cancelled due to the pandemic.“And, in view of the risks we face, it is of course right that we consider what further options, such as cutting interest rates into unprecedented territory, might be available in the future. But it is also important that we consider very carefully the issues that such choices would give rise to.” Despite support measures already taken, official figures released on Wednesday showed the Government was paying the wages of 8.4 million employees, out of a total labour force of 32 million.A new report by a UK charity has highlighted the plight of the world’s most vulnerable communities amid the coronavirus pandemic, calling it a crisis from which many people will never recover. After studying 13 countries in Africa and Asia, the charity Street Child said one third of people surveyed were unable to take the most basic measures to guard against Covid-19, including washing their hands. More than half of the children in the survey have been unable to take part in learning activities during the pandemic, the group said, while more than half of people surveyed were fearful of hunger and starvation due to rising food prices and their loss of income. Street Child’s chief executive Tom Dannatt said in a statement the results of the survey “clearly demonstrate Covid-19 is having a devastating impact on the world’s most vulnerable communities”. “With schools closed, a lack of access to basic prevention measures such as soap and water, and a very real risk of extreme hunger and even starvation, children and families are in the midst of a crisis that many will never recover from,” he said. Nicola Sturgeon is expected to announce “cautious” steps out of lockdown for Scotland. The First Minister will reveal on Thursday if the country is moving on to the first phase of a four-part plan for easing the restrictions - which were put in place more than nine weeks ago on March 23. Dozens of travel companies have called on the home secretary to scrap plans to impose a mandatory 14-day quarantine on people arriving in the UK due to the coronavirus. Accusing the government of being “woefully slow” in its support for the travel industry, more than 70 company heads have co-signed a letter to Priti Patel over her announcement last week surrounding the new measure for arrivals, which starts on June 8. Signatories have urged the government to switch from protection mode in the face of the Covid-19 crisis to economic recovery. “The very last thing the travel industry needs,” the letter says, “is a mandatory quarantine imposed on all arriving passengers which will deter foreign visitors from coming here, deter UK visitors from travelling abroad and, most likely, cause other countries to impose reciprocal quarantine requirements on British visitors, as France has already announced. “Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said he believes “the vast majority of people” will self-isolate voluntarily under the new NHS Test and Trace system. Asked what people should do if they have childcare issues but are told to self-isolate, Hancock told Sky News: “Well, of course, it is very important that childcare is taken into account. I understand that as well as anybody, so yes it is very important that people deal with childcare and do that in a reasonable way.” Pushed on whether you would still need to stay at home, he added: “That is what you will be instructed to do, yes, and you should follow those instructions because that is in the best interest of everybody.” Asked how the system could be made mandatory in future, Mr Hancock said: “There are powers that we took through Parliament at the start of the crisis in the Coronavirus Act to be able to mandate this but I’d far rather not....” He added that it would be “far better if we didn’t have to make it mandatory”.Chief executive Johan Lundgren said: “We realise that these are very difficult times and we are having to consider very difficult decisions which will impact our people, but we want to protect as many jobs as we can for the long-term. “We remain focused on doing what is right for the company and its long-term health and success, following the swift action we have taken over the last three months to meet the challenges of the virus. “Although we will restart flying on June 15, we expect demand to build slowly, only returning to 2019 levels in about three years’ time. “Against this backdrop, we are planning to reduce the size of our fleet and to optimise the network and our bases.

Safe travels! Thanks for bringing some excitement to Dalkey during this pandemic!”Comments underneath the post wished Damon a safe trip home, with one Facebook user thanking him for putting “Dalkey on the world map”.Damon was in Ireland shooting scenes for an upcoming movie´, The Last Duel, directed by Ridley Scott, when the country went into lockdown in mid-March. Instead of catching a flight back to the US, Damon chose to settle into the Dalkey community – where he and his family are reportedly renting the Formula 1 driver Eddie Irvine’s former bachelor pad – and wait out the pandemic on Irish soil.The actor’s stay in Dublin, and subsequent photo which showed Damon wearing a baseball hat and holding a SuperValu bag, prompted an article by the New York Times about the local reaction to the A-lister’s presence in the affluent Dublin seaside suburb.Much to the joy of Dublin station Spin 1038, Damon appeared on the Fully Charged weekday show earlier this month and spoke about living in Ireland during the pandemic.More recently he surprised local schoolgirls by sharing a video of himself congratulating the graduation class of the secondary school, Loreto Abbey Dalkey.“You guys are awesome,” he told the girls, adding that he was “sorry” they had to study and graduate “from quarantine”. “Congratulations – what an achievement.

Image: Getty.The operation of a Co Louth nursing home badly hit by a Covid-19 outbreak has been transferred back to the private provider by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) hospital group. The hospital group took over the management of the Dealgan House nursing home in Dundalk on April 17th to ensure safe staffing levels amid a major outbreak of the disease in the facility. Dealgan House has 84 beds and has been one of the worst hit nursing homes in the State, with 22 residents dying from Covid-19 there since April 1st.The RCSI group still contacts the nursing home for a daily “health check” to assess the need for any supports, according to an update provided by Minister for Health Simon Harris to local TDs on Wednesday. Eoin Farrelly, managing director of Dealgan House, previously told relatives that at the height of the nursing home’s virus outbreak only seven of the home’s 24-strong nursing staff were available. The Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa) has begun an inspection of standards in the private nursing home. Phelim Quinn, Hiqa chief executive, has said inspectors will review the nursing home’s records of residents who died as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Risk systemsThe inspection will assess the provider’s compliance with statutory regulations, Mr Quinn told Louth TD Fergus O’Dowd in a letter on 18th May. This would include a review of “the governance, management and risk systems in place to maintain the safety and effectiveness of care provided to residents,” he said. In an update, Mr Harris said all residents were now in single occupancy rooms, and personal protective equipment (PPE) for staff was “readily available.”The Health Service Executive has been advised that the “situation has stabilised,” and there had been no further spread of Covid-19, with safe staffing levels in place, he said. Responding to calls for an independent inquiry into the outbreak in Dealgan House, Mr Harris said Hiqa was the independent regulator for the sector. The watchdog had “wide ranging powers” to withdraw a nursing home’s registration to operate if inspections identified serious concerns, he said. AccountabilityMr O’Dowd, a Fine Gael TD, said welcomed Hiqa’s inspection of the nursing home and called for “accountability” and an explanation for relatives of residents who died there.“I just don’t think it’s going to give families answers and closure,” he said. Sinn Féin TD Ruairí Ó Murchú said he was “disappointed” that Mr Harris did not commit to an independent inquiry. “It remains the families’ wish to have a full inquiry into what took place and what went wrong. It is the only way to ensure that nothing like this happens again,” he said. In a statement, Mr Farrelly said Hiqa’s inspection would try to answer “the many questions that we have, and that are being asked of us, especially as to how the virus got into our nursing home”. Management welcomed the inspection and was complying fully with Hiqa, he said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4264228.1590652439!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"two metre rule summer camps and golf considered by ministers","story":"Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan says the current two-metre social distancing guideline is the right measure for now, but will be kept under review.

Photograph: Colin KeeganCollinsThe State’s chief medical officer Tony Holohan has rejected pressure from some Government Ministers to accelerate the relaxation of coronavirus restrictions.Mr Holohan told a Cabinet meeting there will be no immediate change to his advice on the current two-metre rule for physical distancing.Despite calls from some Ministers to reduce the recommended distance to one metre, Mr Holohan said it could lead to an increased risk of infection.Under the current roadmap, people will be permitted to extend their orbit of travel to 20km from June 8th when the second phase of the plan to reopen Ireland is scheduled to kick in. Sources said Minister of State in the Department of Health Finian McGrath also raised the possibility of increasing the travel limit from 5km to 20km at an earlier stage. It is understood that Mr McGrath said it was unfair that only golfers who were within 5km of their local course could play the sport and he highlighted the impact that restrictions were having on people’s mental health. Government sources have expressed confidence that there may be some easing of restrictions on June 8th beyond what was originally envisaged. Summer campsWhile some additional elements may be included on top of what was initially intended – such as easing nursing home visitor restrictions, help for children with special needs and potentially allowing some summer camps where social distancing could be maintained, such as tennis camps, to proceed – they are expected to be minimal.The 20km travel limit was due to apply until July 20th, when people would then be allowed travel outside their region. This was initially to be done in tandem with the reopening of hotels, hostels and caravan parks on that date. However, this may be brought forward to June 29th to boost the domestic tourism industry, according to well-placed sources. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Wednesday called on the public to “hold firm” until the first week of June. “If the numbers are still going in the right direction at that point, we can have some confidence about bringing forward some of the things from later phases,” he said.A spokesman for the Taoiseach said Ministers had a “productive meeting” with Dr Holohan.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Move paves way for anti-sedition laws which rights advocates say will threaten city\u0026rsquos freedomsAt least 69 cases this week linked to cluster of infections at logistics facilityThousands take to streets to oppose Beijing-backed laws curtailing city\u0026rsquos freedomsMove to impose security law illustrates Beijing\u0026rsquos increasing tendency to flex its muscleProtesters get ready for more demonstrations against proposed Beijing lawsCommissioner in territory says contentious new security law aimed at \u0026lsquotroublemakers\u0026rsquoPM has made most of her communication skills and the country\u0026rsquos political cultureCian English (19), from Carlow, died following fall from Gold Coast apartmentChina proposes path to imposing rules used against dissidents on the mainlandPolice fire tear gas in popular shopping district as protesters take to the streets\u0026lsquoThere is a political virus spreading in United States,\u0026rsquo says China\u0026rsquos foreign ministerWinds gusting up to 210kmh expected near iron ore producing heartland of the PilbaraInvestigation begins into cause of Pakistan International Airlines crash that killed 97Officials confirm two survivors after PIA aircraft crashes in residential area of KarachiOutrage among pro-democracy legislators at security law put forward at National People\u0026rsquos CongressRescue teams hampered by torn-down power lines and flooding over large tracts of landPro-Beijing politicians are pushing contentious laws in the face of intense oppositionCyclone Amphan moving inland with gusts of up to 185kmh, says India met serviceSuper cyclone Amphan, with winds up to 160kmh, expected to hit India\u0026rsquos coast on WednesdayRules to be relaxed in areas with low numbers of infection, according to governmentStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4264639.1590652063!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"chinese parliament approves hong kong security law","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople walk past riot police  in Hong Kong, China. Photograph: Billy HC KwokGetty ImagesChina’s legislature has approved a decision to force a controversial national security law on Hong Kong, in an extraordinary and unprecedented move aimed at bringing the semi-autonomous territory further under Beijing’s control.On Thursday, China’s National People’s Congress voted and passed a draft decision that paves the way for anti-sedition laws to be directly enacted in Hong Kong, bypassing the semi-autonomous territory’s legislature. The Legislative Council (LegCo) has been unable to pass similar legislation on its own because of widespread public opposition.Now, a detailed law will be drafted and could be enacted in a matter of weeks, according to Chinese state media.The move by China has prompted widespread condemnation and anxiety inside and outside Hong Kong about Beijing’s plans for the semi-autonomous territory. Riot police were deployed across Hong Kong to stop any potential protests.ArrestsThe vote comes after at least 360 people were arrested in Hong Kong on Wednesday, as police fired pepper pellets and detained suspected protesters in a series of skirmishes that broke out across the city. Demonstrators were protesting against a bill to criminalise disrespect of the Chinese national anthem and the looming national security laws. On Thursday, debate over the national anthem bill was suspended after a lawmaker opposing the law dropped what was believed to be a rotting plant onto the chamber’s floor.Following the protests, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said his government would revoke Hong Kong’s special trade status as separate from China.“While the United States once hoped that free and prosperous Hong Kong would provide a model for authoritarian China, it is now clear that China is modelling Hong Kong after itself,” he said.The move, part of legislation passed by the US last year to pressure Beijing into protecting Hong Kong’s autonomy, promises to further destabilise already deteriorated relations between the US and China. Under the law, the US is required to conduct an annual review of Hong Kong’s governance and whether it should continue to be treated as separate from China in trade and economic ties with the US.“No reasonable person can assert today that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China, given facts on the ground,” Mr Pompeo said.‘Necessary countermeasures’Before Mr Pompeo’s statement, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said his government will adopt “necessary countermeasures” to deal with “mistaken” attempts at foreign interference by other countries.On Thursday Hu Xijin, editor of nationalistic state-run tabloid the Global Times, said on Twitter that it was not up to the US to decide if Hong Kong was autonomous. He wrote in a longer post on Weibo: “American politicians like Pompeo presume that the fate of Hong Kong lies in their hands.”“If Washington wants to play this card, let them play it – Hong Kong is a major international finance hub because of its special relationship to the mainland’s massive economy. This is more important than the attitude of the US.”Chinese and Hong Kong officials have promised that the law will only target a “narrow set of acts” and the vast majority of Hong Kong residents would not be affected.Legal observers and human rights advocates say the national security laws will threaten the city’s freedoms and rights as promised under the “one country two systems” framework.“In China they never really define what exactly is ‘national security’. So the law could change according to political expediency or political necessity,” Johannes Chan, a legal scholar in Hong Kong, told public broadcaster RTHK, adding that it was “naive” to believe the law would only affect a small group of people.The unprecedented move by Beijing also represents a worrying escalation of interference in Hong Kong affairs and violates the territory’s de-facto constitution the Basic Law, according to legal experts.“The Chinese communist party is painting a picture to make it seem like it is abiding by the Basic law, but it is not. They’re imposing a draconian law which can be used to silence dissent in Hong Kong and infringe on freedoms guaranteed to Hong Kongers,” said Frances Eve, deputy director of research at Chinese Human Rights Defenders. –Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Former cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationRival Gantz to take over as prime minister of Israeli unity government after 18 monthsAshraf Ghani to lead country as rival Abdullah Abdullah oversees Taliban peace process, sources sayCeremony will end political deadlock that has dragged on for more than 500 daysArab and foreign jihadis ambush military convoys and assassinate officials as Baghdad and Damascus try to contain coronavirusThree men captured west of Caracas are the latest \u0026lsquoterrorists\u0026rsquo arrestedAt least 24 killed by suicide bomber in separate attack in Afghanistan on TuesdayAccident in which 15 wounded takes place during training exercise in Gulf of OmanFormation of coalition to proceed after supreme court clears way for PM to remain in officePolitics and ision facilitate virus in country with just 208 ventilators and scant testingPresident fears country\u0026rsquos 44 cases and three deaths could \u0026lsquosuddenly spike in few days or weeks\u0026rsquoResidents in Mosul, still traumatised by violence, fear a resurgence of the terror groupRuling against Likud chief would likely trigger snap election, the fourth since April 2019Accelerating economic meltdown has left country\u0026rsquos poorest without work and incomeStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4264223.1590610983!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"emily maitlis replaced as newsnight episode host following cummings monologue","story":"Emily Maitlis has been replaced as host of Wednesday night’s episode of Newsnight after BBC bosses reprimanded her over a monologue in which she attacked the government’s handling of Dominic Cummings’ lockdown trip to Durham.

She will be replaced on Wednesday by the Newsnight reporter Katie Razzall.In the monologue Ms Maitlis told viewers: “Dominic Cummings broke the rules – the country can see that and it’s shocked the government cannot.“The longer ministers and the prime minister insist he worked within them, the more likely the angry response to the scandal is likely to be . . . He made those who struggled to keep to the rules feel like fools, and has allowed many more to assume they can flout them.”Talking of UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s “blind loyalty” in the face of plummeting poll ratings, she expressed bafflement: “The prime minister knows all this and has chosen to ignore it.’FuryClips of the sequence went viral on social media, attracting millions of views – many more than tune in to Newsnight on a typical evening. However, it caused fury among both Conservative politicians who have largely parked their longstanding criticism of the BBC during the pandemic, and also some journalists in and outside the public broadcaster who felt it went against the corporation’s approach to journalism.BBC news bosses agreed with the criticism of its own show, swiftly issuing a statement distancing themselves from the monologue. BBC sources said Newsnight’s editor, Esme Wren, worked on Tuesday night’s episode.“The BBC must uphold the highest standards of due impartiality in its news output,” the corporation said in a statement. “We’ve reviewed the entirety of last night’s Newsnight, including the opening section, and while we believe the programme contained fair, reasonable and rigorous journalism, we feel that we should have done more to make clear the introduction was a summary of the questions we would examine, with all the accompanying evidence, in the rest of the programme.“As it was, we believe the introduction we broadcast did not meet our standards of due impartiality. Our staff have been reminded of the guidelines.”‘Ironic’Keith Brown, SNP deputy leader, said: “This statement is a gutless capitulation by BBC bosses. Newsnight should be commended - not slapped down - for their serious investigative work on Cummings, that’s not something you could say about the BBC News at 10. “Pandering to 10 Downing Street by curbing journalists from being able to hold the UK government to account is of serious concern.” An SNP spokesperson added: “It’s ironic that the only apology over the whole Dominic Cummings lockdown breaches scandal comes from the BBC.” AcclaimMs Maitlis’s profile, already high, has skyrocketed since she was made lead presenter of the nightly current affairs show last year, shortly after publishing her book Airhead on life as a television presenter. She received global acclaim after confronting prince Andrew about his connections with the deceased paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, becoming possibly the only journalist who can claim to have conducted an interview with a member of the royal family that turned out to be career-ending for the royal.However, her increasing willingness to deliver opinionated monologues – including one in April dismissing the idea that coronavirus is a “great leveller” given its disproportionate impact on poorer people – has raised concerns among some on the show that the approach is not suited to a BBC political programme. There are suggestions of wider editorial tensions within the programme on the approach, even as it attracts enormous online interest.The BBC has increasingly struggled to hold the line on issues of impartiality in its news coverage, having tied itself in knots over comments about Donald Trump by BBC Breakfast’s presenter Naga Munchetty. It also struggled to deal with the enormous levels of criticism from both Labour and the Conservatives during the 2019 general election. - Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this.

Flights out of the country remain grounded.Hundreds of foreign residents remain in Pyongyang, including diplomats from the Swedish and Russian embassies and a small number of aid workers, though absent representatives from Germany, Switzerland, France, and Italy.There are currently no British residents in the country.Resident diplomats had previously raised their concerns about the severity of the DPRK authorities’ coronavirus-prevention rules, which saw the country close its borders and place them under effective house arrest for over a month earlier in the year.At the height of the restrictions, a request from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) to fly a chartered aircraft from Britain to the country for support and evacuation purposes was rejected by the North Korean government.Lockdown measures in the country have reportedly been relaxed in recent weeks.However, the Russian state-run outlet TASS reported on Wednesday that the flag at the British embassy in Pyongyang had been taken down and a convoy of diplomatic vehicles had been seen departing.Earlier this month North Korea had said it has no cases of the coronavirus, but the country had reinforced border checks and anti-epidemic measures.An FCO spokesperson said: “The UK has temporarily closed its embassy in Pyongyang and our staff have departed the country.

Even if the test returns negative they will be asked to continue isolating. Announcing the new scheme on Wednesday night, Boris Johnson, admitted that it was a huge imposition on the British public. He said that it would be voluntary at first,  but warned that it could become mandatory with fines for those who did not comply with the quarantine or failed to hand over details of their friends and family.Mr Johnson made the announcement in front of an MPs\u0027 committee during which he was again questioned on the conduct of Dominic Cummings, his special adviser, who drove to Durham from London during lockdown in an apparent breach of the guidelines. The Prime Minister said that it was time to move on from that debate and denied the episode could lead to Britons being less likely to make the sacrifices now being asked of them. However, it emerged that Penny Mordaunt, the paymaster general, told a constituent in an email that she believed Mr Cummings had  undermined key public health messages.Mr Johnson denied that the Cummings episode would make the public far less energetic about adhering to the new system.Today the Prime Minister will formally review the lockdown rules which were imposed on Britain nine weeks ago. Mr Johnson also suggested that he could drop the coronavirus alert level from four to three, allowing for some lockdown relaxations.In his announcement, Mr Johnson said the new test and trace system would  place a burden on a tiny minority of people, but would ultimately free up to 66 million people from lockdown.He said: It is a huge imposition, but it will be on a very small minority of the population.And I would just say to everybody that it\u0027s worth it, because that is the tool that other countries have used to unlock the prison, to make sure that we can go forward.And so, that captivity for a tiny minority for a short time will allow us gradually to release 66 million people from the current situation so I do think it\u0027s the right way forward.  The system could see up to 10,000 people a day receive text messages or phone calls warning they have been near a person who has tested positive. It was supposed to be backed by an app, which would mean those who have been in close proximity to those who test positive would be automatically contacted, and urged to self-isolate.  But its rollout has been repeatedly delayed, with officials last night refusing to commit to any date for its launch.  On Wednesday the Health Secretary said testing and tracing must become “a new way of life” in order to protect households across the country.Matt Hancock said people had a “civic duty” to follow instructions to self isolate. He said: “This will be voluntary at first, because we trust everyone to do the right thing. But we can quickly make it mandatory if that’s what it takes.”Mr Johnson said fines could be introduced for people who fail to comply. He told the Liaison Committee: We will be asking people to stay at home. If they don\u0027t follow that advice, what we will be saying is we will consider what sanctions may be necessary.The system will see people with symptoms tested and then provided with a result within days. Yesterday,  Dame Dido Harding, head of NHS Test and Trace, said that currently 84 per cent of tests return results in 24 hours while 95 per cent provide results within 48 hours.If the results are positive the person will be put in touch with one of an army of 25,000 contact tracers who will ask for details of \u0027close contacts\u0027.Close contacts will be defined as anyone who has been within two metres of an infected person for at least 15 minutes. It comes amid concerns that some people may be reluctant to hand over contact details of friends, family or colleagues, fearing repercussions by those who face financial losses from two weeks off work. There are also fears that iniduals could be falsely named maliciously, in a bid to settle old scores. Baroness Harding said the system of manual tracking would “enable the vast majority of us to be able to get on with our lives in a much more normal way.”“It requires all of us to do our civic duty … trading national lockdown for inidual isolation”, she said - suggesting that compliance by those who get the call would allow 60 million people to be released from mass restrictions.Dame Dido said she had “great faith and confidence in the British public\u0027s desire to play their part” in getting the country back on its feet.“We all want to get back to a life, which is much more like normal, and this is one of the key elements that will enable us to start to release lockdown. So I actually have great faith that people will … want to know whether they\u0027ve got the disease and they will want to play their part in protecting their family, their friends and their local community,” she said.“We’re not launching this with fines and penalties for people who don\u0027t self-isolate or who don\u0027t give us their contacts. What we\u0027re doing is asking everyone to play their part.”Modelling for the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) has warned that unless testing is speeded up, the system could cut new infections by as little as five per cent.The study by Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics (Delve) group, which has been handed to Sage, suggests improvements in testing turnaround times could increase this to 15 per cent.Prof John Newton, national co-ordinator of Test and Trace said it would be “very difficult” to achieve a fast turnaround for home tests, and said those contacted by the scheme would be sent to drive through sites and testing centres wherever possible.He also suggested officials expect mistakes to be made as the scheme is rolled out, saying “clearly, when you launch something of this size, something will go wrong somewhere along the line”.Prof Newton urged the public “to bear with us as there may be some glitches” saying he was confident that the “basic programme is very solid”.The Prime Minister denied that Mr Cummings’ decision to bring his family to Durham while they were supposed to be self-isolating could mean the public are less likely to comply with the demands.It came after Conservative MP Simon Hoare suggested the nation will be far less energetic about obeying future restrictions as a direct result of the activities of your senior adviser.Mr Johnson said: If, just suppose for a second that you were right, which I don\u0027t accept, all the more reason now for us to be consistent and clear in our message driving those key messages.One senior Tory MP said the actions of Mr Johnson’s advisor had badly undermined the scheme. He told The : They are rolling this out now when we\u0027ve lost the good will of the nation because of Cummings.The government\u0027s street cred has gone out of the window. People are losing sight at the gravity of the challenge we face and I fear it won\u0027t be until we have a second wave that people start to take this seriously again.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cruise ship study shows 80 per cent covid 19 cases board asymptomatic","story":"Coronavirus infection without symptoms might be more common than previously thought, according to a study of people isolated on a cruise ship during the pandemic.More than 80 per cent of the passengers and crew on the unnamed cruise ship who tested positive for Covid-19 were asymptomatic.The prevalence of the virus on affected cruise ships is therefore likely to be significantly underestimated, the study published in the journal Thorax concludes.Strategies are needed to assess and monitor all passengers to prevent community transmission after disembarkation, the Australia-based researchers said.Professor Alan Smyth, joint editor-in-chief of the journal, said the study\u0027s results could have implications for the easing of lockdown restrictions if more people than previously thought have already had the virus.Of the 217 passengers and crew on board, 128 tested positive for the virus and of those, 104 patients - 81 per cent - did not have symptoms.The ship left in mid-March from Argentina for a planned 21-day cruise of the Antarctic, along a similar route taken by explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton in the early 1900s.It set sail after the global pandemic was declared by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and two of the study authors happened to be passengers, while a third was the expedition physician.Passengers and crew were screened for Covid-19 symptoms, body temperatures were taken before boarding, and no-one who had recently travelled through countries with high infection rates at the time such as China and South Korea was allowed on.The first recorded fever on board the ship was on day eight and the study authors said from that point all passengers were confined to their cabins and surgical masks were issued, while full personal protective equipment was used for any contact with any patients with a fever.Eight people had to be medically evacuated from the ship and the authors said there had been one death to date.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing planet normal new telegraph podcast talks normal","story":"Sick of gotcha political coverage?

They both boast high-level political access – and lace politics into their writing, although rarely from a “Westminster village” perspective. They both have older children and, unlike so many London-centric journalists, live outside the M25.What unites them, above all, is that Pearson and Halligan are staunchly and proudly “normal” – both hailing from unflashy, proletarian, non-professional backgrounds, the first in their respective families to go to university. That’s one reason they share a reputation for shrewd political analysis and trend-spotting - knowing in their bones, often before the Westminster crowd, how “ordinary people” think.“You know that moment when you’re watching a TV panel discussion and finally – finally! – someone says something you agree with,” says Pearson. “That’s what Planet Normal is all about!”Pearson and Halligan have between them spent almost forty years penning national newspaper columns, winning countless awards for their writing and broadcasting. They both feel strongly that the media is now far less representative of the broader UK population than when they started out.“It’s become much harder in recent years for people from ordinary backgrounds to break into high-end journalism,” says Halligan. “We\u0027ve made progress in terms of gender and ethnic ersity, but there’s now far less ersity in terms of opinion – with much of the broadcast media, in particular, dominated by privileged insiders holding the same approved views”.Planet Normal is a small but spirited attempt to counter that. In their 30-minute weekly podcast, Pearson and Halligan will review the news in the same sharp, irreverent, down-to-earth style they bring to their writing.

Somehow it feels provident rather than downright terrifying that I don’t have much work, freeing me up to spend time with my children.For three decades I’ve lived with the constant pressure of chores piling up and tasks undone. The horizon’s always littered with obligations, both professional and social. If the year had continued as usual I’d be speed-reading dozens of books for talks at literary festivals, giving over weekends to a succession of birthday parties, preparing for a week-long walk with schoolfriends, while working like a lunatic to keep my household going.Instead, my life has been cancelled and I’m profoundly grateful. There’s the strangest sensation of your slate being wiped clean. As if the great games mistress in the sky says you can sit this one out.I’ve no doubt this carefree disregard for practical and economic reality is indelibly linked to the glorious weather. The moment the sun comes out a collective mania descends upon the British psyche. We can never quite shake off the feeling it’s a stroke of temporary, outrageous good fortune, like finding a fifty-quid note wafting down the street something that should be squandered joyfully here and now.I feel like I’m enjoying my own back-garden music festival, complete with Spotify playlists sent by similarly Awol middle-aged friends. One temporarily holed-up independent publisher, known for his verve with turntables, sent me a long note alongside his latest compilation of dance music. There wasn’t one mention of the woes of the book trade, with most high-street book stores closed and Amazon prioritising essential items over novels.If my hometown of Cambridge is anything to go by, the illusion of being sunnily en fête is widespread. For two months the city was eerily empty, but when I cycled through two days ago the Mill pub was doing a roaring trade in takeaway pints, with drinkers carrying their booty down to the river. Jesus Green was carpeted with picnickers (as it has been for 10 days now) and a gang of young men in their twenties had a car backed against one of the entrances blasting out rap music, ramping up the Party in the Park vibe.But if there’s one summer pleasure that makes us feel almost Mediterranean, it’s the weather being balmy enough for an outdoor swim. Yes, I know some deranged souls brave winter water, but for most of us it’s sufficient proof of British grit to enjoy a bracing plunge in an early summer heatwave. Vast queues to the coast tell of the pressing need to take a briny dip. In Cambridge I found my way to the celebrated Riverbank Club, where the town’s diehard naturists go skinny‑dipping.My joy was complete when, turning my bike into my street, I heard a melody like panpipes from a lost world: the ice-cream van was back. True, the vendor was wearing a protective face shield and only selling pre-packaged lollies – but he turned my road into a seaside promenade. Children in shorts emerged from back gardens, with a couple in swimming costumes from their paddling pools.This is a very British triumph of the spirit.

There is something very important happening at the end of the year which is that we get back control of our own waters,” he said“Any agreements have simply got to accommodate that reality,” Boris Johnson’s top Brexit official said, as he described the isions over the issue between the two sides. “The EU is still coming to terms with the fact that there is a large country in Europe that doesn\u0027t want to be part of the EU\u0027s structure,” he added.The joint Political Declaration, which sets out the aspiration for the negotiations over a zero tariff zero quota trade deal, was finalised at the same time as the Withdrawal Agreement. It calls for a fisheries agreement to be struck by July 1. Mr Frost said the deadline was just an aspiration and not “an absolute requirement”. However, failure to reach a deal could harden EU attitudes at a time when the bloc’s leaders are consumed by the coronavirus pandemic.  The UK wants a Norway-style fishing arrangement with annual negotiations over access and catch shares for EU boats. It also wants the shares to be judged on the basis of zonal attachment, which the UK says more closely represents the numbers of fish in UK waters than the system of historic catch patterns that are the foundation of the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy. The EU wants reciprocal access to UK waters “under existing conditions” and for the fisheries agreement to be part of the free trade agreement and rules out yearly negotiations. The next round of Brexit negotiations will be held next week on video conference because of the coronavirus pandemic. The previous round ended in mutual recrimination. Mr Frost and Mr Barnier exchanged bad-tempered public letters as talks appeared on the point of collapse. The pressure is on both sides to deliver a breakthrough after repeated rounds ending in bad-tempered stalemate because next week is the final set of talks before a planned June summit to evaluate progress. Boris Johnson was expected to attend that “high-level meeting” Mr Frost told MPs. The meeting is the last chance for the UK to request an extension of up to two years to the Brexit transition period, which finishes at the end of this year. If the UK and EU fail to finalise the free trade deal by that deadline, and no extension is requested, both sides will be forced to trade on less lucrative WTO terms from January 1. Downing Street has repeatedly ruled out any extension to the transition period. Despite that, Michel Barnier wrote to Remain-supporting opposition MPs, telling them the EU was still ready to negotiate a delay. “I take note of your views on a possible extension of the transition period,” he said, “Such an extension of up to one or two years can be agreed.”Any extension would involve Britain paying the EU to remain part of the Single Market and Customs Union. Mr Frost told MPs he did not take orders from Boris Johnson\u0027s under fire adviser Dominic Cummings but admitted he spoke to Mr Cummings frequently and the prime minister only once a fortnight. He said he was confident that the Government\u0027s Brexit negotiating strategy would survive even if Mr Cummings was sacked. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/05/26/08/coronavirus-shopping.jpg","title":"coronavirus lockdown britain high street shops reopen social distance","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Face masks, hand sanitiser and a lot more queueing:\u0026nbspretailers across the UK are set to\u0026nbspopen up to a different world, and shoppers may find it a difficult experience to get to grips withBritain’s high streets will begin to get back to something like normality next month when non-essential retailers are allowed to open their doors again after almost three months in lockdown.That will come as some relief for businesses, many of which were already struggling before the coronavirus pandemic hit.But what will the socially distanced shopping experience be like?Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWe have a rough idea of what to expect from supermarkets’ approach: limited numbers of people in stores means there will be queues outside shoppers will be greeted by employees wearing face masks and maybe other PPE perspex screens will shield checkouts. There will be hand sanitiser readily available and arrows on the floor directing us which way round to go. Ikea and John Lewis are among retailers to have said they will introduce “social distance wardens” to ensure people are kept apart and obeying the rules. High streets are also likely to be a lot quieter than we’re used to. Only a relatively small percentage of shops are likely to open their doors on 15 June as most retailers have said they will take a gradual approach, testing out the new way of doing things on their most spacious and easily adapted stores.Johnson urges Britons to return to the shops and spend next monthNext, for example, says it will open just 25 of its 500 UK stores on the first day. John Lewis has also said it will take a cautious approach to reopening. Richard Lim, chief executive of consultancy Retail Economics, forecasts that shopping centres will be even slower to reopen than high streets because people will prefer to shop in local, familiar, open-air environments, rather than travel to large complexes.He points out that shopping centres often attract consumers looking for a day out by offering an array of food options and other leisure experiences, nearly all of which will remain closed.Some chains have simply stopped paying rent on stores that are closed and will be reluctant to reopen shopping centre locations (which tend to be the most expensive) when they don’t know how many shoppers will come through the door.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some people, particularly those most vulnerable to Covid-19, will still not feel comfortable heading to the shops to be exposed to large numbers of people.Others will have grown used to the ease of online shopping while many more may have lost their jobs or be concerned about their financial position.“There is potentially a big gap between what people expect the experience of shopping will be like and the reality of that experience when retailers reopen,” says Lim.“Shopping is all about having a social experience, it’s supposed to be enjoyable. It might be a shock to some people, being met with a shop-floor worker wearing a mask, being asked to sanitise your hands, and have a social distancing warden walking around telling people to stay in certain areas. “It could really undermine that experience and just push people even more towards online shopping.”Which non-essential shops are reopening and when will it happen?Millions of garment workers facing destitution as demand dries upShoppers return to UK high streets after dire 2019 tradingLim believes the impacts of the guidance will be felt very unevenly across the retail sector depending on a number of factors.Value clothing retailers like Primark are likely to find things tough because their stores need a lot of people coming through to make a profit. People also pick up and put down items often and the stock is normally densely packed, something that will have to be reconsidered in a socially distanced era.Footwear retailers will find things even tougher as the way we buy shoes is forced to change. The new guidelines require a shoe shop to take any shoe that has been tried on by a customer and store it for 72 hours before putting back out on the shop floor. That will make storage impractical and could leave stores unprofitable.“We are likely to see a step change in retailers’ efforts to merge online and offline shopping experiences,” says Lim. That will be through more click-and-collect services, and more inventive ways to get people in stores and excited by what they see. If they then buy online after that it doesn’t matter.Lim points to the example of Zara in Shanghai which is “like an art exhibition”. “You then go to a changing room and the items are waiting there for you in your size or you just press a button and get it delivered to your home.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?This model of the shop as more of a showcase is one that many retailers have been moving towards, but it requires significant investment at a time when many will be tightening their belts.Whatever happens, retailers need a significant turnaround in their fortunes or there will almost certainly be large-scale store closures, job losses and collapses into administration.Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, sums it up: “Lockdown has cost non-food stores £1.8bn a week in lost revenues and with sales expected to remain weak, even as shops begin to reopen, many retailers will still be in a fight for survival. “Government must act to ensure that retail rents take account of the ongoing crisis in the industry. Swift action would protect jobs and businesses – helping retail to play its part in restarting the UK economy.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Financial Times reported that the Treasury’s plans will include barring companies from putting any more employees on furlough.This measure is aimed at preventing firms from putting workers on furlough who would otherwise have been kept on full time, only to bring them back part time with the state picking up some of the wage bill.Ministers will be hoping that, as the economy gradually reopens, companies can survive without government support.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Allowances are more generous for couples and families, but remain lower than in many other European countries.Businesses could find their recovery hampered by high levels of debt built up to get them through the worst of the crisis.Banks have approved “bounce back” loans totalling £18.5bn for 465,000 smaller businesses.

Sales shot up particularly sharply in the four weeks to mid-May, rising 17 per cent.Ice cream and alcohol sales surged 40 per cent and 50 per cent respectively on the Thursday before Britain enjoyed a long weekend to celebrate VE Day from 8 May.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWith the sun shining on large parts of the country for much of the last four weeks, shoppers have bought more chilled dips, crisps and fizzy drinks, Kantar said.Separate data from Nielsen showed that online grocery sales more than doubled in the four weeks to 16 May compared to last year as some shoppers chose to avoid stores, many of which have seen queues as chains introduce social distancing measures.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?The research showed that a new demographic of older shoppers has bought food online for the first time.Supermarkets have benefited from the closure of restaurants, bars and catering businesses which normally serve up a third of the country’s meals.Takeaway restaurants have also been able to capitalise on changing habits as diners are forced to stay indoors, with Kantar registering a big per cent spike in sales.“It’s not just groceries experiencing a boom – people missing their favourite restaurants and wanting to treat themselves have pushed takeaway deliveries up by 250 per cent year on year,” said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar.However, the surge is not enough to make up for lost sales on the premises which in normal times make up the bulk of restaurant revenues.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Financial Times reported that the Treasury’s plans will include barring companies from putting any more employees on furlough.This measure is aimed at preventing firms from putting workers on furlough who would otherwise have been kept on full time, only to bring them back part time with the state picking up some of the wage bill.Ministers will be hoping that, as the economy gradually reopens, companies can survive without government support.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Allowances are more generous for couples and families, but remain lower than in many other European countries.Businesses could find their recovery hampered by high levels of debt built up to get them through the worst of the crisis.Banks have approved “bounce back” loans totalling £18.5bn for 465,000 smaller businesses.

The rocket and capsule that will carry the astronauts has been built by Elon Musk\u0027s SpaceX, and the mission represents the final test of both.Nasa and SpaceX launch could be delayed by weatherIt will also be the first time a private company has attempted to send astronauts into space.Here\u0027s everything you need to know about this mission, which will launch at 8.22pm UK time on Saturday.The mission, known as Demo-2, will allow the US to once again send humans into space.According to Nasa, this is a demonstration mission to show SpaceX\u0027s ability to ferry astronauts to the space station and back safely.It is the final major step required by SpaceX\u0027s astronaut carrier, the Crew Dragon, to get certified by Nasa\u0027s Commercial Crew Programme for more long-term manned missions to space.Mr Behnken, 48, and Mr Hurley, 53, are experienced Nasa astronauts who have been involved in testing of the Crew Dragon capsule.Mr Hurley, who was a fighter pilot in the US Marine Corps, was on the final flight of the space shuttle Atlantis in 2011 before it was discontinued.Mr Behnken was a flight test engineer with the US Air Force before joining Nasa, and has spent just over 29 days in space, which includes 37 hours of spacewalking time.He will serve as the mission\u0027s joint operations commander and take responsibility for the rendezvous, docking and undocking of the Dragon capsule, while Mr Hurley will be in charge of the launch, landing and recovery of the vehicle in his role as the Crew Dragon spacecraft commander.The two men will be wearing spacesuits designed by SpaceX with help from Hollywood costume designer Jose Fernandez.The Falcon 9 rocket will take off from launchpad 39A at the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraft with Mr Behnken and Mr Hurley strapped inside.Shortly after lift-off, the rocket will separate into what is called a first stage and a second stage.The first stage will return to a SpaceX landing ship which will be stationed in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida, while the second part of the rocket continue the journey with the Crew Dragon.Once in orbit, the Crew Dragon will then separate from the second stage and travel at around 17,000mph before being in a position to rendezvous, and dock, with the space station 24 hours later.Mr Behnken and Mr Hurley will test the Crew Dragon\u0027s environmental control system, the displays and controls, and the manoeuvring thrusters.They will also monitor the autonomous docking system during the approach to the space station, according to Nasa.The duo will become members of the Expedition 63 crew and perform further tests on the Crew Dragon along with other tasks related to the space station.But the pair\u0027s main mission is to conclude the validation process that is required by Nasa to ensure the spacecraft designed to carry astronauts can operate safely.The Demo-2 mission is expected to last anything between one and four months. But Nasa said the duration of this mission would be determined by when the next commercial crew will be able to travel to the space station.The spacecraft will be capable of staying in orbit for at least 210 days.When it is time to return, the Crew Dragon will autonomously undock with Mr Behnken and Mr Hurley on board and depart the space station.Shortly after firing up its engines to re-enter the Earth\u0027s atmosphere, the spacecraft will deploy four parachutes to slow its descent and splash down in the Atlantic Ocean, just off the coast of Florida.SpaceX\u0027s recovery ship, called Go Navigator, will be waiting nearby to retrieve the duo and ferry them to Cape Canaveral.In 2010, the US started to wind down its space shuttle programme which had carried astronauts into orbit for three decades with the aim of focusing on building technology for Moon and Mars missions.Nasa asked private companies such as Space X and Boeing to design the technologies which would allow passengers to travel to space, while opting to pay Russia to send American astronauts to the space station as an interim arrangement.If Demo-2 is successful, SpaceX will be allowed to go ahead with more manned missions to the space stations as part of their 2.6 billion US dollar (£2.1 billion) contract with Nasa.Boeing also has a similar deal with the space agency, worth 4.2 billion US dollars (£3.4 billion), to send astronauts to the space station in its CST-100 Starliner crew capsule, although its vehicle is not expected to be ready until next year.Both Nasa and SpaceX will be hosting live streams of the events, which will begin a few hours before launch. Tune in earlier to get a look at the astronauts as they are driven to the spacecraft before they set off, as well as for discussions about the mission with experts.Nasa\u0027s live coverage will be hosted on Nasa TV, which can be watched here, via YouTube, as well as on the space agency\u0027s official site:SpaceX\u0027s coverage will be hosted on its own website too, on a launch page that currently gives a full rundown of how the day will play out.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is possible to track it in real-time using a tool developed by the European Space Agency.Everything you need to know about the Nasa SpaceX launchA 2019 survey by YouGov found that only 32 per cent of British people thought private companies should take astronauts to the ISS.

Sales shot up particularly sharply in the four weeks to mid-May, rising 17 per cent.Ice cream and alcohol sales surged 40 per cent and 50 per cent respectively on the Thursday before Britain enjoyed a long weekend to celebrate VE Day from 8 May.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWith the sun shining on large parts of the country for much of the last four weeks, shoppers have bought more chilled dips, crisps and fizzy drinks, Kantar said.Separate data from Nielsen showed that online grocery sales more than doubled in the four weeks to 16 May compared to last year as some shoppers chose to avoid stores, many of which have seen queues as chains introduce social distancing measures.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?The research showed that a new demographic of older shoppers has bought food online for the first time.Supermarkets have benefited from the closure of restaurants, bars and catering businesses which normally serve up a third of the country’s meals.Takeaway restaurants have also been able to capitalise on changing habits as diners are forced to stay indoors, with Kantar registering a big per cent spike in sales.“It’s not just groceries experiencing a boom – people missing their favourite restaurants and wanting to treat themselves have pushed takeaway deliveries up by 250 per cent year on year,” said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar.However, the surge is not enough to make up for lost sales on the premises which in normal times make up the bulk of restaurant revenues.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Researchers found 70 per cent of parents do not have any type of external support in providing care and education for their children.The study, which polled 3,055 working parents in the UK, America, France, Germany, and Italy, found similar gendered patterns in other countries too.Researchers found women with children across these countries now spend an average of 65 hours a week on unpaid labour around the house — with this figure having almost doubled since the Covid-19 crisis. This is almost a third more than fathers, who are doing an average of 50 hours a week.It comes after a study by the London School of Economics recently found coronavirus is exacerbating the gender gap as women bear the brunt of childcare responsibilities and homeschooling during lockdown — whether they’re working or not.I founded the Wages for Housework campaign – little has changed sinceThe report found women are more likely to deal with homeschooling, childcare and chores around the house even if they are juggling this with working at the same time.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Together with the way we are adapting our working lives to cope during the lockdown, this gives me hope that in the long term, a more equal society will emerge.”The report found women are more likely than men to lose their jobs in the forthcoming recession because a larger number work in sectors — such as hospitality, leisure, tourism and the arts — that are forecast to be hardest hit.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Hundreds of thousands have added their names days after it emerged Dominic Cummings had travelled from London to Durham in April to be close to potential childcare and then to nearby town Barnard Castle.The number of people who had signed the petition on Change.org – called ‘”Dominic Cummings must be sacked” – stood at around 908,726 on Thursday morning. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe prime minister has backed his top aide during the controversy, saying on Wednesday it was time to “move on” from allegations the senior advisor broke rules of the lockdown over coronavirus. Most of the British public think Mr Cummings should quit, according to a poll conducted earlier this week after the aide’s televised speech explaining his movements.  Created with Sketch.Newspapers react after Johnson stands by Cummings Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Seventy-one per cent of people in the YouGov survey thought the PM’s chief advisor had ignored government regulations when he drove more than 200 miles to his parents’ estate in Durham at the height of the lockdown. Meanwhile, 59 per cent of those polled thought Mr Cummings should quit his post. Scores of Conservative MPs have called for the PM’s chief advisor to be sacked or to resign. In a press conference on Monday, the government aide defended travelling from London to Durham with his family in April, saying he believed he behaved “reasonably”.He said they drove north to be near family who had offered childcare in case him and his wife became too ill to look after their four-year-old son.

She did not want to risk a nearly 300-mile drive with our child given how ill I had been.“We agreed that we should go for a short drive to see if I could drive safely, we drove for roughly half an hour and ended up on the outskirts of Barnard Castle town. We did not visit the castle, we did not walk around the town.”Mr Cummings said he had felt a “bit sick” so they had walked about 10 to 15 metres to the riverbank where they sat for about 15 minutes until he felt better.Claimed he had previously warned of coronavirus pandemicMr Cummings used the briefing to insist he, contrary to some reports, had not resisted the introduction of lockdown measures and had in fact previously warned of the dangers of a coronavirus pandemic.“For years, I have warned of the dangers of pandemics. Last year I wrote about the possible threat of coronaviruses and the urgent need for planning,” he said.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

silence at Guy\u0027s HospitalMr Cummings did in fact write an entry on his blog in March 2019, which more specifically examined the possibility of a deadly outbreak being triggered by a coronavirus accidentally released from a laboratory during scientific experiments. However, there have been suggestions that the reference to coronavirus was actually added to the blog in April 2020.Scientists currently believe Sars-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, jumped from animals to humans as the product of natural evolution.Described his family’s farm as ‘sort of concrete blocks’The PM’s senior adviser insisted that his trip to Durham to isolate was not because the property on his family’s farm was a “nice place to be”.“The point about it was not that it was some nice place to be. If you have been there, you would see that it\u0027s sort of concrete blocks,” he said.“The point about it was not that it was a nice place to be, but that it was the safest place to be in the circumstances – and it meant that I didn\u0027t have to expose other people to risk unless I absolutely had to in a critical emergency.”Didn’t make inquiries about childcare in London before making tripMr Cummings used the briefing to insist the journey had been necessary because he and his wife had no reasonable childcare options in London if they both fell ill with coronavirus.“I suddenly got a call from my wife who was at home looking after our four-year-old child,” he explained in a prepared statement.“She told me she suddenly felt badly ill, she vomited and felt like she might pass out, and there would be nobody to look after our child. None of our usual childcare options were available.”However, in subsequent questioning from journalists, Mr Cummings later admitted he did not make inquiries about potential childcare in London.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The health secretary insisted Boris Johnson’s most senior adviser “was acting within the guidelines” and understood why some members of the public disagreed with him. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Hancock, however, sidestepped whether Mr Cummings did the “right thing” when asked six times by presenter Nick Robinson. Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I’ve answered this question before a couple of days ago and the prime minister has answered all these questions endlessly,” Mr Hancock said. Challenged that Mr Johnson had “not answered the moral case of whether he did the right thing”, the health secretary said: “Well, I’ve said I think he was acting within the guidelines. I also understand why reasonable people might disagree with that.” Created with Sketch.How coronavirus lockdowns changed the world\u0027s most polluted cities Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Putting the question to Mr Hancock again, Mr Robinson added: “What matters is not dodging the question am asking you. These are your words – you say duty, you say right thing, you say do your bit and what people are saying to you is Mr Cummings did none of those and whenever ministers are asked they and dodge the question. So did he do the right thing?” The cabinet minister replied: “Far from dodging the question, Nick, I’ve directly answered it because my judgement is that as has been told in great deal in public my view is that he followed the guidelines. I understand why some people don’t agree with that but that is my view.”Responding to dozens of Tory MP calling on Mr Cummings to resign from his No 10 role and warnings that constituents will no longer follow lockdown rules, Mr Hancock also said the “vast majority of people will understand that it is in everybody’s interest” to do so. Earlier Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said the new contacting tracing programme to be launched in England on Thursday risked being undermined by prime minister’s continued support for Mr Cummings - despite considerable public anger. Under the new system – viewed as vital in curbing the spread of the virus – people will be asked to isolate for 14 days if they come into contact with someone infected with coronavirus, even if they do not have symptoms. A team of tracers will contact anyone who has been within two metres of an infected person for more than 15 minutes without protective equipment.Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Ashworth said: We need everybody to co-operate with this because it\u0027s in all of our interests that this works, and I\u0027m sorry, I\u0027ve got to say it, it\u0027s why I think Matt Hancock\u0027s support of Dominic Cummings is really irresponsible.My worry is some people will think \u0027Why should I stay at home for two weeks on my own when I feel fine, while this guy who\u0027s Boris Johnson\u0027s big pal in Downing Street can get away with travelling across the country to Durham?\u0027The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

One son, aged around 15, was allegedly discovered living in the basement after Mr Gray admitted this to authorities. “The house was filled with urine smell, faeces throughout the house, partially flooded basement,” said the Roane County court on Monday. Investigators searched the address over the weekend after someone told police that the youngest child was walking alone near the family home. Whilst his parents were unaware, Roane County authorities located the child who allegedly told them about the basement and the other child buried in the backyard, reported WVLT News. Detectives then arrived at the house to investigate.The couple also admitted that the children had not received medical or dental attention for at least six years prior to the investigation. At the same time, authorities said the children had “stunted growth” and that the parents had withheld food from them as punishment. The couple could face further charges.

as long as coronavirus cases are low enough.But worried Brits dont want the lockdown lted yet, with fewer than one in five supporting the reopening of schools, restaurants, stadiums and pubs."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus lockdown animals abandoned neglected rspca","story":"RIDDLED with fleas, stuffed in a dirty cardboard box and left in an alleyway to die at just three weeks old - this was the fate of five kittens abandoned during lockdown.With millions of Brits bunkered down indoors, whoever left them would have known their desperate mews for help would only sound to empty streets, but they heartlessly dumped them anyway.Miraculously, the helpless pets were rescued by the RSPCA and are now recovering, but regular cases of shocking animal cruelty and neglect are still all too frequent in lockdown - with the majority at risk of going unnoticed.Since the government restrictions began, RSPCA rescuers have so far dealt with , incidents of animal cruelty, neglect and suffering.Its cruelty hotline has received , reports of abandonment - an average of  incidents a day.As theyre only able to currently deal with emergencies, the animal charity fears the reports theyre receiving are just the tip of the iceberg, with people less likely to see or report animal abuse in the current climate. Workers facing money troubles after being furloughed or axed from jobs have also sparked concerns pets could be abandoned as households struggle to pay the bills. With routine operations like neutering on hold, theres likely to be an influx in unwanted litters and the number of animals in rescue care is expected to increase after lockdown.Here, Sun Online speaks to the key workers responsible for rescuing distressed and neglected animals, and takes a closer look at the abuse happening during lockdown.Sickeningly, in one of the worst cases since shutdown, last month a tortured cat was found skewered, burned and lying dead on a disposable barbecue in Doncaster.The animal was so badly burned it was impossible to tell what colour its fur was.The woman who found the remains and reported the incident to the RSPCA said: At first, I thought it was some sort of stuffed toy, but when I got closer, I realised it wasn’t.“It was absolutely horric. The look on its poor little face suggested it must have been tortured and died in agony.In another violent attack, a nesting swan was shot in the face with an air rle - one of five shocking attacks in a ten day period leaving four swans injured and one dead.The bird was targeted in Thatcham, Berkshire, while tending to her unhatched eggs, and needed an operation to remove the mm pellet.With less park workers and members of the public around to witness such horrors, these creatures are left defenceless against vile attackers.Even more worryingly, the public was recently warned to be wary about animal abuse after a spike in domestic violence during lockdown.The Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals highlighted the “strong link” between violence against humans and the abuse of animals in households, and urged people to get in touchthey become aware of animals in danger.RSPCA chief inspectorate officer Dermot Murphy tells Sun Online: There’s a recognised link between domestic violence and violence against animals... and they can be used as a tool to control vulnerable people, for example threats to hurt the dogthe [victim] says anything. We haven’t seen an increase in [abuse] reports so far - but this could be because it is going on behind closed doors.We also normally get reports when people are taking animals out on the street, or when a neighbour sees someone beating a dog in a garden. Reports have tailed away but I suspect it hasn’t gone away. I think people might [turn a blind eye], and especially being home all the time, they may be more reticent about reporting a neighbour, whereas usually they wouldthey werent home as much.There may be a feeling that they might be suspected for reporting it, and as theyre stuck at home they arent going to do it now.Animal collection officer Cara Gibbon is responsible for rescuing sick and injured animals, currently dealing with up to  emergency rescues a day during lockdown.“We’re dealing with a lot of cats being abandoned in lockdown - I’ve definitely seen an increase, she says.Every week Im seeing kittens being abandoned in boxes, and older cats too.Last week for example I rescued five kittens that had been abandoned in a box down an alleyway in Birmingham. A woman called in to say she’d found them and they were only three weeks old, which is way too young to be on their own. They were covered in fleas, and were so poorly, with really pale gums, they had flea anaemia.The -year-old, from Birmingham, has worked for the RSPCA for ten years and insists the kittens would have died had they not been picked up.It’s distressing, especially when you know a human is responsible, she says. It’s not just their mum has left them - someone has put them in a box and just dumped them knowing they might not be found and that’s heartbreaking.“There are a lot of rumours going round about animals carrying Covid on their fur. It could be down to selling issues, or people can’t afford them.Despite her decade of experience, Cara admits some parts of the job, like seeing an animal abandoned, never get easier. When dogs have been tied up at the side of the road with a note to say they’ve come from a loving home - it really gets to me, she says.Logistically, its been hard for animal rescuers to continue their roles while adhering to the social distancing laws too.“I’m not going into homes unless I absolutely have to - I had to when rescuing a pigeon stuck in a chimney so I made sure I wore a mask, overalls, shoe covers and gloves, Cara says.“My colleagues have had people going into hospital with Covid symptoms and their animals have been left behind.In this instance they’ve had to suit up completely, with a breathing mask, with proper PPE, and take the animals to a rescue centre and look after them until the owner is out of hospital.For Dermot, one of the main worries is what happens when lockdown ends, and the RSPCA has a clearer picture of the levels of neglect and abuse, as well as a potential influx of unwanted pets being abandoned. Since lockdown began there has been a huge demand for pets, with pet insurance providers seeing a % increase in people registering new animals as they look for company at home.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.“We’re trying to focus on the most serious incidents currently, but I’m more worried about what will happen when we come out of [lockdown] - about what the impact will be on animal welfare issues that we aren’t yet aware of, he explains.My concern is also that people take on an animal during lockdown, such as a dog, and then once it’s back to normal it could be an inconvenience and they will look to abandon them as they haven’t thought through the lelong commitment“We’ve also seen it in the past when we’ve had periods of recession when people can’t afford food or veterinary treatment.The first thing they can do is find a new home for the animal,they’re responsible, or turn them out. Its not the best time to introduce a dog to the house either.Lets hope at the very least, most new pet owners realise a dog is for le - not just for lockdown.To help the RSPCA keep rescuing animals and keep animal hospitals and centres running through these unprecedented times, please donate whatever you can spare at www.rspca.org.uk covid.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They want Dom’s head on a skewer.In the last  weeks, nothing exemplies The Blob better than its handling of Coronavirus, the non-epidemic which has been allowed to drag this country into destitution.A public inquiry will examine precisely how this country stumbled unprepared into a predictable - and predicted - health emergency.The blame game is already under way.But it is already clear the NHS bureaucracy was caught flat-footed.Along with its blundering sidekick, Public Health England, it failed to provide frontline health staff - and likely Covid victims with the protection they deserved.Under pressure, the NHS panicked and made the decision to clear all beds for incoming coronavirus victims - while disastrously shunting elderly infected patients into care homes.PHE, the vast qango whose mission goal is to protect the nation from pandemics, failed abysmally to provide the testing needed as a first line of defence.Neither of these two bodies thought fit to build the necessary stockpile of Personal Protection Equipment, leaving frontline medical staff exposed to the virus.Meanwhile, along came Bonking Boffin Neil Ferguson who created Lockdown panic with fantasy claims of half a million likely dead - a figure no other scientist has supported.Indeed, highly qualied professionals including a Nobel prize-winning Stanford Professor of Chemistry, Michael Levitt, insist NO lives were saved by lockdown.Sunetra Gupta, Oxford Professor of Theoretical Epidemiology, says the UK death rate from Coronavirus is -in-a-, with Lockdown an unnecessary “luxury”.“I think there’s a chance we might have done better by doing nothing at all,” she says.Prof Gupta echoes a growing view that Britain couldto normal tomorrow, opening pubs, nightclubs and festivals, without putting lives needlessly at risk.“It is very dangerous to talk about lockdown without recognising the enormous costs that it has on other vulnerable sectors in the population.“The truth is that lockdown is a luxury, and it’s a luxury that the middle classes are enjoying and higher income countries are enjoying at the expense of the poor, the vulnerable and less developed countries.“It’s a very serious crisis.”Prof Gupta is describing those Sun readers who will bear the brunt of the looming economic crash.It is fair to say that but for “experts” like Ferguson - who has a long and costly history of disastrous predictions - Lockdown would have been lted sooner and with less economic pain.It is also true that while most people - including me - stuck rigidly to Downing Street rules, countless thousands have broken them by leaving home and visiting relatives.Yes, Cummings and his we - both hit by Coronavirus - broke the letter of the Lockdown law by driving their -year-old son  miles north to self-isolation in Durham.In the same circumstances I would have done the same and so, I suspect, would many readers whatever their political views.Some will rightly insist our leaders should do as they preach.Others will be appalled by the curtain twitching informers who raced to spill the beans.To his credit - and now his cost - Dominic Cummings has never worried about upsetting his critics.He has given his many enemies, some inside the Tory Party, the perfect stick to beat him with.We should be careful before joining in this vendetta against a man who in his own unique way has spoken so effectively for the British people.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yes, as the chief advisor to the PM he should have known better.But who among the parents who viewed Dominic Cummings’ press conference didn’t feel a stab of recognition when he described the reasons he travelled to his parents home to find a carer for his four-year old son He may hold the reins of power.

I’m not.Eventhe enforcement is far from being perfect, it will still have a tremendous effect.According to the British Pub Association, four out of ten pubs are likely to cease to exist at the end of the crisis.Unlike many restaurants that can stay afloat selling takeaway food, pubs cannot generate income in lockdown.Anyone who says that short-term rationing of alcohol in pubs is not a price worth paying to get them to open up fast must have had one pint too many.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No, he hadn’t.“The country can see that and it’s shocked the Government cannot,” she added, before accusing the Prime Minister of “blind loyalty” to Cummings.Then she added, for good measure, that the country had reacted with “fury, contempt and anguish”.I suppose she thought she was speaking for the country with this tendentious, pompous bilge.She was not. She was speaking for herself and those in her North London liberal bubble.The BBC demands that its presenters remain neutral on political matters.Obviously, they don’t. But at least they usually pretend to. Maitlis can’t even manage that. Anyway, the complaints flooded in to Auntie.If this was the first time she’d crossed the line then maybe we might be a little lenient. But it’s not. Far from it.Last September, for example, she managed to force the BBC into that very rarest of things — a public apology, for her appalling behaviour and bias.In an interview she conducted on the programme she was, the BBC concluded, “sneering and bullying”, she was “too persistent and bullying” and “failed to be even-handed”.That was a landmark judgment. I have it framed on the wall of my downstairs khazi. Because the person she had been interviewing was ME.I had turned up to do a debate about Brexit. I was met with a wall of vituperation and abuse that even embarrassed the bloke I was supposed to be debating with, an affable Remainer chap called Tom Baldwin.The BBC warned Newsnight, its hopeless editor and Maitlis that such a breach of neutrality must not happen in the future.It has happened again. So what are they going to do about it  The BBC has admitted Newsnight got it terribly wrong.And will do nothing. Again.Here’s the other thing. I was sacked by the BBC for breaching its code of neutrality. Rightly.I had written an article about how much I hated fox hunting and fox hunters, right at the time the Government was planning to ban the cruel, obnoxious sport.The BBC was right then. But at least I hadn’t broadcast those views on the BBC itself, or allowed them to influence the programme I edited, the Today programme. It was just stuff I wrote in a leftie newspaper.Maitlis broadcasts her idiotic views on her programme!The BBC has to be consistent about this or drop the pretence of neutrality altogether.And for Emily — have some guts, woman.You want a  for your views  Go work for a radio station in the private sector, or get a newspaper column,you can.The BBC has, in the main, behaved well over Covid. But always with the exception of Newsnight.Always with the exception of Maitlis.IF you remember, just before lockdown, it was rumoured that the Spice Girls might get back together.There were gigs planned for next month.“Christ help us,” we all thought. And then we all got down on our knees and thanked Covid for scuppering that idea.Now, however, lockdown looks like it will be eased. Which means they might well fix some new dates. Yikes, etc.I suppose we could tell them the latest scientic news. Singing, apparently, is really bad for spreading the virus everywhere.Choirs and stuff have been banned in some countries. So we could try that line.But then I suppose Sporty and Co might well reply: “You could hardly call what we do singing.”DID you see those hacks questioning the Prime Minister’s adviser, Dominic Cummings on Monday One after another they all stepped up, wreathed in self-importance.And all asked exactly the same question. Over and over again. And therefore got exactly the same response.What the hell is the point of that Did they all think that they would be the only person to ask: “Why is it one law for you and one law for everyone , Mr Cummings ”Did they think they were dead clever coming up with that line Incredible. Thick as a plate of mince, some of us journos.GLORY, glory. Denmark is to open its borders once again.You can travel to the countryyou can prove that you’re dating someone Danish.In my case I think I’d choose one of the models Maja Krag or Terese Pagh Teglgaard – crazy names, crazy girls. I don’t know how I’d prove it to the Danish customs people.Maybe just show them a photoshopped picture of me and Maja out on the town.Anyway, that’syou WANT to visit Denmark.I went there once and was pretty underwhelmed. It was like a middle-class version of Lincolnshire.SO what exactly have YOU accomplished during lockdown A few jigsaw puzzles and watched the entirety of Netflix Listen to this. In  the Bubonic Plague struck London once again. Cambridge University was closed down.And so the young Isaac Newton was forced to leave his studies andhome to Grantham, Lincs, under lockdown.And during this spare time he invented the branch of mathematics known as calculus. And then he discovered the laws of gravity.Oh, and formulated a theory of light which dominated science for the next century and beyond. All done under lockdown.And what have I done  Put out the patio furniture and completed a giant jigsaw puzzle of my own face.Depressing, innit FUNNY, isn’t it, how most of the people screaming blue murder about Dominic Cummings were fervent anti-Brexiteers Cummings was the key architect of the Vote Leave campaign – and the Remoaners utterly loathe the bloke.Among the Remoaners screaming their little heads off are a bunch of Church of England bishops.These include Leeds Bishop “Nick” Baines, who has referred to the Prime Minister as a “liar” and a “bully”.No wonder the Church of England’s attendances have collapsed over the past  years.The Cof E is another institution that has lost its moral compass and is utterly out of step with the rest of the country.THE Chinese government is bullying Hong Kong once again.Thousands of armed police are on the streets, battling protesters.The row is over a new law which makes it a criminal offence to take the p*** out of the Chinese national anthem.Only a deeply insecure totalitarian state would create such a law.Meanwhile, the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, has told his people to “prepare for war”.I don’t know who against.I think Xi has finally understood that the rest of the world is sick to the back teeth of his foul, bullying, communist dictatorship.And once this Chinese pandemic is over we might be more inclined to stand up for ourselves.THE Home ­Secretary Priti Patel is determined to stop economic migrants flooding here from across the Channel.She wants new powers to send boats back to France.

More than a third said they would bring the majority of their furloughed workers back part-time from August.Mr Sunak has already announced that employers will be able to furlough staff part-time, but has yet to announce details of how this will work.Jonathan Geldart, boss of the IoD, said: The furlough scheme is protecting millions of jobs. Business leaders know that the Governments support cant be infinite, but the ugly truth is thattheres no money coming in the door, many firms will be forced to make dficult decisions come August.Directors will be fighting tooth and nail to avoid this scenario. There is hope that as more areas of the economyto work, more companies can keep people on board.However, despite best efforts, many firms simply wont be able to work at full capacity for the foreseeable future and theres no magic wand to lt demand back up again.The Government must soften the blow by introducing as much flexibility as possible into the furlough system. The more flexible the scheme is, the better firms can recover, and the fewer jobs will rely on state subsidy.With the prospect of job losses and businesses struggling to create new roles in the months ahead, the spotlight will be on our training system.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He also attempted to master Japanese during two seasons at League club Nagoya Grampus Eight.Gary explains why sticking to your mother tongue could be an own goal, both on and off the pitch . . .MASTERING a language is one of the most important things you can do.That became apparent to me when, on arriving in Spain, I decided to buy some furniture.Keen that my bedside cabinets had drawers, I asked the shop assistantthey had two tables “con cojones”.The poor woman burst out laughing and explained that in Spanish, drawers are “cajones” not “cojones” — I’d accidentally asked for two tables with testicles.I couldn’t speak a word of Spanish when I signed for Barcelona but I knew I needed to learn the lingo.I had realised that players at foreign clubs who immerse themselves in the culture do better on the pitch than those who don’t.I looked to greats such as Kevin Keegan, who learned German when he joined Hamburg, and Ray Wilkins, who mastered Italian at AC Milan.Then there were others — who I won’t name — who were lured abroad just for the bigger pay packet back in the day and barely lasted a season.I’d studied a small amount of French and German at school but I was so focused on becoming a footballer I didn’t put the effort in.I had a bit of a wake-up call over my lack of language skills on my first day of training.It’s a shock to the system being in a changing room full of blokes bantering and you have no idea what they are saying.Luckily, the team took me under their wing. On the bus to the training grounds Barcelona keeper Andoni Zubizarreta drew a stick man and woman and taught me all the body parts.To get a firmer grip on the language I avoided the ex-pat nightclubs out there and enrolled in a Spanish language class with my then we Michelle and my team-mate Mark Hughes.Poor Mark was only  and struggled with the classes. I think he dropped out after two or three but Michelle and I stuck with it.For two years, three times a week after training, we’d go to school to learn Spanish.It was tough at first as no English was allowed in the classroom, but looking back it did me a world of good.I started playing football when I was small and the skills came naturally. Learning a language was the opposite. It was really hard work and not something that came easily to me.So I made sure I read Spanish newspapers every day and watched the local TV stations. In two months I could get by. After six months I was getting pretty good and in a year I was speaking pretty much fluently.By the time I left in  I was thinking and dreaming in Spanish.From the get go, I made sure I did my post-match interviews in the local language.EvenI didn’t always make sense, it sent out a strong message to the club that I was there for the long haul.Being able to talk to fans gained me a lot of respect and appreciation when I was over there.And when a match goes badly, the pitch can be a really lonely place. But because I was able to speak to my team-mates, it helped me through some tough times.When I went to play for Nagoya Grampus Eight in  it was a whole other story.I took eight months of Japanese lessons before I went out there, and did classes there too. But it is a very dficult language, with a completely dferent alphabet.I learned enough to get by but I was nowhere near as good at Japanese as I was with Spanish.It’s been more than  years since I lived in Barcelona and I’ll admit my Spanish is a bit rusty.Nowadays when I go there I’ll try to speak the language but Spaniards always want to speak to me in English.So many foreigners speak English that it can seem a pointless exercise trying to pick up another tongue.As a nation, we are not great at learning a second language, we can rest on our laurels slightly.But I would argue that it’s more important now than ever to learn, and at the moment we’ve all got the time to spare.Having a second language opens up so many opportun­ities to you and your kids, whether that’s working abroad or in hospitality in the UK.Travel might be shut at the moment, but that won’t be the case for ever and you’ll be giving your family a leg-up during this downtime.Children’s brains are like sponges, they pick up languages so much faster and better when they are younger.And there are so many online tools and courses that I wish I’d had at my disposal when I was first learning.Although I’d always warn against online translation tools — they give a very literal translation which doesn’t always make sense.For example,you type “it’s raining cats and dogs” into Google Translate it won’t mean anything to a foreigner in their own language.Getting kids to do anything can be tricky, as I’m sure mums and dads who are homeschooling have realised by now.In my Celebrity Supply Teacher episode I teach counting to ten in Spanish by doing keepy-ups.Soyou make it fun, it opens up an exciting new world for youngsters which doesn’t involve sitting at a desk.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

the reproduction number of the virus.He said: We don’t know until we see more evidence of the R effect continuing to reduce.Government scientists are meeting today to check whether the five tests have been met and they can safely go back.We do want young children to come back into schoolthe science indicates that its safe to do so, he added.Echoing education secretary Gavin Williamsons call for a cautious approach in reopening, Mr Gibb said the key was assuring that ing children to school does not result in an increase in the R factor.The Prime Ministers announcement earlier this month that it was the governments ambition to reopen schools was initially met with a furious backlash from teaching unions and local councils.More than  councils claimed they would refuse to reopen on June , citing safety concerns, and would either advise against opening or leave the decision in the hands of headteachers.But Mr Gibb appeared optimistic when asked about a potential stand-off between Westminster and councils.He told the committee: I am confident the vast majority of local authorities are planning to open for Reception, Year  and Year  on June , and for young people in Year  and Year  to come back for part of the time for face-to-face teaching.Last night the Prime Minister said while he “would like to reopen schools before the summer holidays, the decision was dependent upon the R rate.It comes as education secretary Gavin Williamson admitted at Tuesdays press conference that only “small numbers” of children will head back to class when England reopens its schools.Official government guidance requires schools to reorganise buildings to allow a maximum of  children in class.Mr Williamson also said “nervous” parents will not be punishedthey keep their kids home.But he added that the Covid- crisis could last another year and schools must start gradually reopening to stop kids falling “tragically” behind.Primaries will be allowed to stay shut past June  onlythey have “practical problems” sorting out the new class size cap, he said.Mr Williamson went on: “When you see other countries around the world who are quite a number of weeks ahead of us in terms of bringing schools back, you see small numbers of pupils in school for the first few weeks.“And then that rapidly starts to increase when people realise how much their children are missing out by not being in school.”To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.But the government have insisted they are taking a cautious approach by only sending a few year groups back into schools from next week.Equally, Mr Williamson claims that -

The popular host was absent from Wednesday nightaposs broadcast after the BBC ruled the programme breached impartiality rules over its coverage of Boris Johnsonaposs top aide. In her introduction to Tuesdayaposs show, she said the Prime Ministeraposs chief adviser had broken the rules and the country can see that, and itaposs shocked the Government cannot. The BBC said while Maitlis had been scheduled to present last nightaposs edition of the programme, Katie Razzall would take her place. However, in the early hours of Thursday morning Emily tweeted to say it was her decision not to appear on the show. She said: So grateful to my friend and excellent colleague Katie Razzall for stepping in this evening . She did so because I asked for the night off - knowing tonight’s prog would be in the most excellent hands. [sic] Newsnight editor Esme Wren said on Twitter Maitlis had not been replaced tonight in response to the BBC statement and that the programmeaposs staff work as a team throughout. Razzall also said her fellow presenter had not been asked by the BBC to take tonight off, adding that she certainly wouldnapost have agreed to present the showshe thought that was the case. In the Newsnight opening, Maitlis said: The longer ministers and the Prime Minister tell us he worked within [the rules], the more angry the response to this scandal is likely to be. He was the man, remember, who always got the public mood, who tagged the lazy label of elite on those who disagreed. He should understand that public mood now - one of fury, contempt and anguish. The National Union of Journalists criticised the BBC over its handling of the row. General secretary Michelle Stanistreet said: At a time of national crisis, frank and fearless journalism that scrutinises and holds this Government to account is more necessary than ever. She said it was clear as day that Mr Cummings breached lockdown rules, adding: Journalists should be congratulated for holding policymakers to account for actions that risk a monumental breach of trust during a public health crisis. The BBC said in a statement on Wednesday staff had been reminded of the guidelines around impartiality following the broadcast, adding that the corporation must uphold the highest standards of due impartiality in its news output. The statement added: Weaposve reviewed the entirety of last nightaposs Newsnight, including the opening section, and while we believe the programme contained fair, reasonable and rigorous journalism, we feel that we should have done more to make clear the introduction was a summary of the questions we would examine, with all the accompanying evidence, in the rest of the programme. As it was, we believe the introduction we broadcast did not meet our standards of due impartiality. Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan branded the BBC statement utterly disgraceful, adding that the BBC is chucking one of its best journalists under the bus for telling the truth. His words were echoed by journalist and former Newsnight economics editor Paul Mason, who said the decision made him sick. He tweeted: Every word Maitlis said was true: truth is the criterion of real journalism.

It could see healthy Brits forced to self-isolate at homethey have been in contact with a confirmed case. Call handlers will interview those in England who have tested positive and ask for details of anyone they have recently been near. Recent contacts who do not have symptoms will be called and asked to self-isolate at home for  days. Close contact is defined as being closer than metres to someone with symptoms for more than  minutes. Data will be analysed to decide whether workplaces, schools, housing estates or blocks of flats need to be locked down to quell local outbreaks. As the NHS test and trace app is not ready yet, all tracing will be performed manually. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: “As we move to the next stage of our fight against coronavirus, we will be able to replace national lockdowns with inidual isolation and,necessary, local action where there are outbreaks. “NHS Test and Trace will be vital to stopping the spread of the virus. It is how we will be able to protect our friends and family from infection, and protect our NHS. “This new system will help us keep this virus under control while carefully and safely lting the lockdown nationally.” The NHS has set up a new website nhs.uk coronavirus and launched a new dedicated phone number  for people to report symptoms and get tested. It comes after a series of hastily-arranged online briefings with journalists. It is understood the Government brought forward the launch amid the growing scandal surrounding Dominic Cummings breach of lockdown rules.  England has gone it alone before similar contact tracing networks are launched in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The NHS contact tracing app is thought to be weeks away from being ready for national roll-out. The original plan had been to launch the app alongside the , human contact tracers who will go live tomorrow It will use Bluetooth to detect mobile phones belonging to other app-users and noty the owner that they have been close to someone who has tested positive.

Baroness Dido Harding, the chair of the NHS Test and Trace Service, refused to give a date when the app would be ready. “This is a huge new public service that we are standing up,” she told a press briefing on Wednesday. “I’m sure there are stuff that we’re going to learn when we go live tomorrow. We will continue to test and learn over the next few days and weeks. “I fully expect there are things that we can do better as we aim to build an NHS Test and Trace Service that is world class. It’s not going to be world class on day one.” She added: “I see the app as the cherry on the cake, not the cake itself.” From Thursday anyone with symptoms in England will be able to access a testthey need one. Wales will follow from Saturday. The Government says it has the capacity to trace the contacts of , people who test positive each day.  Experts believe there are also around , new coronavirus infections daily. However there are thought to be around , people currently suffering with symptoms similar to Covid- but who do not have it. Rapid testing capacity will be crucial according to modelling by the Royal Society. Its Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemicscommittee found test track and trace would need to be carried out in three days to be effective. South Korea has averaged a two-to-three day turnaround. This includes a suspected case being tested, getting their results, being interviewed and having their contacts traced and also advised to self-isolate. Government testing tsar Prof John Newton confirmed the UK was aiming for this three-day turn around.  Prof Newton, Public Health England’s health improvement director, said: “Each inidual will have their risk assessed, which is why it’s quite a labour intensive process. “We are not doing for workplaces, for example, saying thatyou’re a teacher then anyone in that school is a ‘contact’. It’s going to be on inidual risk.” He said this should prevent “overreaction” and the “taking out of businesses” unncessarily. Someone will generally be deemed a “contact”they have been closer than one metre to a positive case, or between one and two metres away for at least  minutes. A new Joint Biosecurity Centre has been launched to work with local authorities to identy localised outbreaks. Mobile testing facilities could then be set up. Public Health England suggested in March regional lockdowns could be applied to towns and cities although this was not mentioned in the announcement. Hospital bosses have warned that local health officials have not been told how they fit in to the Government’s plan. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, said: “We need to build local test and trace capacity and that is simply not going to be in place.” It is unclear how GPs, district nurses and other health professionals can access testing data about local outbreaks. It comes amid plans to reopen schools and more sectors of the economy from Monday. Worrying findings from a contact tracing study in Sheffield found two thirds of Covid- patients did not fully cooperate. Many involved were care professionals amid suspicions people not entitled to sick pay were less likely to self-isolate.

You can unsubscribe at any time.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailLet’s begin with something Boris Johnson can’t bring himself to say but the rest of us know: Dominic Cummings broke the rules. It is as simple as that. His actions were an insult to the millions of people across Britain who have sacriced so much during this pandemic. In recent months, families have been forced to make the most agonising of decisions. People have been unable to see loved ones. Grandparents have been denied the chance to hold newborn grandchildren. Some of the most vulnerable in society have had to isolate alone. In the most tragic circumstances, people haven’t been able to say goodbye at the funerals of friends or loved ones.  The lockdown has been dficult for us all. There is no denying that. We miss each other. But, people have obeyed the rules because they understand the importance of our shared common goal our national purpose. Stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. That’s why, when the revelations about Dominic Cummings’ behaviour broke over the weekend, people were angry. And during the endless hours of press conferences over the Bank Holiday weekend, people were looking for an apology, a resignation or a plausible explanation from Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings about what happened. None was forthcoming.  Instead, we got a very simple message: it is one rule for them, another rule for everybody . I share people’s frustrations, not just because of the actions of one adviser, but because this has become a national distraction at a moment of national crisis. This was the week when we should have been talking about how we ease the lockdown safely. How we restart our economy, support businesses, get more children back to school.  Instead, the Prime Minister’s unwillingness or inability to do the right thing has left the Government looking untrustworthy, unprincipled. And worst of all they have undermined the very public health advice that is necessary to keep us all safe, just to keep one powerful aide in his job. In times like this, we need good government. A government that we can trust. A government that is entirely focused on saving lives. So, I say to the Prime Minister: we cannot go on like this. We cannot lose another week to this farce. We need to get back on track. When I was elected leader of the Labour Party, I made a promise to the British people. That I would work constructively with the Government. Challenging them when I thought mistakes were being made, offering my support when that was the right thing to do. I stand by that promise. That is why I will work constructively with the Government to help us through the next phase of this pandemic. The Prime Minister has promised a ‘world-beating’ test, track and trace system, when in fact what most people are looking for is a system that will work and will keep them safe. For Labour, that means rapidly increasing the amount of testing to at least a quarter of a million a day. It means recruiting an army of over , so-called ‘contract tracers’. And it means a nationwide phone app up and running by the  June, as we were previously promised. For the British people, it also means providing reassurance at time of huge anxiety. If you or a family member have symptoms, or you have been told to go into isolation, you want to know as soon as possible whether you have got this awful virus.

The Health Secretary is relying on the British public to do their civic duty and agree to self-isolate for two weeks eventheyaposre healthy, under new apostest and traceapos rules. He confirmed people will not receive penalties for not abiding by the NHS test and trace self-isolation period in the first instance.He said we are all on the same side in the fight against coronavirus.But asked whether the Prime Ministeraposs aide had done so, he refused to answer. He told the BBC: We are instructing people to stay at home for that -day period. Radio aposs Nick Robinson asked: They canapost drive  They canapost go to a beauty spot  Mr Hancock said: Well, the instructions are absolutely clear and they are that people should self-isolate at home for that -days, thataposs right. Mr Robinson noted that last time Mr Hancock said things were very clear and an instruction - Mr Cummings did something completely dferent. I think the vast majority of people will understand that it is in everybodyaposs interest that those who are at higher risk follow these requests from the NHS, these instructions, Mr Hancock said. And itaposs very, very important that they do. Mr Hancock said: I think as Iaposve said before, Iaposve answered that question and what matters...

He went on: Iaposve answered this question before, a couple of days ago, and the Prime Ministeraposs answered all of these questions endlessly.  Mr Robinson said: No, no, heaposs never answered the moral case, whether he did the right thing. Mr Hancock said: Well Iaposve said that he was acting within the guidelines. I also understand why reasonable people might disagree with that. But what matters... Mr Robinson interjected again: No, no, forgive me. What matters is not dodging the question that Iaposm asking you. Iaposm asking you, using your words, Secretary of State, these are your words.

An existing light-up digital sign bearing the government slogan stay alert, control the virus, save lives was already in place in Bridport, Dorset. But a second sign was apparently attached to the same stand, allowing a carve-out for Boris Johnsonaposs embattled aide sometime on Tuesday afternoon - reading ...except Dominic Cummings. According to Bridport News, Highways England was alerted to the errant signage this morning - but had no idea who put it there, or indeed who owned the land it was on. They said the sign is not their asset, nor is it located on the A. A spokesman for Dorset Council said: We are using temporary road signs at the request of the Department for Transport to help remind people of their responsibilities during the Covid- pandemic. It seems that a local anonymous prankster has added their opinion to one of our signs in west Dorset. The additional homemade sign is unauthorised so it will be removed. West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner David Jamieson says officers are reporting people breaking lockdown rules and using special adviser Dominic Cummingsapos actions as an excuse. Meanwhile, the head of NHS Providers urged Boris Johnson to acknowledge that public trust and confidence in the social distancing measures have been dented in the last few days.And West Midlands Police Commissioner David Jamieson said lockdown breakers are using Dominic Cummings as an excuse to flout the rules, making it aposalmost impossibleapos for officers to do their job Mr Jamieson told BBC Radio aposs The World At One programme that people are telling officers thatit is okay for Cummings, it is okay for us and it looks like there is one rule for us and another rule for the people in No  Downing Street. He said: Now you canapost...the rules are flexible, and people seem to have interpreted them who are at the heart of Government, then it is almost impossible then for police officers to be able to carry out their job effectively.

So many hundreds signed up after the deadline that we decided to do a second round of Britain Connects in early June. We will also re-match anyone whose partner didn’t show up in the first round.  Andyou feel inspired by these stories, sign up at britainconnects. Sue Shelmerdine, , a furloughed haberdashery assistant from Surrey, meets Joelle, , working from home in tech in London. Both are living alone.Born five decades apart, before the coronavirus crisis Sue Shelmerdine and Joelle’s paths might have been unlikely to cross.Conservative Leave voter Sue lives alone in Surrey, close to her two daughters and three grandchildren. Although she is , the former NHS worker has no plans to retire yet and works part-time in the haberdashery department at a fashion and home store. Joelle lives alone in London and works in the technology industry. She has two brothers who live nearby but most of her family is now abroad. The -year-old lived a busy, cosmopolitan le before lockdown but is now working from home.  Meanwhile, Sue has been furloughed but is desperate toto work. Introducing herself, Joelle says, “I have been so excited to meet someone new, someone dferent. “I like to connect with people I wouldn’t usually talk to, away from my own circle of friends. “I live alone and it has been dficult since lockdown. “I usually work in Central London and see so many people during my commute but the last few months have seen so many changes – especially not seeing family and friends.” Sue can relate to this. “I miss seeing my two children a lot,” she says. “But this pandemic has made my neighbours and I connect with each other. Nobody really knew one another before but we’ve started to get to know each other, especially when we’ve been coming out for the pm clap every Thursday.”  The pair have something  in common which is keeping them going – exercise. Sue says: “I moved into this house about two years ago and the garden has needed a lot of attention. So these last few weeks have been perfect for me to do some work in it. But I do go on my daily walks, which I love. I am very fond of walking but I miss my pilates classes, which I attend twice a week.” Joelle, who also enjoys going for walks, proudly tells Sue about joining online pilates classes, which she has signed up to during lockdown. The pair talk about the new skills they are learning, with Sue growing her own vegetables and continuing with her knitting while Joelle is keen to learn some new languages.

Parents of asthmatic children who are shielding are being advised to call their GPthey are concerned about them ing to the classroom. Health charity Asthma UK says the reopening of schools is a worrying time for parents of an estimated , children with asthma and also staff with the condition. Dr Andy Whittamore, Asthma UK’s clinical lead and a practising GP, said: “If your child is shielding, then you should not send them back to school. People who are shielding are classed as “clinically extremely vulnerable” and will have been told to shield by their GP. If your child is not shielding but someone in your household is, then your child should notto school unless they are able to maintain a aposstringentapos social distance from the person that is shielding, according to government advice. It is worth remembering that parents in England will not be finedthey do not send their children back to school at this time.He added: Asthma doesn’t make you more likely to get coronavirus, but unfortunatelypeople with long-term lung conditions like asthma get coronavirus, it can be more severe. The news come after Boris Johnson announced that some primary schools will reopen on June  for reception, Years  and  and nurseries.They are currently only open to children of key workers and vulnerable youngsters.  Some schools and colleges may also be able to offer some face to face contact and support for year  and year  pupils. The charity is urging parents to ensure their childaposs school has an up-to-date copy of their asthma action plan and a named, in-date reliever inhaler and spacer. Children who will be taught by a dferent teacher should be made aware of their condition and what they should dothey experience symptoms. Asthma UK also says bosses should ensure social distancing is practised at all times.  Several councils have said they will not be reopening their schools on June  including Liverpool, Hartlepool, Birmingham, and even Tory-run Solihull and Essex. Some are looking at later dates, some are still waiting to see what will happen, and some are suggesting s may be part-time - despite the government saying this isnapost an option. Plans to open schools with new measures such as class sizes halved, no toys, staggered breaks and one-way corridors have ided many in the teaching profession. They said they need time to prepare, and also want to see the full scientic evidence on whether itaposll be safe. Scientists have also said the government should wait until after a delayed test, track and trace app is up and running.

Schools Standards minister Nick Gibb told MPs that the cost of the scheme would be met by the Government over the break - which for many schools is this week - rather than just in term-time. Addressing a virtual Education Select Committee on Wednesday, Mr Gibb acknowledged the scheme had had a bumpy start with software issues, but he said it had delivered millions of pounds worth of food. Families eligible for free school mealsin England will continue to receive supermarket vouchers worth £ a week per child to buy food over the half-term while schools remain shut to most children. The decision comes after more than , people signed a petition urging the Government not to abandon children by taking away free lunches during half-term and the six-week summer holidays.The  Change.org petition was started by -year-old Christina Adane, from London, who is one of around . million pupils in England entitled to FSMs. She wrote: All kids have the right to get a decent lunch.On the news that the programme will be extended during the May half-term, Ms Adane said: Our voice has been heard. This really shows what we can achieve when we all campaign together. She added: Itaposs just a shame that this has only been properly confirmed today. The lack of clarity will almost certainly have meant that some children didnapost get the decent meal that was their right and some schools may not ultimately get the funding they need. Tulip Siddiq, Labouraposs shadow minister for children and early years, said announcing the plans in the middle of half-term was far too late. She said: Families have been extremely worried that they would not be able to feed their children properly this week as a result of the Governmentaposs initial reluctance. The fact that a petition of over , signatures was needed shows how much worry and confusion this has caused. Food poverty is sadly on the rise in this crisis. Free school meals are the only proper meal that some children get, so it is vital that they continue to be funded. James Bowen, director of policy at school leadersapos union NAHT, said: Whilst it is of course welcome news that the Government has now agreed to fund FSM over May half-term, it is not fair on school leaders, parents or pupils to make the announcement half-way through half-term itself. By leaving it so late to make arrangements the Government risks help not getting to those children that most need it.

To ensure there is enough space, schools will generally allocate Monday Tuesday or Thursday Friday slots for half the pupils to attend - with a deep clean carried out on the Wednesday. One school, Greatfield Park, has ensured siblings attending will be given the same slot to aid parents, and pupils will have a ‘special friend’ who they will be grouped with. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here Children of key workers will continue to attend school each day and home learning will continue to be provided for pupils who will not be attending. Parents have been given a choice as to whether their child attends school so fines against parentsapos non-attendance have been waived by the government. Drop off and collection times will be staggered with queues and marked walkways for parents and pupils to follow. Greatfield Park has announced five minute increments for ious year groups to arrive.  Another local school, Kingsholm, is using timeslots based on surnames, with parents being asked to drop children off alone, without siblings or other children. At Kingsholm, pupils will be dropped off by parents in to pens that will be sectioned with barriers as they arrive. Later, a member of staff will take each group to their classroom. There is also a set route parents must follow through the school site, arriving and leaving by dferent entrances. According to headteacher Jan Buckland, the pens will be “roughly a quarter of the size of a netball court” and the barriers will consist of “bollards with a bit of ceiling tape around to designate the area, some cones and things”. Another school, Lydbrook, have banned pupils bringing bags as the cloakroom areas will not be used.  Break times Again, schools will be staggering times to ensure less cross-contamination. At Lydbrook, pupils will be allotted in to select ‘bubbles’ during school time to avoid cross-contamination between the pupils. These “groups will not be able to mingle” during break times. The school kitchen will also be closed, with pupils expected to bring their own meals. Pupils who are provided free school meals will be provided with supermarket vouchers on a weekly basis.  At Kingsholm, markings have been placed on the ground on the way towards the toilets so that pupils know how far away to stand from one another as they queue. They’ve added that toilets will regularly be cleaned throughout the day. Supply to their water fountains have been cut off with pupils expected to bring their own water to school, plus select sinks and toilet will not be ing. At Greatfield Park, breakfast and after school clubs have been cancelled, as is the case at Kingsholm. It has also not been decided yet whether hot or cold food will be provided during lunch time.  In the classroom Across the board, classrooms will be more spaced apart with one pupil per table. Kingsholm say pupils will be expected to use their own equipment. The amount of books shared will be reduced. Plus certain toys will be removed from the school to avoid cross-contamination. Greatfield Park and Lydrook have explicitly banned toys from being brought to school. Greatfield Park will also provide stationery. The Cheltenham school will be making moves to re-build social development that may have been reduced during lockdown. They will be doing this by introducing outdoor team building activities , in-class sessions where pupils discuss their experiences during quarantine and activities specically designed to rebuild relationships.  Otherwise, core subjects Maths and English will be focused on to ensure smooth transition as pupils progress to the next year of education. How will social distancing be enforced between the children  Schools have cautioned they cannot guarantee social distancing, however informative posters outlining the importance of social distancing will be plastered across the school walls. All schools across have said they will stress the importance of social distancing measures, although this may be more challenging to instill in younger children. Mrs Buckland, head of Kingsholm, said: “Talking about nursery children, we cannot guarantee at all social distancing but we will encourage. We will have adults who sit in places to steer children away from each other.”  She went on to say that pupils who do not follow socially distancing instructions on purpose will be sent home after a three strike rule has been deployed. “We will talk to the parents,a child is being [non-compliant] then what we will do is phone the parents and the parents will then have to come and collect them,” she said. What have parents been asked to do  Greatfield Park have requested parents strip children of all their clothes as soon as they get home and to make sure they wash. The action plan states: “I would strongly suggest that once your child arrives back home, they change their clothes immediately and the clothes they’ve worn at school are washed. Their shoes are removed at the door.” Simon Lusted, Head of Lybrook, has written to parents: “There is a requirement that clothes are washed and not worn the following day.” "},{"url":null,"title":"many watchdogs little help","story":"NewsSo many watchdogs, so little helpVictim of building firm that disappeared owing £.million slates consumer championsShareByAndrew Penman:,  MAY NewsDirector: Paul Davies\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

He fell victim to a rogue builder and is furious with the lack of help from consumer protection rules and watchdogs.It was two years ago that he paid CountyLine Limited a deposit of almost £, for improvements to his home in Kingston, Greater London. The company never started the work and disappeared with his money.The firm specialised in conservatories and extensions and was run from Crowborough, East Sussex, by sole director, -year-old Paul Davies. It went into liquidation owing around £.million to an estimated  victims in London and the South East. “I only paid the deposit two weeks before CountyLine ceased trading, they must have known they were in financial trouble and took my money regardless,” he said. We’re always advised to make large payments by credit card because the important Section  of the Consumer Credit Act offers protection up to £,, and that’s what Duncan had done. He was stunned when his bank Santander told him that Section  did not apply because even though he had paid roughly £, – well below the £, cut-off point – the total value of his building contract was £, and so none of his money was covered. “I would never have paid in advanceI had not assumed that I was protected andI had known about the loophole regarding the £, limit,” Duncan said.  CountyLine boasted of being a member of an impressive range of trade bodies, but the comfort they offered Duncan proved short-lived.There was Quality Assured National Warranties, an independent organisation which secures deposits which says: We place consumer protection at the heart of everything we do.“They said that my job had never been registered with them, therefore I was not covered,” Duncan said.CountyLine was also a member of the Federation of Master Builders, which Duncan says did not respond when he filed a complaint. It was a member of the Government-endorsed TrustMark scheme, which says it thoroughly vets members anda problem does arise it has “a range of remedies to give further protection to consumers”.Duncan says it did nothing beyond axing CountyLine’s membership. He thought that Sussex Police might take an interest in what he regards as a fraud, but these hopes were dashed when an officer emailed to say that they were passing the case to Lewisham Trading Standards in London.This watchdog’s investigation came to a halt when CountyLine entered liquidation, with Duncan receiving an email stating: “Given this, it is no longer viable to continue legal action.”The latest report from the liquidators PCR LLP from last October states: We have ascertained a number of third party to whom the company paid monies and are continuing our enquiries to ascertain for what purpose and for what consideration those monies were paid.We have instructed solicitors Hillyer McKeown to assist us and,necessary, to compel the third parties to provide us with the information we require. It added that it was not yet possible to sayany creditors would receive any of their money back. Duncan did recover around £, via a Visa chargeback but that still leaves him out of pocket by £,, which he had paid by bank transfer. All the money would have been covered, including any cash payments, should Santander have decided Section  was applicable:you pay £ on credit card then any credit and cash payments relating to the item are also covered, he said. If I was to buy a car for £, and paid £ on credit card and £, on cash and the car was never delivered – Section  protection would refund the entire £,. aposIf I paid £. more - £, – I would be entitled to £ compensation, it is a clf edge in protection. So any building company that quotes more than £, for works - in London anyone doing a loft or rear extension will fall into this category - then the customer has no protection from section . Yet every builder I spoke to explained how you are protected. Either they are ignorant of the legislation or are deceiving people deliberately but either way when they give a contract or quote for more than £, which has a Section  logo stamped on it, they are lulling people into a sense of  protection leaving you exposed to crooked builders. If I can help warn others by telling my story and hopefully protect someone  from losing money, that could at least be a small positive to come out of this. “Now I am left with no support or guidance about what to do, while the director of Countyline is free to go about his business with an estimated £. million of money taken from iniduals like myself and no ongoing police investigation,” said Duncan. “I just don’t understand how in the UK this type of behaviour is allowed. “I have tried every avenue to get my funds back but have hit a dead end and don’t know what  I can do.” Here’s how the watchdogs responded. Federation of Master Builders . Chief executive Brian Berry said that CountyLine met its vetting criteria when it joined but was expelled in May  following complaints. He said: “Mr MacFarlane contacted the FMB after the firm had been expelled, at which point we were unable to take further action. In the intervening two years there have been no such allegations of fraud made against any FMB members.”Quality Assured National Warranties. It stated that CountyLine was a member of a Competent Persons Scheme that gave insurance for replacement doors and windows but this membership ended in May , and it had no record of Duncan’s complaint, which he made by telephone. TrustMark. Simon Ayers, chief executive, said he was very sorry to hear of Duncan’s situation but said it was a matter for the police and trading standards: TrustMark was engaged with the agencies to ensure they were supplied with all information required to support that investigation.He added that they were revising the way businesses are checked “to ensure their suitability to be registered” but warned: In some cases, where a business is aggressively acquired and then used for criminal gain in a very short time span, it will remain a dficult situation to monitor and act upon. Santander. The bank expressed sympathy but stuck to its position that Duncan was not entitled to a credit card refund because his building contract was for more than £,, adding that the Financial Ombudsman Service had rejected his complaint.Lewisham Trading Standards. Councillor Brenda Dacres, Cabinet Member for Safer Communities, said: “The Trading Standards team, together with the National Trading Standards Regional Investigation Team, worked very hard to try to resolve this case, and have deep sympathy for Mr MacFarlane’s plight.“However, as the company in question was liquidated, this left us with few options to pursue. The case remains open and should further evidence or cases come to light, we will investigate fully.” Sussex Police. Did not respond to requests to comment.I was unable to reach Paul Davies.

Ryan Hall and Paisley Hamilton travelled from Hull to their nearest open drive-thru in Peterborough before scoffing down double cheeseburgers and McNuggets in minutes.“It was definitely a ‘F*** it’ moment which actually ended up costing me a lot of money, EE customer adviser Ryan said.But I’d do it all again. It was so worth it. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  The pair, both , wolfed down their food - which also included a Big Mac meal, a McChicken sandwich and a Filet-O-Fish - in Ryanaposs Fiat  before getting home after seven hours. He said they had taken the scenic route along the coast last Saturday in blazing sunshine, only to be faced with a -car queue on arrival. “Even the queue was a highlight. I had my car soft-top down, blasting out Rain On Me by Lady Gaga. Everyone  there was joining in with the mini rave, he told The Sun.It comes as McDonaldaposs is rapidly expanding its store openings across the UK and Ireland to have more than , restaurants reopened for drive-thru or delivery by next Thursday, June . Last week, the fast food chain reopened  drive-thru sites but the company said it decided to close some lanes where demand impacted local communities or the safety of our people or customers due to long queues. The company said every drive-thru in the UK and Ireland will be reopened between Tuesday and Thursday of next week. It said it will reveal the locations of reopening restaurants on the morning they open their doors to help manage demand and it is working with local authorities and the police over openings.

Virginia Giuffre, also known as Virginia Roberts, makes the damning allegations in a Netflix documentary which was released today.The series - called Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich - is to thrust the Duke of Yorkaposs friendship with the disgraced paedophile into the spotlight once more. It features serious allegations about the Queenaposs son, who has repeatedly denied he had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Ms Roberts. She has in the past alleged she had sex with the Duke in  after being trafficked to the UK by financier Epstein.  She alleges the Duke, father to Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, had sex with her on three separate occasions, including when she was  - a minor under US law. He denies this. Ms Roberts also alleges in the documentary she met the Duke in the London home of Epsteinaposs associate Ghislaine Maxwell. She told interviewers for the series: Ghislaine has this favourite guessing game that she does, she goes to Prince Andrew aposhow old do you think Virginia is apos And he said .  Sheaposs like, aposOh youaposre right!apos They made a little joke about it. He was like, aposmy daughters arenapost far from your age. My daughters are a little bit younger than you.apos A former employee of Epstein has also accused the Duke of frolicking in a pool with a topless Ms Roberts on a dferent occasion.Steve Scully alleges that Andrew and Ms Roberts were engaged in foreplay in the pool on Epsteinaposs private island in the Caribbean. Scully said: Jeffrey hung out with a lot of powerful and well known figures, both politically and financially and British royalty.  It was probably around  I saw Prince Andrew, he was at the pool, he was with, at that time, an unknown girl to me, she was young, she didnapost have any top on, they were engaged in foreplay, he was grabbing her and grinding against her. Mr Scully, who said he maintained Epsteinaposs telecommunications and data equipment on Little Saint James Island in the US Virgin Islands, added: You tell yourself that you didnapost know for sure and you never really saw anything but thataposs just all rationalisation. Jeffrey Epstein, he was a guy that concealed his deviance very well, but he didnapost conceal it that well.  Meanwhile, Ms Roberts has urged Andrew to come forward and be interviewed by FBI and US prosecutors about his friendship with Epstein, a convicted sex offender who committed suicide in jail while facing sex trafficking charges. US lawyer Geoffrey Berman, who is leading the Epstein inquiry, said in March: Contrary to Prince Andrewaposs very public offer to co-operate with our investigation into Epsteinaposs co-conspirators, an offer that was conveyed via press release, Prince Andrew has now completely shut the door on voluntary co-operation and our office is considering its options. The duke stepped down from royal duties last November following a disastrous Newsnight interview about his friendship with Epstein.  In the programme, Andrew responded to claims made by Ms Roberts that the night they allegedly had sex he was sweating heavily as they danced in Londonaposs Tramp nightclub. The duke said he did not recall meeting her and had a medical condition at the time, after suffering an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War when he was shot at, that meant he did not sweat. Interviewed for the documentary, Ms Giuffre said about Andrew: This guy didnapost have any remorse at all. His arrogance about it, I mean the whole I donapost sweat thing, this guy was profusely sweating all over me. A spokeswoman for the lawyers representing the Duke of York said: As we have said many times before, the duke has absolutely no recollection of ever having met Virginia Roberts. In a statement released in November, the Duke said: It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support.

Temperatures are expected to peak on Sunday with highs of C rivalling the hottest day of the year so far - but June will likely start far less bright and sunny.The Met Office forecasts rain and strong winds for the northern and western parts of the UK especially into next week.While BBC forecasts agree there is some uncertainty as we leave May for what should be the start of the summer - with an area of low pressure likely moving in from the Atlantic and bringing showers. And despite the heat-wave set to continue for now, BBC meteorologist Chris Fawkes said there are warning signs that things may be ready to change.Yesterday saw highs of C in the Heathrow area and while Mr Fawkes said Thursday will be warmer in the northwest the sunny weather will not reach everyone.He said overnight two concerning weather fronts were moving in which could dictate the weather in Britain in the coming days.  One coming down the North Sea, a cold front, thataposs going to be introducing cooler air to East Anglia and south east England, dropping temperatures, he said. While another in northern Scotland, is set to bring cloudy weather and outbreaks of rain today. The heaviest of this across the Highlands, into Aberdeenshire, Orkney and Shetland as well, he added.  Mr Fawkes said while the likes of Manchester will see C and Glasgow , itaposs going to feel fresher in London which dips to  degrees.

The country has seen , more deaths than usual since March , three days before the lockdown was announced. This means the virus has directly or indirectly killed  people per million, analysis by the Financial Times suggests. That is a higher death rate than any other country providing detailed data, including Italy and the US. Italy was the European country hardest hit by the virus in the early stages of the crisis, although the UK and US have subsequently recorded more excess deaths. Despite the US suffering more than , deaths, the highest number of fatalities in the world, its excess death rate is still lower than the UK as it has a population of  million. The data used by the Financial Times was from national statistical organisations in  countries, including all European countries hard hit by coronavirus. These were the only countries for which enough information could be found to make proper comparisons. The actual number of excess deaths in the UK is the highest in Europe, with only the US recording more globally. Peru is the only country that has recorded a higher percentage increase in deaths than the UK since the pandemic started. While countries like China and Russia have suffered many fatalities, the overall death rate is much lower than the UK because of their large populations.

It was deeply insulting. There was no apology for the behaviour of Dominic Cummings. There was no acknowledgement of the anger it caused and no acceptance that it had undermined the Government’s message at a crucial moment in the battle against coronavirus. Calls for an inquiry were swatted away with the arrogance of an oligarch bored of counting his money. The Prime Minister repeatedly claimed the allegations against Cummings were . When asked to substantiate this allegation he declined. Yet as this paper has accurately reported, Cummings did flout the lockdown restrictions, the police did speak to his family and he did make a trip, against the clear instructions, to Barnard Castle. When this defence failed, Mr Johnson resorted to the cheapest trick in the book by accusing anyone asking perfectly legitimate questions of playing party politics. Nobody is playing a game here. There is genuine concern that the public will lose faith in the lockdown measures which could result in a second spike and yet more deaths. On Thursday the Government will roll out its test and trace programme that will require hundreds of thousands of people to self-isolate for  days, whether they are infected or not. Mr Johnson was hesitant to say whether this was compulsory or not – it will, in fact, be voluntary – because he knows he can no longer tell the public what to do when his chief adviser is making the rules up as he goes along.

And despite their -year age gap, the coupleaposs romance has grown to true love, and they are now engaged after photographer Rachael got down on one knee with a very indecent proposal. She says they have a phenomenal sex le, and that their family and friends have accepted their relationship despite John being older than her grandmother. To pop the question, Rachael took John to a nightclub and ordered him an exotic dance, before joining the three naked performers on stage and asking him to marry her. Recalling her indecent proposal, Rachael, of Belle Vernon, Pennsylvania, USA, who met John three years ago when he employed her as a guard at the security firm he runs, said: “It’s quite a vulgar story. “It was not a traditional proposal by any stretch of the imagination. “We were with a bunch of friends at a strip club and I had ordered a ring online, which I had with me. I’m terrible at keeping secrets and was worried about ruining the surprise, so it was a bit spontaneous. “I arranged for him to have an exotic dance with three beautul dancers. He was sitting on the stage in front of a room full of people when, fully clothed, I joined the three naked dancers and proposed to him there and then. “I told him to get this out of his system because he would never have a naked woman dance for him again except me! “It’s definitely not the traditional way to do it. He had no choice and said yes straight away!”  Instantly attracted to John, despite him being  years older than her -year-old mother, and almost  years older than her -year-old dad, Rachael, who has a son, Levi, five, from a previous relationship, says they are soulmates. She insisted: “To us, age is just a number. He’s my soulmate and the love of my le. “I have no intention of being with anyone  even after he has gone. I know nobody could compare to him. It does put a dread on thingsyou think too far ahead, but I try not to. I have him now and I’m thankful for him. “We have an incredibly close relationship. It’s scarily close, we can both read even a slight change in mood in the other. “And we have a phenomenal sex le, too. Age has nothing to do with that, we are spontaneous and can’t keep our hands off each other.  “We rarely make it to the bedroom. Sometimes it will just happen outside, in the parking lots or in woods. When John interviewed Rachael for a job in December , the magnetism between them was immediate - although she did fear that getting involved with him might endanger her position. “I was like, ‘I want him’. It was his mannerisms, the way he carried himself. It was an instant attraction for the both of us,” she recalled. “I think we both knew how we felt straight away, but he was going through a orce at the time, so I didn’t want to rush things, or be the one to make the first move. “My son’s father is  years old, so age gaps have never been a problem for me, but I definitely had no clue that John was as old as he is.  “I thought he was in his late forties or early fties, because he does not look or act his age. And John was clearly unfazed by the fact his admirer was younger than his own son. “He made the first move and kissed me, said Rachael. It was a month after I was hired. He had been teaching me how to input a code into a digital box and as I went to walk out he grabbed me and pulled me in for a kiss. It felt like fireworks. It was amazing and I wanted him so much, but because of what he was going through at the time, I didn’t think it would happen. “It was like my dreams had come true. It was like that movie moment when the guy grabs the girl and leans her over for a kiss. “But I did then freak out because I was worried about getting fired.” Overcoming her fears, a week later the pair went on their first date to a local bar, where they realised how much they had in common.  “We have the same taste in music. We both like classic rock. He was into motorcycles and I absolutely love them. And we both have the same fashion style, she said. “We just kept talking and haven’t stopped since.” A month later, the pair officially became boyfriend and girlfriend, but kept the relationship quiet for two years until Johnaposs orce was finalised. Then they broke the news to John’s -year-old son and -year-old daughter,  who were simply pleased to see their dad happy. It was never an issue, I did not think it was weird at all. When I do see his children, we get along well, Rachael added. Being attracted to older men is nothing new for Rachael, who dated a man of  when she was just , while she started seeing Leviaposs dad when she was in her early s. She said: “Older men are more mature. Men at the age of  are still boys and I’ve never found them appealing. “They just don’t have it together. I’ve always been an old soul. I have myself together and know what I want from le, so I find it easier to connect to older guys. It drives me crazy when people say, aposDo you have daddy issues apos No I donapost, nor have I ever and I certainly wouldnapost look at my fiancé as a father figure for myself.  “At first, my family were not happy about me dating older men, but when I was , I told them I wasn’t going to date guys my own age as there was no attraction, so they accepted it. “When they met John, they were surprised because he doesn’t look his age. They were worried because he was much older than any other guy I’d dated, but once they got to know him, they really liked him and now we do things together as a family.” And, a week after her indecent proposal, Vietnam war veteran John showed he was an officer and a gentleman when - having already bought a ring with the same intention - he got down on one knee at Rachaelaposs favourite childhood haunt, Roundhill Park in Elizabeth, Pennsylvania,  and asked for her hand. “It was a ring I’d been looking at online and I’d showed him how pretty it was, even before we were dating and he had remembered, she said. It was a complete surprise and was the best thing. “We want to get married at Roundhill Park, too, hopefully on top of the hill. We’re not sure when it will happen now though, because of Covid-, so we’re enjoying the engagement. At the moment, Rachael is living in an apartment with her son, while John does up a home in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, for them to move into as a family. “My son is close to John and really looks up to him, she said. Levi has Attention Deficit Disorderand is mildly autistic, and John is great with him, really patient. He’s a really good role model.” Although the couple have been accepted by friends and family, they do get the odd comment from strangers, who assume Rachael is out with her father and that John is her son’s grandfather. “We don’t even listen to it, we just shrug it off,” Rachael said. Anyway, more often than not people tell us how good we look together.”  And the age gap has not hindered things in the bedroom either. Rachael laughed: I think he was quite old fashioned until he met me, but I’ve taught him a lot. “I’m learning from him every day in other ways, he’s learning from me and we’ll never stop. “We do have our dferences. He is stuck in his ways and I know he’s not going to change now. “We do have disagreements about some things – mostly old movies! He will be explaining them to me and I won’t know what he’s talking about. Rachaelaposs only fear about their age gap is that she will lose John too soon. She said: “I know he’s not going to live forever, which is something I worry about every day. “But all that aside, it’s so nice to be with someone older because they have their head together. He’s mature and has opened my eyes to new experiences. “It’s never got boring with us. He is considerate and tells me every day that he loves me.” Meanwhile, John, who as well as serving in the US army worked as a prison officer, before running his security firm, is devoted to Rachael. He said: “I was attracted by her demeanour, the way she carried herself. She was a fast learner and so easy to talk to.

Itaposs yet to catch on in the UK, but one man in the US persuaded his local branch to create one for him and he filmed his reaction to trying it.  Sam E. Goldberg has been using his spare time during lockdown to start a new YouTube series called Respect The Chain. Itaposs a comedic food show, in which the -year-old is currently trying aposspecial pandemic menu itemsapos from ious chain restaurants. The latest episode sees Sam, who is originally from New York, but is spending the pandemic with family in Florida, trying the unique Whopper. Sitting in a Burger King restaurant, he explains in the video: Did you know that the Burger King in Italy is currently offering whataposs called a Social Distancing Whopper   What theyaposre doing in Italy is they are giving you three times the amount of onions that they would normally put on a regular Whopper. He continued: What weaposre doing today is weaposre recreating this Social Distancing Whopper that they have in Italy. We asked them specically for three times the amount of onions on the Whopper.  Before tucking in, Sam admitted that he wasnapost really looking forward to tasting the burger. I have a very bad feeling. Itaposs probably going to taste very bad. Biting into it, he pulls a face, before saying that it has the most pungent taste heaposs ever experienced in his le.Speaking to , the Respect The Chain host spoke more about his decision to try the burger and gave us his official verdict on whether it could actually keep people away. He said: Currently [on the show] we are featuring the post pandemic reopening phase and were intrigued to try the Social Distancing Whopper from Burger King.

The living room is filled with bold print and wood ling with large grand sofas, while a huge stag head overlooks all. The cream kitchen is filled with light, and the walls feature a stunning painting of the castle and fields home to grazing deer. There is a large fridge which has been labelled the aposwine cellarapos, the perfect place to keep all those bottles of Champagne cool.  A light-filled conservatory is decorated with birds of all colours, but is dominated by a huge peacock sitting on the the table. The hallway is painted fuchsia pink, with historical painting in huge gold elaborate frames hanging up the stairs. Upstairs are two double bedrooms which live up to expectation when it comes to the decoration.  The master bedroom has a huge four-poster bed and a beautul dressing table with a marble top. The second bedroom, which has a dressing area, is painted gold with a painting on the ceiling. There is also a coat of arms - complete with sword - in the corner, a gold velvet chair and a glass chandelier.  The bathroom, which is also peacock themed, also has underfloor heating - fancy. Even the cupboard under the stairs has had the glamour treatment, with a stunning patterned wall paper and a fox model sitting on top of the washing machine. And the owners havenapost forgotten about the outside, and there is an articial lawn in the front and a Mediterranean-inspired back garden.

Having that sort of identity going forward.”Appere particularly impressed Connolly, with the -year-old ing from a loan spell at Broughty Athletic in the juniors like a new man.The young attacker has a terric first campaign with the Tangerines, scoring six goals in  appearances and capping it off with a call up in the Scotland U  squad.Connolly continued: “I don’t know what Louis did last summer.“He wasn’t at that level before that but in pre-season he came back, we did a run and he was flying.“In training he was holding people off, using his body. He was like a dferent player.“When you see him running beside you, you have to get away from him because he’s a machine and he’ll show you up.“He’s one of the fittest guys I’ve ever seen now.“I’ve been asking him what he did last summer but he won’t tell me!”As much as the Terrors dominated the league, Connolly was quick to praise the quality of the Championship, particularly part-time teams Alloa and Arbroath.The defender added: “It was my first time in the Championship and it’s a tough league.“It’s a very, very unpredictable league. A lot of the teams you play are more direct.“I found when I was at Kilmarnock, the Premiership was easier at times because you knew what style you were going to be playing against.“Whereas, in the Championship you can come up against  players behind the ball for  minutes.“People can say ‘we have the best players’ and this and that but it’s still very dficult to play against.“Everyone expected us to win every week and always put us downwe didn’t but I think the character of everyone at the club was huge to get over that.“People need to give the likes of Alloa and Arbroath a lot more credit.“The majority of Arbroath’s team could play full-time and Alloa are probably the best team we’ve played, technically.“They pass the ball and play a certain way that suits them.“We struggled against them but they’re actually a decent team.”Connolly missed a chunk of last season with a hamstring injury and, as much as it was hard watching on at times, he is delighted the squad achieved their aim.He is now looking forward to top-flight football when the action s.Connolly reflected: “It was tough – it had been an up and down season for me personally because I had the aim of coming back and being as fit and as lean as I could.“It was probably one of the best shapes I’d been in and I probably pushed myself too hard at times trying to get to that level.“Watching from the side at that stage at the start, when we’d lost a few games, was really, really dficult.“I just wanted to be a part of it and help.“Then when we went on a run it was brilliant to see. That pushed me on to get back as fit as I could, as quick as I could.“The confidence was just sky high, the boys were flying and it was brilliant for me to get some fitness up and back into the team.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53702996-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53702996-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53702996-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53702996-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"dundee united ilmari niskanen transfer","story":"Dundee United are one of a number of clubs looking at Finnish winger Ilmari Niskanen, his club have confirmed.KuPS sporting director Jonne Lindblom believes the -year-old is on United’s radar but, as yet, there have been no talks between the parties.Tele Sport understands the Finnish champions want up to £, for U  international Niskanen, who played a huge role in leading his side to the title last season.Niskanen has a £, buyout clause in his contract but it is likely KuPS will trigger an extension before his current deal expires in December.The Tangerines may balk at the price amid a dficult coronavirus climate but Lindblom believes Niskanen is a player going places.He said: “I believe Ilmari is a player Dundee United have highlighted.“They have an interest in him but there is nothing more than that at this stage.“There has been no offers or discussions between the clubs as it stands.

Football is in phase two of the Scottish Government’s plans to ease lockdown restrictions, which would come into effect on June all the necessary criteria are met.The SPFL are planning for games in August, with a resumption of training, in small groups, mid-June.Scottish FA chief executive Ian Maxwell claimed an August timeframe is “definitely achievable”.That is when the new £ million, five-year deal with Sky Sports begins. However, when Scottish football can once again generate cash from supporters through the turnstiles is uncertain.Dons chairman Dave Cormack recently admitted he feared there would be no football in Scotland in front of fans this year.As concerning as that is, even Cormack’s prediction may be optimistic. Realistically, social distancing could be in place until a vaccine is discovered and widely distributed.Games could continue to be played behind closed doors for a long time or at best with social distancing which would also decimate crowds and revenue.Is playing in front of a few thousand fans at a ,-capacity stadium financially viable Scottish football has to prepare for the worst and hope for the best throughout this crisis.Fundamental to that will be securing some form of broadcast deal that delivers revenue from closed-door action. That could include staggering matches over a few days so each can be broadcast live.There will be an appetite for that.If any games cannot be shown on television then open up avenues for clubs to live stream them on their own social s.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"argyll adventure saddles up for public support","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe owner of an Inveraray equine and outdoor activity centre is looking for customers# help as lockdown bites.It#s fair to say Andy Cameron could have had an easier start to running Argyll Adventure.The business has operated at Dalchenna Farm for two decades in its current format and -year-old Andy took over the reins at the end of .Argyll Adventure#s bread and butter is horse riding # trekking through the hills above Loch Fyne.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

inAugust.The First Minister revealed this will be a \"blended\" approach, far from normality for our nations youngsters, as part of a four-phase plan to ease the lockdown.But even this is reliant on two key factors -the scientic andmedical advice confirms it can be done in a way that will not disrupt efforts to control the virus andthere is sufficient PPE and other hygiene measures in place.Following Ms Sturgeons announcement in parliament, the Scottish Government published its strategic framework for the re-opening of schools.Here, well detailwhat parents need to know ahead of their childsto the classroom.When will schools re-open Schools in Scotland are set to re-open on August .This is earlier than planned for some schools - but the universal approach is being advised by the Scottish Government.Teachers are set toto the classroom by June to plan and prepare for the new blended model of learning.Some pupils set to start P or S may also receive some in-school experience in late June, to help ensure they are supported to make the next steps in their education.Critical childcare will continue until August to ensure the ongoing provision for key worker and vulnerable children.How will the blended model work Under this approach, children will have a mixture of in-school and in-home learning.According to the framework, this is reliant on consistent and easy-to-use in-home materials which are \"intended to support and complement, but not replicate\" in-school learning.To help disadvantaged pupils, a further poundm was announced to provide laptops and other technology for the home learning.However the document notes: \"No matter how well planned in-home learning is, it is not the same as having effective learning and teaching within the school environment, led by teachers.\"The blended model will be kept under constant review.How will pupils social distance For the first phase of re-opening, schools are being asked to assess the maximum numbers they can accommodate, with guidance including:Pupils being taught in smaller groupsThese groups will not be mixed, where practicableSeating positions will be re-organised to allow for m gaps between pupilsOutdoor space will be used moreThere will be staggered arrival and departure times, so parents will avoid congregating in playground areasBreaks will be staggered by class to avoid contact from dferent classesTeachers, rather than pupils, will move around classrooms where possibleThere will be enhanced hygiene practices across all schools, including additional cleaning,params: .pushExpanding the learning estateLocal authorities are being advised to look for ways they can maximise the capacity for pupils to benefit from in-school learning as much as possible.One such way they are doing this is through expanding the learning estate.This would mean seeingclassrooms could be made fromoutdoor space,libraries, community halls, leisure centres and conference centres.It might also include taking short-term leases of vacant business accommodation.Who will be prioritised for in-school learning As set out above, there is likely going to be a finite number of daily places for in-school learning.As a result, to support NHS capacity and other essential work, a priority will be given to the children of keyworkers - but this is only in circumstances where absolutely necessary with no other option for childcare within that household.The remaining allocation is to be distributed across all year groups to ensure every pupils benefits from in-school learning where possible, according to the framework.Local authorities are being advices to use their knowledge of local circumstances to prioritise any groups where need is greatest.Speaking in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday, the First Minister said: ldquoThese arrangements will not represent a completeto normality by August.ldquoBut we judge them to be the most sensible approach we can plan for at this stage.Later in the session, the First Minister said the Scottish Government wants to ensure pupils will be back at school ldquoin a way that allows them to be children.She added: ldquoNone of us relish the prospect of seeing kids, particularly young kids, socially distancing or be as aware of these risks as we will undoubtedly have to require them to be.ldquoTrying to get, for children in particular, as much normality as possible in the school environment is really important.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot underestimate the challenges of that but it is absolutely central to all of this careful

Governments across the UK moved quickly to introduce business support schemes.I know, however, that many Scottish businesses, especially SMEs, have been frustrated with the level and speed of help provided, with some even seeking a judicial review of the Scottish Governmentrsquos policy.The frustration grew from the decision to initially block retailers with multiple outlets from applying for more than one grant ndash putting small chain businesses in Scotland at a competitive disadvantage.Following a backlash, Ministers relented, but businesses with multiple properties here are still only allowed to claim  per cent of the maximum support grant for subsequent properties.But with almost half a billion pounds of business support grant finance still not having been allocated, and the allocation of funds slowing down, Scottish Labour is demanding Ministers urgently reconsider this policy and offer businesses with more than one premises their additional grants in full.Given the widely predicted long-term economic damage likely to be caused by the pandemic, it will be vital that once the public health crisis is under control we dedicate the same urgency and intervention to repairing our economy.I want this to include a jobs guarantee scheme to help tackle the looming threat of unemployment, especially for young people.Further information about the advice and support available for businesses during the pandemic can be found at findbusinesssupport.gov.scot coronavirus-advice, while the governmentrsquos Covid- business helpline number is   ."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-receives-holyrood-recognition","story":"Harlawhill Day Centrersquos efforts during the coronavirus pandemic were highlighted by the countyrsquos MSP, Iain Gray.The facility had to close its doors on March  due to the global pandemic but Mr Gray felt it was important to recognise the efforts being made by staff and volunteers.The centre, on the townrsquos East Loan, has continued to offer a range of support to members during the pandemic, including organising socially distanced street celebrations outside membersrsquo homes to help mark VE Day and delivering special afternoon tea packages and other food and treats to help keep their spirits up during lockdown.Mr Gray, who lodged a motion at Holyrood highlighting the facility, told the Courier: ldquoHarlawhill Day Centre has always been a special place, very much at the heart of the community in Prestonpans.ldquoIt was a very sad day when it had to close its doors to members back in March.

Here are her words:In the past many couldnrsquot read or write and so our history was rolled into the mind and later unravelled when the wheels stopped rolling and the horses were roped for grazing.Cars and lorries may have replaced the old methods of transport, but the importance of our cultural tales remained the same.Stories for children were about joys and adventures of the fairy folk, goblins and broonies.As they grew older, moral messages were concealed in the stories to teach the young person about moral issues.Respecting the earth and all that lived on her made for some wonderful tales about animals and birds why the snakes see all, who painted the eaglesrsquo feather tips, does a blackbird feel a storm coming at the base of his beak Is it not wise to heed the warning of a dog who does not rise to happily welcome the arrival of its master Our lives revolved around such tales, and their inner meanings. The boy who cried wolf was forever with us do not lie!You see, forests hold more than trees and rocks will whisperyou have an ear to listen.Our entire lives were, and are, stories. In my culture we had a teller in every family.In her books about the lives of traditional travellers, and her personal experience of it, she does not overly romanticise it.It could be a hard le, and one often misunderstood or discriminated against, as indeed it still is.But the legacy of stories, told and re-told over campfires, in caravans and kitchens, passed down from generation to generation is a rich and priceless inheritance.I was honoured that she shared a tale with me, albeit online rather than face to face, as these times demand.I believe it is a tradition we should all honour and can learn from.And so here is the story she shared.It has a Tinkerrsquos Leap in it and, who knows, it could refer to the place so named in Woodhall Dean.I have tried as best I can to keep the resonance of Jessrsquos voice in the telling.So sit round your campfire, real or imagined, for Jessrsquos tale:The story I am going to tell is of the Earl of Hell. Aye well that is how folk called him. Irsquom told he was a relative of the famous Jeannie Gordon.Well, he was a handsome lad, and had a roving eye. He also had a knack of walking into trouble.Well one day he was accused of stealing something. He knew he would get no fair hearing in court, and sure enough he didnrsquot.Soon he found himself before a dour judge, who donned his black cap and pronounced that he will be hanged at the light of dawn.Now the Earl had already escaped death three times. Some say he had the blood of Red Ruth in his veins.This time it seemed, he had met his fate. But this young lad was not ready to meet his maker.The hangman did his deadly job but as the Earl fell through the trap door he began a dance at the end of the rope, in which he dislocated his shoulders, threw his legs up in a circle and managed to free himself.The jailers were aghast, and disbelief momentarily paralysed their responses.This gave the Earl time to scuffle to his feet and flee up the steps. No door was locked, for nobody had expected the need of it.The lad jumped onto a horse and rode at speed.

but this is only in circumstances where absolutely necessary with no other option for childcare within that household.The remaining allocation is to be distributed across all year groups to ensure every pupils benefits from in-school learning where possible, according to the framework.Local authorities are being advices to use their knowledge of local circumstances to prioritise any groups where need is greatest.Speaking in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday, the First Minister said: ldquoThese arrangements will not represent a completeto normality by August.ldquoBut we judge them to be the most sensible approach we can plan for at this stage.Later in the session, the First Minister said the Scottish Government wants to ensure pupils will be back at school ldquoin a way that allows them to be children.She added: ldquoNone of us relish the prospect of seeing kids, particularly young kids, socially distancing or be as aware of these risks as we will undoubtedly have to require them to be.ldquoTrying to get, for children in particular, as much normality as possible in the school environment is really important.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot underestimate the challenges of that but it is absolutely central to all of this careful planning that is underway."},{"url":null,"title":"can-pubs-reopen-glasgow-plan-ease-lockdown-revealed","story":"The four-phase plan will begin as of next week, with a number of measures being relaxed on May .More outdoor activity including sportsmeeting other households and the re-opening of recycling centres are among those being re-introduced at what is being described as Phase .But these areentirely dependent on dramatically reducing coronavirusin the country and successfully implementing a ldquoTest and Protect strategy.For those of us hankering for a leisurely drink in our local, the subject of ing to Scotlands pubs has been addressed in the route map.Current lockdown restrictions mean pubs and restaurants have been forced to close.The measures introduced yesterday also reveal that pubs will be forced to remain closed during Phase  -

No change there then because they were overlooked before coronavirus theyrsquove always been overlooked. Irsquom talking about young men, especially young men from deprived backgrounds. Theyrsquore powerless and weak in Scotland and they feel it. But coronavirus doesnrsquot care. Itrsquos a bully: it goes for the powerless and the weak.Irsquom not talking here, obviously, about the direct effects of coronavirus ndash young people are more likely to survive Covid ndash Irsquom talking about the ancillary effects: lockdown, the economic damage, the closure of schools. All of these factors will have a disproportionately negative effect on young men. So could we start paying attention please First: lockdown. Itrsquos grim, itrsquos lonely, and we know young people are more likely to feel depressed about it than older age groups. We also know men are less good at dealing with the consequences for their mental health and more prone to coping with drugs, alcohol or even suicide. Irsquove seen the young men among my friends and family struggle. Itrsquos probably one of the reasons theyrsquove been way more likely than young women to break the lockdown rules.Second: the economic damage. Wersquore in the middle of a crisis in which government policy is depressing the economy and we know from the  financial crisis that itrsquos young people that bear the brunt  years ago, youth unemployment rose by % in some countries. Women may be clustered in low-paid jobs, but the unemployment rate is higher for men and it gets higher the younger you are.And third: education. Young men have been falling behind women in educational attainment for years and the locked gates of schools and colleges is going to make that worse and mostly itrsquos going to make it worse for men from deprived backgrounds. For a lot of young guys, school is the only chance they have anditrsquos shut, their chance shuts down with it, and then they leave school and there are no jobs because of coronavirus, and then theyrsquore more likely to get depressed or resort to drugs or crime. You can see the spiral, canrsquot you Part of the answer is to get in early and give men the skills they need to cope when le gets dficult the other part of the answer is to treat them much better when they get into trouble and canrsquot cope. The alternative, especially under lockdown, is to see boys struggle at school, then struggle to get a job, then struggle with drugs and depression, and then, for some, end up in prison or a mortuary.I once spoke about this to the former Scottish prisons inspector Brigadier Hugh Munro and his take on it was that we need to focus on the lives of young men long before they start to struggle. Boys, he said, are often forced to fit into an academic structure thatrsquos not right for them and they rebel or drop out. Encourage their skills in other areas insteadand you can prevent them getting into trouble.But I was also interested in what the brigadier had to say about young men who do end up in trouble because wersquore still getting that wrong in Scotland. Young men who struggle at school are more likely to leave without qualications andyou donrsquot have qualications yoursquore more likely to get into trouble and end up in prison, and prison, really, is the last chance to turn things around. But no: it just gets worse.Imagine, for example, you end up in Barlinnie. The chances are when you arrive there, yoursquoll be held in one of the tiny holding cells that were condemned last century as a breach of the law on human rights . It is also unlikely that yoursquoll get to access the education or rehabilitation or therapy you need. Fat chance: yoursquore banged up, then kicked out.Itrsquos mostly young men who end up this way and lockdown makes it even more likely by undermining the services that can help, like education or a decent job. As Hugh Munro points out, wersquore imprisoning too many young men when a community alternative would be better. But wersquore still failing them in other ways too. And the bully of coronavirus, and the lockdown thatrsquos supposed to beat it, is making it worse.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Wersquove been erted from the highest moral purpose ndash keeping our minds fixed on the loss of fellow human beings and the government decisions which were involved in their deaths ndash to casting our eyes into a gutter of deceit, hypocrisy and selfishness.This is not to say, however, that the media should have held back on coverage of Cummings ndash completely the reverse. Without the forensic scrutiny of journalists wersquod never know about the double standards to which the rich and powerful hold themselves and us. We can now see that the Cummings scandal isnrsquot just a moral affront, itrsquos potentially lethal too. How many people have shrugged their shoulders and said to hell with public health advice in the wake of Cummingsrsquo actions, adopting a lsquo he can do it, so can Irsquo attitude However, under the cover of such an appalling spectacle many political issues have become distorted at a time when we need clarity of vision and nowhere has that distortion played out more than in Scotland. Cummings has had a unique Caledonian Effect.Letrsquos be frank, the squalid behaviour of Cummings and Johnson has thrown a protective cloak around the the SNP government when it comes to failures over coronavirus. Cummings has unwittingly played something of a blinder for the party and its ambitions for independence.Until the Cummings scandal, most decent minds were concentrated on the SNP governmentrsquos dreadful handling of care home deaths. More than  elderly hospital patients were sent to homes prior to mandatory testing. Around half of Scotlandrsquos deaths have been in care homes.Amid the Cummings scandal, Nicola Sturgeon said she found the care home deaths ldquoheartbreaking. Shersquos a woman of decency so her emotional response is to be believed. That doesnrsquot excuse her Governmentrsquos failures, however. Yet with Cummings soaking up headlines, scrutiny of the issue shrunk. Pressure on health secretary Jeane Freeman over her mistakes weakened.We cannot simply accept such failings in Holyrood because therersquos a tawdry circus of shame in Westminster that draws attention away. You didnrsquot need a science degree to know that the elderly were most at risk. However, there was no mandatory testing for all new care home residents in Scotland until April .The Cummings scandal has overshadowed claims that the transfer of elderly patients from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Glasgow to Gartnavel led to the virus spreading like it was onboard a ldquocruise ship. Gartnavel is said to have recorded  cases and  deaths in a matter of weeks. The buck for this stops at the desk of the health secretary and the First Minister.Concerns about a possible cover-up by the Scottish Government over an early outbreak of coronavirus in Edinburgh have been eclipsed by the Cummings scandal. Lockdown came too late here ndash just as it did in England. Testing and tracing have been inadequate. Itrsquos been a catalogue of one failure after another.From the pandemicrsquos early days, there wasnrsquot that much of a substantive dference in policy between Holyrood and Westminster. Increasingly, though, Sturgeon has begun to forge Scotlandrsquos own path but itrsquos still far from successful. We arenrsquot New Zealand, thatrsquos for sure.Set against the Johnson government, anything would look good. Some % of Scots think Sturgeon has handled the crisis well. However, comparing pretty bad to bloody useless shouldnrsquot be the yardstick by which we measure what our governments do for us.The SNP are frankly lucky to have this shameless and idiotic government in London in the shape of Cummings and Johnson. But that, sadly, makes the Scottish people less lucky. The failings in Scotland arenrsquot any less meaningful just because Boris Johnson is a disaster. If Westminster was being run by a competent leader, the SNPrsquos behaviour would seem signicantly more concerning.The Cummings Effect is also shaping other parties. Some Scottish Tories finally distanced themselves from the UK leadership, with calls for Cummings to go. It simply adds to the notion that the Scottish Tories should strike out alone and leave the UK fold. It also reinforces the perception that the partyrsquos voice here is relatively meaningless.What have Scottish Labour or the Scottish LibDems done that matters throughout the Cummings scandal  Nothing. Whatrsquos the point of Scottish Labour  When it comes to Labour the only story in town is Keir Starmer ndash the great hope. Nice guy as he may be, Richard Leonard doesnrsquot cut through ndash even at a time like this, with Cummings, when a butter kne could cut throughit had the will. The Greens also need to find their voice.When it comes to independence, Cummings must have an effect on floating voters, and soft No voters. Irsquom a Yes voter, and Irsquove been increasingly disheartened in the direction of travel the independence movement has taken in recent years. The SNP base is beyond ugly, the idea of independence has intellectually stagnated, and independence itself has provided the SNP with a shield to hide bad governance behind as its voters will tolerate any failing as long as talk of independence is thrown out now and again as red meat.But even jaded Yes voters like me feel a little galvanised now by the Cummings scandal. I may be uneasy with the independence package currently on offer ndash too many unanswered questions, and the whf of populism, Scottish exceptionalism and thin-skinned nationalism ndash but compared to where Westminster is going, I know which option looks more appealing. Westminster has been a corrupt failure for generations, now itrsquos a sick, cruel joke played on the British people.This pandemic hasnrsquot been handled well or adequately by Scotland and its government. Nevertheless, even a dysal Scotland is better than whatever the hell is happening in Westminster.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The construction sector is waiting to start rebuilding those homes, but it does not yet know when it can do so.\"I have been contacted by customers, who are the important people, across the country, who are waiting to get into their homes, including one man, who was written to by the Minister for Local Government, Housing and Planning and advised to contact the housing charity, Shelter.ldquoAll that people want to know is when builders can start working again. What is the answer to that question Ms Sturgeon stressed that ldquothe priority is to keep people as safe as possible from the coronavirus outbreak.She added: ldquoIf and when we move into it, phase one will allow the construction sector to implement the first two stages of its own re-start programme, which is a programme that has been developed through collaboration between government and the industry.ldquoWe will give as much clarity about all that as we can, step by step, but we will not ndash we must not ndash take our eye off the priority of keeping the virus suppressed and not allowing it to get out of control again.Analysis by Rightmove in the first week that the housing market in England re-opened found that demand for rental property was up by  per cent compared to the previous year ndash with Monday  May seeing the highest level of rental demand ever recorded in one day on the website.For those looking to buy a property, Rightmove had almost , new sales listings on the market in the first week of the sector re-opening in England ndash % down on the same week last year but improving from a % fall during lockdown."},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-second-attractive-place-invest-uk-seventh-year---survey","story":"EYs Scotland Attractiveness Survey shows that both in terms of attracting foreign direct investmentand attracting a number of UK projects, Scotland is in a strong position.The report surveyed  international investments, and for the seventh year running, Scotland was the most attractive place for companies to invest outside of London.The report showed that there had been a .% increase in the number of projects secured, from  in  to  in .:Scottish beauty spot revealed as UKs most romantic placeGrowth in Scottish investment was also at a faster pace than the rest of the UK, with a .% increase .Ally Scott, UKI managing partner for EY Scotland, said: \"Scotland has yet again achieved an impressive performance on FDI in .

When so many people across the country have made such great sacrices in the prosecution of that war it is unacceptable that Dominic Cummings should be behave like this and not suffer any consequences.“Dominic Cummings’ behaviour – and the decision of the Prime Minister to support him – risks undermining public confidence in the messaging of government.  It is also clearly consuming time and energy in government that could be better spent on tackling the disease.“In all the circumstancesDominic Cummings will not resign then the Prime Minister should dismiss him.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

A Coronavirus Business Hardship Support Grant Scheme was launched earlier this month.The grant and loans schemes were created following engagement with local business representatives.During discussions with a broad range of business sectors, requests were made for the council to establish ways to ease the immediate pressure created by poor cash flow, with the curtailing of all trade in some sectors and severely limited trade in others.The council fund is intended to supplement rather than replace national support measures # and business applicants should first explore whether they are eligible for assistance from the schemes put in place by the Scottish and UK Governments.Before seeking a loan from OIC, businesses will need to have first applied for funding from the national Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme or the Coronavirus Bounce Back Loan Schemes.Councillor Graham Sinclair, chairman of the council’s Development and Infrastructure Committee, said: “We are very aware of the hardship many businesses are facing in these uncertain and challenging times.“I am pleased that the emergency loan scheme, as well as the hardship grant scheme, are now in place and open for applications.“Many local businesses are receiving assistance from the government support schemes – and these should be the first port of call for those affected by the economic effects of the crisis“But we know from our engagement with Orkney’s business sectors that the national schemes won’t help all businesses.“The new loan scheme offers a further option for those that have been unable to secure support where.“If your business is facing this situation I would encourage you to check online to seeit is eligible # and to get in touch with our economic development team or Business Gateway Orkneyyou are unsure or feel it doesn’t quite meet the criteria.”Standard loan terms are for a duration of up to six years, with an initial repayment holiday period of up to a year, followed by up to five years to repay the loan balance in full. Exceptionally, requests for a loan period of up to  years may be considered.Businesses can find guidance and check the criteria for funding here www.orkney.gov.uk CV-Loan-Guide and,eligible, apply online here www.orkney.gov.uk CV-LoanThose that are unsure about their eligibility should contact the Council’s economic development team for advice at economic.development@orkney.gov.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

National media reports have suggested that Home Office staff cannot access paperwork held in offices due to inefficient home working procedures.Mr Carmichael said: “EU citizens make a massive positive impact in the Northern Isles and the coronavirus crisis has only made that impact clearer. The pandemic has demonstrated the vital contributions that workers from all over the world make in supporting our economy and keeping the NHS running under severe pressure.“The ongoing legal limbo for over two hundred EU citizens in the isles is unacceptable. Continued confusion and delay caused by administrative problems must be put right. Failing to do so puts people’s futures and lives clouded in uncertainty. They deserve better from a government that promised their right to remain.“This news comes in a week in which the government has seemed blind to the importance of immigrant workers in our health and social care sectors.

One person usually does two or three days in a row at one site, then switches with another operator. “I’m quite confident operating on site alone as I’ve been in the role for a number of years now, but we are well supported and there is always someone at the end of a phonewe need any help. As occasional lone workers, we also have safeguards in place to ensure our safety.“As well as allowing me more time to keep on top of college work, which I’m finding harder now there is no face to face teaching, the single person policy also means we can be more flexible right across the dferent teams on the islands.   “For example,a number of colleagues need to self-isolate, there is now extra flexibility that can be called upon to cover these roles, so it’s good there is that resilience in place.   “I feel very grateful that I’m working for Scottish Water just now. I think we’ve been very well cared for and supported throughout the coronavirus pandemic.”    Sweyn, who joined Scottish Water eight months ago, said: “It’s been a really useful learning experience being on site by myself. This summer I will begin standby duties responding to alarms at our two water treatment sites on the mainland, so I think this time spent working the sites alone will help prepare me for those additional duties.  “I’m getting on with the routine stuff as usual andanything comes up that I need help with, I know there’s always someone at the end of the phone so I’ve got no hesitation calling them in that instance.    “It’s a really good team here, really supportive, which is great. If there have to be two people on site, then we make sure that social distancing is in place. With the implementation of these measures, we’ve been successful in producing the high-quality drinking water our customers expect while maintaining the safety of our team and others.”  Ross, who spends a lot of his time out at jobs requiring more than one person in attendance, has found the new measures harder to implement in some aspects of his role. He said: “It is things like ensuring you are keeping two metres apart when you are both digging a hole # you are so conscious of it but you’re also trying to get on and do your job so it has been a challenge.   “It hasn’t been an issue at all in terms of dealing with customers because we wear our gloves and our masks and make sure that we are well away from themwe need to speak to them, but it does make the physical aspects of our job more challenging.“I’ve been with Scottish Water for around nine months and my days can look completely dferent week to week. I can be heading out in the van to fix a burst or fit a connection, or it can be dealing with a choke on the sewer response side of things. That iety is one of the things that I was looking for: you are never bored, never stuck doing nothing. There’s always something to get on with.”  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

His house was so large that he could let the legislature use four rooms. He was one of the wealthiest men in the town but he was not the only successful Orcadian businessman there. About a quarter of the men who formed the first Winnipeg Board of Trade, in March , were Orcadians or the sons of Orcadians: John Inkster and his son Colin, William Drever, Robert Tait, James Clouston, William Flett and George Kennedy.Three of the Board of Trade members have had roads named after them: Bannatyne Avenue, Inkster Bouled and Tait Avenue. There are two more named after Orcadian settlers: Mowat Road after Edward Mowat from Orphir and Setter Street after Andrew Setter, or Seatter. It is no surprise that Orcadians played such a prominent part in the early le of Winnipeg because they were there right from the start: in the Red River Valley.All through the th Century Orkney men went to work for the Hudson’s Bay Company. At its peak, in ,  of the  employees were Orcadian. Most of them came home but a good number settled in the Red River Valley: the colony south of Lake Winnipeg founded by the Earl of Selkirk for Highlanders displaced by the Clearances. The HBC had granted the land on condition that their men could retire there.The colony struggled through its early years but things settled down after the union of the HBC with the North-West Company in . Shetland pioneer Issac Cowie wrote:And it was these Orkneymen, with other veterans of the fur trade…, coming in sufficient numbers to defend it, who made permanent the settlement of Red River.”…Douglas Hill, in The Opening of the Canadian West , described the birth of Winnipeg, within the Red River Settlement, when warehouses and stores were built near the HBC#s Upper Fort Garry.#The collection of ramshackle log or frame buildings, with one or two solid houses, was at first called McDermotville after its leading citizen, an Irish settler-turned-trader named Andrew McDermot, who with his son-in-law, A G B Bannatyne, erected Winnipeg#s first buildings. Soon the town#s shops were thriving, and challenging the Fort as the settlement#s focal point#In  the prairie path that had been graced with the name #Main Street# was properly surveyed, graded and furnished with one or two culverts . It was a symptom of the magnicent optimism that prevailed. Yet the optimists were justied: Winnipeg and Manitoba were on the threshold of great things.  vw, px\"  The full version of this article can be found on page  of this week’s edition of The Orcadian. Patricia Long is a local tour guide based in Stenness, with a particular interest in social and family history.

Hatston will be open from .am to .pm and Garson from .am to .am. Both will be closed between .pm and .pm.Andrew Drever, vice-chair of Orkney Islands Council’s Development and Infrastructure Committee, said: “We thank folk for their patience while our sites were closed, as we waited for national advice on essential travel in Scotland to change.“I hope people will welcome the step-by-step approach we are taking to opening the sites again and understand the need for them to operate dferently to the way they did before the pandemic.“This is to ensure the safety of our staff and visitors to the sites. Limiting the number of cars and visitors on site at any particular time will enable social and physical distancing. We would urge those visiting to stay at least two metres away from staff and from other visitors on site.”Councillor Drever said: “Both sites are likely to be very busy for the first few days. To avoid the risk of waiting in long queues, we would ask folk to use them onlyit is absolutely necessary.“As a way to spread visits across the week, we are suggesting that you make your visit –possible – on your normal bin collection day. If your bin collection day is a Mondaywe’d suggest that you visit on a Saturday instead.”He added: “As summer approaches we know that many folk will be keen to dispose of waste from their gardens.“That’s why we are concentrating on this when the sites re-open as part of the phased approach we are taking. For the time being, no other materials can be disposed of at Hatston or Garson.”This will be kept under review and, when possible, the sites will start to take other materials as well.Decisions on opening the other HWRCs – and recycling points in the isles – will be taken at a later date as part of the phased approach the council is taking.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The guidance stresses the need for personal responsibility when travelling and this co-operation is vital as we work to provide a safe transport system that supports the people of Scotland.“The route map offers a path away from the current restrictions, but the virus is still with us,we move too quickly or without appropriate diligence, it could rapidly run out of control again. “The level of physical distancing required as we navigate the phases of the route map will affect the available capacity of public transport. Operators estimate capacity will be between  per cent and  per cent of normal availability even with full services resumed. “A system that previously had . million journeys per day will be signicantly constrained. So today, I am urging employers, operators and the public to embrace these changes and help us all adapt to a new environment which has flexible and remote working at its core, for the immediate future at least, flattens peak travel demand and has a strong focus on active travel.“We are looking to increase the frequency of public transport. But reducing the demand for transport is vitally important. We are urging employers to show leadership and be as flexible as possible to allow earlier or later starting and finishing times for those that have to travel to work.  “Over the coming weeks and working with our local authority partners, the transport transition plan will look to manage demand and increase availability of road space and priority for walking, cycling, wheeling and bus. “We have a real opportunity to secure a positive and lasting change, one which supports sustainable travel habits. I am therefore delighted to confirm that the ‘Spaces for People’ fund for local authorities has proven so popular that it is being increased to £ million.“We all have a personal responsibility to take steps to protect ourselves and others. It is vital that we continue to keep two metres physical distance wherever possible, wash hands regularly and maintain good cough hygiene.  “Even with the measures being put in place by transport operators, it may be dficult for people to maintain physical distancing throughout their journey in some forms of public transport. I know these are real concerns of the travelling public, operators and transport staff. For that reason, people should, and are expected to, wear face coverings as an additional measure when using public transport and as a consideration to staff and fellow passengers.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now, why does not Nicola change the dictate for Shetland  We would love to sunbath also, between the snow showers!!!!!😂😂😂😂How fortunate that the Scottish, Welsh and Irish leaders are maintaining their more sensible , balanced and wary approaches .Enlighten us Haydn, why is the infection rate lowerin England than in Wales and Scotland  I for one am not the least confused by the messages, just what is confusing you She niver agrees wIth what the rest off the UK IS DOINGBruce, you make it look asNicola, is acting like a Tory##..The Tory policy being##..me, me, me and melolSince you appear to not know, there has been confusion in Britain today about the actual meaning of BoJo’s statement yesterdayand , as I write, he is trying to explain himself away on TV. THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .On that basis I think we need Nicola Sturgeon down here in England as well!Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful. In all probability Ian will not strike gold but how thankful we would behe did !!Fake news  Trump tried to buy Moussa and replace the old stone buildingswith a shiny new tower and Miss Sturgeon will use the proceeds to building a border wall.The deal came unstuck when China claimed Shetland as part of its North Sea and Atlantic territorial waters. It is understood that Miss Sturgeon has been learning Madrin while Scotlandis locked upOwen Jones has denied that he supports Identity politics, woke culture and he is not a social justice warrior.CNNhires Greta Thunberg to appear on a  as an expert on Covid .Best not to bother with why UK has biggest obesity problem in Europe. Such inquiry requires social science, some sociological imagination and a grain of empathy.Much easier to blame those poor plebs who haven#t got a grip.No need to invest on ending intergenerational deprivation and increasing opportunity too.Playgrounds for schools in poorer parts of our cities Why bother.Simples Peter, integrate #Care# for young and old into the NHS. That would include a voucher towards joining a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Those who chose not to use it, be it on their heads, it is their own health and wellbeing which will suffer. Covid  is ruthless with the obese and unfit,blame and empathy are not part le and death struggle of potentially fatal illness.Ian#s suggestion does nothing to end intergenerational deprivation, aka poverty. Poverty, and other social ills, can result in obesity in ious ways.Obesity simply is not automatically a #lestyle choice#.To suggest so is to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming.Not all single parents on benefits, depending also on whatever the Foodbank might provide, can easily promote healthy lestyles for all of their children.Many are struggling with issues beyond Ian#s limited appreciation.Seven year olds don#t generally make lestyle choices. Fat cells, once over produced in response to whatever unwelcome stimulus, don#t simply disappear. They hang around calling to be filled.Not all parents have time or money to afford Shetland Recreational Trust#s offerings.They dont all have the ability to get their children to the leisure facilities.It is only #simples#you take an uncaring and simplistic approach. Ian knows this intellectually as it has been pointed out more than once. Yet he persists. Odd. A little more fellow feeling might stem his approach.All I am suggesting Peter is an attempt to control excessive eating of Junk foodswith integrating our NHH with free access to all to a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Just how can that be #to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming. #Where are you getting your figures on childhood obesity in Shetland from Ian  Surely not from the newspaper article you’ve linked below, which is from  and quotes figures for adults from  If Ian imagines free education and access to the NHS has equalled le chances this is going to be a walk in the park.If Ian imagines the Welfare State to be thriving why so many Foodbanks  On another planet does not just describe Boris and Dodgy Dom today.There are also undernourished children in Shetland and across the UK, and parents going without in order that their children can eat. Ian might be interested to research the number of food banks before the era of Conservstive austerity and see how well the number has grown since. Quite an achievement for his #thriving welfare state#. Soon unemployment numbers will be thriving too thanks to the ghastly response to Covid  fromBoris and chumsThirty thousand deaths a year is a pre-covid figure we now have obesity as a % factor in covid  deaths!!If we were talking drug deaths running a food bank would be an offence. Perhaps that is a little tongue-in-cheek but this year obesity will be a factor in about , people dying prematurely. Surely about time for gyms, fitness and participant sports organisationsto be granted by integrated into the NHS with a free or subsidised entry for all.Sorry Peter, Boris and his chums were working with Nicola and her chums on Covid  . All in harmony which must be a first!Covid  was away with the fairies, another socialist ideal.!It is mildly reassuring that Ian Tinkler has #no faith in politicians# presumably including BoJo the Clown. This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .So in summary, the gospel according to Ian Tinkler is that BoJo the clown hasn#t put his size  feet in it at all as the death rate is higher in Scotland than in England.Ian, I think your calculations are the wrong way round and show what you might call a #survival ratio# rather than a death ratio. There#s also a decimal place error but for the purposes of comparison that doesn#t really matter.If you work it out in deaths per million of population you can see that Scotland has a lower death rate.England:  from      per mPlease do not put words in my mouth Robbie. What is happening in Scotland is down to The SG and Nicola, as theFM and former Health Secretary. Trying to make political capital out of people dying is morally reprehensible, obnoxious and malign. Bo-Jo and Nicola have equal responsibility for any mistakes, they both shared and followed the best science they could. For once they were in harmony and agreement. The NHS was not overwhelmed, lives were saved, be thankful for that. Fortunately, the injection of disinfectant, we will leave to a real clown who is now mainlining hydroxychloroquine!!! Perhaps Darwinism will step in soon! God save America.Oh this is too funny to pass by! Mr Tinkler creates his own, entirely , Coronavirusfigures to make a political point and is immediately shot down. He then states that only an idiot would try to use coronavirus figures to make political points. Well, on that we totally agree # only an idiot would.Ray try and understand the dference between political comment and malicious point-scoring.ian seems to be using dferent measurement criteria between scotland and england and even dferent data within scottish figures. on  may he has scottish figure  but on  may it has gone up to .the lower figure is the one for deaths from positive test cases, the higher one is all deaths where covid is mentioned on death certicate.in his original calculation for england he uses positive test figuresthus for accurate comparison he should use the lower scottish figure also. this is what alan leask has done and produced an accurate comparison.The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place. However the critical site for immunity is probably conserved.I did read it Ian # that’s how I know it’s completely irrelevant. Now you’ve produced aarticle from ! So, just to be straight, your reasoning for easing the Coronavirus lockdown in  is a  year old newspaper article about obesity  I don’t think that’s the real reason is it now  Could it be that you’re putting your political prejudices first again  Not that it matters of course. Now even the FMs most recent slight adjustments to lockdown only allow five-mile car run to a place to exercise. That does not get a Glaswegian far from the centre of Glasgow. It just does exactly the worst thing, concentrates people together in highly populated areas. The counterargument regards spreading the virus into new areas is fallacious. Just in case our FM had not noticed, the virus has already disseminated widely and in the great outdoors of Scotland Social Distancing is a lot easier than in Glasgow or any other city.So, the death ratio in Scotland from Covid , according to the self-proclaimed STE expert is .. That, I believe, is patently incorrect, not to mention entirely absurd, and would mean that . people from  person had died from the disease. As an analogy, based on a notional teeth count,someone had, let’s say, ten teeth and subsequently had one removed then the ratio of teeth removed to those not having been removed would be  , or %. The “survival ratio”, as someone referred to, ie the teeth remaining, is the remainder as a proportion of the whole, in other words  out of , or %, assuming that the dentist extracts within remit. The two equations are not inter-changeable. This, however, from the statistical and other real experts acknowledged in their fields is very interesting: A good point and as always I appreciate a good dental analogy to illustrate the dference between death and survival rates. I know here we like to fight tooth and nail about such things, but it is good to see someone #filling in# the gaps here. And as for Mr. Tinkler, he certainly puts the effort in and even though we may disagree, it keeps things on here lively. He deserves a plaque.Michael Inkster, Try .Decimal point one, not  to  . Actually maths was wrong recalculation above. Simples absurdly so, evenmental arithmetic was a little rusty first time round!!Since it appears to be much more virulent and deadly than flu the future would seem to be less than rosy.In fact, depressingly gloomy and all the statistical information so diligently presented will be consignedto no more than being purely academic and capable of making not a scrap of dference.I am more intrigued into the sources of  major viruses having a global impact from China, and what is the Chinese Government doing about the health and safety of food products and the, apparent, lack of any proper procedures in which to prevent further outbreaks  What is the WHO doing in regards to monitoring potential infections from China and or limiting the movements of live animals in poorly developed hygiene conditions, allegedly We hear the origins of such viruses, but no information regarding preventative measures taking place to restrict and confine such health hazards within an area and to stop this from spreading further afield  Why has there been no ban on the sale and transport of certain foods from China Is the whole process of live animal meat production having to be totally reviewed by the Chinese government or is it a case of waiting until something even greater forces them to act Should we enforce our own standards of Health and Safety onto other countries in terms of a trade agreement or should market forces have a free for all without any restrictions, including Health and Safety  Should this be reviewed JOSEPH NIVEN has hit the nail squarely on the head. The statistics are not clearly put and blaming one UK politician, BoJo or Sturgeon is wrong. The SNP and Torie parties pretty much followed identical policies until last week.If Ian imagines free education has eliminated inequalities of opportunity he is mistaken.inequalities of opportunity frequently come down to ambition. The opportunities are there for all, not everybody wishes to take them.Sure good sound parentage and background help promote ambition, but the old adage you can take a horse to water but!!! If you wish to destroy ambition, try extreme socialism. The good old USSR and present-day Venezuela give good examples.I don#t know where to start with this statement Ian, and I#m not sure it will make any dference to youI do.There are multiple stories on just this very subject, but since you are not a big fan of the arts, you might not have read them, seen them or heard them.You can have ambition, and even a great education, but still be knocked back by the old boy network, or because you are not white or not male. These inequalities still exist.There are statistics to show that Eton boys get the top jobs still, and the only way to get a better leader for this country will be to do away with privilege and try to level the playing field. New Zealand for example have a great leader and it is refreshing to see someone lead who has her role on merit.I know nothing of the countries you mention but I am sure they still have ambitious and educated people despite your partisan viewpoint.Ian might as well say the poor are frequently to blame for their lot. Oil rich Norway does not tolerate UK levels of inequality.Neither do many other poprer countries.Quite what the USSR and Venesuala have got to do with it is likely apparent to Ian.Others will see their inclusion within what passes for his argument as a clear attempt at distraction. The possible impacts of being brought up in poverty by others who have had the same dficulties are many.The opportunities for such children are not easily compared to, say, those enjoyed by the young Boris Johnson.Ian is again indulging himself in victim blaming.UK policy has not set out to create level playing fields for socio-econmic participation. It should, but won#t for as long as #One Nation# English Conservatives like Boris Johnson continue to serve the interests of those of Ian Tinkler#s outlook over those of all. On th of May Ian described intergenerational deprivation as #relevant to Victorian times#.NY pretending ambition alone can help all children born into poverty to escape it Ian is demonstrating Victorian attitudes of his own. Seven year olds brought up in bedsits should choose better parental lestyles.I was unaware Thatcher, Blair, Cummings, Callahan, Wilson et all went to Eton. Mind you, Tony Ben, Sir Antony no less went to Westminster college!!!! Quite what that has to do #With the price of tea in China # rather like your former comments, escapes me!Johan, Ian#s not just a contrarian, compelled to rile others, but does so to share his quite unpleasant world-view. He talks of intergenerational deprivation as being a #very trendy left-wing academic hypothesis, relevant to Victorian times# but it#s a known fact that many a bairn raised in poverty, enjoying few opportinities will go on to live in poverty and have few opportunities. If they become parents, the likelihood of their bairns being able to do better lessens generation by generation without purposeful government action designed to level the playing field.The concept used here is social mobility and many governments globally take pains to increase it. Where those with disadvantageous starts in le go on, on average, to do better than their parents,social mobility is high. Where their lot is likely to be fixed at birth social mobility is low. Scotland has a long running research project to monitor it. In addition to the factors you cite, cards can also firmly stacked against children raised by semi-literate, or drug dependent parents, or in situations of domestic violence or sexual violence as well as other non-lestyle factors. Ian knows obesity can have complex causes, but doesn#t care.

Whatever is implemented will put the wellbeing of our children at its heart.”Schools closed on th March and since then pupils have been learning at home, through lessons delivered online by teachers.Other pledges made by Mr Swinney included one to expand the school estate, using libraries, community halls, leisure centres, conference venues or taking short-term leases of vacant business accommodation to increase the time children can spend with their teachers.He also suggested that retired teachers couldto school as part of plans to limit class sizes.To support digital home learning, the Scottish Government is to invest £ million for , laptops or tablets – with internet access provided – for disadvantaged childrenMr Swinney added “This is not, however, ato schooling as we knew it # schools are not ing to normal at this stage.“To keep our pupils and staff safe we will implement physical distancing, staggered arrival and departure times, staggered break times, increased hand hygiene, enhanced cleaning regimes and a range of other measures.“That means a new model of teaching, learning and support will have to be delivered.

The move is vital to secure a stronger future for the business which is urging politicians to support its drive to produce , hydrogen buses in the next four years.The  staff that remain would be more than a ten-fold increase in the number of employees inherited by the management team when it bought Wrightbus out of administration in October , with hopes to grow the workforce to , by the end of .“When we saved Wrightbus from administration last year, there were only about  employees, and since then we have grown the workforce to ,” said Mr Atwal.“The decision has been taken to trim the workforce to the size we believe we will need to see us through to the end of the year.”The redundancies are a necessary measure given the economic slowdown as a result of the current Coronavirus crisis. However, it has not altered the long-term vision of prosperity for the company.“Throughout the COVID- pandemic, while we furloughed a large section of the workforce, we also kept about  engineers, designers and sales staff working to make sure we can take future orders of buses and work on long-term projects, which will provide security and stability for Wrightbus in the coming years,” said Mr Atwal.The Wrightbus factory has created the world’s first hydrogen-electric double-decker bus, which emits only water and there is a great belief that in the coming years this will see a large number of orders come in.There are already strong sales for the delivery of buses in London and Aberdeen this year, with more cities due to follow suit.Mr Atwal said: “We see the future in zero-emission hydrogen and battery-electric transport and have positioned the business accordingly. Our vision is to have , people working for us by the end of  and we hope to be in a position to re-hire some of those who have been made redundant.“We believe green fuel is the future and will bring a brighter future to Northern Ireland over the coming years.”A consultation will begin with staff on Monday, May , and Wrightbus will be supporting staff throughout the process, eventhis has to be done virtually due to current Government guidelines.

The announcement by management is therefore profoundly regrettable.“Management plans to make redundant  employees and to bring forward a phased-process of reducing agency staffing affecting up to  workers. Every job lost is a heavy blow for the inidual concerned, their household, the wider community and economy – especially in the face of the current Covid- pandemic.“Ahead of this announcement being made, I spoke to senior management to call on them to utilise the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme to protect jobs and retain skilled workers the prospect of workers being thrown onto the dole queues at this time is unacceptable.“Management confirmed they will be proceeding to a -day consultative period on their proposals but that they will consider furlough as an option. They sought to reassure us of their ambitions for Wrightbus in Ballymena and its centrality to their plans.“Instead of reducing employment, we need to ramp up production of hydrogen-buses to curb greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a more environmentally-sustainable economy. “The Wrightbus workforce is perfectly positioned to make a vital contribution to that they have the skills to build the buses at the heart of any future green transport policy.“The request for furlough will be top of Unite’s agenda in the consultation process. Having played a lead role in securing the transfer of Wrightbus, which faced liquidation, to the Bamford group we are determined to bring as many jobs as possible to Ballymena as a result”, Mr Brash concluded.

Having grown up in the era when the river was dominated by the huge red brick edice of the Braidwater Mill, Rodney points out that its path is more exposed to public view than ever. “When you look back, it was pretty much enclosed space from McNinch Footbridge to Harryville Bridge.  “People had no reason to be in that area unless they were mill workers.“Nowadays we have great views right along this section and I personally feel that there has to be a joined up approach to making full use of this fantastic potential.“With the opening of the retail park it has now opened the area up to everyone and the nature and beauty around the river with wildle such as swans, ducks, otters, kingfishers and other wildle regularly seen on the stretch from Sainsbury’s down to Harryville bridge,” he said. But he acknowledges that not not everyone will see the beauty associated with the area. “There will always be some who will still treat it as a dumping ground and continue to put the wildle and the environment at risk by dumping their refuse into the river. “These people need to be told in no uncertain terms that this will not be lolerated by the local community - we have the ability to impose fines on those who continually flaunt regulations and I would call for such monetary penalties to be used more frequently.”But Rodney beleives the real driving force behind the naural rejuvenation of the area must comes as a united push.“ I feel that the authorities responsible for this area and the retail park owner have to take seriously the issues associated with this stretch of water and listen to the concerns of the community groups and members of the public who regularly use the pathways around the river for daily exercise.“My opinion is that things weren’t thought through properly at the outset and the environmental issues weren’t taken into account when the retail park was being planned. “The aim now should be to preserve the beauty of this stretch of the river Braid and that means taking steps to make sure this happens.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3138061.jpg--.jpg?1590480464000\n","title":"opinion moral necessity to support local business in post virus world","story":"By the Very Rev Dr Norman Hamilton OBEThese last weeks have seen contrasting trends as we battle with coronavirus. On the one hand we have come together in our communityto clap for carers on a Thursday evening, and to make ‘scrubs’ for those in the front line of care in the NHS and in care homes. But with most of our local shops, family businesses and services closed, we have also looked to multinational companies and the big supermarket chains to provide us with what we need . They have done much for which we must be genuinely grateful – perhaps best shown in the huge effort to deliver groceries to homes where people are vulnerable. And many companies have prospered. For example in mid April, Jeff Bezos who is the founder and boss of Amazon, saw his personal wealth swell by pound billionafter soaring demand for online shopping sent the firms share price to a new high. This cemented his position as the worlds richest man with a fortune of well over pound billion. As they say – it is an ill wind that blows no one any good. PATTERNSThese changed patterns of le – evident community spirit and massively increased internet shopping – will bring big moral dilemmas when the pandemic is under control and some degree of normality s. Will community spirit be relegated to the back benches by the need for so many of us to rebuild the patterns of our own everyday lives  And crucially, will we have become so content with buying on-line and having the parcel delivered to our front door, that we will be less committed to buying locally, and supporting local business  I must confess to having real fears on both questions. When the focus moves away from carers and the NHS, what community need will fill the gap  It is very dficult to think of an example which affects every one of us, and to which we can bring such loyalty. And will the obvious convenience of having that parcel delivered to our front door be set aside to go shopping locally on a cold November morning or a wet February afternoon Personally I feel that it is a moral necessity to support our local businesses and shops as best we can – evenit costs a little more to do so. They of course will be well aware of the threat from the big international companies, and must play their part in quality of service and show the ‘personal touch’ that will make it attractive to do business with them in its own right. And there would be a great added bonus that such support on an ongoing basis would be a quite new and important expression of community spirit.I have absolutely no dficulty with the owner of Amazon seeing new opportunities to expand his business. But I have real dficultyordinary citizens like myself in our local area see it as acceptable to give his company so much of our limited income that many of the businesses in our neighbourhood go into serious decline. The Biblical command to ‘love your neighbour as yourself’ has a new and crucially important relevance.

He joined the DUP in . When I walked into City Hall in , I was totally overwhelmed. I was the youngest councillor there and the sole UDP one. I went in as a super-Prod from the Shankill, determined to fly the flag high. I#ve learned a lot over the years.In those early days Sinn Fein councillors Fra McCann and Tom Hartley would sit down for a chat. They represented areas with the same problems as mine. Sinn Fein members in City Hall fought tooth and nail for everything they#ve achieved for their communities. Nothing was given to them. I decided to do the same for mine, evenit meant being a thorn in the side of the council establishment.Mr McCoubrey said he#d joined the UDP because the mainstream unionist parties felt remote to someone from my class. He said: I knew it was the political wing of a paramilitary organisation but it was trying to bring peace and stability to the community, and I was up for that.Askedhe was a UDA member andhe condemns its terror campaign, he said: I was never in the UDA. I condemn every murder in Northern Ireland. They were all wrong. None were, or can, be justied.Mr McCoubrey#s term of office as deputy mayor in  was marred when he shared a  with UDA members Johnny Adair and Michael Stone at a loyalist culture day event on the Shankill, which ended with masked men firing shots in the air. He said: Had I known what would happen, I#d not have been on that stage. Things spiralled out of control and I was caught in the middle of it.I remember at the next council meeting, the Sinn Fein group leader got up and said, #I#ve no doubt the deputy lord mayor is a reasonable person but...# and I was bombarded with criticism. Every nationalist councillor wanted me removed.I continued in office but it left a very sour taste for the Catholic community. Had I been able to turn the clock back, I#d have done it in a heartbeat.Mr McCoubreygrew up the eldest in a family of four in Springmartin. His mother was a guide helping on buses taking disabled children to school in west Belfast. His father, who was a fitter in Belfast Gasworks, fell to his death from a roof when Mr McCoubrey was .A lot of responsibility landed on my shoulders, he said. I had just started working as a painter and decorator and I did as much overtime as I could get to help pay the bills. My mum took a second job in the Royal Victoria Hospital laundry as well. Times were tough.Mr McCoubrey has three grown-up children from his first marriage. He has brought up his two sons, Frankand Kyle , as a single dad since his second marriage broke up over a decade ago. It was a steep learning curve for me but I#ve now perfected my cooking, cleaning and ironing skills, he joked.Some times of the year were hard - putting the boys to bed on Christmas Eve and knowing they wouldn#t have two parents there in the morning like most other kids. But summers were always great. I#d a caravan in Portrush and we#d head down there for weekends of fishing, walking on the beach, and Barry#s.The boys are my best friends. I was offered the Lord Mayor#s position four years ago but didn#t take it because they were too young.They don#t need me just as much now. They#re so excited about me becoming Lord Mayor. It#s been a battle getting them to keep it a secret and not tell their mates.Last September, Frank Jnr was the victim of a sectarian hate crime when he was beaten up by nationalist youths as he walked home from school.I was cooking dinner and he walked in, bleeding, bruised and shaking. His jaw was broken. I was devastated. I#ve brought both my boys up to not care about somebody#s religion and I didn#t want this to change them.That night, Arlene [Foster] visited us. She sat with Frank and told him that he must rise above the assault and not let it poison his mind.Mr McCoubrey said the attack had knocked the stuffing out of his son. He played football for Berlin Swts but he hasn#t been back since, and he#s in counselling. But we got phone calls and #get well# cards from right across the community, including from Sinn Fein people, and that was a big help. I want to build on that cross-community spirit as Lord Mayor.

PA PhotoBy Lauren HarteMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailPriests will be asked to distribute communion from behind glass screens or wear visors as part of plans to resume public celebrations of Mass.New details have emerged of the steps being considered by the Catholic Church to get services back on track safely in the coming weeks.Among the options for holy communion would be a glass screen with an opening at hand level at all distribution points or priests having to wear a transparent visor when administering communion to people in their seats.The details of a new draft plan, being discussed by the Church hierarchy and revealed by The Irish Catholic newspaper, will also see vulnerable and older parishioners being asked to stay home rather than attend Mass.They will be advised to continue participating on webcam or on radio for the moment and,they wish, arrange for a family member to bring them communion, while observing the required sanitising of hands.Priests will also have to work with their own parish councils to calculate how many people their churches can safely hold and clearly display this figure.They would devise a parish programme to allow people to come from particular townlands or housing estates to a designated Mass on a particular day, so that everyone can come at least once every few weeks on Sunday.In the past week, many churches in Northern Ireland have begun reopening for inidual visits and private prayer as lockdown restrictions were eased.Earlier this month, west Belfast priest Fr Paddy McCafferty resumed hearing confessions while observing social distancing through the locked gates of his church, Corpus Christi parish in Ballymurphy.He believes people should be allowed back to Mass as soon as possible.Fr McCafferty said: While it has been good to get this far it will be important to have people coming back in for Mass again. This has been an unprecedented time when faithful Catholics have been unable to receive the Eucharist for months.While many churches have been availing of streaming services via webcams and social media over recent weeks, it#s not the same as being present for Mass.I have a lot of anxious parents whose children haven#t yet been baptised so as soon as it is safe we should be doing that.Fr McCafferty added: Clergy will adapt to the current danger and make things as safe as possible. Older people may be disappointed at not being able toimmediately but we have to consider their safety. The draft plan also envisages confirmation ceremonies taking place in mid-September but advises that such celebrations would be conducted by the parish priest and may have to take place in small groups over successive days.The plan aims to ensure that all preparations are made so that churches are ready to move once the civil authorities in both Northern Ireland and the Republic give approval.Government sources in Dublin have hinted that phase four of its roadmap - when public Masses are due to begin from July  - could be brought forward to the end of Junethe virus continues to be successfully managed.The -point programme, which is expected to be boiled down to key issues in the coming days, also bans choirs and congregational singing when churches re-open.It suggested that dioceses prepare short videos similar to aircraft safety demonstrations to assist parishioners in correct behaviour when ing to Mass.The document says: It is clear that re-opening the pastoral le of the Church will be far more challenging institutionally than anything we have been through in the past few months. Our biggest challenge may be lack of motivation to do all that is required on the part of some, and unbridled enthusiasm to do everything on the part of others.It needs to be clearly understood, however, that churches will only be able to re-open for public liturgy when the proper procedures have been put in place.Earlier this week, Archbishop Eamon Martin said it was sad and disappointing that the Covid- restrictions have lasted throughout the Easter season and congregations are still unable to gather physically.Belfast Most ReadBBC Radio Ulster#s Nuala McKeever #saying nothing# after Dominic Cummings on-air gaffeNI death rate similar to Republic#s, not % higher, claims leading economistCoronavirus Northern Ireland updates: Infrastructure Minister Mallon calls for Cummings to resign after two Covid- deaths reportedWhy Derry Girls actress was in tears after Channel  staff saw her working in pub at Christmas partyLeading NI doctor Murnaghan will face no action over #failure# to investigate boy#s death in ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Paul StaffordThere#s no doubt the salon is going to look and feel dferent. It will be a completely new experience, said Mr Stafford.What people probably don#t fully appreciate until now is the fact that hairdressing is not a service, it#s an experience and there#s a social connection there, a bond and friendships, and some of that might be lost when we reopen. He believes masks, gloves, a reduced menu and longer opening hours will all be part of our new normal.According to the National Hair and Beauty Federation, there are some , hairdressing salons here employing around , staff and generating around £m annually. This does not include self-employed mobile stylists.Our industry in Northern Ireland is up there with the best in world. I#m very proud with the levels of artistry here and what we need now is the whole industry to come together and make sure that we follow the right procedures and aren#t left threatened by people who challenge our businesses by doing things illegally, added Mr Stafford.We are quite efficient and work on a tight schedule but under new guidelines there will be literally no waiting time. It will be a case of making sure clients come in on time and are taken straight through, using an efficient system.At the outset we, personally, will be expanding hours, swapping our normal eight-hour day to  or  hours with staff working shts. That could see us opening from .am and closing at pm.We have a -seater salon and we will be reducing that to four compartments with visors and enough space between.Read More Belfast#s Crossen Engineering sees demand surge for new PPE visorPreparing for such scenarios at beauty-based salons here is manufacturer Crossen Engineering, which is already making visors for the NHS.It is starting to increase its lines to accommodate hair and beauty businesses in the run-up to reopening.We are beginning to see other industries order visors for when they reopen. Places like hospitality establishments, hairdressers and beauty salons, said managing director Paul Crossen.This is all hypothetical and all we can do is plan for every scenario, Mr Stafford is quick to point out.It#s not as simple as ticking all the boxes, this has to be put into practice and it could be a case that it#s just not working, it#s not efficient and that will be problematic.I have spoken to friends in Italy and Germany where there are restrictions and guidelines, but no one is monitoring them. The worst thing that could happen is another spike in October, so I would advise clients now to sit tight. Hair is very important but there is a bigger issue out there. Paul StaffordYes, your hair might look bad and I#ll tell youit looks bad, but stick a hat on, put your hair up, go for a walk and wait until it#s ready. To keep his clients# spirits up during lockdown, Mr Stafford has created a series of #The Virtual Chair# chats with local personalities on his Instagram page.It#s me having conversations with people like Colin Davidson, author Oliver Jeffers, musician Mickey Bradley from The Undertones and broadcaster Pamela Ballantine, he explained. They#re typical of the conversations we would haveI was cutting their hair, and that has brought a great community back together. We#ve had a bit of fun and it shows people that this is what they#re missing. It keeps the brand out there and lets our customers know we are there for them and we#re getting more and more people tuning in.We understand that hair is very important but there is a bigger issue out there this virus is killing people and there have been around  needless deaths here. At our salon no one has been left untouched by it, but we should come through this pandemic in a way that shows empathy.We have been indirectly impacted at the salon and we would like to do this in a respectful way that is safe for everyone.

It#s a  Mustang, and Ireland and Ulster winger Jacob Stockdale couldn#t be happier working on his classic car, with its blue bodywork and two go-faster stripes down its back.The -year-old professional rugby player bought the car on eBay a year ago and the last two months of lockdown in Belfast has given him the luxury of time to pull on his mechanic#s overalls and explore the iconic #first gen# Mustang.Jacob won#t reveal how much he paid for the car which came off the Ford assembly line two years after the first Mustang debuted.It probably was not one of my wisest purchases, but I bought it as a bit of a project car, something to do a bit of work to as a hobby and I love it, said the Lurgan native.Going into lockdown has given me time to tinker away on the car, and I#ve done quite a bit of work on it. I#ve replaced the entire suspension.I re-wired a few things like the horn and the radio because they were both draining the battery.And a year after arriving in Belfast from London, the car still hasn#t a name.No, funnily enough I haven#t given it a name. Nothing comes to mind yet, said Jacob.In terms of its shape, it is my favourite style of Mustang. They ran from  to # or #, so I wanted one from that range.The engine is . litres, so it#s hardly a green machine. It#s quite thirsty, put it that way, said Jacob.And what about speed  Jacob Stockdale is certainly no slouch on the field of play.The GPS which players wear on the back of their jerseys records their speed, travel distance and other stats.I think the fastest I#ve ever been clocked moving is . metres per second, which is around  miles per hour or something like that, said Jacob.He name checks the Mustang Fastbacks, famous for their speed, but Jacob is self-deprecating about his motor. I would say mine is more loud and slow.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseJacob Stockdale is happy to have the time to work on his carPhoto by Kelvin Boyes  Press E FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappJacob Stockdale is happy to have the time to work on his carAnd while he loves the loud sound of the Mustang, his Hungarian Vizsla dog, Layla, isn#t so keen.Purist tendencies means Jacob tries to keep the car looking like it did when it came out of the factory and while his new radio looks old, it has Bluetooth. Just the thing to listen to Johnny Cash, one of his musical favourites, in the car Not so, it seems. He prefers to listen to the sound of the car. Jacob#s first car back in  was his mother#s old  Corsa and his road car is an Audi RS .Yesterday, Jacob took time to promote the Phone a Friend campaign from the mental health charity Aware, which urgently needs to raise funds. Demands on their services are high due to the Covid- pandemic. The campaign is being fronted by Jacob, who is a brand ambassador for Maxol, Aware#s charity partner and runs until June .Jacob said: I had my girlfriend around during lockdown, but I have friends who had to isolate by themselves for  weeks and it can be a struggle and a dficult time, especiallyyou are living with depression or any mental illness.

I wanted to take the pressure off them and do something for the whole denomination, providing some normality perhaps, he said.Uppermost in my mind also was the sense of identity, of being a Presbyterian family who could not meet together. I wanted to give expression to that in the midst of everything.He added: We have all been affected by the pandemic, and my heart goes out to those who have lost loved ones across our island and those who have battled against the virus. They have been in my thoughts and prayers, just as those who continue to go that extra mile in providing daily care for them in our hospitals and care homes. It has been incredible and as a church we thank God for their selfless service and sacrice.The Rev Henry last preached to a church congregation on March . I have been askedI feel that I have been #locked-out# because of the Covid- emergency, he said.We have all had to make adjustments and to live with changed times. As a Moderator your diary is full, you know exactly what you are doing and then suddenly  weeks or more are wiped. However just as in the months before the lockdown, I have been busy and in some ways even busier, but in a dferent way. I have done  weekly pre-recorded services, with the last one going out on Sunday.He admitted that his year in the post had pushed me out of my comfort zone. I am naturally quite shy and reserved and that is not who a Moderator is. You have to get out there, speak up and do the things you are called to do, he said.He said that since the lockdown the Irish church leaders have met more frequently, through video-conferencing, nearly every two weeks. He has already taken part in online meetings with the First and Deputy First Ministers, UK church leaders and the Taioseach. The Moderator#s outgoing address will be streamed live on Monday night during the installation service for the new Moderator, Rev David Bruce.Belfast Most ReadBBC Radio Ulster#s Nuala McKeever #saying nothing# after Dominic Cummings on-air gaffeNI death rate similar to Republic#s, not % higher, claims leading economistCoronavirus Northern Ireland updates: Infrastructure Minister Mallon calls for Cummings to resign after two Covid- deaths reportedWhy Derry Girls actress was in tears after Channel  staff saw her working in pub at Christmas partyLeading NI doctor Murnaghan will face no action over #failure# to investigate boy#s death in ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Outside thinking is required!Another added: That is a disaster. No way I would cycle next to heavy traffic doing well over mph with no safety barrier. In any case, it doesn#t go anywhere. So much for the much vaunted new cycling strategy.Wesley Johnston, a commentator on Northern Ireland#s roads and motorways, said the cycle lane has remained unchanged for  years but understood many of the comments as the lane was laughably inadequate.The cycle lane is the bit on the left and the bit on the right is the strip that ides it from the main road, Mr Johnston explained.There#s a lot of people who seem to think it#s a two-way cycle lane which it#s not. There#s another one of these on the other side of the carriageway.It#s not new. It#s been there in that form for about  years and in some form since  when the Sydenham Bypass first opened. All they have done is resurfaced it and put the cycle lane down exactly the way it was before. In that sense the reaction to it is a bit of an overreaction.Having said that, people#s expectations of what a cycle lane should be are a good bit higher than that cycle lane. It#s not a good cycle lane to use and it#s not a good piece of cycling infrastructure.Mr Johnston added the resurfacing works would have been a good time to install a crash barrier, but said it would have been a much more expensive project.I think what DfI have done here is put a picture up which contains a laughably inadequate cycle lane and now everybody is ridiculing them for it, he continued. I think that#s fair because it#s not a good piece of cycling infrastructure, it#s not safe and you wouldn#t send your kid along there.A DfI spokesperson said: The resurfacing scheme was carried out for safety reasons, to ensure the integrity of the strategic road network. The resurfacing of the cycle lane is not yet completed - there#s still green surfacing to be applied at the accesses and further cycle mots are to be marked out. In cycling terms, this does not change the provision that was previously in place this does not mean, however, that this will remain unchanged in the longer term as Minster Mallon has clearly stated her intention to take further action to improve the attractiveness of our cycling infrastructure, including through designs and approaches that give more of us the confidence to cycle more often.

The former Ballinderry Chairman is Ulster GAAs Head of Operations, but has been called onto the GAAs Covid- Advisory Group, chaired by Chairman of Health and Safety group Shay Bannon. “Our work is less than two weeks old,” McGeehan told the County Derry Post, of the group that reports directly to President John Horan and Director General Tom Ryan. “We are there to provide advice and make recommendations. In terms of the decisions, they will be made by the GAAs management committee. googletag.cmd.push “Our remit is a short and sharp piece of work to develop protocols of how and on what basis,it is possible, will it be possible toto training, playing and eventually watching games again.” Professor Mary Horgan, a professor in infectious diseases, has been added to the group. She has previously been advising other world governing bodies of sport. “Her role is crucial in helping voluntary bodies like the GAA,” McGeehan feels. “All of this needs to be medically driven, whether is it is public health advice from the governments or the research around the vaccines and all that might be required in the future.” googletag.cmd.push The committee have, as McGeehan terms it, the easy job, with GAA management having the final call. An initial plan of inter-county action in October and club pencilled in for mid-July, was based on a cut back version. Footballs Tier  championship, the Super s and the qualiers were likely to be shelved, as were the group stages in the hurling championship. In terms of Derry, the senior hurlers had qualied for the NHL promotion play-off. It was initially hoped that games involving relegation and promotion couldve been pencilled into the overall plan, in a bid to provide a clean slate for . “There is no play-book to this and I dont think anyone knowsany of the league games could be played,” was McGeehans opinion on the situation. “At the minute, the focus is on whether activity willat all and what it would require to bring that activity back. No formal decision has been made on the league or the championship.” He also has sympathy for Antrim and Armagh footballers who worked themselves into promising league positions. “That decision will be taken very carefully and on the basis of what space there is. As the weeks go on, I think it becomes less likely that there will be room for them, but I wouldnt rule them out completely.” In terms of club activity, counties have been working away to come up with plans that could be activated once there is a green light. It is likely that club leagues will be scrapped with,there is any action, a series of warm-up games ahead of a knock-out championship. “It would be very important for a lead-in period,” McGeehan feels. “You would want to give club players time to get collective training under their belt, to get them out. Given the timescale, there mightnt be room for many league games. “The window is a moving piste, in that the GAA talked about October and November . In theory, the inter-county programme,bumped into December and into January would allow the clubs a bit more time.” For McGeehan, getting clubs – who he heaped praise onto for their efforts in communities- up and running first is a must. IDEAL “An ideal situation for me would be to get guidance and clarity, to get started back with club football and hurling getting a sizeable window before the inter-county starts back. “Everybody is mad to get out, but only when it is safe to do so. From a safety point of view, it is not about risk elimination, it is about risk reduction.” If the pandemic continues, it could force long term change. In McGeehans opinion, any measures put in place by the GAA may continue into  and beyond. “I think club activity ing is hugely important,” he feels, not just for sporting reasons, There is a a growing epidemic of mental health issues. There are issues over social isolation. I think the first resumption of activity needs to happen at a local level,that is possible.” McGeehan points out the change of language by the government. “Terms such as permanent pandemic surveillance, that type of vocabulary. We are going to have to adjust our lives for Covid- or other strains of a disease like this for the foreseeable. “While it is important to keep peoples thoughts positive, that there might be Gaelic games in , the measure you put in place might carry on into next year and the year after.” The second issue, he feels is becoming clear relates to youths, tied in with theirto school. He asks: “Is there a way, after risk assessments, that you are able to get juvenile activity moving and you are able to get kids out on the pitch again ” “If that is an area of less-risk for the spread of the disease and children have been less affected by it, that presents an opportunity to get them out whenever there is the science to be able to do that.” From the point of view of testing, McGeehan – while pointing out that inter-county players are deemed elite – the GAA is dferent to the Premier League, or indeed the Bundesliga that has two rounds complete since their resumption. “We are dferent,” he begins. “We are neither professional nor semi-professional. From that perspective, the GAA have to look at things dferently. “We have an inter-county game that, like the professional leagues, in theory could work,it was peoples full-time job to be Gaelic footballers or hurlers, but it is not their full-time job.

Last week Deputy First Minister Michelle ONeill announced that the Magee Medical School had been agreed and that students would start next September. Days later Economy Minister Diane Dodds said signicant work is required and questioned Ulster Universitys financial stability. She added that further reports would be submitted to the Executive. Seeking clarity on the matter, Sinead McLaughlin said: “I have today submitted a written question asking health minister Robin Swannhe will publish his department’s own internal business case for the Magee Medical School. We need greater transparency. googletag.cmd.push “While I very strongly welcome the progress made recently with regard to the Magee Medical School, we also have to impose sunlight on the process to learn where the blockages are. It is very important that we keep the pressure on to ensure the Magee Medical School opens in September . “I emphasised this in my speech in the Northern Ireland Assembly this evening, in which I complained about the lack of transparency over the progress on the Medical School and compared this to the confusion over the plans for Northern Ireland after the end of the Brexit transition period.” In part of that speech, she said: “I met – virtually of course – yesterday with senior representatives of Ulster University. I left the meeting with the sense that they were as in the dark about what happens now regarding progressing the business case for the Medical School as we in Northern Ireland are about the new customs arrangements after Brexit. googletag.cmd.push “We need to know what is going on. We need greater transparency. That applies to the British government’s plans for Brexit, and also to the plans of our own government – the Executive and its senior officials – when it comes to the Magee Medical School.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There is a reason for not having any of the dogs of war in this team, those who fought with me in the trenches to conquer All-Ireland club glory in  - I can’t or won’t pull that team apart.

Paddy Chivers, Adrian McGuckin, John Brennan, Brendan Convery and weeColeman were all vital in my progress as a footballer. I owe everything to the players and management who made all my successes possible.  - Damien McCusker  Easy solution here. This man was way ahead of his time in the number one spot. He played outfield for his club and it showed in his distribution and confidence with the ball. His kicking out was superb and would have found you with a ‘short’on. A big quiet leader and gentleman as well.Beer rating - ..  - Kieran McKeever  In his era, would have been the first man selected in any Derry side. He was the greatest corner back when you had to play corner back, giving me the freedom to go forward without having a worry behind me. Had many a spat with him in Dungiven colours and we always came out the other side as friends. Class personied.Beer rating –    - Kevin McCloy  Was too young to be about in Lavey’s really successful years but matured into a brilliant full-back. I coached him at U and never saw anyone who could read the game like him at that age. He deservedly got an all-star in  and gave Lavey and Derry many years of great service. Beer rating – .  - Tony Scullion  He would walk onto any team in the land. He didn’t like stretching and once smoked a cigarette while warming up. He didn’t fancy training one bit, yet he was imperious as a defender. This four all-stars tells the tale. He was unlucky not to win a county championship with a very good Ballinascreen team in those years. Beer rating – .   - Paul McFlynn  He played number five after I left the Derry team for many years and was a superb footballer. Paul was a very underrated tackler and always grabbed you a point at the other end. He was unbelievably instrumental in Loups two championship wins and their Ulster triumph. He was quiet but so influential on the pitch.Beer rating – .   - Anthony McGurk  Although, at , he made fleeting and telling impacts for our  team from the bench, I’m going to allow him in here. He is reason why the rest of us played football in the house. We grew up travelling everywhereto watch him. His Derry side wasnt far off the  side in terms of talent. A pure talent, legend, leader and a great influence our family.Beer rating . .  - Joe Irwin  When I came into the Derry team, Joe Irwin was the best player in our county bar none. There was a defiance, strength and ruggedness that yielded him unplayable. Unlucky not to be around in  but was a great player for Derry and a decent Drumsurn team of the ’s. Great lad too. Beer rating – . .  - Anthony Tohill  Anthony was simply the best as an all round player of my time. There was just no one to touch him. He was tall, strong, athletic, skillful, brainy, dedicated and had possessed two good feet. The big man was such a big gentleman as well – there is nothing more to say.Beer rating –  .  - Gregory McCartan . The single most reason why the Down of  regained their levels of . A midfielder who covered serious ground on the pitch and also could kick long range frees. He would always chip in with an odd point from play as well. He was a massive player for Down throughout the s and he could sing nearly as well as he played too! Beer rating –    - Dermot McNicholl  The greatest underage player of all time. I grew up at St Pat’s admiring and living in awe of Spoofer. A great leader in school for me as well as Derry minors. Superbly dedicated footballer who was unlucky not to start in , but made many telling contributions. You couldn’t talk about Derry football without mentioning him.Beer rating –  .  - Brian Conlon  I was a lucky man to play in the same Queen’s team and share a lecture theatre as well. He would have won two All-Ireland’s with Downnot for his serious injury. He had everything as a footballer, with two great feet and saw everything happening around him. He would have been a success at anything, shown by the companyhe grew. RIP Brian.  - Peter Canavan  One of the finest players to grace the pitch. He was unbelievably tricky in finding space and had two super feet. A massive influence for Tyrone in terms of scoring and leadership. The reason that Errigal Ciaran became so successful and why the song ‘oh you’ll never bring the Sam Maguire home’ was but to bed. Beer rating – . .  - Joseph Brolly  Joe was a real corner forward who always got you a handful of points in any game. He flourished in  for Derry and for many years after. One of the best club players I’ve ever played against in a really talented ‘sirs’ team of that era. A joy to play with and socialise with. Always full of the craic in training and games and still is! Beer rating –    - Mickey Linden  I played with him for Ulster in the Railway Cup and was delighted as it was a nightmare to play against him! He was possibly the best forward I have ever marked . A superb speedy corner forward who scored at will. A real gent as well.Beer rating –  .  - Enda Gormley  ‘Edna’ as he was known, was one of the most dedicated footballers I have ever played with. He trained like a professional and got what he deserved. I’ll never forget his days in Maghera Rec on the running machines. A great scorer from play and frees. He was part of a decent Watties side at the turn of the s. He had a fantastic All-Ireland final in , after getting a slap.Beer rating – . . RELATED - The club hurling team of the decade More...

On Monday, five of Derry City  Strabane District Council’s  household recycling centres reopened after being closed for a period as a result of the COVID- emergency legislation. Long queues formed outside the centres before they opened as people who were in lockdown attempted to dump and recycle materials that had accumulated. Derry’s centres do not charge people to get rid of their waste. In Donegal people must pay for some items at recycling centres while others are free.  googletag.cmd.push At the most recent meeting of the council, DUP Alderman Maurice Devenney said the use of the dumps by people from Donegal was a quite serious problem which needed to be examined. Alderman Devenney said that given the costs being faced by the local council as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, they should not be footing the bill for people from a dferent jurisdiction to get rid of their rubbish. He suggested that when the dumps are re-opened the council should look at new measures to prevent people from outside the council area using the facilities. Alderman Devenney asked for a report to be prepared in a bid to try and establish how many vehicles with southern registrations are using the local dumps. googletag.cmd.push Addressing the issue of cross border waste, a council spokesperson this week said that it is aware of ‘some cross border waste’ being brought to its recycling centres by members of the public and that its centres are designed to handle the volume of waste which passes through daily. She said: “This issue is reviewed on an ongoing basis with elected members recently requesting a full report on usage that will come before them for review and discussion at the next Environment and Regeneration Committee. “Council acknowledges the fact that there are many instances where users of the amenity sites live outside of the Council area, for example they may own a property within the Council area. “Council continues to remind people from outside of the council area that where possible they should limit travel and should use services and facilities in their own areas.” The Council spokesperson added that they experienced a high volume of users at the sites when they reopened on Monday and encouraged the public to hold off and avail of the services later in the week. Five centres at Pennyburn, Glendermott Road, Strathfoyle, Claudy and Strahan Road in Strabane are all open from am to pm Monday to Friday, am to pm on Saturday, and Sunday opening from  to pm for Pennyburn, Glendermott Road and Strahan Road sites only. The public are reminded that the council’s regular refuse collection service is fully operational throughout this emergency period and that additional support to deal with excess waste has been provided through a bespoke COVID Waste Helpline –    - and a free Bulky Waste Collection Service that can be booked online on the councils website.

Patricia McCallion, who owns her own hair and beauty salon in Waterloo Street, agreed to be stripped of her make-up and lashes to take part in Pretty Single which airs on Monday. The series sees siximage-concious singeltons embrace the natural lookto try and finda love connection that is more than skin deep. Patricia kicks off the showbygoing on five dates with five dferent guys, while her co-starswatch the dates unfold from the comfort of their sofa – providing supportive and humorous commentary throughout. googletag.cmd.push Mum-of-one and self-confessed romantic, Patricia admits she hides her true self behind make-up to boost her confidence. “It’s putting on a mask in the morning, it’s covering the flaws that you don’t like about yourself, she said. People often say to me you look like you workin the beauty industry and I do like to look the part. I have to look at myself in the mirror all day at work so I want to look mybest. Each of the five suitors have been specially matched to Patricia but she could only take one to dinner. The dates were one after the other and then you had to whittle it down to two and decide which one to take on a proper date, explained Patricia. googletag.cmd.push If I was going on a normal dateId have my make-up done because you want to impress, but the funny thing was the fellas didnt even notice we werent wearing make-up. I felt like I was putting myself out there and it was scary, but at the same time I felt like they were getting to know the real me because I was more vulnerable. Patricia remains tight lipped about who she chose for her date, but revealed she was given the option of going bare faced or wearing make-up. I kind of went for a bit of both, she laughed. She is now looking forward to seeing the show for the first time when it airs on Monday. The trailer came on the other night after Eastenders and I was jumping around the room, she admitted. I kept rewinding it to watch again. Narrated by Derry Girls star Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Pretty Single is a Stelly Media production for BBC One Northern Ireland and BBC Scotland. It begins on BBC One Northern Ireland on Monday  May at .pm. All six episodes in the series will be available on BBC iPlayer after the first episode is broadcast.

Terence McDowell, principal of St Eithnes Primary School, has also supported calls from church leaders for the  plus transfer test to be scrapped this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Education Minister last week said it was his aim to see a phased reopening of schools across the North, starting with limited provisionfor GCSE, A-Level and P pupils this summer. Mr McDowell said he first learnt of the Education Ministersplans from the news and had not been consulted about them. googletag.cmd.push It was the first we heard of it and a lot of questions would need to be answered first, said Mr McDowell. The Minister wasnt very definite about the plans. Mr McDowell said he feels very sorry for his P pupils who face the possible prospect of moving on to post-primary school without the chance to say goodbye. My heart goes out to them, said Mr McDowell.For the other primaries we will eventually get them back and we can make up for the missed time, but for the Ps you can never replace that time. There are so many rites of passage like their school trip that they will never get to do and they will go into post primary without preparation that we would normally give them for what is a such a big change. googletag.cmd.push If the plans go ahead, it will give us some formof contact and offer some closure to both pupils and staff. The P teachers were told they might not see these pupils again with just two days notice. Staff at St Eithnes PS had already created a DVD for P pupils and a certicate to mark the end of their time at the school. Its always sad to see pupils go, but it will beall themore poignant this year, said Mr McDowell. Under Minister Weirs plans, primary schools and post primary schools would reopen with limited provision for key cohort years in August, followed by a phased provision for all pupils at the beginning of September. However, teachers would traditionally be on annual leave during the school summer break in July and August. Teachers have been working really hard preparing online resources and work packs to keep pupils going, said Mr McDowell. We dontknow what the requirementswill be, but I believeit will be  pupils to a classroom. We have almost  in our two P classes so they will need to be split into two rooms and that will require more staff. The physical layout of desks and chairs will need to be considered and the resources they are using. We have already discussed requisitioning inidual resource packs for each child but that will come at an extra expense to the school and Im sure we wontget any extra resources. Mr McDowell said the movement of pupils outside the classrooms would also be a concern. We need to consider how the children will move around the school as the corridors arent very wide. We also need to think about meal times in the canteen, where normally we would have one or two slots to feed the whole school. Toilet breaks will need to be consideredtoo and time given for children to properly wash their hands. This will all be time taken out of teaching time. Keeping the childrentwo metres apart staff and each other would be particularlydficult for younger pupils. Children in P naturally gravitate towards one another, said Mr McDowell. You cant police that, it is going to be impossible. Things happen at school where children fall and hurt themselves and they will need comforted. Do we have to tell a child with a bleeding to chin to wait while we ring their parents  Some children will find the transition to primary school dficult and they might be crying or upset. To not be able to comfort that child goes against the grain of the very reasons that teachers came into this profession. Last week,Bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown sent a letter to Catholic post-primary schools asking for the transfer test to be scrapped this year, a call echoed by Mr McDowell. The transfer test causes much anxiety anyway and our teachers have been unable to prepare children in the normal way this year and working from home just doesnt compare. It is causing much anxiety and we need to consider something to stop that. There isnt a levelplaying field in what parents can provide. They might be working from home, they might have multiple children, they might be looking after an elderly relative. Every household is unique. I am very mindful that parents have been thrust into the role of teachers, they are not professional teachers. Parents shouldnt compare themselves to others. We always tell the children just do your best and thats the same message I would have for parents. They are doing the best they can. Meanwhile, Derry Sinn Fein MLA Karen Mullan, has called for an`education forum comprising of teachers, school leaders, parents, trade unions and public health experts to be convened before schools are allowed to . The deputy chair of the assembly education committee, said the forum, would address huge concern and anxiety at the prospect of an eventualto school. Its my view that anyto school must be done in complete partnership and in conversation with all those involved in education when the time comes, said Ms Mullan. Parents, young people and our teaching staff must have confidence that health and safety is paramount in anyto school. There will be no one size fits all approach for schools in preparing to re-open. There should be an intense period of discussion that will be crucial to understand the flexibilities and the bespoke needs that dferent schools and dferent settings will require.

However, concern has been raised about a group of young people who are harassing workers on the site. The construction of the new centre had to be stopped because of the lockdown restrictions. However, work has now recommenced following the easing of some aspects of the restrictions. A spokesperson for Shantallow Community Centre, however, said it was important that the contractors were allowed to get on with the project in peace. Unfortunately they are being harassed by a handful of local young people, the spokesperson said. googletag.cmd.push I am asking all parents and any adults to make a point of walking through the Donkey Field - community centre area when you can - out doing their daily exercise, walking the dog or just to check the site.

Council Animal Welfare Officers have been tasked with looking into the alleged incident after a report was made to the PSNI in January of this year. A PSNI spokesperson said: “Police in Mid Ulster received a report regarding cruelty to horses in the Magherafelt area in January . “Under the Welfare of Animals Act, District Councils are responsible for the enforcement of the legislation as it applies to non-farmed animals. “This would therefore include horses. The report was subsequently passed to Council Animal Welfare officers who are currently investigating the matter, the spokesperson added. googletag.cmd.push Mid Ulster District Council confirmed it was aware of the animal welfare complaint and a spokesperson said ‘an investigation is being undertaken into the case’. Images of the alleged incident were published online along with videos that appeared to show a horse with a bloodied mouth and missing front tooth. A further video appeared to show a horse with a rope tied from the fetlock strap over its neck to keep its head in a downward position. Mid Ulster MLA Patsy McGlone called for those responsible to be held to account. He said: “A lot of concern has been expressed to me personally and my party colleagues locally about footage which has appeared on social media. googletag.cmd.push “These allegations of abuse must be rigorously investigated and I have contacted Mid-Ulster Council, Animal Welfare, PSNI and the Minister at DAERA. “Abuse of harmless animals is despicable and those responsible must face heavy sentences for their hateful actions.” Mid Ulster councillor Malachy Quinn, who has been campaigning for an Animal Cruelty Register for Northern Ireland, also condemned alleged footage of the incident. “The pictures and videos that have been shared a quite sickening and disturbing,” he said. “This morning I sent an email to Mid-Ulster Council Chief Executive to seek assurances that it will be dealt with as a matter of urgency. “This time last year I started a campaign to introduce an Animal Cruelty Register, where those convicted of animal abuses would have their name placed on it and it could be accessed by animal charities and police to prevent those people having access to animals again. “Under present law they can easily get animals across the border or over in the UK. The events that have come to light over the weekend only strengthen the call for this register. “The videos and pictures show disgusting abuse of horses and the people who are subjecting them to this should never be allowed to own another animal. “The SDLP will be pushing the DERA Minster Edwin Poots to bring forward legislation to create a register and also the Justice Minister Naomi Long to bring in tougher sentences for Animal Abuse.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mid Ulster District Council has the second-worst broadband provision of all Northern Ireland’s council areas, with some households unable to reach  Mbps. MLA for the area, Emma Sheerin, said that broadband was an essential utility for households. “It is a poor reflection on the state that basic utilities like broadband are still out of reach for some rural dwellers,” she said. “The fact that many of us are still in lockdown has meant that internet, which is already a necessary utility in most households, is even more essential. googletag.cmd.push “For those asked to work from home, for students attempting to complete school or university work, even for the most basic contact with friends and family, internet has been needed. This has exacerbated the frustrations of those for whom broadband is intermittent or non-existent, and anyone who has ever watched that wee wheel of buffering when trying to stream a video will know just how disheartening it is!” poundm of funding has been made available for the enhancement of rural broadband through Project Stratum, with just under , currently eligible for help. Ms Sheerin said it was vital the support was targeted at the premises that are most in need. googletag.cmd.push “Myself and my Sinn Feacutein colleagues reminded the department that there is another reality, namely the disparity that exists within the Up to  Mbps category,” she said. “I asked that homes on the smaller spectrum of speed be prioritised, so we would not see a situation where a house receiving broadband of  Mbps is improved to  Mbps, whilst another home  miles up the road, with a speed of  Mbps, wouldnt receive any help. “It was our fear thatcost efficiency was prioritised over need, those far off, hard to reach homes, would see no intervention, just because it was going to cost more to get to them. A delay to the roll out of the project has seen the number of eligible premises drop as broadband providers continue to improve their provision. “Due to upgrades by broadband providers, the number of homes with less than  Mbps broadband speed has decreasedby ,, from , to ,,” said Ms Sheerin. “I welcome this, but onlyit means that all , homes are helped, particularly those with the worst service to begin with. I have asked the minister that this be prioritised, and that work begins as soon as is possible.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In an extensive interview this weeks County Derry Post, the former Kingdom and Hogan Cup winning boss gives a Kerry slant to a feature on the minor clashes with Derry from  to . Derry have lost the services of Conor Glass and Callum Brown since minor level, with former U player Anton Tohill also lost to the AFL. Current Derry captain Chrissy McKaigue had a stint with Sydney Swans, and more recently Conleth McShane attended a AFL combine in Dublin before Christmas. googletag.cmd.push It was the same one Tohill and Oisin McWilliams attended two years ago. McWilliams later spent time in Australia with North Melbourne, in , but wasnt snapped up. Kerrys  goalkeeper Deividas Uosis and  winning captain Mark OConnor, both past pupils of Fitzmaurice have travelled down under, but their prize asset – David Clford – has stayed put. “It wasnt on his radar,” reveals Fitzmaurice of a meeting they had when he was senior manager. “He had no interest in going to Australia, or anywhere . Id say there were definitely approaches made but he wanted to play for Kerry and win All-Irelands with Kerry.” googletag.cmd.push On the flip side, Kerry lost OConnor to the AFL. He won two Hogan Cup medals under Fitzmaurice in Pobalscoil Chorca Dhuibhne. “He is a great guy and a big loss to Kerry,” Eacuteamonn states. “He got made an offer and decided to avail of it. From a Kerry perspective, it is up to us to make sure the players want to stay for the right reason. “If they do stay, they get a good education. There is a good job for them and they are well looked after to allow them to pursue an amateur sport. “Rather than giving out about it, it is always important to look in the mirror...is there anything we can do that would make a players le a bit easierthey do stay at home. David wanted to stay at home and we are delighted that he did.” Playing inter-county doesnt pay the bills, but Fitzmaurice sees a bigger picture. “When you are the manager of Kerry, thats what you want – for the players - to ensure the were happy in their personal and professional lives every bit as much as they are in their football lives. “If they are happy in their personal and professional lives, iniably they are going to be better footballers for it. Its not jobs for the boys, what you are trying to do is to encourage players to get a good education, to go down a route that they are interested in, so they can build a good career as well as being a successful footballer.” RELATED - Tohill waiting to make his mark.

Lavey, once a force in both codes, beat the Lynchs to grab a title at the start of the decade – under current Slaughtneil boss Michael McShane. Before the maroon and white dominance, Swatragh nipped in to take the  title. It was an era when the CCC produced the master-stroke of a graded championship structure to give more Derry teams a better crack at an Ulster title.  – Daryl McDermott Big ball or wee ball, it didnt matter – Sticks, in his laid-back manner was Mr Consistency between the posts. He had razor sharp reflexes and ied puck-out. He had a great eye and safe hand between the posts. He was Derrys keeper for longer than I can remember. Unlucky to have played in the era of Slaughtneil and Kevin Lynchs dominance. googletag.cmd.push  – Paddy Kelly A constant in the Kevin Lynchs defence and even had the versatility to pick up a spot in attack for the  hurling team of the year. He has put in place a legacy that his younger brothers are now following. In last years final with Slaughtneil, he was immense, led by example and wouldve deserved to lt the cup. Quiet and does his talking on the pitch.  – Sean Cassidy Has been a tower of strength in the heart of the Slaughtneil defence since coming out of the minor grade. Has played a wing back and full back. He is strong, commanding and has a extremely long clearance that takes the pressure off his defence - all done with a smile on his face. Tad took his club for to the county scene where John McEvoy appointed him as captain. googletag.cmd.push  – Karl McKaigue Karl is the player that corner forwards just had to see coming. An very skilful hurler coming up through the underage ranks and as he filled out, he combined his hurling with an athleticism that just sets him apart. Like Paddy Kelly in the other corners, he says very little but when he is given a job to do in a game, there are few better. He can also dodge forward to pick off a score.  – Mark Craig Mark captained Derry to U glory in  and he has been a mainstay in the Kevin Lynchs story at senior level since. He has played in the defence and had spells in the attack during the decade as the Lynchs tried a reshuffle to give them a focal point. Histo the county  under John McEvoy has given the young guns an experienced head to led them into inter-county hurling.  – Brian Oacuteg McGilligan Brian Oacuteg has played at full-forward and midfield for Banagher as they tried began to exert an influence over the Lynchs and try to knock Slaughtneil off their perch. He has played at full-back for Derry this season, but he is perhaps at his most influential at centre-back with his presence and positional sense. He has many more years of hurling left.  – Liam Oacuteg Hinphey One of the terric characters of the club scene and has played both codes for Derry over an accomplished career. He is very combative under the dropping ball and has played anywhere across the half-back line and on the end of the square. And this was all during a career that brought a troublesome injury, but he was never found wanting. One of the greats.  - Chrissy McKaigue The most decorated club hurler of a decade. Apart from his spell with the Sydney Swans, he has been named in the team of the year since the County Derry Post began and he was hurler of the year in . He is just a natural and like Cormac ODoherty and Brendan Rogers, would probably grace any team in Ireland. He is ultra-completive and has a skill set to match.  – Gerald Bradley You dont miss anything until its gone. Gerald Bradleys knee injury probably cost Slaughtneil the Ulster title in , such is his natural leap and catch. He is now back to his best and last season excelled in the role of the teams quarter-back, sitting in the pocket to frustrate Dunloy and Ballyhale but was able to spring Slaughtneil into an attacking outfit. His point against Dunloy last year...well, what can say. Awesome.  – Kevin Hinphey Joins Liam Oacuteg as the second set of brothers on the team. A very astute player who could play up front and in defence, where he was named on the hurling team of the year on three occasions. Another terric servant of the Derry county team and he battled back from a serious knee injury to get back playing last season. Like his father did, he has invested a lot of time in the clubs underage who are now coming through to the county team. - Cormac ODoherty He was born to play hurling. Played in goals at underage, in the teams well before his years, with a touch developed playing with his older brothers at home. Once he progressed outfield, in his own age groups, he was destined for greatness. Accurate from frees and play, but it is his awareness that sets him apart. Very smart on the ball and can see pass before the inside forward even calls for the ball. A natural.  – Paddy Henry Paddy landed - in Laveys  win over Kevin Lynchs. It was a year to remember, as he kicked the winner fo his native Castledawson in the intermediate football final. He has been a consistent performer and has been selected on the County Derry Post hurling team of the year on three occasions. He is now sowing the seeds of hurling in the Dawson.  – Brendan Rogers Rogers was named at full-back on the club football team of the decade and with the small ball, he is the assassin in Slaughtneils attack. He is terric in the air, is quick, has power and a terric eye for goal. He took a bursting collection of underage medals into the senior ranks and was arguably the main reason for their early domination at senior level, with an attacking power few could match.  – Seacute McGuigan The Slaughtneil man is a brilliant ball winner and has an eye for goal that has helped the club dominate the club and provincial championship scene. For the guts of five years, he was unmarkable at the edge of the square and it allowed Brendan Rogers to be deployed where. Has a very relaxed demeanour, but knows how to perform when it matters. Named on the Champions team of the season at last years All-Star awards.  - Ruairi ConveryWhen Convery hung up his hurl, Eamonn Hasson commented that you just dont replace men like him. He was pivotal in Swatraghs hurling and football double season in , a fittingfor a man who spearheaded their march up through underage. A huge loss to Derry hurling as well and its a pity Swatragh didnt land an intermediate Ulster before he hung up his hurl. RELATED - Paul McFlynns football team of the decade.HEADLINE – DERRY CLUB HURLING TEAM OF THE DECADEINTRO BOX It was a decade dominated by Kevin Lynchs and Slaughtneil, with the latter going on to dominate Ulster and knock the All-Ireland door with purpose last season.Lavey, once a force in both codes, beat the Lynchs to grab a title at the start of the decade – under current Slaughtneil boss Michael McShane.Before the maroon and white dominance, Swatragh nipped in to take the  title.It was an era when the CCC produced the master-stroke of a graded championship structure to give more Derry teams a better crack at an Ulster title. – Daryl McDermottBig ball or wee ball, it didnt matter – Sticks, in his laid-back manner was Mr Consistency between the posts.He had razor sharp reflexes and ied puck-out.He had a great eye and safe hand between the posts.He was Derrys keeper for longer than I can remember.Unlucky to have played in the era of Slaughtneil and Kevin Lynchs dominance. – Paddy KellyA constant in the Kevin Lynchs defence and even had the versatility to pick up a spot in attack for the  hurling team of the year.He has put in place a legacy that his younger brothers are now following.In last years final with Slaughtneil, he was immense, led by example and wouldve deserved to lt the cup.Quiet and does his talking on the pitch. – Sean CassidyHas been a tower of strength in the heart of the Slaughtneil defence since coming out of the minor grade.Has played a wing back and full back.He is strong, commanding and has a extremely long clearance that takes the pressure off his defence- all done with a smile on his face.Tad took his club for to the county scene where John McEvoy appointed him as captain. – Karl McKaigueKarl is the player that corner forwards just had to see coming.An very skilful hurler coming up through the underage ranks and as he filled out, he combined his hurling with an athleticism that just sets him apart.Like Paddy Kelly in the other corners, he says very little but when he is given a job to do in a game, there are few better.He can also dodge forward to pick off a score. – Mark CraigMark captained Derry to U glory in  and he has been a mainstay in the Kevin Lynchs story at senior level since. He has played in the defence and had spells in the attack during the decade as the Lynchs tried a reshuffle to give them a focal point.Histo the county  under John McEvoy has given the young guns an experienced head to led them into inter-county hurling. – Brian Oacuteg McGilliganBrian Oacuteg has played at full-forward and midfield for Banagher as they tried began to exert an influence over the Lynchs and try to knock Slaughtneil off their perch.He has played at full-back for Derry this season, but he is perhaps at his most influential at centre-back with his presence and positional sense. He has many more years of hurling left.  – Liam Oacuteg HinpheyOne of the terric characters of the club scene and has played both codes for Derry over an accomplished career.He is very combative under the dropping ball and has played anywhere across the half-back line and on the end of the square. And this was all during a career that brought a troublesome injury, but he was never found wanting.One of the greats. - Chrissy McKaigueThe most decorated club hurler of a decade.Apart from his spell with the Sydney Swans, he has been named in the team of the year since the County Derry Post began and he was hurler of the year in .He is just a natural and like Cormac ODoherty and Brendan Rogers, would probably grace any team in Ireland.He is ultra-completive and has a skill set to match. – Gerald BradleyYou dont miss anything until its gone.Gerald Bradleys knee injury probably cost Slaughtneil the Ulster title in , such is his natural leap and catch.He is now back to his best and last season excelled in the role of the teams quarter-back, sitting in the pocket to frustrate Dunloy and Ballyhale but was able to spring Slaughtneil into an attacking outfit.His point against Dunloy last year...well, what can say.Awesome. – Kevin HinpheyJoins Liam Oacuteg as the second set of brothers on the team.A very astute player who could play up front and in defence, where he was named on the hurling team of the year on three occasions.Another terric servant of the Derry county team and he battled back from a serious knee injury to get back playing last season.Like his father did, he has invested a lot of time in the clubs underage who are now coming through to the county team.- Cormac ODohertyHe was born to play hurling.Played in goals at underage, in the teams well before his years, with a touch developed playing with his older brothers at home.Once he progressed outfield, in his own age groups, he was destined for greatness.Accurate from frees and play, but it is his awareness that sets him apart.Very smart on the ball and can see pass before the inside forward even calls for the ball.A natural. – Paddy HenryPaddy landed - in Laveys  win over Kevin Lynchs.It was a year to remember, as he kicked the winner fo his native Castledawson in the intermediate football final.He has been a consistent performer and has been selected on the County Derry Post hurling team of the year on three occasions.He is now sowing the seeds of hurling in the Dawson. – Brendan RogersRogers was named at full-back on the club football team of the decade and with the small ball, he is the assassin in Slaughtneils attack.He is terric in the air, is quick, has power and a terric eye for goal.He took a bursting collection of underage medals into the senior ranks and was arguably the main reason for their early domination at senior level, with an attacking power few could match. – Seacute McGuiganThe Slaughtneil man is a brilliant ball winner and has an eye for goal that has helped the club dominate the club and provincial championship scene.For the guts of five years, he was unmarkable at the edge of the square and it allowed Brendan Rogers to be deployed where.Has a very relaxed demeanour, but knows how to perform when it matters.Named on the Champions team of the season at last years All-Star awards.- Ruairi Convery When Convery hung up his hurl, Eamonn Hasson commented that you just dont replace men like him.He was pivotal in Swatraghs hurling and football double season in , a fittingfor a man who spearheaded their march up through underage.A huge loss to Derry hurling as well and its a pity Swatragh didnt land an intermediate Ulster before he hung up his hurl.\"More...

As part of the Marathon Potential  cohort, I attended a two week training camp near Torre-Vieja, Spain, organised jointly by Athletics Northern Ireland and Athletics Ireland.I had the honour of going toe-to-toe with then NI marathon record holder, Paul Pollock, on the track.I also had the opportunity to spend time with Paul off-track, alongside Kevin Seaward, learning from two powerhouses of Irish marathon running and building on the advice we received from Stephen Scullion, in Belfast in early December.Most importantly, I made lasting friendships with my fellow Marathon Potential  athletes. The sense of community allowed me to really embrace the project.Setting a goal of putting two of us on the start line of the  Paris Olympics is very ambitious. As a younger athlete, I always felt like an underdog.This feeling, which I once perceived as a negative, has become one of my chief strengths. The goal of becoming an Olympian, which I have chased mdash still chasing mdash from an early age, has, at times seemed unattainable.However, as time has passed, I have grown to love the chase. I look forward to the next stage on this journey, in the company of the Marathon Potential  athletes and support staff, under the stewardship of my coach and mentor of  years, Richard Rodgers, and the band of local training partners.Our way of le has changed dramatically in the space of four months due to COVID-. I remember reading the news in January and having the unnerving feeling that it would not be the last time that I would do so.When I recorded a : personal best over the half marathon in Barcelona in mid-February, the virus was relatively undocumented in Europe. By mid March, I understood that I would not be racing for a long time.My biggest mdash and somewhat selfish mdash fear was that there would be a blanket ban on exercise. Nonetheless, the sanctions under which we are all living have forced me to reconsider the spirit in which I run.To those friends and family in the health service, who have been tackling the virus over the past six weeks, I am amazed beyond words. Thank you for what you are doing.As a PhD student I do not consider myself a key worker. I decided that I would follow lockdown protocol as strictly as possible to do my part. Double runs mdash two runs a day mdash have always been a staple part of my training, allowing me to hit the high mileage required to prepare for the marathon.Completing the same mileage across the week off one daily training session was initially challenging. However, I eventually adapted after two weeks of attrition. In the process, I learned that I benefit from the extra recovery time between runs. This pleasant surprise helped me come to terms with what seems like a more or less empty race calendar in .Athletes are creatures of habit. We are conditioned to race on a monthly or two-monthly basis. Having the options restricted has enabled me to focus on the process of training without looking too far ahead. It has reminded me that, despite thriving off pushing to my limits in races, I love the journey, equally as much.Yes, it is all about achieving in races, but also, to get there a long time is spent training mdash  years and counting. So we have to love the training too. A consequence of this has been that I have begun to pay attention to the finer details in training.When doing a hard workout, I set high standards for each and every repetition, be it focusing on my running form, my cadence or my composure in a strong headwind. I have been trying out new drills and core routines to break up the days.Beyond training itself, I have found myself looking after my kit better than I may have done in the past. This, strangely enough, has been one of the most fulfilling aspects of my day.Given the recent stint of unusually sunny and warmer April weather, I have been leaving my shoes to dry in the sun after runs. A friend recently told me that this is a standard practice in Japan, harnessing the heat of the sun to kill off microbes.It has become a bit of a ritual for me. My shoes fairly pound the roads, so I guess they deserve some respect for what they allow me to do. Seeing them propped against the wall lts my spirits.I can understand that many of you will be disappointed not to have run the Deep RiverRock Belfast City Marathon, but your chance to do so will come around again in September or the future.Anyone who is brave enough to step on the start line of a marathon is a special type of person, irrespective of fitness.More so those who run to raise money for a cause. It takes courage to do this. Bank that courage and build on it over the coming months. It is directly transferable to enduring the current crisis.I remember passing the -mile mark in the  Dublin Marathon. I was in a world of pain mdash itrsquos worth it when yoursquore on track for : mdash when I passed a sign that read lsquoWhat wall rsquoI knew then that I would be coming back to this distance time and again. Right now, I have to wait. We all have to wait. Runners are resilient. Focus on whatever training you can do right now and enjoy the journey..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Dundrum.jpg","title":"Dundrum chef stars in Great British Menu final  ","story":"CHEF Alex Greene narrowly missed out on being crowned Champion of Champions at the Great British Menu banquet to honour  years of childrenrsquos literature.The Dundrum man admitted he was ldquogutted at not securing the final accolade for the best dish at the event ndash despite becoming the second chef to have got two dishes through to the final and the only Northern Ireland finalist ever to have done it.He lost out to double Michelin-starred chef Niall Keating whose fish dish was voted the best by the  diners, who included Alexrsquos mother, Glynis, his employer, Michael Deane, and Michaelrsquos we, former UTV presenter Kate Smith.However, he was being feted by local fans and well-wishers after the show came to an end on BBC on Friday night.The highly competitive  year-old wowed judges and guests with his starter and desert dishes - a potato and cheese sauce based dish inspired by CS Lewisrsquo book, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe and a coconut and chocolate ganache dessert with edible rice pages and covers presented as a book inspired by Oliver Jeffersrsquo book, The Incredible Book Eating Boy.The event was held in early February, so Alex, who started his career off in the Buckrsquos Head restaurant in his home village, has had some time to reflect on his success.ldquoIrsquove been overwhelmed by the response Irsquove had from people on social media itrsquos been just mental, he said.ldquoItrsquos another achievement for me and itrsquos something I wanted to do for a long time.

A producer came afterwards to ask me how I felt about it and even Niall didnrsquot think he would get it.ldquoI was gutted to be honest. It couldnrsquot have been any closer and I did feel it after all the hard work I put into it. While I enjoyed the whole experience, I do regret not getting Champion of Champions. To me, not to get the whole thing, particularly after coming so far, was tough and hard to stomach. Itrsquos hard when I know the amount of effort I put in and then to get so close. But I know that I couldnrsquot had done anymore.Alex revealed that he worked seven days a week on perfecting his menu dishes for four months while maintaining his demanding job as chef at the Michelin-starred EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, the fine dining experience of the Michael Deane group, where he has worked for the last three years.ldquoWe started filming last November and I was working in the kitchen at Deanes every day, and even on Sundays when Irsquom normally off. The guys at work and Michael were absolutely amazing with their support as well as the local guys who produced the props for me, said Alex.Viewers saw that all the chefs were up against it at the banquet as they had to do all their own food preparation with the work being doubled for AlexldquoIt was a hard couple of days and it wasnrsquot all fun and games. We had to do all our own prep, there was a delay in starting as guests arrived late due to Storm Ciara and there was a lot of things that went wrong, like the power going off, that wasnrsquot shown, said Alex.ldquoI joked with the other two guys you can just put the effort into one dish and can make sure its absolutely perfect but Irsquove got two to doldquoThe profile of the programme and the scale of the guests and how well known they were made it feel more pressurised.Ten years ago, Alex moved on to Deanes in Belfast after the Bucks Head, where he was working when they first received the Michelin star under Derek Creagh. He later moved to work with Gordon Ramsay at Claridgersquos, followed by Petrus in London, then had a spell in New Zealand before moving closer to home to the Clf House Hotel in Waterford.There are great expectations on what Alex will do next in his career but he doesnrsquot feel that a change will happen so soon considering the impact of the coronavirus lockdown has had on restaurants.ldquoA lot of people have said to me that I should open my own restaurant, but the industry is in dire straits at the moment so itrsquos hard to know what will happen, said Alex. ldquoOf course, I have ideas of what I would like to do, but Michael gives me a  for what I want to do which I appreciate.

The six bag restriction includes paper, cardboard, cans, bottles and garden waste waste. No commercial waste is being accepted.Ratepayers are being asked to pre-sort waste before entering the recycling sites and no wood, bulky items of household waste such as old furniture, mattresses or electrical goods will be accepted at this time.Council officials say that only one person per vehicle should travel to the site, appealing to people queueing to get in to the local facilities to remain in their vehicles.Only cars, small vans and trailers with small loads will be allowed to use the sites, with access for vans restricted to those no more than .m high. No large vehicles, horse boxes, tractors or small tipper trucks will be allowed on any of the sites.In addition, visitors must practice social distancing, maintaining a two metre distance from staff and other visitors on site, use hand sanitiser and take direction from centre staff. Any visitors who refuse to follow staff instruction may be asked to leave.Council officials insist that they are continually reviewing the centresrsquo opening hours in light of rapidly changing events and may have to make further changes at very short notice.They have appealed to the public to only visit the centres where it is absolutely necessary, keeping heavier and bulkier items at home. Small loads will only be accepted.Council chairman Charlie Casey urged the public be patient and respect staff as the operation of the restricted service gets underway.He continued: ldquoThe council does anticipate that there may be signicant demand in the first few days and that members of the public may be asked to leave and come back on another day.ldquoPlease treat household recycling centre staff with respect and consideration during this challenging period. Thank you for your continued cooperation in helping keep the district safe and clean.Up until this week, only Mid and East Antrim, Antrim and Newtownabbey and Causeway Coast and Glens were the only councils which had opened their recycling facilities following guidance issued by Stormont environment minister, Edwin poots.A number of ratepayers in the Saintfield area had expressed concern that while the recycling centres in Down District remained closed, one in nearby Carryduff was open. They suggested all councils should have acted un unison and opened their recycling centres at the same time..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Services.jpg","title":"Services to be restored in Downe%2C say Trust chiefs  ","story":"HEALTH chiefs have insisted that they intend to restore services to pre-coronavirus levels at the Downe Hospital in Downpatrick mdash as soon as it is safe to do so.But the South Eastern Trust maintains that it is not possible to put a timetable in place at this stage due to a number of factors, including the potential for a second surge of the virus, staff availability, medication supply and the need to provide support within the care sector.A series of changes were made to services at the Downe last month as part of a Northern Ireland-wide response to the deadly virus which at one stage was suggested could claim up to , lives.The health trust says the Downe continues to provide a vital part in its response to Covid-, including the successful rehabilitation of many patients who have had the virus.Last month, the hospitalrsquos emergency department, minor injuries and day procedure units, along with the outpatients department, were all closed and all available staff and equipment from these units was then requisitioned for use in other parts of the health trust area.And while a number of services have been restored at the Ulster and Lagan Valley hospitals mdash which the health trust also manages mdash South Down MP Chris Hazzard is concerned that no services have been reinstated at the Downe.Writing for the Recorder last week, he said health chiefs asked the local community to be open minded and understand that a ldquotemporary overhaul of services at the Downpatrick hospital was absolutely necessary as the organisation prepared for the biggest challenge it had ever faced.Mr Hazzard said the community and all shades of political opinion accepted the ldquounprecedented nature of the situation and wholeheartedly supported the health trust in its endeavour to reorganise local services to help those in need of intensive medical support, with health chiefs insisting that they would lsquofully restore services to normal as soon as possible.The MP also expressed concern about the maintenance of the endoscopy service at the Downe Hospital and that a promise staff temporarily moved to the Ulster Hospital would be paid for their travel time was not honoured. He also raised concern that a commitment to pay staff for the days they went on strike last December has not been delivered.In a detailed response mdash issued after last weekrsquos production deadline had passed ndash the South Eastern Trust said while the Covid- outbreak appeared to have reached a plateau within its hospitals, ldquothe incidents and challenges within the care sector continue to increase and the organisation is currently some distance from being able toto business as usual.The statement continues: ldquoWe are now considering a recovery plan for our elective, cancer and all other key services. This will include the services we can safely restore and by when.ldquoThere is also a global supply issue regarding anaesthetic, opioid and other medications.The shortage of these medications, amongst others, will have an impact on what services we can restore and how quickly.ldquoRoyal College guidelines for surgical specialities and endoscopy currently advise risk assessment and only performing very urgent procedures. This is due to the risk to the staff and also the patient attending hospital.ldquoThis is signicantly limiting the level of endoscopy we can carry out at this time. There are no plans to cease the reprocessing and maintenance of the endoscopy equipment in the Downe day procedure unit.The health trust insists that it is required to agree any recovery plan regionally to ensure equitable provision, explaining the bowel screening programme Mr Hazzard refers to has been suspended across Northern Ireland.ldquoOur priority will continue to be the safety of our patients and staff whilst we do this, said the health trust.ldquoThere is an ongoing requirement for additional staffing from across the organisation within the emergency departments at the Ulster and Lagan Valley hospitals which continue to have signicant and rising numbers of patients attending.ldquoBoth EDs have been separated into Covid- and non-Covid- spaces. The safe separation of patients requires the support of more staff, helping to reduce the likelihood of cross infection and facilitates the requirement for social distancing.The health trust says there is also a requirement to separate inpatient wards into Covid- and non-Covid- spaces at the Ulster, Lagan Valley and Downe hospitals which requires the support of more staff.ldquoUnfortunately, the Trust is also experiencing signicant numbers of staff absences at present. The reasons include self-isolation due to symptoms and shielding of vulnerable persons. This includes a high number of staff who work in the day procedure unit in the Downe Hospital, the statement continues.ldquoIn addition, we continue to work with colleagues in primary care, including the independent sector where there is an ongoing high level of pressure as a result of the virus.ldquoIn some cases, our staff have been providing care and support to the nursing and residential homes in the locality where the need is most acute. Supporting our colleagues within the care sector and the most vulnerable in our society is an absolute priority.The health trust insists that a commitment to pay staff travel time between the Downe and Ulster hospitals has not been rescinded and that eligible staff will receive a payment in lieu of travel time.In relation to strike pay, the Trust said Stormont health minister Robin Swann gave a commitment that pay deducted as a result of industrial action would be reinstated, with payments from the Business Services Organisation delayed as a result of Covid-. Trust officials say the deferred payment has been agreed by regional trade unions..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Soccer.jpg","title":"Soccer over  ","story":"THE local soccer season has come to an end with unfinished business left on the books.Amateur League and Newcastle League officials have brought their seasons to a juddering halt without promotion and relegation issues being decided.Both leagues made their decisions after consulting with their clubs and although no one goes up and no one goes down, there are clear winners and losers.In the Amateur League the biggest losers are Ballynahinch Olympic, who were bidding to become champions of the Premier Division for the first time.They had an eight-point lead at the top of the table when football was suspended two months ago, although nearest rivals Crumlin Star and East Belfast had plenty of games in hand.Also on the losersrsquo list are Dromara Village, who were lying third in Division A and vying for promotion to the top flight.The biggest winners are Drumaness Mills, who have been spared relegation from the Premier Division, despite being rock bottom without a point to their name.Also saved are Downpatrick FC, who were eight points adrt at the bottom of Division A, and Ballynahinch United, who were at the foot of Division A and odds-on to make the .The only section to have an outcome is in Division C where top of the table Rosemount have been promoted.

These changes are becoming more apparent when extreme weather events increase and sea levels rise.ldquoUsing ground-based survey technology, we can study relatively rapid changes in the movements of beach sands on this site.ldquoResearch to date has shown the once golden beach at the promenade at Newcastle have over the past few decades been pushed down the coast toward Ballykinlar through wave and tidal action.ldquoWith increased storm events we are studying how this may present itself in the near future.Professor Jackson added: ldquoAs well as past and present movements, we are examining future scenarios of how heightened sea levels at the site will alter the coastline dynamics.ldquoWe are using Murlough Bay as a test bed for establishing coastal monitoring protocols for other sites in the region. These protocols will help advise any future science-led coastal management approaches we may adopt for protecting these vulnerable environments.Gina McIntyre, CEO of the Special EU Programmes Body, said the research being carried out will provide invaluable data to help protect Murlough Bay for many years to come.ldquoIt is one of the key environmental protection projects that will lead to better, more sustainable, marine conservation activities across Northern Ireland, Ireland and Western Scotland, she said.Dr Melanie Biausque, who can often be seen surveying the beach at low tide using a quad bike, explained what is done with the collected data.ldquoWe visit the site every month and for the next few years this will help generate a visualisation of surface height changes on the beach, telling us how waves move sand around under dferent wave events, she said.ldquoThese are incorporated in a computer model that should allow us to see how future storms will react with the underlying sandy seabed and beach.Another Ulster University researcher, Dr Edoardo Grottoli, has also been collating information of past changes of the coastal system in Murlough Bay using historical maps, past aerial photography and historical accounts of storm impact.He said: ldquoPast events will show us to better understand how important patterns of change have unfolded through time and how the coastline is evolving to present and future positions.ldquoSociety needs to understand the movement of the coast and the processes that drive the changes in order to protect our marine environment in the longer term..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Supporters Club.jpg","title":"Supporters’ club members select their favourite Man Utd team  ","story":"LOCAL Manchester United fans have picked their favourite Reds team of the Premier League era.Members of the Downpatrick Manchester United Supportersrsquo Club were asked to pick their favourite players since the start of the Premier League in .They were tasked with selecting a best eleven along with five subs.

However, for some reason that warning was not included in the inquiry’s letter to the two men.For instance, in the written questions sent to former DUP minister Jonathan Bell he was told: “It is vital that the witness statement you provide to the inquiry is your own evidence, absent the influence of others ...”He was also told – as were many other witnesses – that “you may share the correspondence and the enclosed notice with your legal representative, but neither you nor they may show, communicate the contents of, nor provide this correspondence or the notice to any other person or organisation without the express permission of the RHI Inquiry. Any breach of this duty of confidentiality is actionable at the suit of the inquiry chairman”.Mr Bell, again in common with many witnesses, did not receive an offer to meet the solicitor to the inquiry, Patrick Butler.However, in his letters to Mr Howell and Mr Lynch, Mr Butler said: “If it would assist you, I am happy to meet with youto discuss the requirements of the Section  Notice and what evidence you may be able to provide which is within the scope of the Section  Notice.”By contrast to the identical evidence provided by Mr Howell and Mr Lynch, when Sinn Fein ‘super spad’ Aidan McAteer was asked some of the same questions, his answers were worded dferently – as were those of the spad to then finance minister Máirtín Ó Muilleoir, Eoin Rooney.The questions to all of the Sinn Fein figures had been around an Ofgem employee, Edd Fyffe, who had contacted Sinn Fein in January  and presented himself as a whistleblower, setting out a series of allegations against Ofgem, which runs RHI for Stormont.Each of the republicans said that they had handled his allegations appropriately and neither they nor Mr Fyffe were called to give oral evidence to the inquiry.The News Letter asked whether Mr Howell or Mr Lynch discussed with each other how they would respond to the inquiry and,not,how they could explain the remarkable similarity between their answers.At the time of going to press, there had been no response, despite repeated requests for comment.Mr Howell and Mr Lynch, along with veteran IRA man Padraic Wilson, had been the triumvirate of senior republicans to whom Mr Ó Muilleoir passed a series of complex policy decisions around RHI – even though none of them are energy experts, lawyers or serve as spads who are bound by civil service codes.Amid alarm from senior civil servants, Mr Ó Muilleoir had asked Mr Howell: “Would you be contentI were to sign off on the business plan on Wednesday afternoon ”The former finance minister insisted that he had been merely consulting the influential republican close to Gerry Adams and not seeking his consent to the plan for retrospective cost controls.However, the RHI Inquiry ruled that was not what had happened and Mr Ó Muilleoir had indeed asked for the publicly unaccountable republican’s consent for the massive decision.—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch on social media.There is a lsquoPODS public grouprsquo on Facebook, PODS quiz nights are being held on Zoom, and there is a website to keep track at podspenarth.org article_url   content_id   site_id
