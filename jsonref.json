Meghan is expected to begin the visit by adding her voice to the thousands who have spoken out about the rising violence against women in South Africa.Meghan, who is a champion of gender equality, is likely to raise the issue when her tour of South Africa with husband Harry and their son Archie starts on Monday.The couple\u0027s first event will be a visit to a Township in Cape Town, where they will tour a workshop that provides a range of services to young people, including self-defence classes and female empowerment training to young girls in the community.Campaigners took to the streets of Cape Town earlier this month to protest at what they claimed was their government\u0027s failure to deal with the problem, following a series of attacks that have shocked the African nation.It is understood Meghan and Harry watched the South African president Cyril Ramaphosa\u0027s address to his country following days of protests, when he acknowledged the African nation was facing a national crisis of violence against women.The former actress is an active humanitarian campaigner – particularly on the topic of gender equality – who has spoken about women\u0027s empowerment.Meghan\u0027s activism famously started at a young age. At 11 she forced a soap manufacturer to alter an advert after she wrote a letter to then first lady Hillary Clinton and other high-profile figures complaining that it implied women belonged in the kitchen.The Sussexes\u0027 first tour as a family comes after the duke and duchess flew to Rome to watch Meghan\u0027s close friend, fashion designer Misha Nonoo, marry oil tycoon Michael Hess on Friday.Among the guests at the lavish celebration were Harry\u0027s cousins Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice, US president Donald Trump\u0027s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, and actor James Corden.

People take part in a ceremony to mark the \u0027death\u0027 of the Pizol glacier in eastern Switzerland today         Around 250 people took part in the commemoration, climbing the side of the mountain in a \u0027solemn march\u0027         One scientist said that the glacier \u0027has lost so much substance that from a scientific perspective it is no longer a glacier\u0027         A man with a flag of the glacier initiative places it down as a commemoration point on the Swiss mountainAverage global temperature between 2015-2019 is on track to be the hottest of any five-year period on record, according to the report, which was compiled by the World Meteorological Organization.The period \u0027is currently estimated to be 1.1 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial (1850-1900) times and 0.2 degrees Celsius warmer than 2011-2015,\u0027 it said.The past four years were already the hottest since record-keeping began in 1850.Guterres said last week the world was \u0027losing the race\u0027 on climate change, with the latest report spelling out the extent to which the gap between what is required and what is happening is widening.Rather than falling, carbon dioxide grew two per cent in 2018, reaching a record high of 37 billion tonnes.         Many of the people who took part in today\u0027s ceremony dressed in black, with the event described as a wake         Children also took part in the event, standing side by side with activists keen to raise awareness of climate changeMore importantly, there is also no sign yet of reaching what is known as \u0027peak emissions,\u0027 the point at which levels will start to fall, though these are not growing at the same rate as the global economy.The 2015 Paris Agreement saw countries lay out national targets to reduce their emissions in order to limit long term temperature rise by either 2 degrees Celsius or 1.5 degrees Celsius.These are benchmarks that will limit the impact of warming on world weather systems.But even if all countries meet the goals they set themselves, the world will warm by 2.9 degrees Celsius to 3.4 degrees Celsius, the report found.The current levels of ambition would need to be tripled to meet the 2 degrees Celsius goal and increased five-fold to meet the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal - technically still possible.         People took part in a mourning ceremony to raise awareness of the effects of climate change, particularly on the disappearing Pizol glacier         In a study earlier this year, researchers of ETH technical university in Zurich determined that more than 90 percent of Alpine glaciers will disappear by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions are left unchecked         Eric Petrini, the chaplain of the Mels municipality where Pizol is located, called on \u0027God\u0027s help to tackle the enormous challenge of climate change\u0027\u0027This reads like a credit card statement after a 5-year long spending binge,\u0027 said Professor Dave Reay, chair in Carbon Management at the University of Edinburgh.\u0027Our global carbon credit is maxed out,\u0027 he added. \u0027If emissions don\u0027t start falling there will be hell to pay.\u0027 In 2018, global carbon dioxide was 407.8 parts per million (ppm), 2.2 ppm higher than 2017 and set to reach or exceed 410 ppm by 2019.\u0027The last time Earth\u0027s atmosphere contained 400 parts per million CO 2 was about 3-5 million years ago,\u0027 the report said.At that time, global mean surface temperatures were 2-3 degrees Celsius warmer, ice sheets at both poles had melted, and seas were 10 to 20 meters higher.         The wake comes as a damning new UN report said that the world is falling badly behind in the race to avert climate disaster as a result of runaway warming         On Monday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will push for countries to increase their greenhouse gas reduction targets       Other major revelations from the report include that the extent of Arctic summer sea ice has declined at a rate of 12 percent per decade over the past 40 years, with the four lowest values between 2015 and 2019.Overall, the amount of ice lost from the Antarctic ice sheet increased by a factor of six each year between 1979 and 2017, while glacier loss for 2015-19 is also the highest for any five-year period on record.Sea-level rise is also accelerating as is the process of acidification, with an increase in 26 percent in acidity today compared to pre-industrial periods, as a result of absorbing increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.The report also found that heatwaves were the deadliest weather hazard in the 2015-19 period, affecting all continents and setting new national temperature records.The summer of 2019, which included the hottest ever month on record, July, saw unprecedented wildfires in the Arctic.In June, these were responsible for emitting 50 megatons of carbon dioxide. "},{"url":null,"title":"Oops German oompah bands fancy footwork avoid horse manure Oktoberfest","story":"Share this article          Interestingly, it is forbidden to drink any beer other than Munich-brewed beer at Oktoberfest as one woman grips on tight to her beverage         Two patrons were downed their beers inside one of the beer tents.

Glasgow is at the centre of that spike: at 73.3 years, male life expectancy in the city is the lowest in western Europe, which has given rise to the term “the Glasgow effect”. Going beyond the poverty and deprivation that are the main causes of poor health in any society, the report flags up other contributing factors, in particular Glasgow’s controversial housing policy in the 1970s.That policy – of breaking up working-class neighbourhoods and rehousing their inhabitants in estates on the edges of town – cut people adrift from their community support networks and left them particularly vulnerable to the mass unemployment of the 80s. “There was so much disruption in housing, working-class communities lost their roots,” says Mackay, who herself grew up in Glasgow. “People had to start all over again.”Mackay’s project focuses on iniduals whose life and experiences “tell part of the city’s story”, including those from the “big four” estates – Pollok, Drumchapel, Castlemilk and Easterhouse. There’s Billy McMillan, for example, an articulate young man from Easterhouse whose teachers ruled out further education. There’s Wee John, pictured on the border between Drumchapel and Bearsden, where male life expectancy varies massively depending on which side of the ide you’re on.Then there’s Liz, a young woman who lost her partner to suicide in 2015, a not uncommon experience. Suicide rates are higher in Glasgow than in any other Scottish city, and are considerably higher in Scotland than in England.“Suicide came up again and again,” says Mackay. “I couldn’t ignore it. What I wanted to do was photograph the people who have been left behind – not just the deaths but the impact they have.” She adds that the subject resonates on a personal level: Mackay witnessed two suicides when she was growing up, one on her way home from school. “People taking their own lives, and some of the other things I saw – that has had an effect,” she says. “These are things I had put away, but doing the project has brought them back up again.”“What is it like to come from this place, as opposed to any other place, and how does that shape you?” Mackay asks in her introduction to The Fish That Never Swam its title is taken from Glasgow’s coat of arms, and also evokes the idea that, just as a fish is not aware of the water it swims in, it’s hard for an inidual to grasp the impact their environment has on them. “That’s why I wanted to photograph a baby,” says Mackay. “I wanted to make a point about your place of birth and how it affects your life.”Born in Maryhill, Mackay moved to Partick with her family when she was three, and grew up in a working-class tenement block near the River Clyde. Partick was a mixed area next to the more prosperous Hillhead district, and Mackay says that growing up seeing those differences made a difference. “There was a lot of ersity, and I definitely aspired to have one of the houses at the top of the hill,” she says. “That’s what you don’t get in these peripheral estates.”Encouraged by a teacher, Mackay studied photography at Glasgow College before leaving for New York and London to work as assistant to photographers including Herb Ritts, Nick Knight and Anton Corbijn. She has an MA in documentary photography from the prestigious school of photography at the University of Wales and has said that her work is fuelled by “injustice on any scale”. Now settled in Bristol, she published her first book, My Favourite Colour Was Yellow, an exploration of the colour pink and the way it’s pressed on young girls, in 2017.Mackay’s accent may have softened over the years since she left but, she says, Glasgow still feels like home – and her mother still lives in the flat she grew up in. “I’m an insider and an outsider,” she says. “When I was making this work I was really aware of that.”That sense of being an outsider meant she sometimes questioned her right to make the series, but two factors spurred her on. First, she wanted to get the research from the Glasgow Centre out to the wider public, “because there was only a couple of articles about it in the papers”. But second, she hopes to add more insight from her subjects, because “it’s the people with lived experience that have the answers.“I’m travelling all around the city, talking, and most crucially listening, to a erse group of people,” she says. “I see myself a bit like a conductor bringing all these voices and life experiences together my hope is that the result will be a chorus of voices that point the way to the next chapter of action.” To this end, the series will be published as a book next year and there’s also a documentary film in the making.Mackay says she usually takes the time to get to know her subjects, collaborating with them on their portraits and frequently photographing them at home. One lady wanted to get her hair done and change her outfit before their session, for example, another wanted to be shot looking sultry. “She said ‘When I die, use this picture of me at the funeral,’” says Mackay. “That’s really the highest compliment.”She works this way not only because she doesn’t want to depict her subjects as victims but also because it’s important that the images reflect the sense of personal pride that people in Glasgow have, despite – or perhaps because of – the challenging circumstances in which some of them live. “People take a lot of care over how they present themselves to the world. Their houses are spotless and they put money into dressing their kids,” she says. “It’s something they have power over.”Kirsty Mackay will be showing work from this project as part of the group show Distinctly at the Williamson Art Gallery and Museum in Birkenhead, Wirral, 28 September to 24 November"},{"url":null,"title":"the big picture raul canibano rural cuba childhood","story":"Raúl Cañibano’s magical photograph of rural Cuba captures his longing for the countryside of his youthThis image is included in the first UK exhibition by Cuban photographer Raúl Cañibano. It forms part of a poignant series on rural life in Cuba that he began in the 1990s. The picture is typical of his work, which concentrates on fleeting, almost magical realist images of daily life. Here, a child views caged birds through an opaque window. The photographer is on the inside with the birds, looking out, raising pointed questions about the nature of artistic freedom and its discontents.Cañibano, now 58, was not always a photographer. Born two years after Castro’s revolution in the sugar farming region of Cienfuegos, he grew up to be a welder working in civil aviation. He was nearly 30 when a visit to a show of surrealist photographs inspired him to pick up a camera. At first, he photographed weddings at weekends, but eventually he gave up his day job and moved out on to the streets.His vocation did not arrive at a good moment. The US embargo on trade with Cuba, and the collapse of the Soviet Union, meant that materials, which had mostly come from East Germany, were in short supply. Cañibano had to work with expired photographic stock, and was thus limited in the number of pictures he could take, which made each composition an event.The challenges in making the images seem to add to their value. Cañibano works now as a commercial photographer in Cuba, but the ongoing series captures a complex yearning for the countryside of his childhood: “The child in this picture, the son of peasants,” he said recently, “was playing just like these children do in a different way to city children because their playthings are the countryside and everything that surrounds them.”Raúl Cañibano: Chronicles of an Island is on at the Print Sales space of the Photographers’ Gallery, London W1, until 17 November"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7963eec041d6edec510ec03e38fbbce6d4cd108b/411_161_2303_1381/master/2303.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90a83b14cd53d7d582272692e5d6257b","title":"in it to win it why are we so obsessed with quizzes","story":"The return of the classic quiz show Blockbusters reflects our love of knowledge tests. Rae Ritchie looks at why getting the right answer is so addictive, and why getting the wrong answer can be so funnyWhat Q is one of the nation’s favourite pastimes? Nope, it’s not quidditch. It’s quizzes. We love racking our brains for that obscure bit of knowledge that we’re sure we once heard somewhere. Whether we are in the pub with our mates or at home shouting at the television, the feeling of getting an answer right is addictive. But why do we find quizzes so compelling?A buzz from the buzzerThe very nature of a quiz lures us in. As veteran question writer David Bodycombe observes: “If a question is posed, you can’t help but wonder what the answer is.”When we get the answer correct, various factors make us want to go back for more. Michelle Tolfrey, a clinical psychologist and member of the Welldoing.org community of therapists, explains: “Physiologically, when we win something, we experience a nice hit of dopamine, which can be quite a euphoric and ‘buzzy’ feeling to have. As a result, we may want to replicate this again and again to get the same sensation.”Tolfrey also points out the psychological rewards involved in quizzes. “They can be particularly enjoyable if we are doing them in the context of socialising with peers, where it can help us to feel connected with others and part of something special.“And there are, of course, lots of other social rewards involved with quizzes, such as receiving praise from others or being given a certain title, prize or accolade that boosts our self esteem.”Fellow clinical psychologist and Welldoing.org therapist Patapia Tzotzoli agrees that quizzes can meet basic human needs. “People are creatures of emotion and are motivated by pride and vanity,” she says. “Quizzes offer a platform where our knowledge is being assessed by our ability to retrieve information quickly while others are watching. Doing so offers us quick gratification and a sense of achievement that nourishes our self-esteem and gains us immediate recognition.“In other words, quizzes offer a setting with the right conditions to feed our need to be important and appreciated for it.”But if quizzes are so rewarding, why do our brains seem to crack under the pressure of needing to come up with the right answer – and quickly?“Sometimes anxiety kicks in and interferes with our memory – and consequently our performance,” states Tzotzoli. “The more anxious we become, the harder it is to remember the information we are after and we experience what we commonly describe as our ‘mind going blank’.”Not quite the answerTimes when a contestant’s mind goes awry make for comedy gold on quiz programmes. On the iconic 80s and 90s show Blockbusters, for instance, participants still had “mind going blank” moments despite being given the first letter of the answer. When asked by legendary host Bob Holness “What D, rhyming with a synonym for defraud, means to decrease in number or grow smaller in size?”, quizzer Susie somehow managed to come up with shrink (correct answer: dwindle, rhymes with swindle).At other times, contestants stuck to the right letter, but under the pressure of studio lights, got the wrong word. After answering “What O is the generic word for any living animal or plant, including bacteria or viruses?”, a young man cringed when he realised that he’d replied orgasm not organism. Contestant Pauline looked even more mortified when the penny dropped that the response to “What K is a Chinese ceremony of abasement?” was kowtow – not Kama Sutra.More such moments follow on the new series of Blockbusters that’s about to hit our screens on Comedy Central. Host Dara Ó Briain is met with laughable responses to questions including “What Q is a type of pen that is made from a bird’s feather” and “What N are potatoes when they first come into season?” No, the answers are not quail and nugget.As in the original, this latest incarnation features student contestants, although a celebrity special with Strictly Come Dancing’s Stacey Dooley and Oti Mabuse against comedian Josh Widdecombe starts the series off.For us armchair quizzers joining in from our sofas, the Blockbusters style of question has major appeal. As Bodycombe puts it: “It’s a clever format because there’s a clue inherently built into the question, which automatically makes you think you might have a chance of getting it right.”Bodycombe is spot-on. No matter how smart, we all need a little help. Just try to distinguish between organism and orgasm.What B has a brand new series?The new series of Blockbusters – hosted by Dara Ó Briain – hits our screens at 8pm on Thursday 26 September on Comedy Central."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3169ecc41d3ec20850bbf74c75bb61522702e6cc/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e20e9b2e1ddadc4b6ae43646f32c744e","title":"question are two heads really better than one","story":"Blockbusters, the classic gameshow that pits two players against one, is returning for a second series. So in quizzes – and indeed life – do you get the best results working in a team or flying solo? Abi Smith unpicks the scienceHow good are you at quizzes? Go on, you can be honest. You think you’re pretty good, right? Well, you might have a superior intellect – but then again, you might just be overconfident. “This is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect, which states that the majority of people tend to overestimate their abilities,” says Matt Shaw, a performance psychologist at coaching company InnerDrive.“Interestingly, this is more pronounced in those with the lowest ability, such as inexperienced players,” says Shaw. “Experts tend to underestimate their abilities, which is sometimes called ‘the burden of expertise’.”Knowing whether you are the type of person who is burdened with expert knowledge or likely to overegg your skills is the kind of insight that would come in handy when playing Blockbusters – the classic TV gameshow that pits a single player against a team of two students.Recently relaunched on Comedy Central with comedian Dara Ó Briain presiding, the game sees contestants making their way across the iconic hexagon-filled game board, answering questions that begin with a particular letter of the alphabet. The format rewards general knowledge, lateral thinking, quick reactions and – in the case of the paired-up players – teamwork.“It’s really important that you choose your thinking partner wisely,” says Robert Ritchie, who’s made a career by cultivating positive mindsets and behaviours across different types of teams.Currently head of organisational development at the University of Salford, Ritchie says “one head is better than two” in the idea-creation stages. After that, he says, you can deliberately decide who to bring in and when. “In a quiz format, that process is accelerated. You have to have that initial moment of reaction and decision on your own, otherwise you’ll only ever be going around consensus or groupthink,” he adds. Get the right teammate and gameplay can be dazzlingly swift: just check out this pair of Cambridge students trouncing their single opponent.Intriguingly, however, two heads are likely to be better than one even if you’re not both Blockbusting naturals. “There is a quirky phenomenon called the Köhler effect,” says Shaw. “This is when working with other people, the weaker teammate tends to elevate their performance. Not only do people work harder if their partner is outperforming them, they are also more motivated when they know that the team’s performance relies on them. This is more prominent when team members’ abilities are similar, like in a quiz.” It’s perhaps no surprise, therefore, that across the two Comedy Central series of Blockbusters, 11 out of 20 have been won by the pair – despite pairs requiring one more correct answer each round than the solo players.Question setter Charlotte Hazzard, who runs the quiz at the historic Grapes pub in Limehouse, London, also believes that two heads are better than one. “When you’ve got two brains, you’re able to pull on a greater bank of knowledge, and pub quizzes often need quite a wide spread of general knowledge,” she says.Knowing the information and having it ready at the right moment are two very different skills, however. Team player Philip fell foul of this when asked: “What U is something designed for both men and women?” His immediate response – underwear – was factually correct but not what the question was looking for. The word Ó Briain wanted, of course, was unisex.There’s a reason that the first answer that comes into your head won’t necessarily win you points, according to Shaw. “Gut responses are essentially shortcuts that help us make decisions quickly and when under pressure. However, they’re not always accurate. Under stress or pressure (like in a quiz), our focus can become too narrow, meaning we stop searching for alternative answers, which can lead to mistakes,” he says.Comedian Josh Widdicombe learned this to his cost on the celebrity edition when he buzzed in too soon on a question about West End musicals, proffering West Side Story as his W answer. This allowed professional dancer and presenter Oti Mabuse to swoop in with the correct response – Wicked – and salvage the point for herself and her presenter teammate, Stacey Dooley.Sometimes though, one head is all it takes. “At the end of the day, if you go with your gut instinct and get it incorrect, you’re more forgiving of yourself than if you hadn’t gone with your gut,” says Hazzard, whose quiz is often frequented by the leaseholder of the Grapes pub, Sir Ian McKellen. The other benefit of going it alone is that you don’t need to negotiate the politics of playing in a team.

In the bizarre and tumultuous state of British politics, this fact is one that will stand among the most historically significant. It is an extraordinary situation. Foster is a member of a regional legislative assembly that hasn’t sat for nearly 1,000 days, the leader of a party with just 10 MPs, and the subject of an inquiry that may well see the end of her political career within weeks.But at this time, she holds the key to Brexit. And the stability of the pound, the constitution of the UK, the size of the European Union and the future of the continent are in no small way affected by her decisions.So what is Foster proposing? Her apparent acceptance of a Northern Ireland-only solution stands out in luminescent colours from her recent comments in Dublin. But we should not assume that this clears the way for a Northern Ireland-specific backstop returning to the table, and thus speeding us through to the withdrawal agreement.Having spent the past two years being decisive about very little, other than resistance and naysaying, Foster is now under a great deal of pressure to move away from her “blood-red line” against any post-Brexit differential between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Even those pushing alternative arrangements acknowledge that there is no way around putting some controls in the Irish Sea after Brexit. It was in Dublin, of all places, last week, where Foster decided to push forward. The question being asked across the European continent now is: how far did she move?In some ways, it could be seen to be a moot point. If Boris Johnson can lose almost two dozen of his party’s MPs without so much as a shrug, why would he worry too much about what the DUP thinks? The loss of the confidence of the DUP, which long failed to supply his predecessor with the promised votes, is hardly a game-changer.But the truth is that what the DUP does now will have a determining role in Northern Ireland’s future – for better or worse. And, with that, it will shape the whole outcome of Brexit, including whether it leads, sooner or later, to the dissolution of the United Kingdom itself.It is absolutely critical that Foster brings unionism with her in accepting the prospect of distinctive treatment for Northern Ireland. This is no small task. Unionism has rallied behind the notion that the withdrawal agreement is anathema to the union itself. Polls have shown that, in the space of a year, support for the backstop among unionists in Northern Ireland has plummeted. This is in no small part owing to the antagonism towards it led by Foster herself.There is a risk that the UK could exit the EU with a deal but at the cost of stability in Northern Ireland. If unionists are left feeling betrayed by the DUP, then perhaps the party could seek to regain credibility by offloading Foster as leader. But if unionists are left feeling shafted by the British government, then it means a breakdown of trust that will be incredibly difficult to restore.Of course, the nature of Northern Ireland means that this tension works both ways. If the pressure for a deal sees the Irish government concede so much on the withdrawal agreement that nationalists in Northern Ireland feel exposed and vulnerable, then this too would rock the foundations of the peace process.Looking more closely at what Foster said in Dublin, it remains fairly clear that the tension that has always been there in DUP (and Conservative party) aspirations for Brexit remains absolutely entrenched: that is, the stubborn belief that it is possible for the UK to leave the single market and customs union yet there be no trade barriers within the UK, and frictionless trade on the island of Ireland.The backstop cut through this tension but left unionists and Brexiters feeling hard done by. But the backstop is a notion and term that is more toxic for unionists than that of “all-island arrangements”.Indeed, Foster notes that the DUP “recognises the unique history and geography” of Northern Ireland, which in turn gives a certain logic to specific arrangements for Northern Ireland. While this is something the party has flatly contradicted in repeated comments over the past year, it can also claim that this has long been its position.In its 2017 manifesto, the DUP sought Northern Ireland-specific solutions, and it wanted to see the “particular circumstances of Northern Ireland” fully reflected in the negotiations.It is significant that there are strong similarities between these aims and those of all the other main parties in Northern Ireland. Sinn Féin has long argued for special designated status for the region. The Alliance party has argued for a special deal for Northern Ireland. The SDLP has argued for its “bespoke” status. And the Ulster Unionists have sought its designation as a special enterprise zone.If Foster can now act to solidify this common ground between nationalists, unionists and others in Northern Ireland, and if she can steer a path towards an acceptable withdrawal agreement and future deal, it would be a rare and momentous act of leadership that could change the course of European history.• Katy Hayward is reader in sociology at Queen’s University Belfast and author of Bordering on Brexit"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e67411c6b9ef02ddbc57d393ba8695e212a780da/0_56_3703_2223/master/3703.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47850d47ab27033a98e45d32dd592651","title":"jeremy corbyn peoples vote remainers labour election","story":"A Labour election victory is the only viable route to ending the UK’s polarising culture war over BrexitEssential to the success of any struggle is to recognise when you have won. It is less than a year and a half since the People’s Vote campaign was founded. It has organised mass demonstrations, rallies, petitions its grassroots have leafleted, chanted, sung and often rather pointedly made themselves heard on social media. Their demand was straightforward: any Brexit deal negotiated with the EU should be subject to a confirmatory referendum, with remain as the other option. And that campaign has achieved a dramatic success, compelling Labour to implement its policy if it wins an election. Yet where are the triumphant declarations or the rightly triumphalist victory parties?Labour’s leadership is savaged for inconsistency and zigzagging incomprehensibly, as though it is unique or politically bankrupt in its attempt to manage drastically shifting sands and an ever more polarising culture war. For those of us who campaigned for remain in the referendum, there was a particular problem: there was no mass movement on our side. The official remain campaign was a dire, corporate, status quo outfit that did not understand, and was institutionally incapable of relating to, a deep well of disillusionment in British society.Remain emerged as a mass movement only after the referendum: or, more accurately, after the 2017 election. In the immediate aftermath of June 2016, many remainers were traumatised but resigned to making the result work. The notion of “no deal” was nowhere within the realms of political possibility, and Nigel Farage had extolled the virtues of Norway, which is a member of the single market. Labour’s position – that although the referendum had been lost, the result was close, and a deal should be based on a close relationship with the EU – made sense in a society willing to compromise.Stalwarts of Remainia passionately backed activating article 50, from Anna Soubry to Chuka Umunna, who argued that “to stand against the decision of the country would be to deepen Labour and the country’s isions”. Open Britain – the successor of the official remain campaign – argued for membership of the single market and the customs union. Labour itself fought its election campaign promising to honour the vote and without committing to the single market and customs union, much to the later chagrin of remainers. What changed? The Tory administration in general, and the Tory Brexiteers in particular, treated the referendum result as though they were an all-conquering army, that the winner takes all. Remainers were not only excluded from the process but were systematically humiliated and insulted by the government. Not only was a hard Brexit offered by Theresa May, but the Brexiteers toxified the possibility of any negotiated deal in favour of the delusion of no deal. When May lost her majority, she should have accepted that the British people had delivered a mandate for a compromise, soft Brexit, and worked on a cross-party basis to secure it she did not.While some leading remain figures genuinely saw Brexit as a terrible national tragedy, others saw it as a means to attack the Labour leadership and drive a wedge between it and its members and voters, leading to ever worsening bad blood. The consequences have been a progressively more bitter culture war. But what is striking is how swiftly the polarisation has taken place. It was after the UK didn’t leave the EU on 31 March that the dam truly burst, aided by a European election campaign that rewarded the radical sides of the ide.Labour has made errors. Its failure to make a principled case for freedom of movement has been depressing and cowardly. And while certain politically hostile elements have used Brexit as a stick to beat the leadership, there has been a failure to empathise with those seeing it as a disaster capitalist migrant-bashing project.The party should have moved more quickly and decisively when its compromise position had been destroyed in polling stations across the country in the European elections. A shambolic, misfired attempt to remove Labour’s deputy leader – however authentic the grassroots anger with him is – has only fuelled Corbyn’s enemies.But the People’s Vote campaign has triumphed, and the only viable route to ending Brexit lies in the Tories being displaced by Labour as the party of government. Those who apparently will never be satisfied until Corbyn tattoos the EU flag on his face and camps outside parliament bellowing “Stop Brexit” should consider that the culture war is ripping the social fabric of British society apart.Without an attempt to bridge a toxic ide, an ugly future awaits us all. If – in another referendum – leavers are left feeling like a defeated people presided over by a triumphalist conquering army, the UK will remain a tinderbox. Is demanding Corbyn campaigns passionately for remain, when almost the entire Labour party will do anyway, worth it? The entire political strategy of the UK’s joint prime ministers – Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings – rests on a ided remain vote. Without tackling the injustices that led to this turmoil – as Labour is committed to doing – how will social peace ever be achieved? The truth is Remainia staged an insurrection, and it won. Sometimes you have to accept defeat: what is baffling is, in this case, many seem incapable of accepting victory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5945dec7dd87332b8c20319d72219949de40aab5/0_94_3648_2189/master/3648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=160a7c454f51096189ad511c5b4b84fa","title":"saudi arabia iran us middle east saudis","story":"There is a longstanding joke told in the Middle East about Saudi Arabia’s reluctance to fight its own wars. “Saudi Arabia will fight until the last Pakistani,” the punchline goes, in reference to the fact that Pakistani troops have long supported Saudi’s military endeavours.The punchline has expanded lately to include the Sudanese, a recent addition to the Saudi army’s ground troops. Saudi Arabia is accustomed to buying labour that it deems too menial for its citizens, and it extends that philosophy to its army.There is always a poorer country ready to send cannon fodder for the right price. The military assault in Yemen is sometimes referred to as “the Arab coalition”, a respectable term for a Saudi-led group of combatants that, in addition to allies in the Gulf, includes forces from Egypt, Jordan and Morocco, as well as Sudanese child soldiers, whose deaths are handsomely compensated for with cash paid to their families back home. When asked what fighting in Yemen under the command of the Saudis had been like, some returning Sudanese troops said that Saudi military leaders, feeling themselves too precious to advance too close to the frontline, had given clumsy instructions by satellite phones to their hired troops, nudging them in the general direction of hostilities. Where things were too treacherous, Saudi and coalition airforces simply dropped bombs from high-flying planes, inflating civilian casualties. This is how Saudi fights: as remotely as possible, and paying others to die.It is baffling, in the light of last week’s attacks on two Saudi oil facilities, that there is so much speculation about Saudi and Iran going to war. Saudi does not “go to war”: it hires proxies, and depends on US gullibility to continue the lie that it is the regional peacekeeper, and that any threat to the country destabilises the region. The US and Saudi Arabia have repeatedly accused Iran of being behind the attacks, which were claimed by Yemen’s Houthi movement, a group aligned with Iran and fighting the Saudi-led alliance in Yemen’s civil war. The Pentagon has announced that it will be sending hundreds of US troops, in addition to air and missile defence equipment, to Saudi Arabia as a “defensive” move. Why does a country that was the world’s largest arms importer from 2014 to 2018, according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, need so much help? What, then, does a country that is involved in one military campaign, in Yemen, and which appears so vulnerable to attack and in need of constant protection, do with so many weapons? Buying the weapons, rather than deploying them, is the point. These multimillion-dollar purchases maintain commercial relations with western allies from whom it imports arms, and who in return turn a blind eye to Saudi’s human rights abuses, assassinations and kidnappings, because there is too much money at stake. Saudi Arabia’s entire foreign policy model is based on using its wealth to buy friends and silence.And so Saudi must continue to play on US fears about Iran, ensuring that its bodyguard is always “locked and loaded”, as Trump stated in a sabre-rattling tweet after the drone strikes. At the same time, Saudi continues to destabilise the region by meddling in the internal affairs of other Arab countries, passing on arms to other dictatorships in the Middle East and North Africa, and launching aggressive social media intimidation and disinformation campaigns. Even Twitter clamped down on Saudi accounts last week. And still the country is perceived to be a vulnerable innocent, a bulwark against chaos in the Middle East. Bellicose in the extreme, and yet aware that it is highly unlikely to suffer the consequences of its pugnaciousness, Saudi is currently locked in escalating conflicts with Iran, Qatar and Yemen, propping up military regimes in Sudan and Egypt, messily meddling in Lebanon, and continuing to fund random Sunni hardline endeavours all over the world – and generally getting away with it. Saudi will not go to war with Iran, but the US may do so on its behalf. Meanwhile, Saudi looks on – as ever, the indulged and unpunished provocateur of the Middle East."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23978c719ffbab6093a9623769276d812606ab96/0_236_7079_4247/master/7079.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdaf8b79300fa92bd0241418ea1f9d53","title":"the guardian view on machine learning a computer cleverer than you","story":"Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, last week told the  that tech companies should stop behaving as though everything that is not illegal is acceptable. Mr Smith made a good argument that technology may be considered morally neutral but technologists can’t be. He is correct that software engineers ought to take much more seriously the moral consequences of their work.This argument operates on two levels: conscious and unconscious. It is easy to see the ethical issue in Microsoft’s sale of facial recognition technology to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement while the Trump administration was separating children from parents at the US’s southern border. The moral stance of more than 3,000 Google employees who protested about its Maven contract – where machine learning was to be used for military purposes, starting with drone imaging – with the US Department of Defense should be applauded. Google let the contract lapse. But people with different ethical viewpoints can take different views. In the case of the Maven contract, a rival with fewer qualms picked up the work. Much is contingent on public attitudes. Opinion polls show that Americans are not in favour of developing artificial intelligence technology for warfare, but this changes as soon as the country’s adversaries start to develop them. There is an economic aspect to be considered too. Shoshana Zuboff’s insight, that the exploitation of behavioural predictions covertly derived from the surveillance of users is capitalism’s latest stage, is key. What is our moral state when AI researchers are paid $1m a year but the people who label and classify the input data are paid $1.47 an hour.But is this true for programmers? It is in the nature of AI that makers do not, and often cannot, predict what their creations do. We know how to make machines learn. But programmers do not understand completely the knowledge that intelligent computing acquires. If we did, we wouldn’t need computers to learn to learn. We’d know what they did and program the machines directly ourselves. They can recognise a face, a voice, be trained to judge people’s motivations or beat a computer game. But we cannot say exactly how. This is the genius and madness behind the technology. The promise of AI is that it will imbue machines with the ability to spot patterns from data, and make decisions faster and better than humans do. What happens if they make worse decisions faster? Governments need to pause and take stock of the societal repercussions of allowing machines over a few decades to replicate human skills that have been evolving for millions of years.

And it followed Rayner’s announcement that Labour would overhaul school inspections in England by abolishing Ofsted, a proposal that received a mixed welcome by teachers and prompted accusations of lowering standards by its opponents.Sunday’s controversial step on private schools, which would represent a existential threat to their dominance of the most influential roles in the establishment, was greeted enthusiastically by the Abolish Eton campaign, which has pushed the issue up the party’s agenda.Holly Rigby, a campaign organiser and state school teacher said: “This is a really positive moment for the Labour party because it’s the strongest commitment that the party has made to deal with the problem of private schools in a very long time. It’s a really radical commitment as well … This is a really big victory for the left.”But Julie Robinson, the chief executive of the Independent Schools Council, which represents about 1,000 private schools in England including Eton, said Labour’s vote was an attack on the rights of parents.“Tearing down excellent schools does not improve our education system. The repercussions would be irreversible and far-reaching, damaging educational opportunities and limiting life chances. Moreover, Labour’s plan would breach the European Convention on Human Rights on the right to choose education,” Robinson said.Rayner said she backed the efforts, and said that a new social justice commission would be tasked with integrating private schools into the state system.“Our very first budget will immediately close the tax loopholes used by elite private schools and use that money to improve the lives of all children,” Rayner said.Labour also set out a major shake up of Ofsted, with Rayner telling conference delegates in Brighton: “Schools will no longer be reduced to a one-word grade or subjected to a system that hounds teachers from the classroom.”Instead Rayner promised “a new system of peer review will deliver school improvement led by the experts in our schools who can achieve more working together for the common good”.The survey also found little support among teachers for Ofsted in its current form. Mary Bousted, the co-head of the National Education Union, gave Labour’s plans a forceful endorsement, saying Ofsted was unfit for its purpose. “Teachers and school leaders know from bitter experience that too many Ofsted inspectors have neither the knowledge or professional experience to come to accurate judgements of schools,” she said.But Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, accused Labour of pursuing dogma that would leave children at greater risk.“Labour are putting ideology before the education of our children. Parents will be rightly fearful of Corbyn’s plans to abolish independent inspections, scrap Sats and destroy academies and free schools. Labour would weaken discipline, lower standards and reduce choice and information for parents,” Williamson said in response to the Ofsted announcement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93ccbe393e3fafdc08cc03f50cd818cc9bd8618a/0_850_6272_3763/master/6272.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dd9dd24386a346d35dec3123c56ec00","title":"how to brush your hair to keep it healthy","story":"Start from the bottom, brush before washing – and whatever you do, don’t overdo itDon’t believe the old wives’ tale that brushing your hair with 100 strokes before going to bed keeps it soft and healthy. Too much brushing can irritate your scalp and stress your hair, causing it to break and fall out. I recommend brushing long hair a few times a day, not more.The same advice applies to using combs: be gentle and, if your hair is long, hold your hair in your hands and comb the ends out first. Whether you are using a brush or a comb, start from the bottom, then brush in sections, working up towards your scalp.I am a big fan of paddle brushes. I particularly like the Aveda paddle brush, and there is a tiny handbag-sized brush from Boots that is only about £1 but is really good. Paddle brushes give your scalp a little bit of gentle stimulation, though you don’t want to overdo it.If you get dandruff, brushing will help to massage away those dead skin cells. I would always recommend that people with dandruff brush and wash their hair every day.If you have curly hair, of course, combs are better – most people with curly hair will know this already. Although, even if you have curly hair, I would recommend you brush it before you wash it.Whatever your hair type, I would suggest you brush it before you shampoo and then apply conditioner through your hair with your fingers. You want to minimise brushing when it is wet because that is when there is an increased risk of stretching and breaking.Many people with hair loss stop brushing altogether. That is the wrong thing to do. If you are going to lose it, you are going to lose it not brushing only means it sits there for a few days longer than it would anyway. A paddle brush will also contain the hair that has fallen out, rather than having it fall on to the floor or into your hand, which can be psychologically quite difficult.Brushing your hair upside down or shaking your head upside down after you have finished brushing it will help give your hair volume.Sara G Allison, a trichologist and the author of Hair Today, More Tomorrow: How To Keep Your Hair On, was talking to Nell Frizzell"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a33a4f9e01b7d6098a030706c0173f45895b782/0_0_1551_1551/master/1551.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=9d2b4f5025f26afd48bb204dc038cb0f","title":"fancy footwork the 10 best high street boots and shoes in pictures","story":"From heels to trainers, cowboy boots to snakeprint: step out in the season’s finest footwear"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef261702cbd907fff3944fea219149cd16bd3e8c/0_384_5761_3457/master/5761.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d781e94fea98c49de9326c0e0e627eb","title":"international incident work mistake official secrets film","story":"It was the Observer’s big scoop of 2003, and as a young journalist, I was asked to type up a top-secret memo.

Cool young things wear absurdly small clothing – low-slung jeans nicknamed “bumsters”, for obvious reasons thongs crop tops and, most ill-advisedly, “shrugs”, unflattering miniature cardigans. An incredible heatwave sweeps Europe, too, with the mercury hitting 38.5C in Brogdale, Kent.The feverishness of those days extends to geopolitics. Three years earlier, George W Bush narrowly won the 2000 US presidential election after a recount in Florida and a debacle involving hanging chads. In 2001 came the terrorist attacks of 911, propelling al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden into the public consciousness. Britain’s “special relationship” with the US grew ever closer, thanks to the manoeuvrings of the then prime minister, Tony Blair.It was an interesting time for a young journalist with no newspaper experience to be joining the foreign desk of the Observer. Aged 24 and having held only junior positions at women’s magazines, I applied for the role of foreign desk assistant in late 2002. State-schooled in Sussex and with no newspaper contacts, I had a thirst for foreign news. As a teenager, my heroes had been foreign correspondents Kate Adie, Michael Buerk and John Simpson. At university I devoured the works of George Orwell – himself a former Observer journalist – Ernest Hemingway, Martha Gellhorn and Graham Greene, before devoting a year of my degree to the impact of reporting on the Vietnam war. What I offered in keenness must have made up for my lack of experience because, after two interviews, I took a call and was told: “You’ve got the job… if you want it?” Of course I did.Joining was a culture shock. Our working week ran from Tuesday to Saturday, with knocking-off times getting progressively later (9, 10, 11pm) as Sunday approached. Everyone was constantly available on their BlackBerry – the height of tech at the time. The neighbouring Coach \u0026amp Horses pub was our unofficial canteen. My colleagues were impressive: charismatic raconteurs, supremely well-read and worldly wise. I was entrusted with an A4 contacts book – a ringbinder of phone and satellite phone numbers and emails for correspondents all over the globe. Dusty reporters would fly in from assignments in far-flung places, handing over a bundle of disorganised receipts for obscure items: four camels, for instance, “replacements for a herd accidentally hit and killed on a road by driver”.It was intense, collegiate and fun, and I felt privileged to be part of the team – but also out of my depth. My brilliant predecessor had left to make documentaries for Channel 4. I set about looking after flak jackets and foreign currency, visas and travel plans. I called to check in with reporters on high-risk assignments and watched the international news wires for stories. Not long after I started, I was asked to look into flights for a foreign correspondent to go from London to Diyarbakir and then help find a fixer to assist with crossing a border. I didn’t even know which country that was, let alone which border they might be crossing.Towards the end of my second week, I was handed a printout of an email by Martin Bright (then the Observer’s home affairs editor, played in Official Secrets by Matt Smith) and Peter Beaumont (the foreign affairs editor – played by Matthew Goode). Could I type it up and save it into the system? I wasn’t given any other information. Their only instruction: “Don’t make any mistakes.” And so I set to painstakingly typing in each sentence.Importance HIGHTop SecretAllAs you’ve likely heard by now, the Agency is mounting a surge…… We’d appreciate your support in getting the word to your analysts who might have similar, more in-direct access to valuable information from accesses in your product lines.It took about 10 minutes. I double-checked it, sent it through, moved on to my next task.On Sunday morning, I woke up to see the paper’s front-page splash: “Revealed: US dirty tricks to win vote on Iraq war”. Underneath was the memo I’d typed up.Of course, the story – broken by Bright, Beaumont and the inimitable New York correspondent and investigative journalist Ed Vulliamy (played with great aplomb and accuracy in the film by Rhys Ifans) – was huge. But my pride in being a tiny part of the team soon crumbled when, first thing on Monday morning, my phone rang. It was an unknown number and, as Monday was a day off for most of the news team, I didn’t expect it to be the office. It was – I think – Stephen Pritchard, the paper’s readers’ editor. He was very polite, but informed me with deft understatement and a total lack of drama that I had caused “something of an international incident”.Fastidiously typing in the memo, and not knowing what the document was or its origins, I’d changed all the American spelling “mistakes” to British English. “Recognize” became recognise, and “emphasize” emphasise. “Favorable” was amended to favourable. I thought I was being helpful. Instead, it was a disaster.The story that Gun had risked so much to reveal was thrown into doubt. How could this be a leaked US memo, asked websites such as the Drudge Report, when it was all spelled in British English? The wobble caught on. Was it a fake? Some outlets due to report on the Observer’s story cancelled interviews over doubts about the memo’s authenticity. It was decided the readers’ editor should publish a special dispatch to counter the thousands of complaints from readers, many American, calling us “lying limey bastards”, claiming that the story’s authors had fallen victim to a hoax and that the email was part of a campaign of misinformation.Of course, it was not. Despite my “administrative error”, the story still made shockwaves around the world. Some days later, Gun went on to reveal her identity, and her life imploded she lost her job, was arrested and ultimately faced a trial under the Official Secrets Act, which collapsed after the prosecution declined to offer its evidence.Meanwhile, I struggled to make peace with the ramifications of what I’d done. Humiliated, and just a few weeks into my dream job, I rang my former magazine editor and asked for my old job back it had, of course, been filled.By Tuesday morning, there was nothing to do but go in and face the music. I assumed I’d be fired, and sobbed in the office loo before going to my desk. But while I am sure everyone involved was cursing my name – one of the biggest stories of their careers had been plunged into unnecessary doubt – they were outwardly kind and magnanimous. I was summoned to meet Pritchard and Bright to explain what had happened, and while there were a few eye rolls I think they understood why I’d done what I did, being in the dark about the genesis of the document. How the mistake wasn’t spotted by anyone else was also a matter of some consternation.Somehow, I managed to put the disaster behind me. The senior editors forgave me, and I remained on the foreign desk for three years.When, 16 years later, I found out that not only was the story being made into a film, but my mistake had been included, I had some sleepless nights. I met Footman, the young actor who plays me, at a cafe in London early last year with some trepidation. She told me she couldn’t ulge any specifics about the movie. “But is it made clear I wasn’t fired over what happened?” I asked. She was noncommittal, but said I did appear in a later scene. She wanted to talk details: what did I wear back in the day? What colour did I paint my fingernails? How did I get on with my colleagues? What were the foreign correspondents like? “Most of my outfits were probably too casual,” I said. “I was frequently hungover and more than once fell asleep in the canteen.” And how to describe the foreign correspondents? Simultaneously impressive and unpredictable.Around nine months after we met, I was invited to a first-cut screening of the film. I watched as “Nicole” got bawled out by the Observer’s famously sweary then editor, Roger Alton (played by Conleth Hill, Lord Varys in Game Of Thrones) in front of the entire team – thankfully not something that happened in real life. Footman played a blinder as me – albeit a more groomed version.I knew it would be hard to watch my mistake unfold, but when it came, it felt like being punched in the throat. I felt the shame all over again, and sobbed silently into my tissue. Nevertheless, the film is as brilliant as it is important. And while I wouldn’t recommend carrying the burden of a catastrophic fuck-up, as Alton would term it, through one’s career, it did provide a salutary lesson in attention to detail. It was my first serious mistake, and hopefully it will be my last.• Official Secrets is released in the UK on 18 OctoberIf you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37816d4a19be7cb1f0f3a31292806e53c9995caa/0_217_7232_4341/master/7232.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18dc6b42b78764424413717707999e0a","title":"keira knightley interview official secrets film","story":"In an exclusive interview, the actor talks about her new film Official Secrets, in which she plays Katharine Gun, the whistleblower who tried to stop the Iraq war• Read an interview with the real Katharine GunThe role of Katharine Gun in Official Secrets is played by Keira Knightley. Earlier this summer, a few weeks before her second child was born, Knightley, 34, sat down and talked exclusively to the Observer about why she took the part, and why she felt she believed that the film was coming out at a timely moment.Did you spend much time with Katharine to prepare for the part?Not a huge amount. I had lunch with her, and she came to the set once. I really liked her. Gavin Hood, the director, had said he didn’t want a characterisation of her. I mean, I don’t look anything like her. She has an interesting accent because she was brought up in Taiwan. I really wanted to do that, but Gavin wouldn’t let me. I’m not a journalist, of course, so this was the first time I had asked anyone any questions that they legally could not answer. What is amazing about Katharine is that her point of view is so utterly clear. As far as playing her, that point of view had to come across. This is a story told through her eyes.Was it a story you were aware of?No. It was only a week before the war started, wasn’t it? I guess the avalanche of the invasion itself overwhelmed it. I was about 18 at the time. I thought I was engaged. I really remember the run-up to that conflict, but I didn’t remember this.It’s extraordinary to think that it was 16 years ago. Did you join the anti-war march in London?I wasn’t on the big march I was on the one before that. When the big march happened, I was in America shooting Pirates of the Caribbean and feeling utterly stupid that I was in a pirate costume and all my mates were on an anti-war march. I remember sitting in the makeup bus and there being a conversation along the lines of “We are going into Iraq to pay them back for 911” and thinking “Hold on - I don’t think that was Iraq!” For my generation it was the first time that we had been really politically engaged - and it didn’t change anything. There was disillusionment after that. Quite severe. The way that we viewed politicians and the world was massively coloured by the weeks leading up to that conflict.And led to where we are now? Katharine has that great line in the film, which was cheered at Sundance: “Just because you are prime minister that doesn’t mean that you’re allowed to make things up.”Look where we are now. The questions we have about government and accountability go back to that. Why are politicians who lie not held to account? The script made me think hard about that.The movie is very faithful to the story – which means that it doesn’t have a Hollywood ending…It’s a very British story in that way. It has that heroic failure about it. But what are you going to do? Write an ending in which the war didn’t happen? She didn’t stop it. She told the truth and there was little consequence.Films are a good way of opening up those historical questions. Are you offered more parts with a political edge than you were 15 years ago?Yeah, definitely. I’ve always loved a political thriller. I know some people like escapism, and that’s fine, but I like to be challenged. I was watching Paths of Glory last night, the Kubrick film, 1957, black and white, Kirk Douglas, about the futility of war, and political lies, and it’s amazing.Do you have any qualms about putting your head above the parapet, as it were, and talking about political issues?One thing I learned from being in the public eye when I was very young is this: you can say nothing and some people will hate you, and you can say something and some people will hate you. So you might as well, if you are feeling like it, say something. If I am asked my opinion, I generally don’t have a problem giving it.You don’t do any social media…I had an account for about five seconds. I watched it accumulate, like, 100 followers in three seconds and I got so freaked out that I turned it off straight away. . And then Facebook. I was on for a day 10 years ago, and never posted anything on it, but it still emails me all the time as if I am a member or whatever.That has obviously been a conscious decision…It has. I mean, the thing is, I don’t have very much that I want to share in that way. I have a child and another one on the way, and I want their privacy to be safe and sacred until they are old enough to choose what they want to do with their lives. I don’t write about family life – though of course I did write a very long essay about my vagina splitting! I am better at that kind of thing. Also I am rubbish at taking pictures, so my Instagram feed or whatever would be an embarrassment.Where do you go for news?I get my news from the  and the New York Times and the Financial Times at the weekend. I feel I should be branching out more, because I am reading papers that I generally agree with. My husband has - really kindly! - forced me into reading all of the climate change books that he has been reading. Which is just great when you are pregnant. I am halfway through Uninhabitable Earth. I have to do the Naomi Klein next. I spend half my time saying sorry to my baby in there. Maybe I should start reading all those rightwing newspapers and then I could pretend everything will be fine…The film centres on the courage of Katharine Gun in telling the truth. Can you imagine doing that yourself in that situation?Honestly, I have no idea whether I would – and I think that is what I find fascinating about it. It’s funny we all like to think we are truth-tellers. But we also know what the consequences are for truth-tellers like Katharine. Pretty horrific. What is interesting, culturally, I think, is that America has had relatively more whistleblowers than Britain. I think that generally speaking we do what we are told, and we toe the line. I have no idea why that is. Would I do it? I don’t know. I have no idea. I think it might even depend on how I was feeling that day.Official Secrets is released on 18 October"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e479ceeb53dd0a6ae62db90d44da4972498046b/413_0_3549_2129/master/3549.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=861b1dab5d64d838e2c975a5a90d9e12","title":"bernardo silva benjamin mendy twitter post manchester city fa","story":"The Football Association is looking into a tweet Bernardo Silva posted in reference to his team-mate Benjamin Mendy on Sunday.Silva captioned a photo on Twitter believed to be of Mendy as a child next to an offensive image on Sunday with the caption: “Guess who?” The image was of the logo for the Spanish confectionery company Conguitos.

At the same time Chelsea might also have taken a point.Sad to say this fine, slightly chancy line was decided by something else besides these moments of skill tipped one way, albeit not decided, by another key intervention from football’s own flawed deus ex machina.Yes: it’s VAR! And with all due apologies. Here it comes, the radioactive cloud currently coating the Premier League in its toxic lustre, that tinge of sporting death that is ill-conceived, badly applied VAR. Every system needs time to find its rhythms.This is complex, fast-evolving stuff, enacted on the hoof, and in a sport that excites furious, unceasing disagreement like no other human activity. But there is a problem here with refinement and with the limits of the technology. For the second time in two days a pivotal Premier League goal was ruled out by another of those problematic reviews. It is something that needs to be fixed.Once again this came with the double-jeopardy punishment of a goal conceded at the other end while the crowd, the players and the manager still seemed to be absorbing the gut punch of all that short-lived elation.This is an issue for players and coaches to resolve and work on: goal celebrations must now be guarded. They must come with an instant recovery time, a professionalism that means no more punching the air, no more touchline sprints, no more unalloyed joy. Like the sound of that? Well, it’s coming.Here’s how it happened. Liverpool had begun like a train at a muggy, clammy Stamford Bridge. The opening goal was a moment of jaw-drop, Alexander-Arnold running on to Mo Salah’s backheel and producing that sublime finish.Chelsea pressed back and thought they had equalised on 27 minutes, César Azpilicueta tapping home after a scramble in the goalmouth. VAR said otherwise. Mason Mount’s toe was decreed to have been offside in the build-up, his ankle having strayed across a line drawn by the VAR as Willian passed the ball down the left flank.Stop. Rewind. Delete. Swallow all that emotion. And within two minutes Liverpool were 2-0 up though Firmino, another superbly worked goal (and some slack marking) that the post-VAR lull should not diminish. But still. Two days, two interventions, two problems.It seems fairly obvious that Serge Aurier’s goal at Leicester on Saturday should have stood. The technology is not good enough to decree with absolute certainty whether Son Heung-min’s armpit was two millimetres offside at the precise moment (whenever that was) the ball was passed, as captured between frames by an elevated TV camera.Drawing a best-guess straight line is not accuracy, consistency, or whatever it is we expect. There is only a pretence of academic rigour here. Understanding and acknowledging a margin for error, incorporating uncertainty is a part of being precise. This is simply bad science.Fast forward 24 hours and Mount’s foot was, arguably, slightly more offside than Son’s armpit. But only arguably, and based on a line that there is no evidence we can actually trust. A middle-aged man playing with a light pen is not the Large Hadron Collider.Plus, of course, what is offside actually for? Firstly to stop the game from losing its shape, dissolving into a cross between Aussie Rules and mass goal-hanging. And secondly, in its finer margins, to stop players cheating by pushing this enforced line and gaining an advantage.In this case there was no advantage to Mount in having a toe, arguably, beyond the line of a player 20 yards away. It didn’t cause the game to lose its shape. It was offside because a man with a pen drew a pointlessly certain line.Most people have by now “backed a horse” in this race and are intent on arguing it to the line either way. The idea of being pro or anti VAR has its ideological, even generational edge. Suggest this isn’t currently working and you risk becoming a Proper Football Man crying into his Charles Hughes coaching manual about the death of My Day When Things Were Good.And yes, there is a paradox to complaining about discussion of VAR, on a page that discusses VAR at great (and no doubt) tedious length. But the sport is unavoidably affected by all this. There is a price to pay here for the most precious part of the spectacle, the miracle of the moment, the goal, the shared experience. Is it worth paying?

By Monday morning the internet had gone mad and was out for her bloodIt was my fault. Sometimes I write glibly. I make an argument for myself and forget that people read it. It still surprises me, after 20 years of writing, to think that I have readers: that my internal monologue is out and about in the world. I do not think about them. If I did, I couldn’t write anything.In June, I wrote a piece about Nike’s obese mannequin, which was displayed at the London flagship shop to publicise Nike’s new willingness to sell clothes to overweight women. It makes me laugh now to think I insulted a mannequin – how, on that day in 2019, we came to discuss human rights for mannequins. I said it was a cynical doll from a cynical company that is no friend to women. I said that the normalisation of obesity frightens me, because I can see the outcome of addiction to sugar in myself. I said that the “fat acceptance” movement is an abyss of denial. I said the mannequin was “gargantuan” and “heaving with fat”. I said it might get diabetes – if it had flesh. I said that if it ran, it would ruin its inhuman knees.I am an addict: to alcohol, to nicotine, to sugar. And now I think that, because of this, I wrote about the doll with self-hatred. I was ill with alcoholism when I was young, and the worst thing was my denial. I conquered alcohol by hating what it made me with such ferocity I was too scared to drink again. But I never got anywhere with food. I am stuck on food. So I said I hated the doll.The piece appeared on Sunday. By Monday morning it was trending on Twitter. A friend emailed to tell me this, as if it were happy news: but she is a comic with the all the oddness peculiar to the comic. I do not write for attention, which is what I was accused of. I think it is more accurate to say that I write to conceal myself – and this time I failed.It rolled around the world. It followed the sun. I was called fat-phobic in the South China Morning Post and elitist in the . I became a person who hated women. My Wikipedia entry was changed to “Tanya Gold is fat and fat-phobic.” Within half a day I was an invented person, and that version of me, which I do not recognise, is more vivid than I am and will, I marvel, outlive any other version, no matter my future strivings. This invented person was fleshed out swiftly, like a doll, and this seemed, in retrospect, a suitable punishment. I was presumed to have opinions I have never held. A reply to a famous critic enclosed a list of inspirational mantras to protect against feminine self-hatred. I was presumed to be against all of them. If I wasn’t, I would not make sense.If I am being honest, I should say that I do recognise the character that was made for me, as a new skin. It is the voice of my own addiction screaming at me, as it often does, but now with many voices. In that sense it is the worst thing I can imagine. I had been found out. I began to hate my own name.My storm, though, was comparatively minor. I read Jon Ronson’s work about internet-shaming for context and comfort. In 2013, a PR called Justine Sacco wrote from Heathrow as she prepared to board a plane to South Africa: “Going to Africa. Hope I don’t get Aids. Just Kidding. I’m white!” It was a bad joke. She later said she intended to “mimic and mock what an actual racist, ignorant person would say of South Africa”. It didn’t matter. By the time she landed she was the number one trend on Twitter globally there was an awful hashtag called #HasJustineLandedYet, designed to celebrate the annihilation of her name. She became a comforting scapegoat for every racist and she was punished. She lost her job and, according to Ronson, she was devastated by it. And another example: in 2012, Lindsey Stone was photographed at the Arlington National Cemetery’s Tomb of the Unknowns, pretending to scream and “flip the bird” by the “Silence and Respect” sign. She was fired a scapegoat for everyone who has ever been insensitive.A famous Twitter storm shows how swiftly it can turn. In 2013, at a tech convention, a woman overheard a man making a bad joke about “a fictitious piece of hardware that has a really big dongle, a ridiculous dongle… It wasn’t even conversation-level volume”. The woman tweeted: “Not cool. Jokes about… ‘big’ dongles right behind me.” The man became a scapegoat for every misogynist in tech he has three children and he lost his job. When hackers attacked her employer’s website, the woman was fired, too. Ronson believes that, at their heart, Twitter storms signify a desire for acceptance. If Sacco is entirely bad, then, by condemning her, others are entirely good. It makes the tweeting people seem vulnerable, and that is comforting.Because Twitter is monomaniacal, almost no one defended me. Those who did – on the danger of obesity point, which flew away – received the same punishment. So what follows should not have surprised me. There is another Tanya Gold. She is an editor, and kindly she sometimes forwards messages that have come to her in error, with wry comments. I wrote to her as it began: I’m sorry for what is coming. She replied: OK. She posted a note saying she was not the Tanya Gold who wrote the article. One of her friends wrote a hashtag #NotTHATTanya. They condoled with her for the hate mail. I was baffled that she was allowed an emotional response to the hate mail, which was mine, but I was not. Still, it was funny, in retrospect, watching people who had tweeted at her, returning in the spirit of maiden aunts once they learned their error. They were sodden with manners. One even offered her work. I couldn’t laugh at the time. I felt that the central narrative of my addiction – that I am two people, and one is good, and one is bad – had literally come to pass. Still, I was infamous.I turned on Radio 4 and they were talking about me. Piers Morgan asked me to come on Good Morning Britain, so he could teach me to be a good feminist, and I wept.In truth, I did not need my old name any more, because I had a new one: “Here’s a daily reminder,” wrote one Twitter correspondent, “that you: you’re a fucking cunt!!” They wrote satirically, misogynists day-dreaming of sexual violence: “Fuck you, Tanya Gold. Eat a dick.” Some people – women mostly – wrote to say they wanted to sit on my face.My subversion enabled all other subversion. A woman with the Twitter name Miss Lucy P changed her Twitter name to Tanya Gold’s Husband (Who is Fat). Someone wrote: “I HOPE YOU DIE OF HEART DISEASE! YOU FUCKING OBESE WHORE!!! DIE ALREADY!!! KILL YOUR FUCKING SELF!!! OBESE WHORE!!!” This person is apparently a personal trainer. I replied, idly: “Would you look after my son?” “Bring your son to your grave,” he replied. “Would it,” a woman asked, “be horrible if I had a wish that Tanya Gold’s body turned up in a ditch somewhere?” She is apparently a watercolourist.They seemed fascinated that I am fat and unearthed photographs to prove it, including many zoomed in on my crotch. It does make sense. If I am a “fat cunt”, I must have a byline picture.“I know how awful it is,” a journalist wrote to me, “but they do go away. Twitter storms are like real storms. The bigger they are, the better the weather is afterwards.” I recovered by searching for reality. I had become unreal, so I made something real. I wrote to a correspondent who had said: “Can’t you understand that the language you used suggests a disgust of fat people? If you cared about the health of these women you might have used more clinical language with statistics rather than the hyperbolic language you used.”I replied that I thought my language was too vicious. She thanked me for listening. I said I was addicted to sugar. She said she had a serious condition that was not related to obesity, but that the doctors had almost missed because she is obese. And that was the ending: a conversation from which we both learned something and from which we parted courteously. Once I had reclaimed myself from my avatar I was no longer hateful, at least to myself.

Both options will now be voted on by delegates, along with the official national executive position, leaving open the possibility that competing motions could pass and cause further confusion over the party’s Brexit policy.The pro-remain motion reads: “Labour must reflect the overwhelming view of its members and votes, who want to stay in the EU. Labour will therefore campaign energetically for a public vote and to stay in the EU in that referendum, while recognising the rights of those members who want to argue another view.”Those close to the leadership had hoped that Corbyn’s clear statement of his position would put pressure on supportive delegates to agree a Brexit policy motion that does not contradict his view. However, party activists at the “compositing” meeting on Sunday night showed their appetite for defying the leadership over the issue of Brexit, with the aim of forcing a remain stance into the next election manifesto.Corbyn explained he was in favour of negotiating a Labour Brexit deal before letting the party decide how it would campaign in a second referendum in an interview on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show.When asked if it was in Britain’s long-term interests to remain in the EU, the Labour leader suggested a Labour Brexit deal could be preferable in some circumstances: “It depends on the agreement you have with the European Union outside.”The new position caused a fresh revolt among several shadow ministers and pro-remain activists, adding to the febrile mood at the Brighton conference following an abortive attempt by Jon Lansman, the Momentum chair, to abolish Tom Watson’s job as deputy leader and the resignation of Corbyn’s key policy aide, Andrew Fisher.Clive Lewis, a shadow Treasury minister and supporter of Corbyn, said the leadership had been “hijacked” and was taking power away from members.Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, also made clear her unhappiness with the position, saying Labour risked getting stuck in a “crusher” between leave and remain with the “walls coming in” unless it picks a side before an election. She said a new direction in favour of remain needed to be decided by activists at this conference, not in a future one after an election.Another shadow cabinet minister involved in election campaign planning told the  that his position has changed and he now believes Labour needs to campaign to remain, because of the risk of voters moving to a revitalised Lib Dem party.Many of Corbyn’s allies on the left also believe the party needs to take pick a side on Brexit before the election. Laura Parker, Momentum’s national coordinator, said Corbyn must decide on Labour’s Brexit this week, not after a general election.“We have to decide at this conference. The one we have come to, the one we have travelled across the country to come to, not at some putative further conference which is presumably in the mythical land with that fucking table with all our options on it,” she said.The issue has been causing serious tensions within Corbyn’s own team. It is understood Fisher, who resigned citing a lack of “professionalism, competence and human decency” in the Labour leader’s team, has been arguing that the party’s policy of trying to appeal to both sides over Brexit was no longer working and was electorally problematic.He tweeted several supportive policy statements on Sunday, indicating he was still backing Corbyn’s project overall and sources confirmed he would stay on to write the manifesto at the next election.Ahead of Monday’s debate, pro-remain activists were increasingly hopeful that their motion would pass, potentially with the help of some trade unions. The collective union position is the same as Corbyn’s stance, but senior union sources said Unison was considering breaking ranks.Michael Chessum, of Another Europe is Possible, said his group had been “utterly determined” to take a remain position to conference floor and urged delegates not to see it as a test of loyalty to Corbyn.“There will be an attempt to turn this into a loyalty test. But those proposing these motions are by and large people, like me, who have spent years fighting for the left inside Labour and backing Corbyn,” he said.However, Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, said it would be a “loyalty test” as he said any shadow cabinet ministers openly advocating a pro-remain position should get behind the leadership or “step aside”.The second day of conference was dominated by the row over Brexit, but many anti-Corbyn MPs were also exercised by the move earlier in the week to abolish Watson’s post as deputy leader. This was abandoned on Saturday after an intervention from Corbyn, but MPs on the centrist wing of the party were up in arms about the move against him.Several suggested on their WhatsApp group that Watson should challenge Corbyn for the leadership or lead a public split of Labour MPs, regardless of the country potentially being very close to a general election.Watson is understood to have dismissed the idea that this was time for a breakaway but the deputy leader arrived at the party’s conference earlier than expected in order to fight any further attempts on his position.Two shadow cabinet ministers told the  they believed the bid to oust Watson was related to concerns within the Labour leadership about Corbyn’s position if he were to lose an election and stand down, with the deputy leader potentially becoming the most powerful elected person in the party.Watson was among those on the NEC who declined to support the statement on Brexit, which is also expected to be put to a vote on the conference floor.Watson said: “I have no doubt that Jeremy’s supporters on the NEC will endorse any statement he proposes. However, without the NEC having met to debate over it, we risk giving an imperfect document to conference, and the document not being given the weight it deserves by delegates.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc9c829ee172e0c3a0b84d032010e03ff9c18780/642_289_1793_1076/master/1793.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31d13837d33fbd4da868ea539ef0031a","title":"health cover for retired britons in eu to last six months in no deal brexit","story":"Government pledges £150m for those not covered by reciprocal arrangements if UK crashes outThe government has pledged £150m to temporarily cover the healthcare costs of 180,000 British nationals living in the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said workers posted to the bloc, plus pensioners and students, who can currently have their healthcare funded by the UK under existing reciprocal arrangements, would continue to be covered for six months after a crash out.The government will also pay the treatment costs of UK tourists if they began their holiday before the UK leaves the EU.“Protecting the healthcare rights of UK nationals is a priority of this government,” said Hancock.However, the move was met with anger by campaign groups. Sue Wilson, chair of Bremain in Spain, the country where the largest cohort of pensioners live, said: “They keep making these announcements and they seem to think they will provide reassurance. But they are time-limited and therefore have the opposite effect – people will ask what happens after six months.“What we need is reassurance that our rights do not change regardless. That is what the leave campaign promised, that’s what Michael Gove promised and it’s clear every time they make one of these statements that is not the case.”Jeremy Morgan, vice-chair of British in Europe, said the government’s plea to Britons to sort out healthcare if the NHS cover disappears was “another massive let down” for UK pensioners in the EU.“The government is urging them to ‘act now to secure access to healthcare’ as if it were as simple as ordering coffee in a restaurant,” he said.Earlier this year, the government pledged to cover the costs of healthcare for up to 12 months for all British citizens in the EU who had started treatment before exit day. The new pledge will extend healthcare costs for new conditions and treatments that begin afterwards.An estimated 1 million Britons live in the EU, but the majority are earners and pay into EU member state health systems through tax or a combination of tax and insurance, so should remain covered in the event of no deal.The government announcement covers Britons in the bloc who are retired, students, employees of UK companies or on holiday when Brexit happens.Visitors who fall ill or have accidents on holiday or on short stays in the EU are currently covered by the European health insurance card, but this will no longer be valid in a no-deal scenario.Also invalidated by a crash out would be the S1 reciprocal healthcare scheme used by an estimated 180,000 pensioners who paid their taxes in the UK but decided to retire elsewhere in the bloc, apart from Ireland where existing arrangements would continue.The offer by the government in March to cover costs for just one year for treatment agreed or started before exit day prompted fury, with some Britons in the EU questioning what would happen if they fell sick after the UK left the union.One Briton, retired to France, claimed at the time it was discrimination. “Why should I be treated any differently from any other retired government servant living in the UK?”Questions remain unanswered about what will happen in the longer term to those who opted to retire abroad in the knowledge that reciprocal arrangements applied throughout the EU as part of EU membership if there is no deal.The government has proposed continuing the reciprocal arrangement until the end of December 2020 with all EU member states, but no bilateral deals can be signed until the outcome of Brexit negotiations is known."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50f58171585ef78f99e6080c0195206fcfed7f6f/86_10_547_328/master/547.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44ec01ea6f742a569a2c71492e97dad3","title":"starwatch northern autumn fomalhaut loneliest star","story":"The blue-white star Fomalhaut, one of the brightest in the sky, can be seen low in the southern sky from the northern hemisphere If there is one star that signposts autumn in the northern hemisphere, it’s Fomalhaut.

The NHF said England needed 340,000 new homes a year to tackle the problem, but the last time that had happened was in 1968 during Harold Wilson’s premiership. In the year to March 2019, 169,770 new homes were built in England.“Today’s research reveals the full enormity of the housing crisis,” said Kate Henderson, the chief executive of the NHF. “It is the single biggest domestic issue we face. From Cornwall to Cumbria, millions of people are being pushed into debt and poverty because rent is too expensive, children can’t study because they have no space in their overcrowded homes, and many older or disabled people are struggling to move around their own home because it’s unsuitable.”Campaigners are struggling to keep housing high on political agendas before a likely general election. Town hall leaders said the research showed that new powers and funding for councils to build more social housing should be included in next month’s Queen’s speech. But hopes are modest that Boris Johnson’s government will be radical after he listed housing far beneath other domestic priorities in his first speech as prime minister.The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government responded that housing was a priority and said: “Last year we built more homes than in all but one of the last 31 years.” However that was only true for England, and across the UK the latest figures for 2017-18 show that eight years since 1987 had higher output.Only one in six new homes being built are affordable homes for rent, despite it being the market sector the majority of analysts believe is in most need of urgent supply.The ministry said 2,440 council houses had been built between 2010-11 and 2017-18, an increase on the New Labour output but a drop in the ocean compared to the NHF’s estimate that 90,000 new council homes are needed every year for the next decade to help end the crisis.A housing ministry spokesperson said: “Since 2010 we’ve delivered 430,000 affordable homes and to protect renters we’ve cracked down on rogue landlords, banned unfair fees and capped deposits, saving at least £240m a year – helping to ensure access to safe and secure housing for millions.”Responding for Labour, the former housing minister John Healey said that “deep cuts to housing investment since 2010 mean the country is now building 30,000 fewer social rented homes each year than we were with Labour.”He claimed a Labour government would build a million low-cost homes over ten years, “give renters the rights they deserve and end rough sleeping within five years”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f86d634297e6085c75dd500d1e5743793a4c935/0_249_5321_3193/master/5321.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=218a4282bf00bed494e6f038157a4c28","title":"rugby world cup fans previews predictions japan","story":"South Africa are confident.

We will be competitive and we will trouble top teams, may even upset one if it all comes magically together. We have a decent draw if we can beat Wales. If we top our pool, we play France or Argentina in the quarter-finals and will be too strong for them. That gives us a semi-final, most probably against South Africa or New Zealand, maybe Ireland, at which time our tournament will end. If we are very lucky and face Ireland – who are a much more settled team but have shown some weaknesses recently – we might make a final. But I very much doubt it.We have a decent pack and lineout, but our No 6 is not a No 6. Michael Cheika will unbalance the pack and play the Michael Hooper and David Pockock combo, which does not work. Our bench players does not give us depth. We have brought an out-of-form and ageing Ashley Cooper instead of some of our best performers. One full-back can’t catch high balls and the other has no pace. At least one winger has no pace.

Couple that with being placed in a “pool of death” and expectations among Canadian rugby fans are very low. The Namibia game represents our final. If we win that and put up a creditable performance against Italy, most fans will be satisfied. Tim YobiloEngland are not favourites but we are one of the main contenders. This World Cup is one of the most open, so I expect to see a lot of surprises and new heroes emerging from all countries. Hopefully England can win it all!||Here in Greece the faithful few are organising ourselves to see the games where we can, all together, even though we support different countries! I personally, due to my Newcastle heritage, want to see Mark Wilson continuing his good performances, making the North proud. Anthony KiousopoulosI fear an elimination at the pool stage, especially taking into account recent results. Argentina are a strong team and England are above us by far. Although, if we beat Argentina, we could reach the semi-finals. Wales or Australia in the quarter-finals are both winnable games. The good thing is that for the first time in years, the French have had time to work as a unit, particularly on tactics. The enhanced management team also changed the defence, which worked well during warm-up games.It might be too early for some of the brand new players such as Romain Ntamack, Demba Bamba and Peato Mauvaka, but the exceptional gifts of some of the young guns like Antoine Dupont, Damian Penaud and Grégory Alldritt mixed with the rebirth of some old guns like Maxime Médard and Louis Picamoles could bring some good results. The problem is that the team isn’t rock-solid and it has some weaknesses better teams can exploit. Arnoud XavierSadly this year will almost certainly be a huge comedown for the Lelos after the highs of automatic qualification in 2015. After taking that step four years ago, the aim should be to, at least, finish third in the group again. However, Georgia were dealt a horrible hand in the draw, which could not have been worse.Georgia could have had the USA, Russia or Namibia as fourth seeds, which would almost certainly have guaranteed third place. Despite the poor build up, there would have perhaps been talk of “targeting” one of Australia or Wales for a last eight spot. Unfortunately, Georgia find themselves in a group with Fiji, who have a squad good enough to threaten Australia and third place seems far harder this time around than it was last time. Pool D is the only group with four teams in the top 12 of the World Rugby rankings.One should be positive, it isn’t a foregone conclusion. Georgia has as good a scrum as anybody and if the game against Fiji comes on a horrible rainy day, hopefully played on a recently ploughed field, parity could be secured. If it is an arm-wrestle, Georgia has a chance. And of course, that scrum could also turn over Wales and Australia’s. But the team has shown consistently over the last four seasons, against second-tier nations as well as the few opportunities they have against the big boys, that they struggle to finish opportunities off and without a huge change in that area there really is no chance of anything better than fourth. Adam HookerIt seems mad to be saying I’m nervous when my team is ranked as world No 1, but that’s the mad position I’m in as an Ireland fan. 2018 was a dream year. If the 2019 Six Nations felt lacklustre by comparison, then the thrashing by England was a real bodyblow for a fan’s confidence.Recent results against Wales steadied the ship and I hope we can recover the magic that saw us outclass the All Blacks. I’m flying out to Japan and praying we hit the ground running against Scotland. I’m an Ulster girl and want Rory Best to go out on a high. One of the friends I’m going with is Scottish and I’ll be pure sickened if they have bragging rights for the rest of our trip. Emma CassidyWe hope to win the first two games against Namibia and Canada, and then we’ll go in pilgrimage to the Vatican and pray for a miracle. Maybe we’ll defeat South Africa again like in 2017, or maybe we will face an already qualified and content All Blacks. But whatever happens I really hope that Sergio Parisse and Leo will have some glory in their last Rugby World Cup. Damiano MartignagoHistorically we have played 19 lost 19, so a victory would be sweet. Scoring a try against South Africa or New Zealand would be awesome. As the lowest ranked team in the finals and, probably, the fewest fans able to afford the trip, our fan strategy will be to get the Japanese to love us and support us. I know our team will play with strength and stubborn optimism. We love Namibia and the fact that we are on the world stage. We will be few, but we will sing our national anthem, Land of the Brave, with passion. Jeremy SilvesterAfter the heartbreak of 2007, the nervousness and joy of 2011, and the excitement of 2015, it’s hard to say if New Zealand will raise the trophy once more. Of course, Kiwis are dreaming of the legendary three wins in a row. However, we know that having an amazing team doesn’t make it a winning team. With 2007 in our memories, no New Zealander is going to assume we will always make it through the quarter-finals.Ardie Savea and Brodie Retellick are the two players I am looking forward to watching the most. I’m excited for Retallick’s return from injury and I hope Savea receives the international recognition his abilities deserve. We will be proud of our boys no matter what. Nikki CarterWe just want to give it a good lash. We probably won’t get out of the group, barring a miracle. KT O’ConnorAnything less than the quarter-finals would be a big disappointment anything more a big surprise. It’s hard to know what to expect from Scotland anymore, such is their inconsistency. They are capable of blistering brilliance one day (running in six tries in half an hour or so at Twickenham) and abject incompetence the next (the error-strewn performances at home to Ireland and away to France in this year’s Six Nations). I’m left with the impression that we’re going backwards under Gregor Townsend.Vern Cotter gave the side a more steely, competitive edge. Though, let’s face it, Scotland could hardly have been any less competitive in the years before he took over, whereas with Townsend it seems to be a case of boom or bust. That might be harsh on him and you could point to the home warm-up win over France as evidence of steeliness, but one minute I find myself thinking we could beat the Irish, top the group and give South Africa or New Zealand a serious run for their money in the last eight, and the next I’m contemplating the very real possibility of losing to Ireland and Japan and going home early. Much will depend on Finn Russell, possibly too much. I’m also hoping the Ireland players don’t complete a hat-trick of sneakymistimed hits on Stuart Hogg this year. James CalderI’m approaching the tournament with building expectation and hope. The Boks are many people’s pick for the title. Their squad depth is unrivalled and their preparation under Rassie Erasmus has been meticulous. I expect their first game, against New Zealand, to be part one of a double header that will culminate in the final. South Africa have the forward power to generate both quick ball and field position for them to unleash their burgeoning back line.Handre Pollard is in the form of his life and will be one of the dominant players of the World Cup. At blindside flank Pieter-Steph Du Toit is already a candidate for world player of the year and can play a similar role to that of Juan Smith in the 2007 World Cup victory. Cheslin Kolbe has the potential to announce himself as a true superstar and be one of the stars of the World Cup. Fans across the world will be won over by his stepping ability and his huge courage. South Africa’s main weakness will be Faf De Klerk and Willie Le Roux, two players who waver from world class to dreadful. If either of them has an off day, it could cost the Boks hugely. Sam KantorowichI don’t have much hope really, but just want one positive result in our four games to show the amazing development rugby is having in Uruguay. I’m looking forward to watching Juan Cat, Santiago Civetta and Manuel Leindekar. Juan LaffitteOur hopes are simply to win one or two matches. Of our opponents in the pool – England, France, Argentina and Tonga – I realistically think we can beat Tonga and then produce another highlight, like we did in 2007 against South Africa. We can expect to come up against a second or third XV against England and maybe Argentina, but France will want to give their first team a run so we’ll have a hard time of it there. Tonga is the game we are setting our sights on. The boys are up for the challenge and won’t lack spirit. Brendan CareyThis year could be our year. I’m not reading too much into the warm-up games. Warren Gatland knows what he is doing to ensure we are in the best possible frame of mind for the start of the tournament. Losing Gareth Anscombe was a huge blow and, if Rhys Patchell misses out we’ll be very thin at No 10, but Dan Biggar knows how to play on the biggest stage and his kicking game is second to none. With Alun Wyn Jones leading from the front, George North on the wing, and a resurgent Jonathan Davies in the side, I expect us to beat all of the northern hemisphere sides. That just leads to the big three and, on our day, we are finally ready to dispatch them.

It was an explosive finish to what had been a processional affair on the streets of Marina Bay. Vettel’s win, however, was at the cost of his teammate Charles Leclerc. The 21-year-old kept his cool at the close but through gritted teeth and the clear disappointment of a driver who firmly believes he had, and has, his four-times champion teammate beaten.Ferrari’s strategy cost Leclerc as did the Mercedes calls for Lewis Hamilton who started second but finished fourth, behind the Red Bull of Max Verstappen.As a team Ferrari could not have come away from Singapore with a better result. It is their third win a row and their first one-two finish since Hungary in 2017. Moreover, they managed it on a track where they expected to be behind Mercedes and Red Bull.The upgrades Ferrari brought to the nose, front wing, floor, diffuser and rear wing of their car had come together this weekend remarkably well. They found the grip they had been lacking all season and with it the balance that allowed their drivers to attack the corners. Allied with their straight line speed advantage the Scuderia had the superior package here. Mercedes had to gamble on their strategy to go at their rivals and it cost Hamilton, who believed they still could have won.This is a hugely positive result for Ferrari but in Singapore Leclerc, who won the previous two races and led here until the pit stops, wanted answers from his team. With overtaking difficult, the race hinged on the stops and Ferrari opted to send Vettel into the pits before his teammate in what Mattia Binotto, the team principal, explained was an attempt to cover Verstappen and pass Hamilton, who was in second.On fresh rubber Vettel flew, he took the undercut and his teammate’s place. In a race then interrupted by three safety cars it was the decisive moment. Vettel went on to close it out with great skill under pressure to gain his first win for more than 12 months.Leclerc chased but could not pass and questioned the decision. “I don’t understand at all the undercut, we will discuss after the race,” he said, before adding that he thought it was not fair.Afterwards he was still looking for an explanation. “It was frustrating,” he said. “But I understand if the decision made must be for the good of the team. The answer I need really is that there was no other way for us to be first or second in the same order before the pit stop. I don’t know if I could have stopped earlier.”Leclerc then had to stand next to Inaki Rueda, the head of strategy, who collected the constructor’s trophy on the podium but Binotto backed his man making the calls on the pit wall. “I know Charles is annoyed and frustrated but that is a positive attitude for a driver to have,” he said. “Once he has the full picture, I am sure he will understand.”For Mercedes, their bid to leave Hamilton out long in the hope the leaders would hit traffic failed to pay off. After his late stop he emerged in fourth, from where he could make no gains. He, too, was frustrated, believing they should have followed Ferrari’s strategy with Vettel.“I knew we should have undercut,” he said. “I knew this morning in the briefing but they didn’t. We win and lose together as a team and we take it on the chin but it is painful because we could easily have won today.”The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, admitted their ploy had not worked. “Everyone was surprised by how strong the undercut was,” he said. “We tried to do the opposite and go a bit longer, and hoped that he might catch up in the traffic. Our tyre wore off and that is why we ended up nowhere.”Hamilton has retained his strong title position, however. He leads teammate Valtteri Bottas by 65 points, with Verstappen and Leclerc tied 31pts behind the Finn. Vettel is 6pts further back in fifth.The world champion and Leclerc will leave Singapore disappointed. Yet Ferrari as a team could not be looking stronger and further chances for victories are certainly within the Monégasque driver’s reach. The Scuderia may have finally unlocked the potential of their car and are on an absolute roll, as Hamilton acknowledged.“It feels like they are hungrier at the moment,” he said. “We have to step it up, we are still the best team. We have to stop dragging our feet and get on.”Bottas was fifth for Mercedes and Alexander Albon sixth for Red Bull. Lando Norris was in seventh for McLaren, in front of the Toro Rosso of Pierre Gasly. Nico Hülkenberg was in ninth for Renault and Antonio Giovinazzi 10th for Alfa Romeo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91c76571c07a2ed9aeb45c101fc60c55d4e21b07/0_299_5487_3292/master/5487.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a44b9fa5e8905fc100cf5f1d60c912d8","title":"food tour of russia russian cuisine journey st petersburg to moscow","story":"There’s much more to Russian cuisine than sour cream, beetroot and dill, as this culinary journey from St Petersburg to Moscow provesAt Taste to Eat, a contemporary restaurant with a distinctly SEO-unfriendly name in St Petersburg, I am about to plunge into a chicken kiev, its heart bursting with garlic. Over the past five days I have eaten hot pyshki doughnuts covered in sugar, scarfed down herring under fur coats, and gobbled barley porridge with blood sausage. I have looked askance at beef wobbling in grey-brown aspic. I’ve tasted mead and pickled mushrooms where you can practically taste the mud on the fingernails of the people who made them. I have had borscht (exceptional) and borscht (execrable) and borscht (middling). In tearing the pizza-like crust of a katchapuri and dipping it in its central egg and molten cheese vat, I have learned the joys of Georgian cuisine. Despite all this, I worry I am no closer to answering the question I set out to answer: what’s Russian food actually like?This is a culinary immersion into Russia organised by Intrepid, a travel company that likes its visitors to get under the skin of the destination. Clearly it is not without a sense of irony. After all, a Russian culinary tour sounds about as paradoxical as an English weather tour or, I suppose, an English culinary tour.“Part of the inspiration for this trip was knowing that Russia had so much more to offer,” says Neil Coletta, a trained food anthropologist who oversees Intrepid’s food tours. “But home cooking is so important here and it can be difficult to discover if you don’t know where to look.” In many countries, what and how people eat is changing quickly, but Russian food finds itself in the grip of recent specific political circumstances, as is made clear when a man offers me a cheese sample under the domed concrete roof of Moscow’s Danilovsky Market, near the Moskva river.This used to be one of the city’s busiest farmers’ markets, where Muscovites would come for their weekly shop. Like so many across Europe it has evolved into something more hipster. There are craft ales, smoothies, sushi and plenty of other concessions that would not feel out of place in Lisbon or London, but others are more specific to the region: meats from Dagestan cloudberry and dogwood jams from Karelia, on the border with Finland dried apricots and nuts from Tajikistan Armenian stuffed vine leaves chafing dishes piled high with Uzbek plov, rice cooked with carrot, onion, raisin and tender chunks of mutton.“What is it?” I ask the cheesemonger.“Gorgonzola,” he replies, with a grin. I eat it and raise an eyebrow. There’s a bluishness to it, but it has none of gorgonzola’s creaminess or texture.“Not gorgonzola,” I say.Our guide, Xsenia, steps in to explain. “The EU embargo was a positive kick for our farmers to do something different,” she says. “Before 2014, we would import cheeses, but now local providers and ordinary people are doing their own.” In other words, Vladimir Putin’s annexation of Crimea has been an unexpected boon for Russia’s artisan food producers. Russian authorities are said to have destroyed 20,000 tonnes of banned produce, so the locals are making do. There aren’t any naming restrictions, either, when you have nothing more to fear from EU regulation. Those planning to make their own Brexit brie may find this heartening.There’s more to life than sour cream, beetroot and dill, in other words, which is not the same as saying those things don’t feature at all. As wonderfully haute as cuisine Russe can be, much of what we eat is obviously informed by Russia’s size, its climate and its history of economic hardship.The trip involves several definitions of “home cooking”, and dill, the spindly green monster of a national herb, is never far away. The first night in Moscow we visit Mari Vanna, a smart restaurant done up like a babushka’s living room, a haven of purest chintz, with doilies, floral wallpaper and a snoozing cat. Waiters bring out pickles and potato-and-mayo-based Olivier salad, herring ”under a fur coat” with its Instagrammable rainbow layers of grated beetroot, onion and mayonnaise, and various sorts of pelmeni dumping. The meal is jolly right up to the moment I discover there is a branch in Knightsbridge.Next morning we head out to Suzdal, a holy town a short train ride from Moscow, in the Golden Ring of similar sites that surrounds the capital. Its remoteness saved it during the Soviet industrialisation, as nobody could be bothered to knock the churches down, and now its many bell towers endure as a lure to tourists. A couple of bored-looking men were selling mushrooms and pine-cone jam in irregular jars. A different kind of attraction is the house of Helen Polezhaeva, a charismatic former chef who now offers at-home classes to Intrepid’s visitors. She teaches us the secrets of borscht, which she prepares using ingredients from her sprawling kitchen garden, where the bearded irises are in flower between the rows of vegetables. “Women must learn to cook borscht before they get married,” she explains. For some borscht is shorthand for dodgy former Soviet-bloc cooking, dour purple gruel. In Helen’s hands it becomes something else entirely, rich and sour and sweet and perfectly balanced, which is lucky, as she gives the impression she, and many others, still eat a lot of it.While Moscow might have the more dynamic restaurant culture, it is in St Petersburg that the clashing forces in Russian cuisine are clearest. On opposite sides of Nevsky Prospect, the city’s most famous road, which has more than 140 restaurants, are two types of canteen. Stolovaya No 1 Kopeika is a traditional Soviet-era spot, where anyone can come for a cheap lunch of average soups and dumplings. If you picture “Soviet canteen”, you’re right. Down the street is Marketplace, an international version of the same concept, where for three times the prices you can eat blackened cod and sushi and pasta and drink flat whites and international beers.Back at Taste to Eat, as I consider the kiev, I wonder if there’s a lesson to be drawn from the contradictions of Russian cooking. How it is fiercely protective of its traditions, but open to certain kinds of innovation how it is susceptible to the forces of globalisation even as embargos make trade impossible how its politicians project a froideur at odds with the hospitality of its people. About how genuinely weird its attachment to dill is. But then I am offered another toast, the same as last night’s: to new friends, and so I drink up.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

As it welcomes another world-class event, we road test three famous climbsI have achieved a sort of cycling singularity. The UK cycling scene is obsessed with professional racing, hills, Yorkshire, social media – and pretentious coffee. And a couple of weeks ago, I set out to ride the undulating West and North Yorkshire route of the 2019 Road World Championships with a small-batch coffee roaster called Ben whom I’d met on Twitter.Over the past five years, Yorkshire has become a global cycling destination. As Ben and I, and another Twitter acquaintance called Tom, rode out of Otley, north of Leeds, there were dozens of other riders heading out of town, up Wharfedale towards Bolton Abbey. None of them was in an organised group – just ones and twos, including quite a few children and teenagers. I doubt many of them were doing what we were planning: a 200km section of the men’s elite race, involving a long loop north from Otley to Hawes, east up the gloriously named Buttertubs Pass, and then south through Ripon to finish in Harrogate.I’d mentioned my plans to Otley native and 2015 world champion Lizzie Deignan. “If I press on a bit it shouldn’t take more than about six hours,” I said.There was a pause. “I think you might have underestimated that,” she replied.I found it hard to find volunteers to keep me company. I asked the local Otley club. “Bit too much for most of us,” was the response. I was undeterred. I shouldn’t have been.The explosion in Yorkshire cycling hasn’t happened by accident. In 2014, the Tour de France started in Leeds, after Yorkshire had snatched the Grand Depart from under the nose of a rival Scottish bidder – largely, so the story goes, because the then chief executive of Welcome to Yorkshire, Gary Verity, flew to Paris in a chartered helicopter and brought the Tour’s top brass back to Yorkshire for a pub lunch.Verity was clear about his desire to win the bid for Yorkshire. “The world’s biggest sporting event is the Olympics. We couldn’t get that: it was too big. The Fifa World Cup was too big. But the Tour de France? We could get that.”The event itself was extraordinary. No one had ever seen anything like it. Huge crowds lined the entire route, to the extent that staff in the team cars following the riders arrived at the finish with bladders the size of space-hoppers because there had been nowhere in 200km to stop for a quiet pee.The 2014 Tour de France’s legacy is the men’s and women’s Tours de Yorkshire – held every year since and sufficiently Frenchified that the climbs are now “côtes”, as in the Côte de Buttertubs and Sheffield’s legendary Côte de Jenkin Road. Cyclists come from all over the world to ride the now-famous roads. The Zwift virtual cycling app has a Yorkshire route, allowing riders on stationary bikes to sprint past Betty’s Tea Rooms in Harrogate from the comfort of their own homes. And now the week-long World Championships festival is arriving.To those of us who’ve been in the world of UK cycling for years, none of this was a surprise. Yorkshire is cycling country. It always has been. It is a wonderful place to go for a ride – as long as you like your riding hard.Ben, Tom and I had three significant climbs to get over: Kidstones, Buttertubs and Grinton Moor. The first problem is that they sneak up on you. In the Alps, you can see a climb coming for miles as you approach along the valley. In Yorkshire, the roads undulate all the time. I was halfway up the Côte de Kidstones before it dawned on me this wasn’t just another random lump – this hill was going to keep going. By that point, of course, I was committed to riding up it at an unwise pace.I suspect Yorkshire does this to you deliberately. And here is something else: in other cycling meccas, the climbs have hairpins to even out the gradient. In Yorkshire, the roads go straight up. The climbs are not long, but they are steep. It’s not at all unusual to find yourself out of the saddle, grunting to get the pedals round on a one-in-five gradient.This sort of thing might punish the unwary outsider, but it manufactures great bike riders, such as Brian Robinson, the first British Tour de France stage winner, in 1958 Barry Hoban, who won eight Tour stages between 1967 and 1975 and world champion Tom Simpson, who grew up in Harworth, Nottinghamshire, but learned his riding over the border. Deignan will get to race through her home town at this year’s Worlds. And, of course, there’s the peerless Beryl Burton, winner of seven world titles in the 1960s and 70s and an astonishing 72 UK titles at various distances between 1958 and 1986.It’s the relentlessness of the roads that makes it different. You have to work for everything. An hour’s ride in Yorkshire is worth an hour-and-a-quarter in most other places. “It’s not just that the roads are hard – the weather can be bad, too,” said Deignan. “When I turned pro, I’d find myself riding up some French mountain in the pouring rain, and that was fine.”The Côte de Buttertubs is brutally steep, an incline of almost one in five. It comes too early in the race to really play a decisive part, but it’s the climb that will produce the defining images of the World Championships. Just a few minutes away from the little town of Hawes, it feels untouched and wild.It’s barren and exposed, with no shelter beyond some low drystone walls. There are no trees on Buttertubs even the grass is close cropped by the sheep. The narrow road clings to the side of the steep valley then turns inland to run through a natural amphitheatre which, when the race arrives, will be crowded with fans and flags. It’s the essence of Yorkshire, and it’s utterly lovely. The climb took us about 20 minutes – the pros will probably do it in 13.But 200km was, as I’d been warned, too much. By the time we were heading back south towards Ripon and Harrogate, I was finding every excuse I could to freewheel for a moment’s respite. More than once I tried freewheeling only to discover that I wasn’t even going downhill, I just desperately wanted to be. Of course, I didn’t say anything. I was pleased beyond words when Tom said he was exhausted, too. “Go on ahead, if you want to get back,” he said. “That’s OK,” I said magnanimously. “Let’s back off a bit. I don’t mind at all.”The sense of achievement in getting to Harrogate (after seven hours) was immense, but I’d have to admit that Deignan and the Otley club were right. I had underestimated it. And I’d do it again tomorrow.• The UCI Road World Championships run from 22-29 September. For those who don’t fancy 200km of properly hard riding, the events are held over a variety of courses and distances, starting at 14km.

Here, for the first time, he talks about his life with the virusThe words “smoky lavender” appear twice in Over the Top, a memoir by Jonathan Van Ness, the most fabulous of the so-called Fab Five on Queer Eye, the hyperventilating makeover show in which he stars. The first time it is used to describe the skin colour of a gun-toting meth addict he encounters during a stint as a sex worker in Tucson. The second to describe the colour of the thigh-high boots worn by the hair stylist at a salon he lands at in Los Angeles in 2008. He is 19. Later, Jane Fonda, a customer, tells Van Ness his hair makes him look like Jesus.Between these two smoky lavenders is a gulf that separates two versions of Van Ness: the garrulous, sassy, resident groomer of Queer Eye – and the emotionally bruised, risk-taking addict. As he warns readers midway through the book, “Buckle up, buttercup, because I can go from comedy to tragedy in three seconds flat.”Van Ness and I are in a Cadillac sedan, driving past the tangled, rusting architecture of Philadelphia’s suburbs. Travelling like this is normal for him – on Queer Eye, he gets to roam the country waving his wand and transforming lives. The show, which was brought out of cold storage last year after an 11-year hiatus, has been a surprising success. America, it seems, is hungry for its uplifting brand of magic. A lot of that comes down to Van Ness, the show’s foremost cheerleader for Queer Eye’s stated mission of turning red (Republican) states pink, “one makeover at a time”. It’s Van Ness who brings the energy to the party, Yass queening his way through each episode, scattering memes and neologisms wherever he goes, and generally helping people connect to their feelings, often by tapping into his own. Tears are never far below the surface. Resistance is futile. Everyone loves him.Van Ness has a hectic, energetic style and a voice that soars high and then higher. In the car he talks quickly, words tumbling out of his mouth in a way that can leave you trailing far behind. When I ask if any of his encounters on Queer Eye have changed him, he answers: “The act of showing up for your family and being able to live in the world I think is heroic. There’s like 15 bajillion eggs in the ovaries and who even knows how many, like, little spermies are in there, so the fact we got to be born and be living this long is kind of like a mathematical who-knew.” This is, I think, a roundabout way of saying we all deserve to be acknowledged. But things are way more fun when Van Ness says them.For our meeting, I’d taken the train from New York to Philadelphia, where Van Ness was filming an episode of the show, with vague plans to walk to the Liberty Bell. But he’d just received a 24-hour reprieve from work and, shortly before arriving, his publicist suggested I drive back to New York with him. Sitting in the back of a car with someone you’ve never met can be awkward, and I was conflicted. But Van Ness disarms with charm. A pop culture magpie, he slides from subject to subject and dares you to keep up. How he finds time to watch so much, know so much, work so much, is a conundrum. Lately, he has learned to meditate as a way to manage his stress. “On Sundays I sometimes don’t work,” he says.We are on Route 95 somewhere outside of Philadelphia and, as we navigate the traffic, we admire his latest manicure, each nail painted to represent a different cast member of the 1996 comedy the First Wives Club, a touchstone for Van Ness.“This is Goldie Hawn getting her lips done,” he says, lifting a finger for inspection. We talk about cats – he has four, including Liza Meownelli – and we watch an old video that surfaced late last year on the Jimmy Kimmel Show. In it the 11-year old Van Ness performs an interpretative dance to Jewel’s Pieces of You – his entry in the school talent show. For the number, he wore a kabuki mask positioned on the back of his head and a baggy black T-shirt emblazoned with a question mark. The piece, inspired by an ice-skating routine, culminates in a triple-axel-style pirouette that is so wholehearted, so gutsy and so precious that it’s heartbreaking. At the time, his mother gently suggested he might want to reconsider. The other kids, she said, might not let him live it down. But when had they ever?What Van Ness knew early on was that the world of women was more interesting to him than the world of men. He recalls at the age of four telling his father’s friend that he wanted to be a cabana girl or a cosmetologist when he grew up. As an adult, he would gravitate to the term “gender queer” to express his place in the world, but that wasn’t an option in childhood. A particularly painful story conjures his father’s war on his gender exploration. “I remember very clearly my dad finding me in an evening gown with my two cousins,” he says. “He tore me out of the dress, holding me in the air so that I was perpendicular to the ground. I was terrified.”But there were pockets of joy, too. Joining the junior varsity cheerleading squad at high school at 14 was an epiphany – he felt at home immediately. When I make the faux pas of forgetting who starred in Bring It On, the cult 1999 cheerleading movie, Van Ness gasps. “I could almost throw you out of the back of this car for asking such a preposterous question,” he says. “So, you’re telling me you came to this interview not having seen Bring It On? What were you doing?”In season four of Queer Eye, viewers saw Van Ness return to his high school in Quincy to makeover his arts teacher, Cathy Dooley, a beloved figure who stood out for not making him feel different or unusual. The cameras show Van Ness performing with the cheerleading squad as students clap and whoop. It’s a moving spectacle that implies a circle has been closed. Everyone loves queer people now, even in Quincy.But what we see on screen is not the whole truth. A few weeks before the Fab Five arrived, the school had asked parents to sign permission slips for their children to be on camera, prompting protests from a local pastor. “He sent a letter to the newspaper that blasted the normalisation of LGBTQ culture, and said we should not be rolling out the welcome mats at a public school,” Van Ness says. “It was just a really nasty letter.” Nor was it just any old pastor. “This was someone who was like a family friend, someone I’d known for a very long time.” He looks glum. “I don’t think we’ve come as far as I wished and hoped that we had.”Leaving small town America in order to be fully himself, only to find being fully himself is what brings him back to small town America, is an irony not lost on Van Ness. “It’s a little bit Gift of the Magi,” he says. But he also knows Quincy is his secret weapon because “even the most Republican-ass Trump supporter is someone I have grown up next door to”. Or even grown up with. Three years ago, he had to work hard to convince his father not to vote for Trump. “I cussed my dad out 300 of the days of 2016,” he says. “Our relationship literally was on thin ice over that election.” In the end, Van Ness Senior voted for Gary Johnson, the nominee for the Libertarian party. “I was really proud of him for it,” he says.When the original Queer Eye premiered on the Bravo channel in 2003, it was a more straightforward makeover show inspired by advice columns in Esquire magazine. Where it was radical was in the casting of five confident, unapologetic gay men to dish advice to hapless straight men. But people rarely cried and there was little talk of self-care. “I was just trying to get guys out of pleated khakis and to get them to cut off their mullets,” says Carson Cressley, who starred in the original. “I don’t think any of us thought the show had any sort of idea about making a political statement.” The 2018 reboot, on Netflix, repackaged the Fab Five as social missionaries spreading the gospel of love around America. A masterstroke was to take the guys out of New York, where the original show had been located, and into the heartland states that voted for Donald Trump in 2016. In a fractured society, the show would open minds by showing that our similarities were greater than our differences. Or, as another of the Fab Five, Karamo Brown, said in the opening episode of season one: “We’ve all got to come together in a way we can understand each other.”There have been four seasons of Queer Eye since its debut in February 2018 and a new one will drop early next year. The show’s hosts have not wasted time, assiduously attending to their brand while they still enjoy the spotlight. Three have published books this year and this month it’s the turn of Van Ness. His memoir, Over the Top, could have been a ghostwriter’s gift, packed with his witticisms and mantras for self-care. Instead it’s a lightning bolt – devastating and stirring, powered by years of anguish and humiliation. Does he worry how fans will react to his own revelations? “I’m scared,” he admits. “But I’m ready to pull the Band Aid off.”For Van Ness, Over the Top is about charting his own path through adolescence towards the triumph that is Queer Eye, but it’s also about owning – and thereby defusing – two of the most traumatic chapters in his life. The first occurred when he was four, when an older boy molested him in a closet. Van Ness tells his parents but it’s written off as “experimentation” and swiftly passed over. That single act of abuse casts a long, pernicious shadow over the book as we witness the ways in which Van Ness acts out his confusion and pain, from taking crystal meth, to sustained binges in sex clubs that satisfy his need to be wanted. He joins a 12-step programme for sex addiction, but relapses.In the midst of all that, his stepfather, Steve, is diagnosed with bladder cancer, and told he has 11 months to live. His death, when it comes, knocks Van Ness back into the unhealthy behaviour he’s been working to quit.“Everything that happened to me that summer will always be painful to think about,” he says. “It was like saying goodbye to so much of what I wanted.”Shortly after the funeral, his former boyfriend tracked him down at a bathhouse in St Louis and Van Ness’s fall to rock bottom seems complete. Almost. When he gets sick, collapsing at the hair salon he is working at one afternoon, he already knows what a doctor will tell him a day later: he is HIV positive.Van Ness writes about these bombshells with a quiet tenacity that skirts melodrama. He wonders if his reckless behaviour was a self-fulfilling prophecy, the consequence of all the fear ingrained in him at such a young age. He wants other people not to have to go through the same thing.“It occurred to me: what if everything I’ve ever been through was preparing me for this moment – to be strong enough to share this, and to share it on my own terms,” he says. “Part of that for me is to process what’s happened, but the bigger part is that I wanted to do something to move the conversation forward in a meaningful way around HIVAids, and what it is to live with HIV, and to humanise and normalise a lot of the things I talk about.” He blinks, then adds, “I’m talking slow because I’m trying not to cry.”We are nearing New York, and the canyons of Manhattan fill the hazy skyline. Growing up, Van Ness used to fantasise he would help other people like himself. “I always felt that was part of my purpose,” he says. “But I thought it would be a really chic juice studio with great baked goods, maybe a dance and yoga studio.” He didn’t think the way he’d help people was simply by being himself on a global TV show – or by penning a generous and frank memoir.At a certain point, Van Ness picked himself up and decided he didn’t want to throw away his life. “It really took some time to figure out how to put my life together,” he says. But medical advances mean the virus is now undetectable in his blood. He remembers the day he was given his HIV diagnosis, asking the doctor if he could still live to be 75. “She was, like, ‘I will keep you alive long enough to die of a heart attack or cancer like everyone else,’ and then she laughed uncontrollably.”Is he making time for relationships? Van Ness shakes his head. “In the past, I’ve had relationships with people who I was almost using to validate myself and my existence, and that’s not been a great plan for me,” he says. “So, this is a season of me falling in love with myself all the way.”In some ways, he thinks that testing positive for HIV has been his liberation. In the past year, he has taken up ice-skating and thrown himself into gymnastics. And, of course, there is an election to fight. “I absolutely do not think I’d have been as socially aware or conscious or want to make as much of a difference,” he says. “It gave me a reason to really fight.”Picture me in the seventh grade: a chubby, slightly snaggletoothed kid with a voluminous mop of frizzy curly hair. I’d be cycling through several of my cutest looks, usually monochromatic jumpers with severe Doc Martens boots, just to go to the mall. It felt entirely possible that a talent scout would be there, in the nation’s smallest capital of Springfield, Illinois I’d practice ice-skating routines in my living room, trying to be like the Olympians I idolised, imagining how triumphant I’d be when I finally seized that gold medal. The years of fantasising about reaching stratospheric fame through a local mall discovery had long since faded by 2017. I’d settled for much more attainable goals. I became a hairdresser, working in both LA and New York. I’d stumbled, very gratefully, into a side hustle in the form of a web series called Gay of Thrones. That spring I would move to Atlanta to shoot a dream project with four new friends. We had beaten out the collective gay world for these five coveted positions, and we all knew it was a monumental opportunity. Like Maya Angelou taught me, I was hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst, so that nothing could catch me off guard. I was just happy that I had completed my mission of escaping cornfield-small-town-only-gay-person infamy and was now free to live an authentic queer life in a gorgeous big city with a Trader Joe’s and nobody thinking twice about my leggings.A year later in February, Queer Eye had just come out, and I was on my way to a meeting. To my shock I arrived early, so I went to grab a coffee, and as I was walking in, this lady with the most gorgeous expertly done microbraids and giant glasses stopped me and bellowed, “Honey, this faggotry you are serving is giving me everything!”At first, I was confused. Did she just call me a fag? But the smile on her face and her extreme proximity seemed to suggest a loving and enamoured person. I’m now doubly confused, I’m running ahead of schedule, and strangers are stopping me. Mind you, it’s still 8.15am, my eyes still subtly perma-stoned from last night’s edible, and I hadn’t even had my coffee yet! So I said, “Thanks, queen,” and continued on my way.But then two steps later, two other girls stopped me. They said they were living for the show and asked if they could take selfies. Of course I said, “Yes, sweets!” and that caused a few more girls from outside the shop to come in for what was quickly becoming an impromptu meet-and-greet. My original encounter from the store got in line for her pic next, then became the photographer for the rest of the meet-and-greet. After thanking all my new friends, I left the coffee shop to head back with no coffee because I forgot. Well, that was fun. How much am I thriving right now? I thought.Crossing the street to go to my meeting, a very nice man stopped me and began playing twenty questions with me about my life, about the show, about everything. I obliged, because I’m eternally a people pleaser, and I didn’t want him to feel bad, but at that point my early arrival turned into being fully actually late to the meeting. When I was filming Queer Eye in secrecy with the boys in Atlanta in 2017, sometimes producers, or people who were familiar with the show’s revival, would ask me, “Are you ready for your life to change?” I always said, “OMG, yes! But this morning, something shifted. People knew who I was, everywhere I went.There was a girl who stopped me on the corner of Twenty-Third and Park not long after the show came out. We made eye contact for a split second and it was like an invisible Jackie Chan punched her in the stomach. She doubled over. She took a dramatic step back. “Oh my God,” she yelled. “Oh my God! Oh my God!” I was so worried about her that I stopped right there and pulled her onto the curb. We sat for a while until she pulled herself together.When people had asked me whether I was ready for my life to change, I don’t think I really understood what they meant. It wasn’t just that strangers would know who I was. It was this other thing that started to happen to me: when I looked in their eyes, sometimes, there was a little voice in my head wondering, Would you still be so excited to meet me if you really knew who I was? If you knew all the things I’d done? If you could see all my parts?Sure, there’s a part of me that’s endlessly positive. But it’s just one part. It’s a beautiful part, a strong part, and an important part, but it’s not all of it. There are other parts I want to show, parts that are a little bit scarier to get into. Like the nagging, insecure part of me that worries my positivity is faker than the hair that covers the chalkboard scalp of Donald Trump. Or the part of me that’s had sex with a ton of people – a lot of whom I wish I hadn’t. What about my irritated part, which isn’t the easiest to deal with if my people-pleasing part has been working overtime. My binge-eating part, my part that just wants to be left alone, or my part that could make you pray for me to catch permanent laryngitis because I can’t stop telling you about the Romanovs, or my cats, or the irony of the GOP that wants low taxes and even lower federal government regulation, unless it comes to regulation of people’s pregnancies, marijuana, or the fundamentally racist state and federal prison systems. Because when you have this much personality, there’s a fear lurking just below the surface: If you knew all of me, you wouldn’t love me anymore. You would no longer want me as your new best friend.Over the Top by Jonathan Van Ness is published by Simon \u0026amp Schuster at £20.

Bring on the series six resurgence! Poor Tommy Shelby the one man he can’t defeat is himself. An episode that began with him accepting pep talks from Winston Churchill ended in a full-blown existential crisis.But while the show’s protagonist almost certainly won’t kill himself between series – my money is on time on the road taking Charlie’s gypsy walking cure – I did genuinely enjoy this gloomier-than-usual finale and how the storyline ultimately played out.That’s largely because there was something refreshing about the fact that Tommy didn’t get it right, that he was undone, that his ever-ticking mind began to falter.This hasn’t been a perfect series (although I have personally enjoyed it) but one thing that has been beautifully handled has been Tommy’s impending breakdown. The crisis has been coming since the opening episode and when it finally arrived, with Tommy genuinely unclear how he had lost and Mosley won, it rang absolutely true.That said, while I generally prefer the more talky episodes of Peaky and downbeat series endings, I’m sure more than one viewer will have felt this conclusion set up more questions than it gave answers, as well as going round in circles (particularly where Arthur’s story was concerned) just when it needed to build impetus the most.I did also wonder if Peaky Blinders increasingly needs more time to tell its story. Would another couple of episodes have allowed us to learn more about Gina or the Chinese, to spend more time with Polly and Aberama, to see a bit more of Jessie Eden or feel the gut-punch of poor Finn’s mistake more clearly?Oh Finn, didn’t Arthur make it very clear that you should never tell your business to anyone outside the family, no matter how congenial they might seem? If you had the youngest and most inexperienced Shelby in the unintentional Fredo Corleone role, stick your hand up and I’ll direct you to the now barman-less Garrison to collect your winnings.Not that things are looking much better for the rest of the family, after Michael drew power from Gina’s brain cells to launch his bid for control of the family via the Chinese heroin trade with a wonderfully patronising speech about the new generation taking control and letting the old dogs head off to a ‘legitimate’ retirement.I admire Michael’s impressive ability to convince himself he’s so much smarter than he actually is, though in reality I suspect Gina’s family will keep him around just as long as they need him and not a second more.I also wish he wasn’t Polly’s blind spot. While it makes sense that she chose son over nephew, it’s more than a little depressing that she can’t see Michael’s thoughtless arrogance for what it is.And so the great plot to kill Mosley fell apart at the seams. In truth it was never going to end any other way – and this is the problem with casting real-life figures as antagonists. While it might take the odd liberty, Peaky Blinders is not a show that messes with reality so there was no way Tommy’s assassination could come off.Instead, the interest was always going to lie in just how it fell apart – and I did very much enjoy that, from Finn’s slip to the murder of Barney and the ambushing of Aberama (alas poor Polly, ever unlucky in love).My favourite moment, however, came as Tommy, who has never looked so defeated or so small, stared out at his best laid plans falling apart only for Mosley to mutter: “I think it’s about time you got off the stage old man.”Time is passing and the entire episode was focused on informing Tommy that he should exit stage left. But if we know anything about the middle Shelby brother it’s that he hates being told what to do. I predict not a riot but a resurgence in series six.As I mentioned last week, if ever a man would have a taste for a spot of resurrection it’s Alfie Solomons. And so it came to pass, as Tom Hardy popped by to inject a welcome note of hammy insanity into proceedings, while also providing Tommy with a vision of what his life might be like should he choose to quit the game.Did we need the scene with Alfie? Probably not, but it was a great deal of fun and I loved the little touches – from Alfie’s doormat spelling out Lethe in honour of the river to the Greek underworld, to the fact that he spends his time shooting seagulls and would prefer not to hurt his dog by having it return to him.• A sad goodbye to Aberama Gold, brutally murdered, and just as I was coming to truly appreciate you too. This wasn’t the best of seasons for the Peaky women’s lovers.• The conversation with Charlie might have been my favourite of the episode – if only because it confirmed my suspicions that he’d always been in love with Tommy’s mother.• His appearance may have been brief but I did enjoy Cosmo Jarvis’s turn as poor, doomed Barney.• No Lizzy or Ada this week. I missed them both.• I don’t know about you guys but I think old Grace is quite a malevolent shade …Nice use of Mercury-nominated Idles’ Never Fight a Man with a Perm during Mosley’s rally and I loved Richard Hawley’s cover of Bob Dylan’s Ballad of a Thin Man. But I have to give this to Anna Calvi, whose soundtrack has held the whole series together, providing a suitably spooky accompaniment to Tommy’s breakdown.“Since my resurrection I’m considered to be a god in the Holy Land. Someone has made an image of me out of rock, embedded in the sand so I am told, and I am planning to make a pilgrimage to stand in my own shadow.” It might be ludicrous to see him back from the dead but I still love the way Alfie tells them …Finally, thank you all for coming below the line, laying down theories, getting carried away, fed up and, at times, furious. Here’s to a short wait till Peaky Blinders: series six. The drinks at the Garrison are on me, and one last time: no spoilers and all speculation welcome below …"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b324d2b0ece3fba27391b5e5e0dbc08def1f851e/0_396_7737_4642/master/7737.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5fdc4e386bbec97ad12fae2d7a6db10","title":"russell tovey art is for everyone margate festival turner prize","story":"Contemporary art is the actor’s passion. As he curates a festival in Margate to celebrate the Turner prize, he discusses his collection, his podcast - and advising James Corden on what to buy Cor, Russell Tovey’s apartment is gorgeous! A New York-style warehouse-style place, with wooden floors, big windows at front and back, two light-filled bedrooms and enough space in the living-dining-hanging-out area for an army of cool cats to swing. But it’s not the flat itself that dazzles, fabulous though it is. It’s the art.As soon as you walk in, you notice it. On every wall there are canvases – huge, brightly coloured abstracts, delicate etchings, cartoon-like figures in spray paint and oils. Sculptures nestle in alcoves or stand proud on tables. One piece – a chair in the guest bedroom by Jessi Reaves – is only recognisable as art because it’s so tatty when compared to the rest of the furnishings. (“Most of my friends hate that one,” Tovey laughs. “They think it looks like it was found in a skip.”) How much art does he own? He counts up in his head: “About 250 pieces,” he says. A lot of it is in storage.Well known as an actor – one of the original History Boys, Being Human and most recently, the amazing Years and Years – Tovey has another, less-documented life. He is an absolute, stone-cold art buff: a self-taught specialist, a taste-making collector, an art “geek”. Geek is the word he usually uses about himself when on Talk Art, the podcast he hosts with gallery director Robert Diament though he could equally call himself an enthusiast. He adores contemporary art, and his passion, over the years, has led him to expertise. He hosts special in-house tours in his apartment for high-up people such as patrons of the Royal Academy and is a guest curator for Margate NOW, an art festival created to celebrate this year’s Turner prize being held in the town.From 28 September until 13 October Margate is being taken over by art: as well as the Turner prize, there will be performances and screenings, pieces placed in unexpected places, work that only lasts a few days, and other works that have been months in the making. Five hundred artists and performers making more than 60 events in total, most involving Margate citizens. Yuri Suzuki, a local artist, has created 12 horns representing 12 sections of Kent that will broadcast songs and tales sung and told by locals. Open School East has been busy working with Margate kids, as has 1927, a theatre company. Tovey – who recently bought a flat in Margate – is excited. “Culture automatically raises the status of a place and raises its quality,” he says. “And culture is something that brings people together. That’s the whole point, because it’s about humans communicating with other humans about what it is to be alive.”I am interested in all this of course but I am far more intrigued by Tovey’s flat. Can we look around? Tovey gives me an info-packed tour. It’s noticeable that he mostly chooses to highlight the female artists in his collection. The first piece he ever bought, with his cheque from the film version of The History Boys, was a Tracey Emin etching, and he has always made a point of buying women’s art: Phyllida Barlow, Rebecca Warren, Rose Wylie, who he worships. He has a lot by older artists, including the 90-year-old Venezuelan Magdalena Suarez Frimkess, who works in Venice, California Carmen Herrera, who is 104 Etel Adnan, from Beirut, in her 90s. He likes supporting female artists because he feels they have a tougher time than their male counterparts.We spend some time admiring a gorgeous work by African American artist Toyin Ojih Odutola, who, says Tovey, “creates this fantasy of these fantastical Nigerian families in images that you would normally see in white depictions of royal families. And these families have been joined by their gay sons. So it’s really imagining something that probably is never possible in Nigeria, but every one of these characters has their own story and their own place within these families.”He has a couple of Joyce Pensatos on display. A few months ago, he and Diament interviewed Pensato, maker of scary-drip versions of classic cartoon figures and comic book heroes. She died of pancreatic cancer in June, aged 77. Tovey had collected her art for a while, and they’d become friends: she requested that her last interview be for Tovey’s podcast.In just over a year, they’ve made 30-plus Talk Art programmes including lively interviews with artists – Ryan Gander and Rose Wylie – or art-friendly people (often actors) such as Zawe Ashton and Lena Dunham, and art world heavyweights – the Serpentine’s Hans Ulrich Obrist, gallery owner Sadie Coles and the director of Turner Contemporary, Victoria Pomery. The podcasts are gossipy and fun, engaging and well researched. The point, says Tovey, is to make a podcast about serious art that is approachable, that anyone can listen to.Tour done, we settle down for a chat at Tovey’s big kitchen table. As we talk, I am struck by how different he is to most actors I’ve met. Not only because of his passion for art, but because of his steady self-confidence. Most actors are insecure (understandable, given their profession), and deliberately sparkle for interviewers. Tovey is charming, friendly company, but he’s also robust. Not desperate to make me like him (though I do). The main feeling I get from him is determination.I tell him he seems like the kind of person that has an idea and then absolutely commits to following it through. “I am,” he says. “My mum says that I’m blinkered, and if I want something I get it. I think it comes from enthusiasm and I’ve never apologised for being enthusiastic. When I want to know about something – ie art – I want to know everything. I have to know everything about it.”When he was a kid, growing up in Billericay and Romford, Essex, Tovey used to collect stuff. Rocks, minerals, fossils, coins, stamps, phone cards. One day he realised he had to streamline his life, so he got rid: sold his coins to one of the coin shops opposite the British Museum, put the phone cards on eBay. He was good at art himself – he still draws, mostly cute cartoons of himself for his boyfriend, Steve Brockman, or of their three dogs – and he was “visually stimulated” as a child, buying comics featuring Ren and Stimpy, Beavis and Butthead, Rocko’s Modern Life, and watching Rugrats. It wasn’t such a big leap from those to Roy Lichtenstein, Keith Haring, Andy Warhol, Mel Ramos, Patrick Caulfield. But the big “aha” moment was when he went to see the YBA Sensation show, in 1997, when he’d just turned 16 (he’s nearly 38 now). “It blew my mind,” he says. “It felt like something had shifted. People say, ooh, the swinging 60s, and I’m always like: ‘OK, cool’… Sensation was my Woodstock moment.”He went back home in a daze, and, when required by his sixth form college, Barking College, to make a speech as part of an assignment, he did one about the importance of contemporary art. He got a pig’s ear from a pet shop and put it in a tank of water to explain Damien Hirst (he called it Sow Memory). He found a bit of glass and passed it round his class, asking everyone what it made them think of. “That was my Duchamp, my ready-made.” He got a distinction. “But that was the only award I got. They chucked me out after a year.”They chucked him out because he didn’t take up a role in the college play having been working as an actor since he was 11, he’d landed some paid work and did that instead. Soon after, he started at the National Theatre, and got a life-changing part in Alan Bennett’s The History Boys. He made friends with Emin when the play was up for a South Bank award. At the party afterwards, they got on so well that she subsequently asked him to be her plus one at various dos. “It was during her miaowing phase,” he recalls. Now Emin has moved into her imperial era, they remain excellent friends.How does he find the art he likes? Initially, he says, he used art advisers but not for long. Advisers are usually there to find the work that will make the buyer the most money, and that’s not why Tovey is buying art. He wants to support emerging artists, to look after work he considers important. He has ideals. “Contemporary art, especially, is all about the moment. The artist is trying to tell their story. So I feel like if you buy art, you’re part of the dialogue about history, and you’re contributing a little bit, by looking after it, to all these stories that are going to live for ever. Art is for everyone and outlives you.”So now he finds the art himself. If he sees something he likes in a gallery, he will email: “I always say, I’m a London-based actor and collector, because some artists like being collected by an actor.” He occasionally buys in auctions: “I love it. But if you don’t win, you do feel like you’re being told off by the gavel.” And he uses social media.“The magic of Instagram,” he says. “With emerging artists, if you post a picture of their work or you comment on it, if you ‘at’ them, they normally contact you. Or you can direct message them and be like: ‘Hey!’ I’ve done this so many times where I’ve been in the States. I say: ‘Where are you?’ And they’re like: ‘In Brooklyn’, and I say: ‘Can I come do a studio visit?’”He understands and cultivates his own taste: “I oscillate between figurative, cartoony abstraction and geometric abstractions.” (Is there anything he doesn’t like? He thinks: “Gerhard Richter’s squidgy paintings. I just fucking hate them. They make me really angry. I think they’re shit.”)These days, friends ask him to be their art advisers. James Corden, another of the first History Boys, has been in touch, asking for advice: “James messaged me the other day, and I’ve got him buying work. He’s got loads of money now, so he’s like: ‘What should I do?’ I’m like, ‘Buy art!’ So he’s running stuff by me and I’m like: ‘No, don’t do that, how about this?’”When he’s not working, Tovey’s researching art, disappearing into internet wormholes. It’s how he relaxes. He re-educates himself constantly. He used to have a problem with video and sound-based work, partly because he looked at art as a collector. But now he’s into it. “My medium of choice has always been painting, works on paper and sculpture. I saw video and sound art as not so important. But now I’m like, “No.” Because it’s all about connecting and experience. And being immersive. And what’s more immersive than that?”Can he understand that some people find art difficult? “Yes,” he says. “But you just have not to be intimidated by it. Go to a museum, you’re going to see a thousand works of art. And if you find one you like and spend time in front of it, on some low level, molecularly, it will change you. That moment of culture.”He gets cross about bad art, as he does about all bad culture. He has a little rant about rubbish plays: “Imagine someone going to see a play for the first time, and they’ve saved up their money, and they get dressed up, and they get a train to London. And they have lunch before, all excited… and it’s crap. And afterwards, they don’t want to badmouth the play, they just assume that because they saw it on stage, it’s got to be good. But fundamentally, inside them, they know it’s not. That makes me sad.”This leads us, naturally, to his acting career. Tovey has a film to promote. The Good Liar, out on 8 November, stars Ian McKellen and Helen Mirren and is “a con-rom romcom”. Tovey plays Mirren’s son and he loved doing the film, adored Mirren (he calls her Dame Heaven Mirren) and the director Bill Condon. He’s quite proud because it’s a big film, “my first proper one”. I think of him as thoroughly established, but he still feels he’s known more for his TV and theatre work than the “culty” films he’s been in, such as The History Boys and The Pass. This seems, to him, to be a move into a bigger film world.And what of the future? Long term, he has two art-style ambitions. He wants to get to a financial point where he can buy a little flat and support an emerging artist to come to London for three months and live rent-free. And he wants to have a foundation, a Tovey Foundation, which shows his collection in rotation. This would be in Margate or London, “anywhere, really. It could be in Essex, maybe Billericay, make it a destination.” “This art,” he says, “I own it but it isn’t mine. I feel like it’s everybody’s. I love sharing it. I do walks and talks around my flat like it’s a museum, and I love showing off to my friends… but that’s not enough. It’s for everyone, isn’t it?”More short term, in previous interviews, he’s talked about wanting to have a baby before he’s 40. Next year, he’s going to be in New York for the whole year, rehearsing and performing in Joe Mantello’s production of Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, alongside Eddie Izzard, and he plans to use that time to set some baby wheels in motion. “I’ll really be putting the feelers out on how we’re going to make this work,” he says. I’m so sure that he will make it happen that I offer congratulations. “Thanks,” he laughs. “It’s not happened yet!”Where does his confidence come from? His parents, he says, always told him he could do anything, and he’s worked hard to take advantage of his opportunities. He’s had therapy when he has felt he needed to and he has followed his passions. He tells his young relatives to work out what they want to do, and pursue that with energy. He told his nephew the other day that if he wanted to go to art school, he would pay for it, “and I shook his hand”.I feel like cheering. What a positive force Russell Tovey is.“The thing is though, I’m getting the opportunity,” he says. “It’s like when people say to me: ‘God, you work hard.’ If you’re getting the opportunity to do or have something you love, then you’re going to work hard, aren’t you, because work is more fun than fun. Because there’s people who don’t know what they want to do, or they build walls to stop themselves doing what they want to do. And that’s awful. Isn’t it the best gift to know what you want to do with your life?”Margate NOW runs from 28 Sep–13 Oct.

She seems as surprised as we are, giving a genuine and emotional speech. It’s a big boost for the show which has received a lot of nominations from different bodies but never usually wins.A lovely surprise here given that Game of Thrones was also stuffed in this category with The Handmaid’s Tale and Killing Eve. “Quite a lot of British winners, maybe too many, might want to have a think about those immigration restrictions,” Armstrong quips on stage. A much-deserved win here for one of the best and least awarded shows on TV right now.And this could be the start of Game of Thrones winning the evening. “I count myself so fortunate to be a member of a community that is all about tolerance and ersity,” Dinklage says for winning yet another award for his performance in the hit series. There are swears! The first of the evening which were bleeped out but will surely get revealed on Twitter within minutes.Twitter has been wondering what the hell is going on with RuPaul and Billy Porter:And here it is:Fleabag be Fleabaggin:The fourth win in a row in this category for John Oliver’s acclaimed HBO series. “Thank you to Game of Thrones for the lead in over these years,” he jokes on stage.The ninth win here for SNL’s Don Roy King, a show that the Emmys continues to reward year after year. But two awards tonight after a mostly laugh-free season does make one wonder if anyone from the Academy has been watching it lately.There’s been a ton of great Chernobyl content on the site but here’s one of the most revealing and fascinating reads:The Emmys music tonight has been odd and I’m not the only one a bit confused by some of the intros:It was a hugely underwhelming season but that didn’t stop SNL from winning this one yet again. It’s the most nominated show of all time with more than 250 nods to date. The show’s big chief, Lorne Michaels, is using the speech to pay tribute to Chris Farley, whose legacy was part of the episode he submitted this year, hosted by Adam Sandler.Emmys mainstay John Oliver is on stage with his very big and very talented writing staff, beating out Stephen Colbert’s and Samantha Bee’s teams. For anyone who watches the show, even in snippets, it’s a much-deserved win and implies that the show will probably win variety series in a few awards time.Here’s a snippet of Michelle Williams’s speech, unarguably the most powerful of the night thus far:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/713b39b9b8b3f3de9a10780f00cfd5e2a095df48/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=432a30c5437413540adb58efa50e9fad","title":"ilhan omar joe biden iowa peoples presidential forum","story":"At the Iowa People’s Presidential Forum on Saturday, organisers hoped to serve up an antidote to the Polk County Steak Fry, an event a few miles down the road that drew 17 Democratic presidential candidates to deliver stump speeches and pose for selfies with 12,000 attendees.The people’s forum, organized by a collective of grassroots groups, aimed to push progressive policy initiatives. It hosted four candidates, including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, frontrunners in the state that will hold the first nomination ballot on 3 February next year.Perhaps the most notable absence was that of Joe Biden, the former vice-president who Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement Action, the forum organiser, declined to invite after his campaign failed to respond to a questionnaire.Biden, a centrist in a field increasingly dominated by progressive ideas, has dropped behind Warren in the polls in Iowa for the first time.To a number of speakers at the forum, his absence spoke volumes.The Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar, one of four new members of the House of Representatives racially abused by Donald Trump, gave the keynote speech. She demanded “a president who realises we are not just fighting for one election, we are fighting for the very soul of our democracy and what society we want to become”.Asked by the  if Biden could be that candidate, Omar was less than optimistic.“There are few people who fit into the kind of progress that we all want to see in this country,” Omar said. “And I would say he is not one of them.“I think it has been very clear to many of the people who have been creating the kind of movement that is exciting generations, that we want somebody who really has a plan that is going to tackle a lot of the systematic challenges that we have, and he doesn’t.”Asked about Biden’s absence, former housing secretary and presidential hopeful Julián Castro told the : “I’ll just say that if we’re going to win this election in 2020, it’s going to be because we excite people, and we can’t excite them if we don’t show up for them.”Like the other candidates who attended, Castro was pushed by questioners from Iowa and other midwestern states on subjects including Medicare for all, immigration reform and the creation of a “Homes Guarantee” – an initiative that would create 12m new housing units supported by federal rent control to combat a growing housing crisis.Tiana Caldwell, an organiser with Kansas City Tenants in Action, told Castro she was evicted from her home last year and forced into housing with overflowing sewage, which she was also forced to leave, meaning she was homeless for six months.“Why are we forced to live like this in the wealthiest country in history?” she asked. “I can’t take it anymore. I need a homes guarantee.”Castro accepted there were differences between his affordable housing plan to create 3m new homes and the “Homes Guarantee”. He told the audience of around 2,000: “I don’t want to sugar coat that, but I believe that mine is the most ambitious plan that any candidate has put forward.”Warren was also pushed on the Homes Guarantee but declined to endorse it, pushing her plan to invest $500bn over the next decade in affordable housing.Of the four candidates who appeared, only Sanders has endorsed a plan for federal rent control.The senator from Vermont invited the  to observe an intimate meeting with a group of workers from the Fight for $15 group.Kelly Osborne, a McDonald’s worker from Cedar Rapids, told him how her hours had been cut, making a small pay rise from $8.25 to $10 an hour essentially irrelevant. As he listened, Sanders’ smile disappeared.The senator, a longtime backer of the fight for a $15 minimum wage, first met the 44-year-old earlier this year, as he took part in a strike with other fast food workers. He appeared disgusted.“Jesus Christ,” he muttered under his breath.“I’m not making any more money than I was before,” Osborne said, “and I’m working just as hard”.Sanders replied: “There is no end to the greed. Every time you think you hear a new low, then it gets lower.”No candidate was as warmly received as Sanders, who was given standing ovations as he answered questions from community leaders. Among a progressive audience there was little evidence that he was slipping, as the most recent polls suggest.The South Bend, Indiana, mayor, Pete Buttigieg, drew perhaps the most lukewarm response. As he responded to a question about Medicare expansion, which he supports while advocating for a private insurance option, he met with chants of “Medicare for all”. Organisers intervened to quieten the crowd.The questioner, Sameena Mustafa of Seniors in Action in Chicago, asked a follow-up.“A market-driven approach has meant that 40,000 people die a year without healthcare, that a $6 vile of insulin is being sold for $300,” she said. “We know as president you will be commander-in-chief. Will you be the healer-in-chief?”“You can count on it,” Buttigieg said.Mustafa did not seem convinced."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e48508a0f769f4f92b2237775204450e67934486/0_150_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63ce8ad145e4aacaeadd06f9f09c9f64","title":"iran to release british flagged tanker seized in strait of hormuz","story":"Stena Impero was impounded following seizure of Iranian tanker on suspicion of providing oil to SyriaIran says it will soon release a British-flagged tanker that its Revolutionary Guards seized more than two months ago, sparking a crisis in Gulf shipping.Maritime authorities in the Islamic republic told the semi-official Fars news agency on Sunday that the Swedish-owned Stena Impero would imminently be released, confirming earlier remarks by the chief executive of Stena Bulk, the company that owns the vessel.“We received information this morning indicating that the ship Stena Impero is going to be released in a few hours,” Erik Hanell, chief executive at Stena Bulk, told Swedish television SVT on Sunday.The Stena Impero was dramatically seized on 19 July as it passed through the strait of Hormuz after Iranian officials claimed it had infringed maritime regulations. Footage released by Iran showed Revolutionary Guards descending from a helicopter to take control of the ship and detain its 23 crew members.About two weeks earlier, British Royal Marines seized an Iranian supertanker off the coast of Gibraltar carrying 2.1m barrels of crude oil that UK authorities alleged was to be sold to Syria in breach of EU sanctions against Bashar al-Assad’s government. Iran has denied the Stena Impero’s impoundment was a tit-for-tat move.The takeover, which led the UK to advise its ships to temporarily avoid the strait of Hormuz, was part of a wave of sabotage attacks and seizures of ships over the past six months in and around the narrow waterway through which more than a quarter of the world’s oil supply passes.The US and Gulf states have blamed Iran for the incidents including the alleged use of explosives against four oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman in May, suspicious fires on two tankers in the same area in June and the attempted seizure of the British vessel in July, allegedly by Iranian boats that were driven off by a Royal Navy warship.A Gibraltar court ordered the release of the Iranian vessel, then called Grace and since renamed Adrian Darya 1, on 18 August after receiving written assurances from Iran that it would not head to countries under EU sanctions.Tehran denies making any such assurances and the UK says the Adrian Darya 1, which turned off its transponder off the Syrian coast earlier this month, has sold its oil to Assad’s regime. Satellite images of the ship said to have been taken days after it stopped transmitting its location showed it near the Syrian port of Tartus.Iran’s envoy to London claims the cargo was sold to a private company in a ship-to-ship transfer. The Islamic republic’s oil exports have fallen from around 2m barrels per day in August 2018 to around 160,000 barrels per day after the US imposed sanctions on the industry in November.Iran signs the joint comprehensive plan of action with the US, UK, China, Russia, France, Germany and the EU after years of negotiations. The\u0026nbsp deal limits Iranian nuclear activity in return for the lifting of economic sanctions. Crucially, the deal gives UN nuclear inspectors access to suspected Iranian sites.International economic sanctions on Iran are lifted after the UN says it is satisfied with Tehran’s adherence to the nuclear deal.Hassan Rouhani re-elected in a landslide.US president Donald Trump unilaterally withdraws the US from the 2015 nuclear deal, despite broad agreement that Tehran has largely adhered to its conditions. In response, Iran warns it will restart lifting uranium enrichment capacity.An Iranian supertaker suspected of carrying oil to Syria (in breach of sanctions) is seized by UK marines and local police off the coast of Gibraltar. Spain says the seizure of the vessel - believed to be carrying 2m barrels of oil - was made at the request of the US.US announces it is putting together a coalition of countries to patrol the Strait of Hormuz. We are going to keep it open,” secretary of state Mike Pompeo says. “Countries from all across the world who have a vested interest in keeping those waterways open will participate.”Trump claims USS Boxer shot down an Iranian drone that came within 1,000 yards of the ship in the Strait of Hormuz and ignored multiple calls to stand down. Tehran denies Trump’s assertion, saying the US might have “shot down their own unmanned aerial system by mistake”.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards seize two oil tankers - the British-flagged Stena Impero and the Liberian-flagged Mesdar – in the Strait of Hormuz, alleging infringement of maritime regulations. The seizures are widely seen as retaliatory.Australia announces it will join the US-led coalition patrolling the Strait of Hormuz, promising a “modest, meaningful and time-limited” contribution. France, Germany have declined to contribute. The only other countries to join are the UK and Bahrain.Washington is seeking to force Tehran to negotiate a new nuclear deal to replace the 2015 agreement that Donald Trump unilaterally pulled out from in May last year. Trump said the deal, which traded curbs in Iran’s nuclear program for relief from sanctions, needed to also address Iranian missile development, human rights abuses and sponsorship of proxies. Iran had been in full compliance with the agreement when it was breached by the US.The incidents in the strait of Hormuz have led the US to create the international maritime security construct, an alliance of countries including Bahrain, Australia and the UK whose vessels are trying to deter Iranian intervention against oil tankers in the area. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have both signed up to the construct in the past week since an attack on Saudi oil facilities that the kingdom said involved Iranian-made weapons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af4fe62004fd97b211b9020e03a7b1142e0e1fd3/0_148_4693_2816/master/4693.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c253fba65ee04de4722e23dfcb86500a","title":"thousands of indian americans expected at modi rally in houston","story":"Deafening drums marked the entrance of Donald Trump and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi as they clasped hands and walked across the stage in a packed Texas stadium on Sunday, sending a message of unity between the world’s two largest democracies despite trade tensions.Trump highlighted the growth of US exports to India, the billions of dollars spent by India on US-made defense equipment and joint military exercises with New Delhi.“India has never invested in the United States like it is doing today,” he said, adding that “we’re doing the same thing in India.”The president also discussed border security, an important campaign issue for Texas, which shares a border with Mexico.“We are taking unprecedented action to secure our southern border and stop illegal immigration,” Trump said.About 50,000 Indian Americans attended the “Howdy Modi!” rally in Houston, where the crowd chanted “Modi! Modi! Modi!” as he took the stage to introduce Trump as “my friend, a friend of India, a great American president”. Modi even used Trump’s political slogan to say the president had a strong resolve to “make America great again.”“When I met him for the first time, he said to me ‘India has a true friend in the White House,’” Modi said. “Mr President, this morning in Houston, you can hear the heartbeat of this great partnership in this celebration of the world’s two largest democracies.”The event had the feel of one of Trump’s campaign rallies, complete with a packed venue and a roaring crowd, and Trump treated it that way at times. He ticked off his accomplishments in office, highlighted a drop in the unemployment rate among Indian Americans and extolled their contributions to the US as he pitched for their vote in a Republican state Democrats have visions of winning next year.Trump said Modi invited him to the rally – one of the largest US gatherings of the Indian diaspora in history – when they met last month in France, and Trump seemed to explain his decision to attend by saying: “I love India.”Earlier this year, Modi won the biggest reelection India has seen in years and his support for Trump could help the president at the polls next year. The two are to meet Tuesday on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.Trump is also scheduled to meet this week with Pakistani leader Imran Khan, who recently solicited his help mediating the Pakistan-India conflict over Kashmir. India’s government has stripped the disputed Himalayan region of its semi-autonomy and launched a security crackdown last month.Trump said US-India bonds are expanding despite tensions over India’s trade surplus with the US. In June, the US canceled special trade privileges that had allowed India to export certain goods with lower tariffs. India responded by slapping tariffs on more than two dozen US goods.The US and India are discussing ways to negotiate at least a partial trade deal, which would let the president score a victory as he campaigns for re-election. A partial deal could include Washington reinstating India’s special tariff status in exchange for concessions related to access to Indian markets, possibly in dairy and medical devices. Other issues are thwarting efforts to sign a larger trade deal.In an address in Hindi to “my family”, Modi briefly mentioned the trade talks and expressed hope that an announcement can be made while he and Trump participate in the UN gathering.Modi said that while Trump has called himself a “tough negotiator”, he has learned a few things from Trump about the art of making deals. After the speeches, Modi asked Trump to walk hand-in-hand around the perimeter of the stadium floor, looking up to the stands of cheering fans.After the Houston event, Trump flew to Ohio, a key state in the 2020 presidential race. He and Australian prime minister Scott Morrison were to mark the opening of an Australian-owned Pratt Industries plant in Wapakoneta. Trump hosted Morrison and his wife, Jenny, on a state visit last week.In Texas, Trump was briefed on recent storm flooding in the south-eastern part of the state when he stopped at a US coast guard station. Authorities blame the storm for at least five deaths."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4026637.1569171096!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"schools to notify social services when pupils on reduced hours","story":"Schools are to be obliged to notify social services if they place pupils on shortened school days under new Department of Education rules aimed at restricting the practice.Many vulnerable students such as those with special needs or Traveller children are being placed on reduced school timetables as a way of managing behaviour, campaigners argue. The practice has remained mostly hidden as there are no official figures on its use and schools are not obliged to record the number of pupils on shortened school days.Minister for Education Joe McHugh will on Monday announce draft rules obliging schools to formally notify Tusla, the child and family agency, if a child’s school hours are cut, and to say why.The aim is to ensure that the use of reduced timetables is limited solely to those circumstances where it is absolutely necessary, the Minister will say, The  understands.As part of the new rules, reduced hours should not be used as a sanction or as a tool to manage behaviour it should be applied proportionately and should last only as long as is necessary to bring a child back to full hours.The draft guidelines on reduced timetables also state that the consent of parents or s will be required a school must set out a plan to get the child back to full hours Tusla will record and monitor the use of reduced timetables and if used, the hours cut must be subject to time limits.Concerned parents or s will be encouraged to contact their local educational welfare officer, who will advise them on the most appropriate approach. The Minister is now seeking views on the proposed guidelines.“Inclusion is central to this Government’s education policy and it is essential that all pupils who are enrolled in a school should attend for the full day unless in exceptional circumstances,” he said.“A reduced timetable is not in any way a standard aspect of a child’s experience of school and must not be allowed to become such it should be an exceptional measure.”Mr McHugh added that in some cases it may be necessary to use a reduced timetable, for example, as a means of assisting the reintegration of a pupil to a school routine, but such arrangements must only be adopted in limited and time-bound circumstances.“The best interests of the child, their education and their development, should be paramount in any decision-making by schools,” he said.The finalised guidelines will apply to all recognised schools with the department inviting observations from education stakeholders until October 18th. BackgroundA study published earlier this month found that one in four pupils with special needs have been placed on reduced hours. The study by academics at Technological University Dublin, and commissioned by Inclusion Ireland, a lobby group for people with an intellectual disability, found the practice was largely hidden and, in many, cases illegal. Among children with autism, as many as one in three had been placed on reduced timetables.Traveller representative groups have also highlighted inappropriate use of short school days affecting pupils. Many schools argue that the practice is a measure of last resort and say they lack trained staff to deal with complex needs.The Government, however, argues that record sums are being invested in special education and training."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Blaze at Matt Talbot centre in Ballyfermot has curtailed support programmesFunding sought for scheme that will not require offenders to talk about crimeIn bid to retain staff Government expected to review status quoCampaigners say vulnerable pupils excluded from education through short school daysChildren\u0026rsquos Rights Alliance says greater support from schools and communities neededContainer inside which businessman was tortured is believed to have been identifiedFrequent train commuters report serious overcrowding, anti-social behaviourFianna F\u0026aacuteil pledges to end two-tier pay system for hospital consultants appointed since 2012 if it leads the next governmentThe Disappeared: \u0026lsquoImpossible to describe continuing pain of another search ending\u0026rsquoTaoiseach: to announce move at UN climate summit on MondayNew website Peaktime.ie will enable rail users to check for less crowded trainsKey skills include teamwork, problem-solving and adaptabilityWith more formal education than any previous generation, today\u0026rsquos graduates are tech savvy and ambitiousEven the rain turned up to witness the green monster Schmidt\u0026rsquos defensive set-up has becomeUSI president questions global rankings as provost warns student numbers may be cutLabour leader wants to delay decision on Remain until after general election heldSome students told there were no college places this year after they secured places following Leaving Cert upgradesMichael D\u0026rsquoArcy says he\u0026rsquos doing all he can but \u0026lsquoit now falls to judges to reduce awards\u0026rsquoGarda\u0026iacute investigating incident in Cabra which left one boy with \u0026lsquoseverely deformed\u0026rsquo handList of potential burglary targets allegedly compiled by gang found in vehicle, judge told"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4026783.1569181619!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"corbyn faces revolt as pressure mounts over brexit stance","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLabour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn at the party’s annual conference in Brighton, on Sunday.   Photograph: Daniel  Leal-OlivasAFPGetty ImagesBritish Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is facing a revolt over Brexit at his party’s annual conference in Brighton amid growing pressure on Labour to campaign for the United Kingdom to stay in the European Union. Calling for a second referendum and a Labour Remain campaign, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said policy must be “thrashed out” this week at the conference ahead of an imminent general election.However, Mr Corbyn and Labour’s National Executive Committee (NEC) wants to delay a decision until after a general election is held, fearing the loss of Brexit-supporting Labour voters.The NEC voted by 16 to 10 in favour of a statement calling for a Labour government to negotiate a new withdrawal agreement within three months and to put it to a referendum within six months.ReferendumA special conference would decide what position the party should take in the referendum, which would be a choice between remaining in the EU or backing an exit deal but a no-deal Brexit would not be an option.Labour’s debate over Brexit comes as British prime minister Boris Johnson prepares to meet some EU leaders, including Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Mr Johnson has been talking up the likelihood of a deal. However, foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Sunday that a Northern Ireland-only solution to the Border could not go beyond the agrifood sector.Such moves would go beyond the Good Friday agreement which everyone “wants to preserve”, said Mr Raab. “Fundamentally that’s democratically wrong.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Instead they were told they could take up their place in the 202021 academic year.This is despite a High Court ruling last year in favour of Wexford student Rebecca Carter, who argued that she should be allowed to take up her veterinary science course after securing enough points on appeal.The court ruled at the time that the system was not fit for purpose, and that students should be able to access a course for which they qualified. Universities argued that they were unable to accommodate the students for a range of reasons such as limited capacity, insurance restrictions or quotas placed on course numbers by health authorities.Among the courses where students were told last week they was no spare capacity include dentistry, physiotherapy and psychology.However, it is understood that behind-the-scenes efforts involving Ministers over the weekend led to colleges agreeing to find places for many of the students in the current year.Some students, however, were on Sunday night still facing the prospect of having to take up their higher preference next year. UpgradedIn a statement the CAO confirmed that it issued 35 “deferred offers” to students on Thursday following successfully appealing their Leaving Cert grades.In all 590 students secured higher preference course offers after being upgraded last week.Minister of State for Higher Education Mary Mitchell O’Connor said she welcomed the “intensive work” by the universities and their admissions offices to accommodate students over the weekend, enabling them to access higher preference CAO offers this academic year.“I am very aware students worked incredibly hard for their exam results, and I do not want them penalised in any way through no fault of their own,” she said.“The universities have been working hard over the weekend to accommodate students who qualify for their higher options. The number of deferrals sought by the universities has decreased substantially over the weekend, and I trust that further offers will be made to students for their preferred options over the coming days.”The number of upgraded offers is up by almost 140 per cent this year due to the large volume of students appealing their results.Universities sources say they had been working hard to ensure the vast majority were able to take up their course this year, with the number of “deferred offers” down almost 70 per cent this year as a result. Updated offersIt is understood that all students who received deferred offers for courses in UCD, UCC, UL on Thursday have since received updated offers over the weekend allowing them to take up their places this year. Some other universities were still seeking to provide places in the current year to students.Ms Mitchell O’Connor called for a review of the process of awarding deferred places on the basis that no student should have to wait a year after qualifying for a course.She said wanted to engage with education stakeholders to see what reforms are needed to avoid the situation arising again."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4026765.1569178634!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"corbyn dismisses speculation that he is planning to step down","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJeremy Corbyn suffered a fresh blow on Sunday when it emerged one of his top advisers, Andrew Fisher, had resigned. Photograph: Victoria JonesPA WireJeremy Corbyn has dismissed speculation that he is planning to step down as Labour leader, after some of his allies launched a botched attempt to abolish the post of deputy leader, which is held by one of his critics, Tom Watson. Mr Corbyn said he was not aware of the move against Mr Watson but backed a proposal that could see the deputy leader blocked from becoming acting leader if the leader steps down.The furore over the deputy leadership overshadowed the start of Labour’s annual conference in Brighton, which is expected to be the last before the next general election. Mr Corbyn suffered a major blow on Sunday morning when it emerged that one of his top advisers, Andrew Fisher, had resigned following clashes with other members of the leader’s inner circle.Mr Fisher, who was the main author of Labour’s 2017 manifesto, said in a public statement that he was stepping down because the demands of his job meant he could not spend enough time with his family. But in a message sent to colleagues last week and leaked to the Sunday Times, Mr Fisher blamed the “lack of professionalism, competence and human decency” of Mr Corbyn’s team.He said he no longer had faith that the party could win the next election and criticised the leaders’ office’s preparations for the party conference.“Tens of thousands of pounds have been spent on focus groups and polling for this and there is no end-product, just a blizzard of lies and excuses,” he is quoted as saying.Mr Corbyn said he had spoken to Mr Fisher and he praised his contribution to the party since 2015. He rejected speculation that the move against Mr Watson was part of a plan to prepare the way for his own departure as leader.Private schools“I’m taking the party into the general election. I’m taking the party into the general election to end austerity, to bring forward policies that bring about a better standard of living and better opportunities for people all across this country. I’m enjoying doing that, I’m campaigning all the time,” Mr Corbyn told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show.The conference on Sunday backed a motion committing the party to abolishing private schools in Britain, starting with the withdrawal of their charitable status for tax purposes. It means Labour’s next manifesto will commit the party to ensuring that universities admit the same proportion of private school students as in the wider population (currently 7 per cent) and that “endowments, investments and properties held by private schools to be redistributed democratically and fairly across the country’s educational institutions”.The motion notes that 65 per cent of senior judges, 52 per cent of junior ministers and 44 per cent of newspaper columnists in Britain went to private schools.“The ongoing existence of private schools is incompatible with Labour’s pledge to promote social justice, not social mobility in education. Labour is opposed to hierarchy, elitism and selection in education. Private schools reflect and reinforce class inequality in wider society,” it says."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4026788.1569181325!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"labour conference in brighton off to shambolic start","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Labour’s   deputy leader Tom Watson at the  party conference in Brighton. Photograph: Daniel Leal-OlivasAFPGetty ImagesEven by the frenzied standard of contemporary British politics, Labour’s annual conference in Brighton has got off to a startlingly shambolic start. The bungled attempt to abolish Tom Watson’s post of deputy leader contrived to weaken the position of everyone involved.Momentum founder Jon Lansman, who led the plot, looked foolish when Jeremy Corbyn pulled the plug on it. Corbyn looked gormless when he told Andrew Marr he had known nothing about it – “I’m not all-seeing and all-knowing: I’d love to be.” And although Watson survived an alternative to Lansman’s motion will effectively block his path to becoming acting leader if Corbyn steps down.Hostilities between Watson and Corbyn’s circle are nothing new, but the resignation of Andrew Fisher highlights the isions among the leader’s supporters. A key adviser since Corbyn won the Labour leadership in 2015, Fisher was the architect of the party’s 2017 general election platform of Keynesian social democracy which proved popular with voters.Fisher’s unhappiness centred on the culture within Corbyn’s office and what he described as its lack of professionalism. Many more of the Labour leader’s allies are frustrated with his approach to Brexit, where he is resisting pressure to commit the party to keeping Britain in the EU.Delegates were preparing to work through the night in an attempt to agree on a composite motion that would replace dozens of Brexit motions from constituencies. But the trade unions, which control half the votes at conference, will ram through Corbyn’s preferred position unless a compromise is found. General electionCorbyn wants to postpone a decision on whether to back remaining in the EU until after a general election, a Labour government to negotiate a new withdrawal agreement within three months and to put it to a referendum within six months. A special conference would decide what position the party should take in the referendum, which would be a choice between remaining in the EU or backing an exit deal, but a no-deal Brexit would not be an option.Labour’s isions over Brexit and infighting at the top are likely to overshadow domestic policy announcements at the conference. But the party’s commitment to dramatically expand universal benefits on the model of the National Health Service could form the heart of its campaign against Boris Johnson at the next election.Such ambitious policies to transform society, along with eye-catching initiatives like the abolition of private schools, could help Labour to move the focus of the next election away from Brexit to more promising terrain.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Democrats haven’t been able to get him on obstruction of justice. But maybe this time they’ll finally bring him down.  Photograph: Alastair PikeAFPGetty ImagesEveryone here is keyed up for the Big One. The One that’s going to finally bring Donald Trump down.As soon as the news broke Wednesday night in the Washington Post that a whistleblower had accused the president of making some sort of nefarious “promise” during a call to a foreign leader, the hive erupted.Democrats haven’t been able to get Trump on paying off a porn star to protect his campaign. They haven’t been able to get him on being a Russian agent. They haven’t been able to get him on obstruction of justice. But maybe this time. Maybe this was the One where all would decide that they wanted impeachment, that the president’s behaviour was so outrageous that they couldn’t imagine this sleazy business guy sitting in the Oval Office playing a tinpot dictator in a tinfoil hat for another second.Maybe this was the One that would finally move Republicans to turn on the Grendel who is terrorising the village and gulping down their party. Certainly, Trump himself didn’t think so. As the capital was going into overdrive-freak-out mode Friday night trying to flesh out the whistleblower story, the president was busy tweeting about a children’s book by a Fox News host: “Buy this Book – great for the kids!”WhistleblowerIf House Democrats can ever get their paws on the whistleblower, maybe they can make up for the judiciary committee’s performance with Corey Lewandowski this past week, which left many wondering if these hearings designed to pry Trump out of office are just making Democrats look foolish.They certainly provide an ample platform for Trump loyalists to rail against their favourite deep state foils. When failed presidential candidate Eric Swalwell tried to get Lewandowski to read a message Trump had dictated to him, the witness nastily referred to the Democrat as “President Swalwell” and told him to read the message himself.The internecine strains between the impeach-now Nadler crowd and the get-him-out-in-2020 Pelosi crew grew more bitter. Politico reported that in a closed-door meeting, House speaker Nancy Pelosi shocked lawmakers and aides by harshly criticising the House judiciary committee staffers for propelling the impeachment effort far beyond where the Democratic caucus stands. “And you can feel free to leak this,” Pelosi said acidly.In an interview with NPR, she said she hadn’t changed her mind on impeachment, but she does think Congress should pass new laws so future presidents can be indicted. She said everyone had now seen what the founding fathers could not imagine: a president blatantly abusing the constitution he has sworn to protect.Above the lawTrump has certainly been working hard to prove Pelosi right that presidents should not ever be above the law. By Friday night, while Trump was readying for a state dinner with his ultraconservative pal from down under, Australian prime minister Scott Morrison, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times were reporting that the secret whistleblower complaint involved this: Trump repeatedly pressured President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine – about eight times, the Journal said – to work with Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s loony personal lawyer, to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden.Giuliani has been pushing a story about the former vice-president and his son, who had ties to a Ukrainian oligarch. After a fair bit of babbling on Chris Cuomo’s CNN show, Giuliani spit out some truth, that he asked Ukrainians to look into the Bidens.Later he tweeted: “A President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job.” Crooked Donald thinks he can create a Crooked Joe narrative just like he created a Crooked Hillary one. Which is it, Donald: Crooked or Sleepy?Escaped the nooseSo just consider this: Around the same time that Trump escaped the noose after Robert Mueller’s tepid testimony, sliding away from charges that he colluded with a foreign country to interfere in our election, he began arm-twisting another foreign country to interfere in our election. “Questions have emerged,” the Times said, “about whether Mr Trump’s push for an inquiry into the Bidens was behind a weeks-long White House hold on military aid for Ukraine.The United States suspended the military aid to Ukraine in early July, according to a former American official.” So the president is under suspicion of making like Nixon and abusing power to go after his enemies, saying it would be a shame if anything happened to that military aid that you want because you don’t dig up some dirt on the son of my political rival.Pelosi’s acerbic statementThe administration kept the whistleblower’s complaint from Congress, even though Congress has the legal authority to know what this urgent complaint is about. Pelosi issued an acerbic statement on Friday, noting that Joseph Maguire, acting director of national intelligence, was violating the law by refusing to disclose the complaint to Congress.“If the president has done what has been alleged, then he is stepping into a dangerous minefield with serious repercussions for his administration and our democracy,” she said. Trump is literally acting like an international mobster. Roy Cohn would be so proud. So is this the Big One? We don’t know because so much has come before. But if it is? Now that would be big.Read more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraph matt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Thomas Cook collapses as thousands left stranded abroadLabour voters are ready for Jeremy Corbyn to stand down, poll showsDuchess of Sussex wears £5 borrowed earrings to lavish Rome weddingIran \u0026#39ready to release\u0026#39 British-flagged  tankerLabour will be crushed over Brexit, Corbyn toldRescue planes line up to bring home \u0026#39stranded\u0026#39 Thomas Cook holidaymakersComment: It is clear Labour is peddling a lie and is preparing to betray ‘the many’\u0026#39Orwellian\u0026#39 Seumas Milne blamed for top Labour aide resigning amid growing tensions in partyThe Thomas Cook bosses who received £20m in bonuses in last 5 years as company collapsedDuke and Duchess of Sussex to begin tour of South Africa in one of country’s most notorious townshipsMassive crowd hails Donald Trump and Indian prime minister Narendra ModiFlower children of Arnhem tend the memory Jeremy Corbyn told Labour will be crushed over Brexit as leader faces party revoltLet caterpillars eat your flowers this autumn to help pink moth, RHS saysIran \u0026#39assures\u0026#39 FIFA that women are allowed to attend World Cup qualifier after suicide of woman arrested for entering stadiumFormer Labour employees set to sue party for libel over anti-SemitismIsrael\u0026#39s Arab party throws its support to Benny Gantz in bid to oust NetanyahuJeremy Corbyn accuses Boris Johnson of \u0026#39abuse of power\u0026#39 over relationship with former American model and entrepreneurWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/09/21/TELEMMGLPICT000210085974_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrpfQw2hJyG_yckwxPAr0gmupraKUR1Zcu4RcaNG-VEQ.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"inside charity gala justin trudeau shocked 500 guests blackface","story":"The shock \u0026#39didn\u0026#39t register\u0026#39 with Mr Trudeau, pictured at the party in 2001On the evening of Feb 24, 2001 Justin Trudeau breezed into the palatial Fairmont hotel overlooking Vancouver harbour for a charity gala.It was supposed to be a formal event with an Arabian Nights theme including belly dancers and Middle Eastern music.Some 500 guests showed up, the men in tuxedos.

Granted, it wasn’t so hard to fall for the charms of its marketing campaign. Released in the grim haze left behind by Batman v Superman (more on that later), Suicide Squad looked us in the eye and promised us an antidote to what had come before. It told us it would be the neon-splattered, anarchist baby brother of the DCEU. All that arrived was the adolescent part. Too much of Suicide Squad is spent on its over-edited character introductions: each arrives on screen with a classic rock track blaring and some meaningless onscreen text (what’s the point of Captain Boomerang’s “unicorn fetish”, again?). All ultimately wasted once the (anti-)heroes are tasked with defeating the DCEU’s most half-baked villain, The Enchantress (Cara Delevingne). She’s a character so devoid of interest, the worst crime she’s guilty of is piss-poor archeology skills.27 6. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016)Although more cohesive in its vision than Suicide Squad, Batman v Superman suffers because that vision is almost entirely delusional. What is presented to us as a philosophical epic – a treatise on morality and personal responsibility – is instantly undone by a series of ludicrous decisions on the part of the film’s director, Zack Snyder. Chief among them, the now-infamous reason that Batman (Ben Affleck) and Superman (Henry Cavill) finally stop pummelling each other and decide to become super friends: their mothers were both called Martha. And why again did Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) have any interest in making these two titans fight? The film’s plot is wildly incoherent, but it only becomes a true chore after the realisation that even Gal Gadot’s introduction as Diana PrinceWonder Woman isn’t enough to lighten the film’s funereal tone.Justice League contains, at its heart, a story that was only half-realised. Zack Snyder stepped down from his duties as director, following the tragic death of his daughter, Autumn. They were intensely difficult circumstances that didn’t necessarily come with easy answers for the future of Justice League. Warner Bros, however, made an odd choice in inviting Joss Whedon to complete the film. The quip-heavy, energetic style he brought to Marvel’s Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron clashed abrasively with the weightiness of what Snyder had already shot. Yet, Justice League at least has the advantage of showcasing the characters that the DCEU has now bet their future on, with charismatic turns from Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman, Jason Momoa’s Aquaman, and Ezra Miller’s The Flash.47 4. Man of Steel (2013)As the onscreen debut of Cavill’s Superman, Man of Steel at least benefits from a fairly straightforward, linear storyline that duly ticks off the various demands of an origin story. Elements of the film feel over laboured: the Jesus imagery is excessive for a character whose parallels with a religious saviour are already obvious, Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner)’s death scene seems unnecessary, and the film concludes with a seemingly endless destruction fest. Yet, after Superman IV: Quest for Peace (1987) and Superman Returns (2006) turned the franchise into a joke, an approach as sombre as that of director Zack Snyder felt right for the character at the time, flaws aside. Whether he made the right choice in violating Superman’s usual no-kill policy, by having him snap General Zod (Michael Sheen)’s neck, is up for (usually lengthy) debate.Aquaman is far from perfect, but credit has to be given to director James Wan for taking such a huge risk with the film and standing by it, even in its most ludicrous excesses. This is a bombastic adventure. And it’s all anchored by its star Jason Momoa, who manages to turn a character who, for years, has been the butt of the joke, into DC’s new party jock hero. Momoa made the man-who-talks-to-fish cool. Unfortunately, it’s also an audience ider: either you buy into the giant crab warriors and the octopus playing drums, or you get distracted by the lazy plotting and the weak dialogue. Unfortunately, beneath all the fishy visuals, the film’s story gets swamped by exposition and an unconvincing central romance.Shazam! centres on a troubled 14-year-old orphan (Asher Angel) who has the power to transform into a Superman-type character (a visibly delighted Zachary Levi) by saying the film\u0027s title. Borrowing heavily from Tom Hanks\u0027s Big, the film breezes along, playfully skewering superhero tropes and concluding with a light-hearted, low-stakes climax. Sure, there are segments that drag, and the superhero fights are a little too long, but Shazam! finally gives the world a coherent and fun DCEU film. With this and Aquaman having been released back-to-back, the darkness of Snyder\u0027s Man of Steel and Batman vs Superman seems but a fever dream.When Patty Jenkins entered the ring to direct Wonder Woman’s first solo film since her inception in 1941, she brought something to the DCEU that arguably hadn’t been seen before. Wonder Woman has heart. It’s a film filled with characters you can believe in, root for, and idolise. Although it stumbles at times – its main villain is dull, its side villain is under-used, and its finale relies far too much on CGI – those weaknesses pale in comparison to how beautifully crafted Wonder Woman’s own personal journey is. We see what courage and sacrifice represents, and what it means to fight for the good of others. It’s a rare thing to see a superhero film place at its centre the true ideals of heroism – kindness, justice, and love – and have them all embodied in one character. And with Gal Gadot exuding both power and compassion in equal measure, it’s no wonder that so many uphold her as the bright spot of the DCEU.

Again, over half – 56 per cent – said they do not have enough information to start making decisions about their post-Brexit recruitment strategy, with just 27 per cent happy to make decisions based on existing information.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Environmental activists rally during the UK Student Climate Network\u0027s Global Climate Strike protest in central London.

Australia were all out for 284 after Steve Smith frustrated the hosts with a total of 144. He helped drag his side from 122-8The institute also found that since the 2016 vote to leave the EU most employers have focused on retaining existing EU staff, rather than on planning for immigration restrictions.Very few employers are ready for the end of free movement and restrictions on immigration in just over a year. Worse still, many seem both daunted and alarmed by the range of restrictions planned and the costs they are likely to incur,” said Gerwyn Davies, senior labour market adviser for the CIPD.“It seems inevitable that the rate of inflow of EU citizens into the UK from 2021 will fall compared with recent years,” he added.The CIPD urged the government to bring in immigration restrictions gradually to give firms more time to adjust and to avoid harming UK competitiveness.It recommended introducing a two-year visa system for unskilled workers and making an exception for some jobs with labour shortages by lowering the proposed £30,000 salary requirement for foreign workers.One engineering firm in Scotland told the CIPD that the average salary of a skilled manufacturing worker is £28,000. “That’s a significant issue for us,” the employer said.The British Chambers of Commerce also highlighted lingering gaps in government guidance on the status of EU migrants despite the fast-approaching Brexit deadline of 31 October.“The implications of unclear government advice, and gaps in the system, could be costly for businesses that may feel they need to access professional help,” the group said on Friday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He helped drag his side from 122-8The institute also found that since the 2016 vote to leave the EU most employers have focused on retaining existing EU staff, rather than on planning for immigration restrictions.Very few employers are ready for the end of free movement and restrictions on immigration in just over a year. Worse still, many seem both daunted and alarmed by the range of restrictions planned and the costs they are likely to incur,” said Gerwyn Davies, senior labour market adviser for the CIPD.“It seems inevitable that the rate of inflow of EU citizens into the UK from 2021 will fall compared with recent years,” he added.The CIPD urged the government to bring in immigration restrictions gradually to give firms more time to adjust and to avoid harming UK competitiveness.It recommended introducing a two-year visa system for unskilled workers and making an exception for some jobs with labour shortages by lowering the proposed £30,000 salary requirement for foreign workers.One engineering firm in Scotland told the CIPD that the average salary of a skilled manufacturing worker is £28,000. “That’s a significant issue for us,” the employer said.The British Chambers of Commerce also highlighted lingering gaps in government guidance on the status of EU migrants despite the fast-approaching Brexit deadline of 31 October.“The implications of unclear government advice, and gaps in the system, could be costly for businesses that may feel they need to access professional help,” the group said on Friday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ms Rose will become the first chief executive of a major British high street bank when she replaces outgoing boss Ross McEwan on 31 October.\u0026nbspRBS will also be the only FTSE 100 company with women in its top two positions. Katie Murray is the lender\u0027s chief financial officer.\u0026nbspMs Rose, who is currently chief executive of RBS\u0027 commercial and private banking ision, as well as deputy CEO of NatWest,\u0026nbsphad been widely tipped for the top job.Thomas Cook in race to find £200m to stave off collapse\u0026nbspThomas Cook is\u0026nbspon the brink of administration after the tour operator\u0027s lenders demanded that it finds\u0026nbsp£200m in extra funding.\u0026nbspThe company said it was in talks with stakeholders to secure the required funds, including Chinese firm Fosun which injected £450m last month.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0027s travel correspondent, Simon Calder, explains how people who have booked holidays with Thomas Cook might be affected:\u0026nbspThomas Cook: How will holidaymakers be affected if the travel company collapses?\u0026nbspDover is 100 per cent ready for no-deal Brexit, says port chief executive\u0026nbspThe Port of Dover is 100 per cent ready for a no-deal Brexit, according to the port\u0027s boss, Doug Bannister.\u0026nbspHowever, he\u0026nbsptold Bloomberg\u0026nbspthat he still has no clarity on the rules of the game such as what documents will be needed for freight consignments\u0026nbspMr Bannister also conceded that he was anticipating\u0026nbspdisruption: whether it’s a day, two days, a week, two weeks, a month, two months, nobody can really predict”.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThree Mobile customers will continue to pay a loyalty penalty\u0026nbspCitizens Advice says Three Mobile customers will continue to pay a loyalty penalty that collectively amounts to as much as £2.7m a month after the company.\u0026nbspOther major networks have committed to end the practice of continuing to charge customers for their handset when their minimum contract period ends and they have paid it off.\u0026nbspBut Three has refused to follow suit, Citizens Advice said. This means loyal customers are being overcharged, the organisation said.\u0026nbspA Three spokesperson said: The current proposals are not in customers\u0027 best interests. Applying an arbitrary discount to tariffs will not effectively tackle what really matters - helping them to find a contract which is both best-suited to their needs and priced fairly.Offshore wind no longer needs subsidies after costs tumble\u0026nbspRenewable energy from new offshore wind farms will be cheaper to produce than the current market rate and no longer require any subsidy after cost tumbled 30 per cent in two years.\u0026nbspThe government revealed that 12 new energy projects, including offshore wind farms will receive between £39.65 and £41.61 per megawatt hour.\u0026nbspBoris Johnson said: The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it\u0027s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.Google makes \u0027biggest\u0026nbspcorporate purchase\u0027 of energy\u0026nbspGoogle boss Sundar Pichai said the tech giant plans to make the\u0026nbsp“the biggest corporate purchase of renewable energy in history.\u0026nbspIncluded in the investment will be more than $2bn (£1.6bn) in energy infrastructure and 1,600-megawatts of wind and solar agreements.\u0026nbsp“In all, our renewable energy fleet now stands at 52 projects, driving more than $7bn in new construction and thousands of related jobs,” Pichai said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0027Truly extraordinary\u0027\u0026nbspThe record low prices secured for new renewable energy\u0026nbspprojects are truly extraordinary says\u0026nbspSimon Virley, UK head of energy and natural resources at KPMG.\u0026nbspThe government has secured almost 6GW of new renewables capacity, without spending any of the £65m budget allocated for this auction, due the record low clearing prices.\u0026nbsp“Giant offshore wind projects will now be built in the North Sea effectively ‘subsidy free’. \u0026nbspThis raises the prospect of offshore wind contributing even more than previously envisaged to achieving the UK’s Net Zero emissions target by 2050.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhat are the options for Thomas Cook as it struggles to stay afloat?\u0026nbspJoanna Ford, partner at law firm Cripps Pemberton Greenish, says the proposed rescue deal would come at a cost. Existing shareholders would lose much of the value of their investment and control would shift to Thomas Cook\u0027s\u0026nbspChinese investor, Fosun, says Ms Ford.\u0026nbspThis is a common and obvious option for companies that are struggling financially – turning to their existing stakeholders to put their hands in their pockets so their investments can hopefully be salvaged makes sound commercial sense.\u0026nbspShareholders will inevitably want something additional in return, though, and this is usually in the form of shares that then dilute the value of the stake held by those shareholders who chose not to invest.But if that doesn\u0027t work...\u0026nbspIf the rescue deal fails to materialise then the options for Thomas Cook could include administration, an insolvency process where professionals are appointed to manage the company’s affairs. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn this scenario they would try to sell the whole, or parts of the business, leaving behind the company in administration, its shareholders and all the liabilities, which would then be paid (usually not in full) from the cash received from the sale. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOther options to businesses with cash flow difficulties include emergency borrowing, either from their own banks or specialist distressed lenders, but this is usually only a sticking plaster if the root cause of the difficulties are not addressed. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIf the problems continue, then the cash deficit simply increases and the lenders stand to shoulder greater losses should the business ultimately collapse.The banks are strong-arming Thomas Cook, says analyst\u0026nbspAlex Brignall, Travel and Leisure Analyst at City equities broker Redburn, comments:\u0026nbsp“It feels like a bit of strong-arming by the banks to see the Fosun deal get sorted quickly, or for the situation to be resolved in another way, likely through disposals. Triton has remained very keen to buy the Nordic business, so that should be able to be done if the other solutions do not come through on time.\u0026nbsp“The concerning thing is that September should be the best point of the year for the cash balance, so for banks to be demanding a cash top-up now suggests demand has taken a big hit from all the negative publicity and that the company is facing additional working capital stress.”\u0026nbspPound falls as Ireland pours cold water on Brexit deal hopes\u0026nbspThe pound has plunged more than a cent against the dollar from a high today of $1.258 to $1.245 after Ireland\u0027s foreign minister warned that a Brexit deal is not close.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSimon Coveney told the BBC that everyone needs a dose of reality about the negotiations.\u0026nbsp“We need to be honest with people and say that we’re not close to that deal right now,” he said.

They will not now go ahead.\u0026nbspThe low-cost airline called on pilots to resume talks next week to resolve disputes over a wide range of concerns, including pensions, loss of licence insurance and maternity benefits.\u0026nbspYesterday, Balpa accused Ryanair of being\u0026nbsp“hell bent on prolonging the dispute”.Rogue oil trader causes $320m loss at Mitsubishi\u0026nbspJapanese financial firm Mitsubishi\u0026nbspsaid a rogue oil trader at its Singapore unit lost $320m in unauthorised transactions disguised as legitimate hedges for customers.\u0026nbspThe employee, a Chinese national working at Petro-Diamond Singapore, has been fired and reported to police, Mitsubishi said in a statement, declining to name him.\u0026nbspThe trader, hired in November 2018 to handle oil business with China, “repeatedly” engaged in the unauthorised deals since January, disguising them to “look like hedge transactions,” the parent company said.\u0026nbspA person familiar with the matter identified the trader as Wang Xingchen, also known as Jack Wang. Calls to Wang’s mobile phone wouldn’t connect, while a person who answered the phone at Petro-Diamond’s Singapore office said he has left the company.

Applying an arbitrary discount to tariffs will not effectively tackle what really matters - helping them to find a contract which is both best-suited to their needs and priced fairly.Offshore wind no longer needs subsidies after costs tumble\u0026nbspRenewable energy from new offshore wind farms will be cheaper to produce than the current market rate and no longer require any subsidy after cost tumbled 30 per cent in two years.\u0026nbspThe government revealed that 12 new energy projects, including offshore wind farms will receive between £39.65 and £41.61 per megawatt hour.\u0026nbspBoris Johnson said: The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it\u0027s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.Google makes \u0027biggest\u0026nbspcorporate purchase\u0027 of energy\u0026nbspGoogle boss Sundar Pichai said the tech giant plans to make the\u0026nbsp“the biggest corporate purchase of renewable energy in history.\u0026nbspIncluded in the investment will be more than $2bn (£1.6bn) in energy infrastructure and 1,600-megawatts of wind and solar agreements.\u0026nbsp“In all, our renewable energy fleet now stands at 52 projects, driving more than $7bn in new construction and thousands of related jobs,” Pichai said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0027Truly extraordinary\u0027\u0026nbspThe record low prices secured for new renewable energy\u0026nbspprojects are truly extraordinary says\u0026nbspSimon Virley, UK head of energy and natural resources at KPMG.\u0026nbspThe government has secured almost 6GW of new renewables capacity, without spending any of the £65m budget allocated for this auction, due the record low clearing prices.\u0026nbsp“Giant offshore wind projects will now be built in the North Sea effectively ‘subsidy free’. \u0026nbspThis raises the prospect of offshore wind contributing even more than previously envisaged to achieving the UK’s Net Zero emissions target by 2050.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhat are the options for Thomas Cook as it struggles to stay afloat?\u0026nbspJoanna Ford, partner at law firm Cripps Pemberton Greenish, says the proposed rescue deal would come at a cost. Existing shareholders would lose much of the value of their investment and control would shift to Thomas Cook\u0027s\u0026nbspChinese investor, Fosun, says Ms Ford.\u0026nbspThis is a common and obvious option for companies that are struggling financially – turning to their existing stakeholders to put their hands in their pockets so their investments can hopefully be salvaged makes sound commercial sense.\u0026nbspShareholders will inevitably want something additional in return, though, and this is usually in the form of shares that then dilute the value of the stake held by those shareholders who chose not to invest.But if that doesn\u0027t work...\u0026nbspIf the rescue deal fails to materialise then the options for Thomas Cook could include administration, an insolvency process where professionals are appointed to manage the company’s affairs. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn this scenario they would try to sell the whole, or parts of the business, leaving behind the company in administration, its shareholders and all the liabilities, which would then be paid (usually not in full) from the cash received from the sale. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOther options to businesses with cash flow difficulties include emergency borrowing, either from their own banks or specialist distressed lenders, but this is usually only a sticking plaster if the root cause of the difficulties are not addressed. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIf the problems continue, then the cash deficit simply increases and the lenders stand to shoulder greater losses should the business ultimately collapse.The banks are strong-arming Thomas Cook, says analyst\u0026nbspAlex Brignall, Travel and Leisure Analyst at City equities broker Redburn, comments:\u0026nbsp“It feels like a bit of strong-arming by the banks to see the Fosun deal get sorted quickly, or for the situation to be resolved in another way, likely through disposals. Triton has remained very keen to buy the Nordic business, so that should be able to be done if the other solutions do not come through on time.\u0026nbsp“The concerning thing is that September should be the best point of the year for the cash balance, so for banks to be demanding a cash top-up now suggests demand has taken a big hit from all the negative publicity and that the company is facing additional working capital stress.”\u0026nbspPound falls as Ireland pours cold water on Brexit deal hopes\u0026nbspThe pound has plunged more than a cent against the dollar from a high today of $1.258 to $1.245 after Ireland\u0027s foreign minister warned that a Brexit deal is not close.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSimon Coveney told the BBC that everyone needs a dose of reality about the negotiations.\u0026nbsp“We need to be honest with people and say that we’re not close to that deal right now,” he said. Mr Coveney acknowledged that the mood music around Brexit talks had improved\u0026nbspbut said there was still a wide gap between what the UK has proposed and what the EU would accept.\u0026nbspThe comments reversed a rally sparked last night by optimistic remarks from European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.\u0026nbspIn today\u0027s session, the pound is down 0.4 per cent against the dollar and 0.2 per cent against the euro at €1.131.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRyanair pilots cancel strike action\u0026nbspRyanair says its UK-based pilots have cancelled five days of strikes planned for this month.\u0026nbspMembers of the Balpa union had set walkouts for September 21, 23,\u0026nbsp25, 27 and 29. They will not now go ahead.\u0026nbspThe low-cost airline called on pilots to resume talks next week to resolve disputes over a wide range of concerns, including pensions, loss of licence insurance and maternity benefits.\u0026nbspYesterday, Balpa accused Ryanair of being\u0026nbsp“hell bent on prolonging the dispute”.Rogue oil trader causes $320m loss at Mitsubishi\u0026nbspJapanese financial firm Mitsubishi\u0026nbspsaid a rogue oil trader at its Singapore unit lost $320m in unauthorised transactions disguised as legitimate hedges for customers.\u0026nbspThe employee, a Chinese national working at Petro-Diamond Singapore, has been fired and reported to police, Mitsubishi said in a statement, declining to name him.\u0026nbspThe trader, hired in November 2018 to handle oil business with China, “repeatedly” engaged in the unauthorised deals since January, disguising them to “look like hedge transactions,” the parent company said.\u0026nbspA person familiar with the matter identified the trader as Wang Xingchen, also known as Jack Wang. Calls to Wang’s mobile phone wouldn’t connect, while a person who answered the phone at Petro-Diamond’s Singapore office said he has left the company.

That includes new features like improved multi-tasking, a re-designed home screen and more.When the new iPhone update arrivesThis is the first year that Apple has split the operating systems for iPhone and iPad into separate releases, with the latter being referred to as iPadOS. That has presumably allowed the company to more easily stagger the different releases.And it will not be until 30 September that Apple TV gets its own software update, too. That update, named tvOS 13, will bring support for multiple users as well as the ability to use Xbox and PS4 controllers with Apple\u0027s set-top box.Apple presumably could not delay the release of iOS 13 for iPhones in the same way as the Apple TV and iPad because the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro will be released this week, and they needed a stable version of the new software to ship on them.The company did unveil a new iPad at its September event, when the new iPhones were shown off, but that device will not ship until 30 September.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The logic is that, should the hatch never be created, Oceanic Flight 815\u0026nbspwill never crash on the island. The flashsideways show\u0026nbspwhat would have happened had the plane\u0026nbsplanded safely\u0026nbspin Los Angeles.All season long, viewers see the characters rubbing shoulders with one another in LA, unaware of the events of the past\u0026nbspfive seasons.Eventually, these characters\u0026nbspare drawn\u0026nbsptogether and they begin to recall\u0026nbsptheir time on the island, which leads\u0026nbspto the final scene’s revelation: they are dead in the\u0026nbspflashsideways, which are essentially\u0026nbspa netherworld the survivors created in order to congregate so they can\u0026nbspmove on to “whatever comes next” together.So, to clear up the confusion: in\u0026nbspthe flashsideways\u0026nbspscenes,\u0026nbspthese characters are dead. But no, they were not dead all along after their plane crashed.The flashsideways\u0026nbspscenes\u0026nbspdepict an afterlife that the characters constructed for themselves due to the fact that their time on the island – which was completely real from start to end – was\u0026nbspthe most important part of their respective lives.The characters present in that final church scene are characters both dead and alive in island time, meaning\u0026nbspseveral characters (including Kate, Sawyer and Claire) went on to live a full life beyond the series finale.These flashsideways\u0026nbsppresent a purgatory-of-sorts, where these characters\u0026nbspcome to when they eventually\u0026nbspdo die\u0026nbspwhenever that may be. When broken down, it’s a beautiful and reassuring depiction of the afterlife.The plane crash, the smoke monster, the hatch, the island – it was all real.Of course, it almost all ended rather differently...Find a ranking of every single Lost episode here.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Months ago, that was the date that a college student typed into a joke Facebook event, before writing the words that would go on to make it become a day of angst for the US military and residents who live near Area 51.Next to that date, a bored young man called Matty Roberts writes an event description that would propel the page to viral fame.“Storm Area 51, They Can’t Stop All of Us,” it read.Now that the day has arrived, the mission to “storm Area 51” looks very different than it did during that moment of excited viral fame. It went from an online joke, to something that prompted action from both the US military and Facebook, to a potential disaster for the people who are intending to turn up after all.The event began as a joke. That much was clear from the description, which referenced an anime character and suggested people would be able to outrun bullets.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red.

Lets see them aliens.”The page developed in the same comedic manner, playing host to a variety of jokes and memes that sarcastically riffed on aliens and the secrets of the government.Storm Area 51 event could be disaster, locals fearBut it very quickly became very serious indeed. As interest in the Facebook page grew, so did anxiety that some people might really try to break into the base – and US Air Force spokesperson\u0026nbspLaura McAndrews\u0026nbspwas one of a number of officials who\u0026nbspgave a stern warning to anyone who did.Ms McAndrews added: “The US Air Force always stands ready to protect America and its assets”.Last month, the event disappeared from Facebook. It wasn’t clear exactly why, and at the point it was removed more than two million people had indicated they would take part.It was particularly frustrating for organiser Mr Roberts because he had attempted to parlay the interest into a real event: the equally ill-fated Alienstock. Rather than raiding Area 51, that woud be a festival devoted to the culture that surrounds it, attempting to harness people’s interest in the moment into something organised and profitable, rather than potentially lethal.There are now three different major events planned, with a number of others likely. It’s not clear how many people will be arriving in Nevada to take part in them.Two of the main ones are now called Alienstock, after some confusion and disagreement between the people organising them. One will happen in Las Vegas, and appears to be something like a more traditional EDM festival the other is taking place in the tiny town of Rachel, Nevada, in the heart of Area 51-country.It’s that event in particular that has led locals to “prepare for the worst”. Rachel is a tiny town, with a population of around 54, which is only about twice the number of musical acts advertised as performing at the event.Last month, the town’s official website posted a warning indicating that the event has a “high potential to get ugly”. The town and the harsh desert that surrounds it has few places for anyone to stay, is subject to wildly fluctuating temperatures, is home to dangerous animals and the local area has no internet,\u0026nbspphone signal or credit card facilities.Those warnings are still continuing as the weekend begins. This week, local Joerg Arnu said that people did not know what they were getting themselves in for.“Those that know what to expect camping in the desert are going to have a good time,” Arnu said. “Those who are looking for a big party are going to be disappointed.”He predicts people showing up in the desert in shorts and flip-flops.“That doesn’t protect you against critters, snakes and scorpions,” Arnu said. “It will get cold at night. They’re not going to find what they’re looking for, and they are going to get angry.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This would take the 70-year-old to the brink of his 75th birthday in 2024.The role could be thrust upon him suddenly if he is invited by the Queen to form a national unity administration after a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson, or if the PM resigns rather than request a Brexit extension from Brussels.The senior Labour figure said he believed\u0026nbspMr Corbyn would be “terrified” by this prospect, as his personality was not suited to the demands of the premiership.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn is met by an anti-Brexit campaigner as he leaves after a BBC interview at the party conference in Brighton Protesters gather for a march and rally organised by The People\u0027s Vote in Brighton, to call for politicians to give the public a final say referendum on BrexitProtesters in London joined millions across world to demand urgent action to save planet in the largest environmental protest in historyRapper Dave poses with the Mercury Prize: Albums of the Year Award at ApolloA surfer in action during sunrise at Tynemouth on the north east coastProtesters dressed as the Incredible Hulk and Robocop outside the Supreme Court in London where judges are due to consider legal challenges to Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u0027s decision to suspend Parliament.

Donald Trump is 73 – maybe we should just give Jeremy a wig and some fake tan.”Corbyn-backing Unite union boss Len McCluskey dismissed suggestions that the Labour leader might quit.“I have never met a stronger inidual than Jeremy Corbyn,” Mr McCluskey told Sky News’ Sophy Ridge on Sunday.“All this stuff about his age and he’s not looking well –\u0026nbsphe’s already seen off a few Conservative prime ministers in David Cameron and Theresa May and when we get a chance in a general election he’ll see a third off.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But I can say today, that our very first Budget will immediately close the tax loopholes used by elite private schools, and use that money to improve the lives of all children.”The news was welcomed by anti-private school campaigners.Holly Rigby, from the Abolish Eton campaign, said: “We are delighted that Labour has committed to integrating all\u0026nbspprivate\u0026nbspschools\u0026nbspinto the state sector and that it will feature in the next manifesto.”She added: “We will dismantle systems of privilege and inequality and build a society that works for the millions and not the millionaires.”But the Independent Schools Council (ISC) warned Labour that the policy would be a “vote loser”.Citing a ComRes survey for the organisation, Barnaby Lenon, chair of the\u0026nbspISC\u0026nbspchair and a former headmaster of Harrow, said:\u0026nbsp“t’s not something that people are thinking is going to be especially helpful. The main thing they want to do is improve state schools, which is what we all want.“If you look at the proportions that are less likely to vote for a party abolishing independent schools or are neutral, the figure ranges between 62 and 77 per cent across all regions and it ranges from 64 to 75 per cent across all age groups.

If\u0026nbsppassed, the text would become\u0026nbspofficial party policy.The change would\u0026nbspextend the right to vote in general elections to anyone with residency rights in the UK, regardless of their nationality. Currently only British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens are allowed to vote in general elections. Other foreign\u0026nbspnationals living in Britain can vote only in local elections and European elections.The proposal\u0026nbspwill be debated at the Labour conference in Brighton after being quietly included\u0026nbspin a motion that says a Labour government should maintain and extend freedom of movement even if Britain leaves the EU, including by opposing any new immigration system based on migrants\u0027 income\u0026nbspor skills.\u0026nbspThe text says that, if Labour wins the next\u0026nbspelection, it will extend equal rights to vote to all UK residents.Labour votes to abolish private schools at party conferenceIt also says that a Labour government would close all detention centres and scrap all Hostile Environment measures, including restrictions on migrants\u0027 access to the NHS and welfare payments.Extending the voting franchise would likely have a\u0026nbspmajor impact if it was implemented before any second Brexit referendum and applied to the subsequent poll,\u0026nbspwith the 3 million EU citizens living in the UK easily enough to swing any vote heavily towards Remain. In the 2016 referendum, only people with the right to vote in UK general elections were allowed to vote.It would also be likely\u0026nbspto deliver millions more votes for pro-EU and pro-immigration parties in future general elections.The move has been co-ordinated by the Labour Campaign for Free Movement and is expected to be approved by conference delegates when it is put to a vote on Monday.A statement\u0026nbspaccompanying the motion, signed by Labour MPs, trade unionists and representatives of EU citizens in the UK, said it was fundamentally wrong that millions of people living in the UK are currently denied the right to vote.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As representatives and activists of the labour movement, we understand that people only ever win justice and beat prejudice when they have a voice of their own. At minimum, this means having the right to vote.It added: “Millions of people who have made their home here cannot vote here. It is fundamentally wrong that so many millions of people are denied a vote in decisions which affect them deeply.\u0026nbsp“So at this Labour Party conference and beyond, we will support moves to extend equal rights to vote to all UK residents.

1,500 people had gathered at the festival sites and said more than 150 people also made the rugged trip several additional miles on bone-rattling dirt roads to get within selfie distance of the gates.Another group of about 40 people gathered at a different gate in the\u0026nbspAmargosa Valley.The military had issued stern warnings that lethal force could be used if people entered the Nevada Test and Training Range, and local and state officials said arrests would be made if people tried.It\u0027s public land, the sheriff said.

One person starts something and it infects everybody with positivity. Anything can happen if you give people a place to be.The entertainment kicked off weekend events that also feature a gathering Friday and Saturday at the Alien Research Centre souvenir store in Hiko.Owner George Harris said it would focus on music, movies and talks about extraterrestrial lore.Authorities reported no serious incidents related to the festivals, which were\u0026nbspscheduled to last until Sunday.Hiko and Rachel are about a 45-minute drive apart on a state road dubbed the Extraterrestrial Highway, and a two-hour drive from Las Vegas.Michael Ian Borer, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas, sociologist who researches pop culture and paranormal activity, called the festivities sparked by the internet joke a perfect blend of interest in aliens and the supernatural, government conspiracies, and the desire to know what we don\u0027t know.YouTuber sentenced to jail after attempting to film Area 51People desire to be part of something, to be ahead of the curve, he said. Area 51 is a place where normal, ordinary citizens can\u0027t go. When you tell people they can\u0027t do something, they just want to do it more.Eric Holt, the Lincoln County emergency manager, said he believed authorities could handle 30,000 visitors at the two events. Still, neighbours braced for trouble after more than two million people responded to the Storm Area 51 Facebook post weeks ago.Those that know what to expect camping in the desert are going to have a good time, said Joerg Arnu, a Rachel resident who can see the festival grounds from his home.Those who show up in shorts and flip-flops will find no protection against critters, snakes and scorpions, he warned.It will get cold at night. They\u0027re not going to find what they\u0027re looking for, and they are going to get angry, he added.The Federal Aviation Administration closed nearby airspace, although Air Force jets could be heard in the sun-drenched skies, along with an occasional sonic boom.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Not unless we want to be ruled by unelected judges and unelected millionaire litigants, on top of unelected peers and unaccountable Speakers.Andthese judges do now demand Parliament’s recall, what will Remainer MPs do with all their new sitting time They have already passed their law to “prevent No Deal”. And they are too ­terried of voters’ rage to topple the Government and face an election.What  is there  Unless they intend to go for broke and deploy their own Bercow-backed pseudo-Government to revoke Brexit entirely.This case has been an act of stupid, reckless constitutional vandalism — undermining the PM just as progress towards a new deal IS being made, as even Jean-Claude Juncker concedes.As for the spurious arguments against Boris, we recoil at the hypocrisy of John Major claiming that letting a PM suspend Parliament could enable future ones to axe elections or scrap the Army.Such scaremongering fantasies didn’t trouble him in  when HE did it — and swerved scrutiny over a bribery scandal engulfing his MPs.“This case is not about Brexit,” claims Supreme Court president Lady Hale.Pull the other one.THE Sun is proud to have taken a stand for disabled kids and their families, hit hard by Government cuts.And we’re honoured that the public interest journalism of our Give It Back ­campaign won the Media of the Year award from the charity Sense. The real prize, though, is that the ­Government IS listening. It must now reinstate the £million taken from respite care and vital equipment.Then we will truly celebrate.AFTER  years of negotiation, the EU’s huge trade deal with South America is vetoed by a single Austrian sub-committee.Proving two things: That an organisation so unwieldy is virtually incapable of making trade deals and Britain will be infinitely more nimble outside it.And that it is, sadly, delusional now to believe we could strike one with Brussels before the hated backstop kicked in.That’s why it must be killed off.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Corbyn hasn’t committed to either side. In an interview yesterday, he refused to answer the question EIGHT TIMES.So, we are in the absurd position of a man running to be Prime Minister not being able to say where he would stand on the biggest issue facing the country in decades.Little wonder that more than three quarters of voters are dissatisfied with his performance.Corbyn is betting that he can quarantine the issue of Brexit. His strategy is to offer a second referendum then fight a general election on classic Left Right lines.The problem with this plan is that British politics is so dominated by Brexit that you HAVE to have an answer on that before you can talk about anything .Is Jeremy Corbyn really intending to spend the entire election campaign refusing to say how he would vote in the referendum he is calling for Corbyn’s equivocation is a particular problem, given the clarity in the other parties’ positions.The Lib Dem conference agreed this week thatthe party won a majority in a general election — stop sniggering at the back — they would simply revoke Article .This clear policy is helping them scoop up more and more Remainer votes. One poll this week had them overtaking Labour and pulling in support from more than  per cent of those who backed Remain in .If the Lib Dems get anywhere near this level of support in a general election, then Labour will lose seats to BOTH the Lib Dems and the Tories.As one gleeful Cabinet minister points out, the Lib Dem position “shines a spot-light on Labour’s ambiguity”.Many in the Shadow Cabinet are worried about Corbyn’s refusal to say where he stands. Many of them want Labour to state clearly that it is the party of Remain.Expect an effort at next week’s Labour conference to change the party’s position to make it clear that as a party Labour WILL IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES campaign for Remain in a second referendum.The other problem with Corbyn’s position is that it means this whole debate will just drag on. Another negotiation with Brussels followed by another referendum would take at least six months, and maybe more.This isn’t going to be popular with an electorate that wants this issue resolved so the country can move on and start addressing the domestic issues voters care about most.At the last election, Corbyn managed to skilfully straddle the Brexit ide.He hoovered up the votes of Remainers but with a manesto that promised to respect the referendum result, held on to heavily Leave-supporting seats too.It will be far harder,not impossible, for Corbyn to pull off that trick again. The danger for him is that his fence-sitting ends up alienating both groups.AT his book launch, David Cameron told the assembled guests that he had tried to avoid writing too much about scandals in the memoir.But he did remember when a Tory peer got caught up in an SM sting early in his leadership.It was put to him that he should remove the whip, to which Cameron replied: “Shouldn’t we take the handcuffs off too ”“WHAT was he thinking ’ one loyal, long-time supporter of David Cameron declared to me after the former PM revealed how he had worked behind the scenes to get the Queen to make an intervention in the Scottish independence referendum.The Palace is understandably cross about the revelation, which undermines the Queen’s political neutrality.One Whitehall source tells me the Palace are “apoplectic” about it and can’t understand why a former Prime Minister would break such an important confidence in such a pre-meditated way.Belatedly, Cameron seems to have realised the trouble he’s caused – refusing to answer further questions on it for TV.But as someone who has worked for three Tory leaders tells me: “It is one of the weirdest unforced errors I have ever seen.”As part of efforts to deal with this problem, Operation Anson has been launched. This week, the team involved arrested  people on suspicion of involvement in this activity after targeting  marinas and harbours.The test of this surge in enforcement activity will be whether it stamps out this vile trade before more people perish in the Channel.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is not clear who runs it, but it also operates two websites: globalclimatestrike.net and peoplesdemands.org.On the latter, it publishes what passes as its manesto. Read it, and it becomes very clear what lies behind the climate strikes.It is really the anti-capitalist movement — the lot who used to demand an end to globalisation — in green disguise.Astonishingly, it opposes not just nuclear energy but also “mega hydro” , biofuels and carbon capture and storage.These are all technologies central to the Government’s ambition to cut UK carbon emissions to net zero by .Yet FridaysfortheFuture wants the world to move to zero carbon energy by  —  years earlier.How on Earth does it expect to achieve that  It wants humanity toto living in pre-industrial conditions.And it wants to “support non-market approaches to climate action”.In other words, it wants some kind of primitive socialist society.The trouble is thatwe went back to living in pre-industrial conditions we would very rapidly end up with pre-industrial levels of hunger, disease and child mortality.There is another way to tackle climate change, which is to invest in renewable energy and other low-carbon tech through a liberal, market economy to build a proper energy infrastructure.Children are right to be concerned about the planet, but they might care to take a closer look at the  ideology behind their climate strikes. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We were promised that we would.But a half-hearted and incompetent strategy from Theresa May, alongside a well-funded, relentless campaign to undermine the referendum and the Government’s negotiating position, has left us still in the EU after three years of drt and doom-mongering.Matters have been made worse by Speaker John Bercow’s bias, which has brought Parliament into disrepute.But in response, Jeremy Corbyn is in danger of adopting a still more absurd and tragic position, urged by senior figures Emily Thornberry and John McDonnell.To renegotiate a deal, to put it to yet another referendum, and then to campaign against that deal and in favour of remaining in the EU after all.What a self-defeating proposition. To give credit to the EU negotiators, they have played hardball all along and used every trick to avoid concessions.Imagine how they would negotiatethey knew that our Government would be committed to telling the public to reject that deal afterwards!Unfortunately, this policy may become a reality. All too many activist delegates to Labour Conference are out of touch with the history and the values of the party, and do not respect traditional voters’ opposition to EU federalism and neoliberalism.This is leading to anger and disillusionment in leave voting areas, which a majority of Labour MPs represent. Many decent, patriotic Labour voters feel alienated by the suggestion they were at best foolish to vote to Leave and should know better next time.Labour should take warning. Labour voters in seats we must win to take seize power may never dream of voting Conservative. BUT they now have a credible option.The Brexit Party has a clear promise to follow through on the referendum vote. It includes left-wing MEPs and cannot be dismissed as simply UKIP mark II.If Labour does not recognise this danger and recommit to our existing policy of honouring Brexit, its future may be bleak.

He quit Labour to be an independent MP in February over the “culture of extremism and intolerance” created by Mr Corbyn.Today Mr Austin launches cross-party campaign group Mainstream, aimed at combating extremism in public le.He said: “I grew up listening to my father, a Holocaust refugee, warning of the dangers of prejudice and hatred.“I joined Labour as a teenager and campaigned for it all my adult le.“But the party of today is not the one I grew up in.“Under Jeremy Corbyn it has been poisoned by a culture of extremism and intolerance. It is the responsibility of everyone who opposes extremism in all its forms to stand up against this destructive force.”The poll found  per cent are proud of Britain’s history over the past  years, with  per cent “ashamed”.Only  per cent believe in retaining the monarchy while  per cent want a republic.Twenty per cent would be “happy” or “proud” to sing the anthem but half would be “bored, embarrassed or angry”.More members,  per cent, blame the Government for the atrocities of the Troubles than blame Republican terrorists like the IRA .Just  per cent think groups like al-Qaeda are the most to blame for Islamist terrorist attacks in the UK. A total of  per cent think the UK and its allies are most to blame, while  per cent blame both sides equally.Meanwhile  per cent support using strikes to overthrow a Conservative government.A huge  per cent agree with getting rid of Britain’s nuclear weapons. Almost half,  per cent, want to abolish our country’s borders.A total of  per cent support new laws limiting who owns national newspapers. And  per cent say a Labour government should take more control of broadcast media.We stand up to extremism, racism and prejudice. That’s the British way.Sun readers expect their government to defend their country abroad, maintain their security at home and keep their streets safe. They certainly don’t expect a party which might be in power in just a few weeks to tear itself to pieces in the way Labour has done in the last  hours.Tom Watson has given the party he loves decades of service. But because the extremists who now control Labour don’t trust him to bow to all of their demands, they tried to abolish his job while he was at home looking after his son.Mainstream is a new campaign to stand up for these values and warn people of the dangers of extremism.We will promote respectable and responsible politics wherever we can, and we will oppose extremism - wherever it comes from.We’ll oppose extremism on the far left or the hard right, and today we are highlighting the impact of a government led by Jeremy Corbyn and the hard left.I thought I knew how badly Jeremy Corbyn had poisoned the Labour Party.I quit after  years as a member to shine a spotlight on the extremism and racism.But even I was shocked by this new poll showing what Labour members now actually think.Under Corbyn, half say they would be bored, embarrassed or angryasked to sing the National Anthem.Just  per cent are proud of our country’s history. Almost three times as many are ashamed.More than six out of ten want to abolish the monarchy and more of them blame the British Government and our brave army than the IRA and other republican terrorists for the violent troubles in Northern Ireland.Almost half want to abolish our country’s borders and nearly seven out of ten members think it would be ok for trade unions to hold a general strike to remove a Conservative Government.More than half either blame the media or Jeremy Corbyn’s political opponents for the allegations of racism against Jewish people instead of the members responsible or the leadership that has allowed it to happen.Sixty-nine per cent of Labour members now blame Western Governments instead of Terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS for Islamist terrorist attacks on the streets of Britain or think they are equally to blame as groups like Al Qaeda or ISIS!You would never have got results like that under previous Labour leaders, but the Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn and the hard left is completely outside Britain’s mainstream political traditions. They can’t be trusted to uphold our country’s values or safeguard the institutions on which our democracy depends.Corbyn’s supporters claim he is ing the party to its socialist roots, but it’s just not true.Clement Attlee’s great post-war government established the NHS and the Welfare State, but he was a proud British patriot who set up NATO, insisted on Britain having nuclear weapons and booted communists out of the party.There are still decent people in the Labour Party, fighting for common-sense, but good MPs have been targeted, smeared or driven out and all sorts of people from the fringes of politics have joined to support Jeremy Corbyn.All this explains why we are setting up Mainstream, a new campaign - led by a group of people from dferent political backgrounds – to encourage ato respectable and responsible politics, and to banish extremism from British politics once and for all.To lead Britain, you must love this country, but Jeremy Corbyn is the opposite of a patriot. He could not be trusted with our national security or to defend our country. At every available opportunity, he has backed Britain’s enemies, whether that’s the IRA at the height of the Troubles or groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.No previous Labour leadership would have supported dictatorships in Cuba or Venezuela or have sided with the Russian dictator’s line on Ukraine or when his killers used chemical weapons to bring death to Salisbury. The hard-left think that wealth is the problem and the people who create it the enemy. A government led by Jeremy Corbyn would see John McDonnell in the Treasury, but our economy has never before been run by someone who says he wants to overthrow capitalism or says Marx, Lenin and Trotsky are his most signicant influences.Jeremy Corbyn surrounds himself and works with people from the far-left fringes of politics and they could not be trusted to respect and uphold the independence of our civil service, the impartiality and fairness of our broadcasters or the freedom of the press.It is a disgrace that he and the people around him have allowed a party with a fine tradition of fighting for fairness and equality to be poisoned by racism against Jewish people.Under Corbyn, mainstream ideas are being replaced by views that are wildly out of step with the views of the general public. Extremism is rearing its way back into the public discourse in a way that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.We encourage everyone who wants to support our country’s mainstream values in political and public le to join us. The left-wing grassroots body — set up just weeks after Corbyn won his  leadership contest — now has , members. It was based on the Syriza movement in Greece and Podemos in Spain, both of which  also fought against austerity measures.Cambridge graduate Lansman, , tried to run the party machine last year by mounting a failed bid to replace  out- going Iain McNicol as general secretary. But he does sit on the party’s ruling executive.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So it was unthinkable for them to be promoted in their workplaces.”The women were repeatedly rejected by potential sponsors, who thought it was inappropriate for women to leave their children at home with their husbands and head off on such a dangerous expedition.The group managed to secure some last-minute funds from Japans biggest newspaper, Yomiuri Shimbun and also from television network, Nippon but each member also made a huge personal contribution - equivalent to Japans average yearly salary.The female mountaineers also prepared their own equipment, due to the lack of expenses available to women climbers.At the same time as they trained for the mammoth expedition, the women also sewed their own sleeping bags, recycled old car-parts into mountaineering kit and collected food donations.At , metres up the mountain, the group suffered a devastating blow when an avalanche buried them and their kit - with Tabei being knocked unconscious beneath the snow for a full six minutes. However the group persevered, and Tabei was the first woman to reach the top - receiving worldwide recognition for the huge achievement.In the years following, she also became the first woman to scale the Seven Summits and focused her efforts later in le into advancing the role of women in Japanese Society.Tabei died in ."},{"url":null,"title":"creepy man kiss girl toddler bed bransholme","story":"Katie Genter, , was taking toddler Peighton to her nursery school in Bransholme, Kingston upon Hull, when the elderly stranger approached them.Katie’s mum Samantha told Hull Live that the man allegedly told the child “give me a kiss” and “Id love to take her to bed.”According to Samantha, Katie started screaming and told the man to get away from her daughter – before the stranger’s female friend ushered him away.Incredibly, local cops have told the distraught mother that the disturbing incident was NOT a crime.Humberside Police say they treat cases of this nature “incredibly seriously” but that no offence took place, reports Hull Live .Grandmother Samantha said: My daughter Katie was walking with her two-year-old daughter Peighton to nursery school near her home on Monday lunchtime when she was accosted by a man.My daughter Katie shouted at the man to get off her.“He laughed and said he would love to take the baby to bed.

sacked 28 years","story":"Robert Lockyer, who was based at the Ashford Delivery Office in Kent, had been tasked with dropping off a parcel to a high street bank by pm.The veteran postie says he arrived at the branch at .pm, but that is was .pm by the time the parcel was signed for because he had to wait in the queue with regular customers.Items under special delivery, of which Mr Lockyer successfully delivered around , over the course of his career, are guaranteed to arrive between am and pm the following day.A disciplinary meeting in October  saw Lockyer accused of gross misconduct over the incident, which had occurred the previous month, Kent Live reported.John Peter, delivery officer manager at Mr Lockyers branch, accused him of continual failure to follow correct procedures.Lockyer appealed the decision, but it was upheld at an employment tribunal in July.The tribunal heard Mr Lockyers performance at work had not been entirely satisfactory and that it was clear from the evidence that the claimant was a challenging employee.Independent casework manager Sue Knight-Smith said: To suggest the dismissal was for being one minute late was not a true reflection of what actually happened.She said Mr Lockyer was aware of bank protocols but chose to ignore the noon PDA alert and left the delivery until the last moment.The case dismissed after Mr Lockyer withdrew claims for unpaid wages and redundancy pay.The tribunal heard that Lockyer had been given a serious warning in May of last year after failing to secure his vehicle.Three months later, he received a dismissal penalty, suspended for  months, for failing to obtain a signature for a delivery.At the time of the second incident, he was told going forward any breach of standards will lead to your dismissal”.Mr Peter said that a late delivery would usually result in a penalty valid for one or two years, but that Mr Lockyers dismissal was justied because of his record.After the hearing, Mr Lockyer said in a statement he was “bitterly upset” at the “harsh” treatment he had received.“I can’t believe what has happened to me – all I wanted to do was to do my job, he said.“I really hope the union can make this right.I just want to get back to work.”Mark Baulch, outdoor secretary of the Communication Workers Union, said Mr Lockyers case was probably one of the most outrageous dismissals by Royal Mail and Tribunal verdict I’ve ever heard about.“Make no mistake, this union is appealing this decision legally and, in the meantime, we’ll also be taking up this case with the company at the highest possible level, he said.The delay is obviously due to the unusual procedure of the bank itself in telling our member to queue alongside the other bank customers.“How on earth our member could be considered to be at fault here is completely beyond me – this is why the culture within the workplace must change, once and for all."},{"url":null,"title":"man sacked premier inn losing bus pass journey","story":"Ashely Saint, , was dismissed after failing to make the .-mile trip from his home to a West Bromwich branch of the hotel giant for three shts last month.The former housekeeper, who is on universal credit, has hit out at his former employer, saying he had been unable to afford a new bus fare.“My we, Rosie, usually buys a monthly bus pass for me just so I can make it to work – it even takes priority over food and bills,” he told BirminghamLive.He said problems first arose when he went into town on Friday August  - ahead of a sht that Sunday - and accidentally left his pass on the bus.When I found out I lost my pass I rang the station to find outanyone had handed it in but it was closed over the weekend, he said.I literally couldn’t afford a ticket and I was waiting for my pass to arrive.”Mr Saint said he missed three days of work before his pass was ed to him on Tuesday August , but did not contact his work because he was not due in again until the following Friday.On arriving for that sht, he was asked to attend a one-on-one meeting with the hotels head of staff and two further disciplinary hearings, and was subsequently fired.A spokesperson for Premier Inn said: It is inappropriate to comment on inidual cases.In general terms, any decision taken in the course of employment is never taken lightly and made only after following the relevant process.But a letter written by Premier Inn management and published by BirminghamLive highlighted inconsistencies in Mr Saints version of events, and said it was a coincidence that Mr Saint had earlier requested holiday for the days he missed.Ashley did have a letter from the bus station when they sent his bus pass back to him, it reads.I do believe he had left it on the bus.But it goes on: When it came to making other arrangement to get to work, his actions and behaviours show that there was a lack of effort made.There was a clear display that he seemed to be ok with not going into work and having time off, that also coincidentally, coincided with his holiday he had requested that had been declined.This I do believe was a coincidence.It adds: [Ashely] did not report his absence accurately or fully when he contacted his place of work.He has conflicting recollections of what happened, there does not seem to be a clear line of events.When management tried to contact him he was unreachable due to the fact he had changed his mobile number and not informed his manager. The letter concludes that Ashley had been heard saying he intended to hand in his resignation, had had previous issues with attendance, and had displayed a negative attitude to his work and managers.Mr Saint has said he is appealing against the decision to sack him."},{"url":null,"title":"iran rouhani

And while I had read their stories in the Mirror for years, it was only when I talked to them that I truly realised the pain they had been through, especially when their children and grandchildren began to suffer health problems. Like all veterans, they were proud to serve, but for them, it comes with a sense of dismay that successive governments have let them down so badly in response, denying them the compensation they deserve. I want the next Labour government to be dferent. Because it is not just our role as a party to fight against the injustices we see today, but also to correct the injustices of the past. And justice for these veterans cannot wait a second longer. We don’t need science to tell us what is right under our nose.    Both the US and France have given large lump-sum payments to some of their own nuclear test veterans to help them and their families. But I have agreed with Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn, our Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell and our Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Grfith that the next Labour government will go further. We will give a £, lump sum payment to every surviving test veteran to give them security and comfort in their old age. And once we’re in government, we will also review war pensions to ensure the widows of servicemen who died as a result of their exposure to radiation are also supported as they should be. Let me thank Susie Bonace, the Daily Mirror and its readers for fighting so hard and for so long to win justice for those brave servicemen. Hopefully, we are one big step closer today.

But he insisted that - despite Boris Johnsonaposs claims - Brussels will be in no way responsiblethat happens after October . Mr Juncker told Sky Newsapos Sophy Ridge on Sunday: We have to make sure that there will be no hard and physical border between the two parts of the Irish island and things have to be done on a level playing field. If these three objectives are met by the alternative arrangements, then we donapost need the backstop. The backstop was never an instrument having been put in place for whatever will happen.    No, it was put in place in order to preserve the rights of the internal market and of the island of Ireland.But in the event of a no-deal Brexit , Mr Juncker said there would have to be checks.He added: Iaposm not an architect of new border stations. The British have to tell us exactly the architectural nature of this border. I donapost like a border because after the Good Friday Agreement, and this Good Friday Agreement has to be respected in all its parts, the situation in Ireland has improved. We should not play with this. He said: We have to make sure that the interests of the European Union and of the internal market will be preserved. An animal entering Northern Ireland without border control can enter without any kind of control the European Union via the southern part of the Irish island. This will not happen. We have to preserve the health and the safety of our citizens.  He said the EU is in no way responsible for any kind of consequences entailed by the Brexit as thataposs a British decision. He suggested that some MPs are forgetting about the history of Northern Ireland and Ireland. Mr Junckeraposs meeting with Mr Johnson in Luxembourg on September  came just hours before the countryaposs prime minister Xavier Bettel criticised the Tory leader and left an empty podium for him at a press conference. The European Commission president said: I donapost knowthis is helpful. I rather consider that this was not very helpful but itaposs his decision. Mr Juncker also criticised former UK prime minister David Cameron over the build-up to the  Brexit referendum, claiming he failed to explain the agreement reached with Brussels. We agreed the deal back in , I think, between David and ourselves but this deal was never explained to the British public. Never.

I was five and my mum, Can, told me and my brother Tam we were going on holiday, but as she hugged us goodbye, she began to sob so much her whole body was shaking. I gripped my little brother’s hand as I watched the tiny village grow smaller in the rear view window. Like many Vietnamese children, we were adopted by an Australian family. It was a scary, lonely and confusing time, and I missed my birth family horribly. ‘When am I going home ’ I’d ask again and again in Vietnamese, but no one would answer me because they didn’t understand. I’d ask after my birth mother so often that my new parents told me she had died. I cried myself to sleep every night until I was eight or nine. My adoptive family were dysal and home le was tough. At , my adoptive mother died.    After that, I was going through my adoptive father’s filing cabinet and I found an old letter, with a Vietnamese postmark. I felt elated as I realised it was from my birth mum. Straight away, I wrote a long letter to the address she had given, explaining who I was and askingCan was alive. Soon after, I got a simple fax back, saying, ‘Mother still alive, very happy to hear from you.’ My heart soared as I read her words. For the next few years, I exchanged letters with her and was thrilled to finally have contact with her. But as time went on, the correspondence became overwhelming and she started to demand money. At only , it was far too much for me to take in and I stopped responding, tearing up the letters and trying to move on with my le.    It wasn’t until many years later that I felt ready to try contact again. It was , I was  and hadn’t seen my birth family for nearly  years. But I booked a flight to Vietnam and resolved to meet my mother. I tracked down a family friend in my home city, Can Tho. Within  minutes, my mum was on her way over, and I waited nervously for her arrival. I recognised her face immediately as she bounded towards me, sobbing. Bawling her eyes out, she looked just like she did when I left. I held her tight. ‘You came back,’ she kept repeating. Taking me to see the rest of my relatives in Phong Dien, the entire village turned up to welcome me home. Seeing their faces, fragmented memories of my early childhood in Vietnam came flooding back and I realised I couldn’t leave again.  I moved to Vietnam permanently, buying a house and inviting Can to live with me. I got to know the family members I’d left behind, and was even financially supporting many of them. I never questioned that this was my family. I had no reason to ever doubt it. I adopted my two beautul boys, Daniel and Sam in , but the cracks started to show. Mum began hassling me over money and when she became strangely jealous of my sons. So after four years of living with me, Mum moved out and we put some distance between us. Our relationship deteriorated until we no longer spoke. Fourteen years after myto Vietnam, I was working out at my local gym when my phone began to ring on repeat. I put my phone on silent and carried on, until I received a strange message: ‘Ho Thi Ich is your real mother’. As soon as I got home, my phone started to ring again. I knew something wasn’t right, so I handed it over to my cousin. When my cousin hung up, she was in shock and just said, ‘You’re not my cousin… and Can’s not your mum.’  My head was spinning – it didn’t make sense. I rang my aunt right away and bombarded her with questions, asking hershe ever saw Can pregnant with me. When my aunt said no, my cousin called Can and coaxed a confession, telling her I was going to do a DNA test. Finally, Can confessed. Forty-eight years earlier, she had taken me from my real birth parents. She was a friend of my real mother, Ho Thi Ich, who had fallen gravely ill during childbirth. Ho Thi Ich, a widow with two other children, had nearly died. Offering to help, Can had nursed me. But when Ho Thi Ich recovered and asked after her child, no one could tell her where she’d gone. Can had run away with me. I cried for three days — not because she wasn’t my mother, but because of the lies and deception. My entire world came crashing down. Everything I thought I knew was a lie. For the past  years, this woman had deceived me, and I was desperate to meet my real mum.

With children of a similar age, they would share their problems over dinner and celebrate special occasions together. So when Diane’s -year-old son Robert dropped out of uni, Nina was concerned too. She had known Robert since he was  and believed him to be a hard worker, as he was always taking on part-time jobs as a teen. By this time, Nina was running her own successful estate agency with  employees. She had worked hard to build up her business from scratch, and it was booming. ‘Robert was clever and reliable, so I offered him a job as a trainee letting agent,’ says Nina. ‘Diane was thrilled and Robert was so grateful – I even bought him a smart new suit, so he’d look the part.’ Nina took Robert under her wing and trained him up herself.    Robert called Nina his ‘second mum’, and he was also close to her husband Rob, regularly going on bike rides together at the weekend. Within a few years, Nina promoted Robert to lettings manager. Nina trusted him implicitly: he would be responsible for collecting money from renters and landlords, and delivering large sums of money to the bank. ‘I was proud of Robert for turning his le around,’ says Nina. ‘He had a great rapport with clients and was savvy with money, saving up for fancy holidays. aposHe also liked to go to betting shops and the races with his dad, but it wasn’t my place to judge how he spent his wages.’ But gradually Nina began to notice strange discrepancies in the company’s accounts. Although her agency was doing well and taking on new clients, profits stayed the same.    Her confused accountants investigated, but couldn’t find the cause and assured Nina that everything was in order. During this time, Robert got engaged to his pregnant girlfriend Rachael and began planning a huge wedding. He also bought two houses. Robert was living a comfortable le, regularly receiving packages at work as he bought the latest gadgets. Then, in , Nina was given devastating news: HM Revenue  Customs told her she owed £, in taxes. Nina was horried – she had never been in debt in her le, and none of her clients or landlords were missing any money. Her accountants had repeatedly looked into the company’s finances, but everything seemed to be in order. Nina asked her trusted employee Robert, who said it must be a mistake. Nina was given just three months to pay the bill. Terried of damaging her company’s reputation and risking her employees’ jobs, she quickly scrabbled the money together by remortgaging some properties she had invested in and dipping into her pension.  Desperate to get to the bottom of where the money was going, Nina hired an expensive firm of forensic accountants to investigate, a process that would take months as they went over the books with a fine-tooth comb. Meanwhile, Robert got married in a decadent country house hotel, and of course Nina and Robert were there to support the man they treated like a second son. It wasn’t until August , a year after HMRC had saddled her with the bill, that her forensic accountants finally got to the bottom of where the money had been going. Robert had been manipulating the system to swindle cash from Nina for years. Robert had been skimming a percentage from the rental and management fees and pocketing the cash. At first, Nina refused to believe it, telling the accountants that Robert was like family. She took Robert aside again for a private chat, but he denied any knowledge of where the missing money could be. Desperate for the truth, Nina and her husband Rob spent days going through CCTV footage from the office. They made an awful discovery, watching in horror as they saw Robert at his desk with huge wads of cash he had collected from tenants. He picked up a bundle of cash, kissed it, stuffed it into his bag and walked out of the office. Nina’s whole world fell apart.  ‘I couldn’t escape the image of him kissing the money and piling it into his suit pocket,’ she says. ‘The suit I lovingly bought him, enabling him to be smart and professional when representing my business. ‘I couldn’t forget the sight of him putting white envelopes full of my money into his lunch bag, and swinging the bag around when he was leaving for the day, knowing it was full of stolen cash.’ Nina and Rob realised what had been happening: Robert had been collecting rent from the tenants and giving them receipts, then paying the landlords the rent they were owed. But he hadn’t been taking all the money he collected to the bank, instead keeping a percentage to fund his opulent lestyle. It was a huge blow. ‘I grew my business from the little savings I had,’ Nina says. ‘I sacriced spending quality time with our four children, my elderly mother and family for holidays and days off, as I worked every hour possible.’ Immediately, Nina called a disciplinary meeting with Robert and confronted him.  Nina sobbed as she showed him the evidence, and he coldly admitted she had inadvertently paid for the wedding and the houses. Robert didn’t apologise or attempt to explain his actions, but instead had the cheek to ask Nina for a reference as she kicked him out. Straight away, Nina and Rob called the police and reported Robert for theft. When Nina told Diane, she broke down in tears and said, ‘It can’t be true.’ In October , police interviewed Robert, but he refused to answer questions. Desperate for justice, Nina and Rob paid £, of their own money to gather more evidence against Robert, hiring more forensic accountants and computer specialists. Investigators uncovered shocking new information: Robert had a serious gambling problem and had squandered £, in one month alone. Seven months later, police interviewed Robert once more, this time armed with evidence from Nina’s team of investigators, which suggested he had stolen more than £,, although Robert only admitted taking £,. ‘The personal betrayal has caused me enormous emotional damage,’ says Nina. ‘This experience has been devastating.

There was no point I felt unsafe or at risk, until all of a sudden I was.

I was fighting to keep them open. When we got to my door, I tried to say goodnight and turn away, but he grabbed my wrist and told me to stay and talk longer. I told him I didnapost feel well but he still didnapost let go. I started to panic, and I told him to let go of me and tried to pull my wrist from him. Eventually, he let go and tried to make a joke about me overreacting. I turned and got inside as fast as I could, but I didnapost make it far. I woke up the next morning half undressed, with half of my body on my bed and the other half on the floor. I hadnapost taken my makeup off or put my phone on charge. I hadnapost even turned my bedroom light off.    I felt like I had been hit by a truck. My head hurt worse than any hangover I have ever had. My body ached. It felt so sore and heavy. I felt so confused, so groggy, but worse than that I felt so vulnerable and embarrassed. I wanted to cry, and I didnapost really know what to do, so I got dressed for work and kept thinking: aposJust get on with it.apos The whole day, I couldnapost concentrate or shake it. I felt sick to my stomach and everything. I considered reporting it but, even though I did nothing wrong, I felt so ashamed. I was so worried about what people would think or say about me. I didnapost want to be treated like a victim or called a liar, to have people talking about me. I just wanted to move on. I Googled what to do when youaposve been spiked, and even the NHS advice just says itaposll leave your system in  hours and only says go to AEyouaposre in immediate danger. None of that felt like the right thing, and I didnapost know what  I could do, so I deleted the dating app and I got on with my le. Part of me still feels ashamed. I wasnapost brave enough to report it. I just hope he hasnapost done this to someone . There are no official statistics for drink spiking, and many incidents are believed to go unreported because of embarrassment or memory loss.

The betting company has accepted a flurry of bets in the last week on Kate being pregnant after she made several public appearances. Kate, , was snapped with a new hairdo while taking Princess Charlotte to her first day at school two weeks ago - which led to pregnancy rumours online. She also touched up her hair up seven weeks before she announced she was pregant with Prince George and shortly before revealing she was going to give birth to Princess Charlotte. Body language expert Judi James told Daily Star Online: “Like a lot of women Kate does tend to change her hair when she is pregnant, although not dramatically.    “The new style and colour she emerged with when she took George and Charlotte to school did look like one of her glossiest and most fashionable looks to date. “But then she did say she’d had it done for the school run, and it could have been aimed at giving her an emotional lt as Charlotte left home for school for the first time.” Judi also said that another sign Kate is pregnant is that she was pictured touching her belly during her visit to the school. “Kate did meet a lot of small children and one baby in particular recently and it wasn’t hard to describe her teeth-baring, dimple-creating smile of utter delight as she stroked the baby’s head and chatted to the children as broodiness,” she said. “She also touched her belly, which is a common gesture of protection from women in the early stages of pregnancy. “However this is a gesture that Kate uses a lot, pregnant or not, so tends to be less than reliable as a clue. She did look broody but she appears besotted with youngest child Louis and the baby she met could just have reminded her of him.”    Celebrity stylist Jay Birmingham told Fabulous Digital: “Kate’s new colour has brightened her complexion and the use of lighter pieces throughout the top of her hair and around her face add dimension and give the illusion of thicker hair. The signs have forced Ladbrokes to pull the plug on all bets on Kate having a baby in . Alex Apati of Ladbrokes told the Star: Royal fans reckon Kate is showing early signs of a potential pregnancy. Weaposve welcomed two royal babies into the world in as many years and punters are seemingly confident Kate will make it three in three. “Weaposve taken a flurry of bets across the country in shop over the last week or so following recent royal appearances from the Duchess of Cambridge.

The doctor had suggested she collect a repeat prescription of the tablets there but the pharmacist wouldnapost help her.He wouldnapost even give his reason for refusing to give the emergency supply to me - maybe he did have a good reason but heaposs not got a leg to stand on by not speaking to me, Maggie told Daily Record today.The occupational therapist visited the Boots branch in Edinburgh city centre earlier this month and initially found shop assistants to be very unhelpful.    She said: I went in and explained to the shop assistant,I could speak to the pharmacist about getting this emergency one monthaposs supply. She was really quite tight-lipped and not that accommodating or friendly and said she would ask the pharmacist - she came back and told me, aposHe says no.apos I told her this is what my GP is advising me to do - so she went back to speak to him again then came back and told me, aposNo, sorryapos. The vibe I was getting was that his refusal was specically to do with what I was asking for. That he didnapost want to give it to me. He looked up when I came in then refused to come out and speak to me. Thereaposs a private consulting room and that option wasnapost offered to me.    Maggie went to another two pharmacies, both with female pharmacists who she said would have been happy to provide the medication, but didnapost have any in stock. She was then served in another Boots by a female pharmacist who she said treated her with respect and dignity before prescribing her the emergency supply. Maggie, who works at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, said: I am most concerned this extremely negative experience appears to have been the result of a misogynistic attitude.  I am a strong and independent -year-old inidual with a thick skin and I found this humiliating - I can only imagine how a young or more vulnerable woman would be made to feel in these circumstances. It seemed that he really didnapost have that right to refuse me. Emma Ritch, executive director of Scottish feminist organisation Engender, said: Many people reading this will be shocked to learn that it is still seen as perfectly acceptable for pharmacists to withhold prescribed medication from patients based on their personal moral beliefs. Although guidelines require pharmacists to offer assistance to customers in finding an alternate provider, this clearly didnapost happen in this instance. This is not an isolated incident and it raises huge questions about access to contraception for disabled women, women with caring responsibilities, women in rural areas, women experiencing poverty, and other women who are not easily able to travel to multiple pharmacies to get hold of a prescribed medication.

Doctors swaddled Arlo in bubble wrap after the tot arrived with translucent skin. Mum Emma Hope says she could count her sonaposs ribs through his chest after he was born more than four months early.But the little fighter pulled through and is finally at home with his family, the Daily Star reports.Emma, , said: “I couldn’t believe that someone so tiny could possibly survive. He could literally fit in the palm of my hand but he was a fighter and so I named him Arlo, which means warrior. “I could see through his skin and see the blood going round his little body and count his ribs.” Shopworker Emma was hysterical when her waters broke at  weeks. Doctors warned her to “prepare for the worst” as they believed her son was too premature to survive.  She said: “They kept referring to the baby as a foetus because it was so early in my pregnancy. I told them to stop calling him that as he was my baby – he was my son. “But the medical staff explained that babies aren’t considered viable until  weeks, when it’s possible for them to survive.” Arlo suffered a further blow when the umbilical cord supplying his oxygen moved out of place. Emma was rushed into theatre for an emergency Caesarean and, minutes later, Arlo was taken away to intensive care, wrapped in a plastic bag. Emma said: “It was to keep his temperature stable, and whenever it dropped they wrapped him in bubble wrap to stabilise it. “It looked weird but I would have done anything to keep my little boy alive.”  Things took another turn for the worse when X-rays showed Arlo’s bloated tummy was hiding a severe inflammation. Emma said: “The surgeon came to see us and said that there was a chance Arlo wouldn’t make it through the night. “My legs went from under me. I was so scared I couldn’t talk. I was allowed to kiss Arlo before he was taken for surgery. That kiss was the first time I’d been able to touch him. I just hoped it wasn’t the last.” During surgery to remove % of Arlo’s bowel he lost % of his blood and needed a transfusion. Nurses used Manuka honey to help heal his wound.

The Brits waved European Union, Spanish and British flags and held banners reading Theyaposre trying to make us leave the EU and Take back control: My grandkidsapos future. They are worried they will lose free access to Spanish healthcare, currently assured by the EU, as Britain crashes out of the bloc, possibly without a deal. Protesters hit out at the Conservative Government, with Tamara Essex, a -year-old from Dorset, saying: Spain is doing everything it can to protect us. The UK government has forgotten us. She said Spain had done more for Britons living in the country than the UK Government.    During Sundayaposs demonstration the Brits marched through the streets of Malaga, a port city on southern Spain’s Costa del Sol, to register their concerns about their uncertain status ahead of the October  deadline. Spain is home to around , Britons and is the most popular European retirement destination for UK residents, with around a third of them aged over . Among foreign nationals, they are by far the biggest users of Spainaposs state-funded universal healthcare system.  Together with Portugal, the Iberian peninsula accounts for almost a quarter of all Britons living in Europe, according to the UN. Michael Soffe, a -year-old businessman who has lived in Malaga for  years, said: We feel really forgotten here in Spain. Many here are pensioners - will they lose their healthcare overnight, for example  Acting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who could be replaced following November elections, has sought to reassure Britons living in Spain, promising to protect their rights after Brexit.  Brexit Minister Stephen Barclay visited Spain last week to discuss the exit with Spanish officials and hear from groups representing Britons in Spain. The British Government is in talks with Spain about protecting access to healthcare, he said. A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Unionsaid on Sunday: The Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay held productive discussions with groups representing the British community in Spain while in Madrid last week and made clear that protecting the rights of both UK nationals in the EU and EU citizens in the UK is a key priority for this government.But we cannot protect the rights of UK nationals unilaterally.We have made an unequivocal guarantee to EU citizens now living and working among us that their rights will be protected and that they can continue to live here as they do today. We urge other EU member states to do the same for UK nationals living in their countries and give them the certainty they need by matching our generous offer. The protest in Malaga was held as European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Brussels will insist on border checksthere is a no-deal Brexit in order to preserve the interests of the EU. In an interview with Sky Newsapos Sophy Ridge, he insisted that Brussels was in no way responsible for the consequences of a no-deal Brexit, saying the blame would lay squarely with the UK. But he said we can have a deal, and Boris Johnsonaposs proposals for dealing with the problems Brexit will create at the border with Ireland were the basis for progress.

Palace sources said Harry and Meghan want to “hit the ground running”. They will focus on key issues of their global charity work including the environment, conservation, education and women’s rights.    Harry will travel alone to Botswana on Wednesday and visit a project run there by his charity Sentebale on Thursday. He will then make a “poignant” trip to Angola surveying vital work by the Halo Trust, which was supported by his mother Princess Diana. In Malawi, he will pay tribute to a British soldier killed by an elephant during anti-poaching operations. The Duchess will stay in Cape Town with Archie and take on several engagements including meeting female entrepreneurs working in technology. The family will be reunited in Johannesburg next week and fly home.    Courtiers hope the trip will be a success and go some way to replacing the goodwill that has been questioned in recent months following a barrage of controversies. Eco warriors Harry and Meghan have been heavily criticised for preaching about saving the planet while flying on gas-guzzling private jets for several holidays and excursions. They took four private jets in just  days while speaking about the dangers of climate change, leading to charges of hypocrisy. One senior palace source said: “This tour will see the Duke and Duchess go back to basics, using their profile in the right way to highlight causes they are both passionate about.” Harry will travel to Angola on Friday to survey vital work being done in the region by the Halo Trust and visit an orthopaedic hospital which is to be named in her honour after a massive upgrade. Photographs of the late Princess visiting a de-mining site and meeting mine victims became iconic and powerful images in support of her campaign to create a global mine ban – which came to fruition in the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention that same year.    The Huambo Orthopaedic Centre, visited by Diana in , aims to become Angola’s national centre of excellence in orthopaedic care. A senior Palace source said: “This is all about wanting to fulfil his mother’s legacy.” Harry, , will also visit a working de-mining field outside the southern city of Dirico. He will remotely detonate a mine and meet members of the community and make a speech about the importance of continuing de-mining. A palace spokesperson described the Angola trip as a “signicant and poignant” journey as the Duke pays homage to the anti-landmine work of his mother Diana, Princess of Wales.

Between them, his parents Ed Stafford and Laura Bingham hold the Guinness World Record for being the first to walk theof the Amazon River, in  shattering days, and have completed the world’s first descent of the Essequibo River in Guyana, South America.And he’s named after the great Sir Ranulph Fiennes , for whom death-defying expeditions are just another day at the office.So it’s perhaps no surprise two year-old Ran’s explorer parents are starting him on the road to adventure early.Earlier this year they took on the perilous task of going completely off-grid with their baby, on an uninhabited island for a month.   Surviving a holiday with a toddler is an achievement in any family, but this first big trip really was packed with risk. Yet, while they may face criticism for stranding themselves on a desert island as part of a TV survival experiment, the couple believe there’s just as much danger at home in the UK. Ed, , says: “Having Ran with us meant that I never relaxed and was bloody exhausted because we were constantly keeping an eye on a child. “I’m used to putting my own comfort aside for these programmes but I wasn’t prepared for Ran to be uncomfortable or crying. “I didn’t know how we were going to do it at first and make sure Ran didn’t do anything really really dangerous. I had this vision of making Ran a harness out of vines and I even read about a Japanese tribe where, when women are working, they bury their kids up to the neck in soil.  “But you quickly realise that it was as simple as being more present and aware. Yes, you might be getting on with other stuff but you need to always be watching your child. “Ran got a lot of mum and dad time, so he thrived with that. He also didn’t know to be scared or that he was part of an experiment. “There was one point where we were walking along the beach and it was getting a bit dark and Laura and I were worried because we weren’t back at camp. But Ran was just on my shoulders singing and completely oblivious to the potential dangers. “There are always dangerous things that could happen but you mitigate the risks as much as possible. You know,you’re really unlucky you could just as much come a cropper in Chiswick.” And with the terrying rise in kne crime, Laura adds: “You could get stabbed in the park.”    Ed and Laura decided to take part in the Discovery TV show, Man Woman Child Wild to challenge the ways that they were living and how they were parenting their young son. Laura, , says: “We wanted to inspire families to take more risks with their children, get out of their comfort zone and expose them to more things. We were at an indoor play centre recently and some of the kids got stuck on some tiny ladders because they were too scared to go up or down, but Ran was going head first down a big slide.” Ed adds: “When we had Ran everyone was saying you need to have this buggy and this type of dummy and this type of formula and you have to ask - does it really need to be this complicated  Surely there is a more natural and wholesome way of bringing a child into this world, where they don’t have access to screens and stuff like that. For the challenge, the family travelled to the remote Merak island in Indonesia. They packed just a few knives, bananas and the clothes on their backs. It meant finding a safe area of land to build a house, fishing for food and making sure they had a steady stream of fresh water flowing into their camp - all while looking after a -month-old child.    They were completely alone and filmed the full series themselves. And things got off to a rocky start - with arguments, a tropical storm and Laura falling ill from drinking unclean water. Laura says: “We had a huge tf before we left and I thought that the trip was going to go awfully and we’d disagree on everything. “We had another small argument on day one, when Ed criticised my filming. It was quite funny because I went to storm off and literally got ft away and realised that I couldn’t go anywhere. So we came back together, sat on a rock and figured it out. “We realised that arguments weren’t a luxury that we could afford. At home you can have an argument and go off in dferent directions and be moody and not talk for the rest of the day. But on the island, you have a child, you’ve got to stay safe and find food and shelter. We couldn’t allow ourselves the luxury of going off in a huff.”And even the weather seemed conspire against them.Ed says: “We’d been warned a couple of days before the trip that storms had hit the island and I was told to make sure that I built a shelter very quickly. We had a rudimentary shelter but it didn’t have any walls or anything so we were being buffeted by the storm - it was pretty hairy.”    And Laura explains: “I knew it was going to be an uncomfortable night, curled up in a little square where the rain couldn’t hit us. I thought, ‘is this what this whole experience is going to be ’” But soon they settled into a happy routine on the island - and found there were huge benefits to there being no access to modern technology. Ed says: “Ran massively progressed from not being in front of screens. There’s a demeanour that he has after coming off a screen,” Ed says. “He’s a little bit restless and a little bit dficult. Whereas on the island the only way we had to distract him was by digging a hole in the sand and putting hermit crabs in there for him to play with. “But when he came away from that he was engaged and bright and happy.” And Ed and Laura say that they are now hyper-aware about how screen time and social media could affect their son in the future. Ed says: “We are more aware that screen time is something that needs to be managed.There’s been Facebook suicides and things like that and it’s not to be underestimated."},{"url":null,"title":"student earns 40000 year social","story":"NewsStudent earns £, a year as social media influencer posting between classesTia Christofi, of Melbourne, Australia, has over , followers on Instagram and more than , subscribers on YouTubeShareCommentsByNiamh CavanaghBrendan McFadden:,  SEP NewsTia has been signed by several sports apparel brands \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

With only Mark Reynolds a stick-on starter, there are big decisions to be made over the fitness of new boy Troy Brown or whether to opt for Paul Watson or midfielder Calum Butcher against the Red Lichties.Going for the latter in central defence would likely see Ian Harkes come into the midfield.And the American’s inclusion would be a welcome one, in my opinion.His impact in the derby win over Dundee was clear, not only with his goal but overall play.Up top, Louis Appere has impressed but when Nicky Clark came on at Ayr he looked lively and is a proven scorer at this level.Much to ponder as United look to remove the spoke from their wheel and get back on the title charge."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d84ef8db47184.83854957-770x564.jpg ","title":"jamie ness touch and go for dee clash in greenock","story":"Dundee are sweating over the fitness of Jamie Ness ahead of today’s trip to face Morton.The experienced midfielder is “touch and go” according to Dark Blues boss James McPake for the Championship clash at Cappielow.The -year-old former Rangers and Stoke City man picked up an ankle injury against Cove Rangers in the Betfred Cup before exacerbating that issue against Elgin City in the Challenge Cup a fortnight ago.And gaffer James admits it is still a niggling problem for Ness.“Jamie Ness is still touch and go.

There’s also a fair range of vegan options.Five girls choosing food can take a little bit of time, but we did quite well and quickly decided to skip the starters and focus on the main courses.Our order was for a frankfurt calzone , chorizo and meatball tagliatelle , beef lasagna £., a Giddy Goose house burger , a pulled ham hock panzerottiand a portion of fries for the table . Nope, I’d no idea what a panzerotti was either, but the menu said it was a deep fried calzone style pizza and “ you fancy something new then be sure to pick one”. Being an obedient girl, that’s just what I did.I was delighted that when I asked that they hold off a little on the brieas it’s not my favourite cheese, I was offered to change the cheese to something . I chose mozzarella. A nice touch. vw, px\"  We also sniggered at our burger-ordering friend who asked for just a burger on a roll. Asking for clarity the server said, so no cheese or salad  Oh, I’ll have the salad, she said . . . and some coleslaw. So basically her “just plain burger”, which she asked to be well done, was only missing the cheese – I think there’s an easier way to ask!We ordered some drinks and a bottle of wine and some water for the table and sat back to wait.There is what looked like a nice seating area outside, though inside it’s almost like a garden, too, with lots of wooden trellis- type structures with green leafy plants and nice lights dotted about the place. vw, px\"  Beside the bar there’s a partially enclosed area they called Bohemian that looked like it would be a good spot to bookyou were a larger party. There’s also a room along from the bar and a downstairs area that had a privateon when we were in.Seats are a mixture of leather and cloth, with attractive bright cushions. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere.We didn’t seem to wait very long for our food as we were busy chatting, though our server apologised that there had been a delay when he brought the plates over.All the dishes were well presented.The meatballs looked a little overdone and, when pressed, my friend agreed they were quite dry.We persuaded her to ask for more sauce and the plate was taken away to be replaced by a whole freshly-cooked plate. vw, px\"  More sauce would have sufficed, but it was nice to see the restaurant strive to make things right.The lasagna was a good-sized portion, with clearly defined layers. My friend said it was enjoyable, but she prefers her Italian pasta with a bit more sauce.The oz burger was well done, as requested, and served with fries, salad and relish. It was a big plateful and very tasty.The calzone was served with salad and had a lot of filling – including sweetcorn, so I’d avoid it – but the recipient enjoyed it.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate. We are asking adults to step up alongside us and make this a turning point in our history.#Greta Thunberg was welcomed by the Speaker of the House of Commons, the leader of the Labour Party and the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. She also spoke at the elite gathering of business leaders in Davos and at the UN.In March , school strikes took place in more than , cities around the world.

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-39-s-tales-magic-real-39-s-around-us","story":"Of course, in stories magic is very real a frog or beast can transform into a prince, dragons and witches can fly, animals can talk, wishes can be granted by faeries and spells cast by wizards.

Animals do talk, any dog lover will tell us that.Have you ever seen a hare and made eye contact and felt the connection or watched a squirrel hide nuts, and then come up to you asking for more Walk in a wood, or by a riverbank, or just sit in your garden or a park and the magic is all around you. We watched wood pigeons nest in a small elder tree outside our front window over the summer. Two eggs hatched and we watched as they were fed and finally flew the nest. It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it. And when we donrsquot care about it we donrsquot protect or value it.And when we donrsquot value it, we canrsquot feel the wonder and sense of awe it creates. And so we trash it, ignore and neglect it, exploit it. And we forget we are part of this magic that we are sons and daughters of nature too. And so we disconnect ourselves from what can truly make us feel happy, and instead drug ourselves with the articial magic of our own technology which makes us feel all powerful.But the truth is we are not.Ultimately we rely on the natural environment for our physical and emotional well-being, as much as the creatures we are making extinct.We need nature, it doesnrsquot need us, and eventually it is in control. Asto make this point huge waves hit the rocks of Prestonpans in a storm not so long ago, drenching the nearby houses in a display of naturersquos power. It was scary but also spectacular.In  such a storm was believed to have been the result of magic conjured by the ldquoNorth Berwick Witches.That storm, like the recent one, was indeed magic, conjured by nature, which can whip up a whirlwind more effectively than any wizard or witch.Magic is real.

He was in Scotland mainly to play golf and try whisky, he told me. I was trying to convince him Scotland had many other things to offer and we got onto the issue of Scotlandrsquos landscape. He seemed interested in how our land was used, and he told me that back home he owned a ranch, which included a medium-sized forest of native trees.I remember saying ldquowow, thatrsquos so special, but he shook his head, saying: ldquoSpecial  No, not really, a stupid law means the forest is worthless.I was a bit confused, so I asked him what he meant. ldquoTherersquos a preservation order on it, which means that part of my land is unproductive, he said.I realised at this point that although we were having the same conversation about land, we were having dferent understandings of it.He shook his head sadly and said: ldquoItrsquos just a waste of good timber.That kind of ended our conversation. I didnrsquot try to persuade him to think dferently, I felt that I wasnrsquot in a position to do that since he was a paying customer and my tip could have been at stake.That conversation was nearly  years ago. And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule.

However, the local authority has stressed it is aiming to ldquoenhance parking provision in such a way that the number of available spaces in Haddington is increased beyond current levels and that better use is made of each space.Currently, Haddington town centre is home to more than  spaces.The long-stay car park at Tesco has  spaces, which includes two disabled and car club spaces and four public electric charge spaces.On the opposite side of Court Street, the car park at East Lothian Councilrsquos headquarters, John Muir House, has  spaces.The majority of those ndash  ndash are long stay but the car park is reserved for ldquocouncil-based activities between am and pm throughout the week and is only available to the general public at the weekend and outwith those times.Proposals suggest a revamp of High Street, which has  spaces Market Street, which has  spaces Hardgate, which has four spaces and Court Street, which can accommodate  cars.Meanwhile,  town centre residents have parking permits, which enable them to park in any of the restricted -minute maximum parking areas for any duration.East Lothian Council has not revealed the number of spaces ndash or the site ndash for any proposed car park at Whittingehame Drive, although it has been suggested as having between  and  spaces.Liz McDougall, chairwoman of the Nungate Gala committee, told the Courier that the council had not been in touch about the proposals.She was concerned about the impact it could have on their gala activities.

Wood denounced the councilrsquos decision to block the parades as ldquostupid. This seems harsh, although the immediate backlash does show this cautionary step backfired. As Wood commented in a newspaper article, outright bans simply allow resentment to fester and violence to erupt where.Explosions of sectarian aggression and abuse are an obvious outrage, but even entirely peaceful religious marches through Glasgow are a blot on the cityrsquos reputation. Whenever a Grand Orange Lodge goes past, banging drums, playing flutes and waving banners, I feel I have stepped back three centuries. In theory, Orange marches are harmless and legitimate expressions of faith and historical commemoration. In practice, in the west of the country at least, they are the unlit end of a fuse that doesnrsquot take much to ignite. Everyone knows these are potentially inflammatory occasions, and a marching season that passes without incident is the very definition of a miracle.As is all too evident, sectarian prejudice is alive and well. Those who say it is nearly extinct are either optimists or judge todayrsquos level of confrontation against a much bloodier and more ignorant past. By that measure, certainly, things are considerably better than they were even as recently as when I joined this newspaper when on my first day a new colleague commented on the arrival of yet another Protestant. Anti-discrimination laws have helped promote more enlightened attitudes, but even without this statutory inducement to scrupulous fairness, the majority of us these days make no distinction between Catholic and Protestant,indeed we even notice it at all.:Faith no more  Have catholic schools had their day, asks Kevin McKennaThe country has come a long way since the Church of Scotlandrsquos disgraceful and virulent anti-Catholicism in the s, and the barefaced discrimination and hurtful jibes Catholics of all ranks endured. No wonder separate schools were considered necessary. Yet while levels of abuse and discrimination are dramatically lower than before, in some quarters hoary old grievances and antediluvian attitudes continue to smoulder.You could argue that the answer is education: an ongoing challenging of closed minds that will eventually lead to a state where nobody cares what religion other people follow. It is Tom Woodrsquos contention, however, that in order to eradicate sectarianism we need to abolish Catholic schools. These, he believes, are the root of the problem.With some reluctance, I have to agree their time is up. This, despite knowing that endorsing this view would appear to be rejecting the liberal values that I consider essential for a fair and well-run country. If parents wish to send their children to a school whose principles are guided by the Catholic faith ndash or any other for that matter ndash surely they should be allowed that choice  By all accounts, the education students receive in Catholic schools is impressive, and in some cases so enviable that lapsed members of the church appear to have a Damascene reawakening in order to get their offspring into the classroom.Yet the existence of this archaic system of schooling is tangible evidence of a problem that refuses to wither. From early childhood, separate schools reinforce the idea of dference, segregation and distinction. Whatever side of that school fence you walk, you are made aware from Primary One onwards of the concept of Them and Us.Therersquos another distasteful aspect of segregated schools too. Richard Dawkinsrsquos new book, Outgrowing God, which is aimed at young readers, tries to help ldquobreak the cycle of indoctrination. That word will be offensive to those who think they are doing their best by their children in instructing them in their own religious beliefs and culture, be they Catholic, Protestant, Muslim or Jew. But, even when done with the best intentions, sending a child to a school affiliated to a church is a form of intellectual and emotional programming. It represents the opposite of liberal values.:Catholic schools are rated higher by inspectorsFor as long as it is possible to put a child through a denominational education, society is tacitly acknowledging the power of religion to define who people are. In an age when the state is increasingly non-religious in its decision-making, in order to maintain strict neutrality and equality, it makes no sense. When single-sex institutions are frowned upon as out-dated, when discrimination based on ethnicity, background or sexual orientation is considered abhorrent, it seems odd that this particular expression of dference is allowed to continue. Onlysectarianism were unheard of, rather than a persistent blight, would it ndash just about ndash be acceptable.Back in the real world, the existence of educational pigeon-holes like these means there is little hope of religious bigotry being eradicated. Those on either side of the school gates live in an environment that allows this shameful stain on our country to persist, and even flourish. Initiatives to raise awareness or to banish deep-rooted prejudices can never be wholly successful so long as the public statement of religious identity is allowed such a state-sanctioned .This is not to attack faith itself. What iniduals choose to believe, and the ways in which they introduce children to their religion or creed at home, is their business.

It comes against new legislation requiring planning authorities to ensure decent play areas and improved access to play facilities is encouraged in new developments.Among the councils taking steps to rethink the signage is North Lanarkshire, birthplace to illustrious football talents such as Sir Matt Busby, Jock Stein, Davie Cooper and Jock lsquoTigerrsquo Shaw, who grew up honing their skills in the streets around their homes.The council has now published a survey asking residents for their views on the proposal to withdraw all lsquono ball gamesrsquo signs from communities across the district unless there are an obvious health and safety reasons for them to be retained.The signs are set to be removed from areas other than car parks and roads by next May.A North Lanarkshire Council spokesperson said: ldquoThe council encourages children and young people to be active and have a healthy lestyle, and the proposal to remove these signs opens up more opportunities for children to play outdoors in their neighbourhoods.The move to rip down the signs is being seen as a step back to times when children were actively encouraged to play in the streets around their home, with hopes it can raise exercise levels, help in the battle against childhood obesity and improve young peoplersquos ball skills.Countless lsquono ball gamesrsquo signs cropped up in housing estates across the country in the s mainly in response to rising numbers of households becoming car owners.Rather than protecting children from vehicles, the signs were mainly devised to prevent the damage a stray football, cricket or tennis ball could cause to a windscreen.Although not legally enforceable, they acted as a deterrent to children and their parents, driving them indoors just as childrenrsquos television and electronic games became more accessible.Tam Fry of the National Obesity Forum welcomed the move to rethink the signs and called for a societal sht in how childrenrsquos outdoor play is perceived.ldquoIn some cases, itrsquos concern over the noise children make when they play that has been the triggering factor for these signs cropping up. Thatrsquos le, we have to live with children laughing, shouting.ldquoIt might be a bit of a disturbance, however, itrsquos important that they have space which allows them to have unstructured play.ldquoIf thatrsquos impossible then there must be safe routes and paths to spaces which can offer these facilities.ldquoBy not providing those, you are storing up problems for the future. Children go home, sit in bedrooms playing their video games and donrsquot get the exercise they need. A lot of people are very intolerant, he added. ldquoA societal change has to take place.Aberdeen City Council became the first city authority in Scotland to remove the killjoy signs four years ago.Former Scotland striker Denis Law took up the councilrsquos offer to begin the process, and said at the time: ldquoYou need to get young people out playing ndash the streets were where we learned our trade.ldquoOne post was a lamppost, the other was a drainpipe or a jacket. There were no signs up to say no ball games.It was hoped that more councils would follow but in many cases, the signs have remained in place.Marguerite Hunter Blair, CEO of Play Scotland, said planning legislation introduced in July has sparked new play strategies and a sht towards removing obstacles to childrenrsquos playtime.ldquoTherersquos a recognition that therersquos no legal backing to these signs, however, they create a culture of children not being allowed to play or be visible in public and contribute to this culture of sedentary behaviour.ldquoParents donrsquot want their children to get into trouble, so they donrsquot encourage them to play ball games.ldquoWhile we do have to recognise that in some places the signs may be appropriate, in others, they are unnecessary and go against a lot of what councils are attempting to do to promote outdoor health and wellbeing.ldquoMore positive signage to encourage play is needed, or no signage at all.The PlanningAct  includes a section requiring councils to produce a sufficiency of play audit in planning reports to ensure there is adequate access to play opportunities.However, itrsquos thought changes to housing stock ownership and decades of lsquono ball gamesrsquo signs being in place has meant many councils have lost track of where the lsquono ball gamesrsquo signs might be.A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said: ldquoFortunately we have relatively few lsquono ball gamersquo signs and, where we do, these tend to be formal places such as by the Kibble Palace Glasshouse in the Botanic Gardens.ldquoOur city should feel welcoming to everyone, including children, and not discourage healthy outdoor play. We want to take a common-sense approach and regularly facilitate traffic-free Streetplay events for younger people.ldquoIf there are lsquono ball gamesrsquo signs situated where in the city which residents feel are not required, wersquoll consider removing them.City of Edinburgh Council announced in March that it planned to give residents the chance to report any old lsquono ball gamesrsquo signs which are no longer regarded as necessary. A spokesperson said at the time: ldquoWe know that there are a number of no ball gamesrsquo signs that have been up in open spaces for some time.ldquoSome may no longer be required or there may be other options for how the areas are used.Elsewhere, Falkirk Council says signs are under review: ldquoWe do not want to deter children from playing outdoors and have removed a number of these signs from council land in the past, said a spokesperson.ldquoHowever, there may still be some of this historical signage but we do keep this under review.Meanwhile, Fe Councilrsquos spokesperson said: ldquoFes position is that it dfers from community to community and we respond directly to their wishes on this issue.

According to new figures, a fth of shoppers admit to buying items with the intention of wearing and then ing them.The trend for \"wardrobing\" is estimated to cost UK retailers pound.bn annually. Such is its prevalence, online retailer Asos announced earlier this year that it would blacklist \"serial ers\", while the fashion brand Diesel pokes fun in an autumn campaign with the tagline \"enjoy before ing\".Its been suggested that social media is fuelling the practice with people posing for photographs in trendy clothes before sending them back to get a refund.Among those aged  to , a survey found  per cent say they dabble in a sneaky wear-and-. Interestingly, wardrobing decreases with age:  per cent of  to -year-olds polled admitted doing it, compared with six per cent of people aged over .To be honest, wardrobing sounds like a lot of hard work with very little tangible reward.

When we started the strikes,I look back at my first speech, it was all about how we need to wake up the world. No one was talking about climate change. Now what wersquore saying is that the world knows and now we need to act.To me the first step to changing everything is awareness. Itrsquos a really huge thing and powerful. I do feel itrsquos working. Everybody knows that climate change is a thing now, and itrsquos an actual issue that will affect us. Before, it was like, ldquoYeah, I need to turn off the lights to save the polar bears. Now people we leaflet to in the street will say, ldquoYes, I get why you are doing this, eventhey donrsquot agree with it. Thatrsquos probably the biggest indication that itrsquos working.I think itrsquos kids that are doing this because we havenrsquot been swayed by normal society as much. As soon as you get a job and go into normal le you do what you do to get by, whereas wersquore still in a place where we can try things like striking and do as much as we can. We can imagine something dferent and a world that isnrsquot shaped as much.Finlay Pringle, , UllapoolThis is my fortieth climate strike. When I was younger I always had a fascination with the ocean and that was reaffirmed when I went snorkelling with my parents. I realised it was beautul, and this beautul place needed protecting.I felt pretty angry that we as human beings were destroying that incredible place ndash whether it be through plastic pollution or climate change. So I decided, with my sister, that we were going to start climate striking on December . We believe we were the first in the UK. Back then there was no Extinction Rebellion in our area, no Scottish Youth Climate Strikes. So we got in contact with Fridays for Future, the organisation that Greta set up. It grew from there.It angers me that we as human beings have let it get this bad. We were being told back when it was black and white TV that there was such a thing as climate change. What did we do  We just pretended it didnrsquot exist. Itrsquos human nature to leave everything to the very last minute. If we do that with climate change there will be no stopping it.I would like our governments to actually do something. Politicians can say climate emergency, but what does it actually mean  We need radical action. We need net zero by . Wersquove got till  to turn this ship around. If we donrsquot reach that deadline then the world is basically doomed. And I hate to put it like that because Irsquom usually quite optimistic.I find it shocking that people my age donrsquot think that climate change is real. It is the greatest threat that we as humanity have ever faced. I read books, IPCC reports, online articles. Because we know the stuff, we become the teachers and we teach everyone . I feel like we as climate strikers have almost a role to educate. We shouldnrsquot be having to do this. It should be the government. But currently it is us ndash and we can educate people about the climate crisis and about some of the small things they can do.Martine Miller, parent, EdinburghIrsquove become more and more educated recently about climate change and what our future is going to look like. Irsquove got a daughter who is three years old and Irsquom terried about what world shersquos going to inherit ndash and not even in that far off distance. Becoming a parent just really brought it home to me. The young people have really galvanised support for the issue and raised awareness. This is my first climate protest. Irsquove not been on any sort of protest before. Everything wersquove done so far has just been at an inidual level, making small changes at home.Charlotte Muller-Stuart, , PeeblesItrsquos insane how much the strike has progressed. When we first started it was literally just  of us including a few friends from Peebles that I managed to drag up to Edinburgh. Now its tens of thousands. I do think people are starting to listen. I think therersquos not enough panic though. Irsquove found that quite a lot of the time with the politicians, they will secretly tell us, ldquoI shouldnrsquot be saying this but I think itrsquos really good that yoursquore striking. They just think itrsquos good that wersquore getting involved in activism and that wersquore having a political say.Quite a lot of the debate about the strikes is more about the action of us striking rather than what wersquore actually trying to say and the reasons why wersquore striking.There is also still so much that our government can do in Scotland that they arenrsquot doing right now. Things like more peatland restoration.People take it far more seriously when kids go out on strike rather than adults protesting because when adults do it, it comes off as hippyish. Itrsquos not taken as seriously as children sacricing their education and making this statement that says, lsquoWhy should we go to schoolwersquore not going to have a future rsquoI think itrsquos really important not just to educate the youth, but also to educate the adults. People know about climate change but they donrsquot know the scale of the problem. I think so many adults are in denial about it. I think they donrsquot want to acknowledge it. Also there are quite a lot of adults that donrsquot know about it as well. In March I asked five teachersany of them had heard of the IPCC report and all of them said that they hadnrsquot.Mike Shepherd, retired petroleum geologist and author of Oil Strike North SeaOur city streets echo with youngsters campaigning for action on climate change youngsters who care passionately about the future of our planet. The environmental groups that support them insist that Big Oil must be shut down to prevent further global warming. It all seems very worthy, and herersquos my opinion: they are distracting us from the real problem.Donrsquot get me wrong here ndash climate change is all too real and will cause dficulties in the decades to come. My grouse with the protests is that they drown out the discussion that should be taking place instead.The world population of humans are increasingly city dwellers. In the UK almost  per cent of us inhabit the urban landscape. Our food is produced by farmers with their diesel-fuelled tractors the food they harvest is then transported to our shops by diesel-fuelled lorries. Electric tractors and lorries do exist but are not common yet.The climate protestors should note that oil as a fuel must not be phased out until alternative methods of fuelling tractors and lorries are in place and can be shown to cope with the challenge of feeding our huge urban population. Get this one wrong and billions will starve - itrsquos that serious.Step back to  when the world population was . billion. The global economy had been recovering from the recent war, and received a boost when huge oil fields were brought on stream in the Middle East and North Africa. Cheap energy fuelled a humongous increase in human activity lsquothe great accelerationrsquo academics call it.From  to now, humans, particularly in the affluent west, have seen a substantial change to their standard of living.During this time the world avoided major famines, not the least because of the lsquoGreen Revolutionrsquo in the s when wheat and rice yields increased substantially. In consequence, the world population has increased to over . billion today. Thatrsquos an extra five billion people since . Cheap oil is responsible for underpinning this huge population increase. If oil runs out and nothing takes its place, the props fall away . Plan A is thus to replace oil with alternative energy sources as a priority. We have to.Dylan Hamilton, , LinlithgowOne analogy I use to explain why young people are pushing this is the boiled frog. If you put a frog in a pot of water and slowly heat up the temperature the frog will boil and die. Butyou put a frog into already boiling water, it will immediately jump out. So the boiled frog represents the grown up, but the young people are the frog that jumps out. The dference is wersquore tied to the boiled frog andwe all donrsquot act then we all die.Irsquove been striking weekly since February . I met Greta in August in Switzerland. What struck me was that she is a really down to earth person. I was on crutches at the time and she was the only person in the entire room that helped me carry my food.The things Irsquove learned over the past eight months are actually less to do with climate change and more to do with society ndash the little political tricks, how to talk to politicians. I think wersquore having an impact on how politicians think. Every time they make a policy, wersquore in the back of their minds. Nicola Sturgeon declared a climate emergency and the Greens have said wersquove given them momentum to push harder because they can say wersquove got tens of thousands of young people pushing for this as well. Scotland likes to claim that theyrsquore a world leader andthis is threatening their status as a world leader, theyrsquoll try to keep up the the good profile. Not quite enough is being done but itrsquos better than it was.Obviously what I want from these strikes is for us to stop the emissions of greenhouse gases. But more specically what I think they could do is implement a Green New Deal. So we would become a renewable and completely sustainable society ndash because at the moment our system isnrsquot built to be sustainable and renewable. We use the term Just Transition a lot. We would have to have a Just Transition to get jobs in renewables so people wouldnrsquot be out of work. Everything would have to be renewable and not killing the earth.Hilary Brown, marketing manager, EdinburghAlthough I am a politically aware person and have marched many times over the years, it is fair to say that my daughterrsquos concern about climate crisis and her much repeated plea, \"Wersquove just  years to stop climate change before itrsquos too late\" led me to commit to joining the global strike. I should have been working, but made a very last minute decision to walk away from it and support the strike. She and her friends have attended some the Friday climate strikes and I am proud of their commitment to raising the urgency of the climate emergency as a political priority. I also find it demands a personal response from me. Younger people are understandably able to focus on the immediate threat posed by climate emergency and donrsquot hedge their bets in terms of what needs to be done about it. There are so many lsquoah butsrsquo and lsquowhat srsquo that plague any debate for politicians and that stop people from committing to radical change. I have very valid distractions plus a degree of complacency and,Irsquom honest, cynicism about the ability to make change happen. I find that the young climate strikers are bringing clarity to the issue and making me acknowledge the need for urgent and sustained action. I am blown away by Greta Thunberg ndash how well informed she is and the way she articulates the reality of the situation facing the world ndash not in her first language either! I donrsquot really like the generational blame game. Many people my age and older have marched and campaigned all their lives and won many rights. They have made the world a better place for all of us lucky enough to claim those rights. But I do understand the anger young people feel about the future they face. Itrsquos not so much that they are more aware of the issue than their elders. We are all well aware. The dference is their sense of urgency about doing the things needed to tackle it. I find there is less and less excuse for me, as a person with dependents and a whole iety of responsibilities, not to make this as much of a priority as they do."},{"url":null,"title":"39-re-gloomed-cope-times-eco-anxiety","story":"ldquoI was thinking way more about humans rather than nature. Only recently have I been more connected with the environment. Irsquove realised that this is way bigger than just the humans. The fact that nature is being exploited and destroyed right now ndash thatrsquos the bit that stresses me out most.Stress is just one of the feelings she and other young people experience around climate change. Fridayrsquos mass climate strike in the September sunshine, a riot of colour and noise, looked on so many levels like a flowering of positivity. But the words used by the young people out that day do not come from the spectrum of joy.They were, naturally given the scale of the issue, ldquoangry, ldquoterried, ldquoscared, ldquoworried. In the same week, the United Nations Childrenrsquos Fund warned that the biggest emerging threats to children globally, are ldquothe worsening climate crisis, a decline in mental health and online misinformation.What do we do with the fact that this generation, already troubled in terms of mental health, is now having to process chilling facts about the future of our planet and humanityrsquos role  How do those of us who are parents, or adults connected to children, work through this with our youngsters, who are now coming across this information at sometimes a very young age As Caroline Hickman, a psychotherapist working with the University of Bath and the Climate Psychology Alliance, points out, adults too are having many ldquocomplicated feelings around the climate emergency. ldquoBut theyrsquore also thinking, how can I cope with my childrenrsquos feelings  How can I support my grandchildren Sometimes these feelings are described as eco-anxiety, a current buzzword, as Hickman observes, an inadequate descriptor for the full range of emotions around climate crisis.ldquoAnxiety is the gateway in, but then people go through a whole process of emotions ndash depression, despair, frustration, among young people, that adults arenrsquot doing something, and hopelessness, and blaming.Scottish climate-strikers will frequently mention eco-anxiety. One, -year-old Dylan Hamilton, says there are times when he has felt ldquoreally down. ldquoIrsquove never felt like giving up. But I struggle a lot because I also have chronic fatigue, so it makes everything ten times more dficult. I have to constantly keep up and be on top of my learning. That can be really stressful and Irsquove had a few burn outs, but I never stop striking.Dylan first started to question how we were behaving around the environment when he was eight. ldquoI was in the eco committee at school, he recalls, ldquobut I got really fed up because it felt like all we were doing was taking out the bins. I feltit is as serious as yoursquore telling me then we should be doing more than just taking out the bins. That, he says, triggered a mental state of ldquohopelessness for a while.However, he says, striking has helped hugely. ldquoI feel like Irsquom doing enough, which has really helped my mental state. Wersquore actually a really supportive group because we all get each otherrsquos problems and wersquove got loads of people we can turn toit is stressing us out.But these youth activists are not the only young people to have been impacted our current wave of climate crisis stories. All children are. Few can have escaped hearing the news that the earth is warming, the ice caps melting, the polar bears threatened, and plastic is everywhere.In this context how we talk to our children about it becomes crucial. Over the past year, it has become a question for me. How much do I share, as I cover climate related issues, of both the information and my own rollercoaster feelings, with my sons aged  and  Hickman believes that talking is the most important thing we need to do with our children. She recalls how six months ago she interviewed an eight-year-old in a bid to find out how might be best to talk to youngsters. She said to her, ldquoOkay Sophia, I want to talk to you about some scary things ndash climate change ndash but I want to find a way to do that that doesnrsquot terry and overwhelm you. What would you suggest we do Sophiarsquos reply, she says, is something she often quotes. She said: ldquoThe thing is, it is dficult, but you must tell me the truth. Andyou donrsquot tell me the truth yoursquore lying to me ndash and Irsquom not a baby.ldquoI loved the way she put that, says Hickman. ldquoShersquos spot on. We mustnrsquot treat them like theyrsquore babies. They do need to be prepared for the realities of these things. But a parent needs to be able to process their own feelings a little bit to talk to the child. They need to have taken a little bit of time and thought, well how do I feel  How upset am I  Whatrsquos getting in the way of me talking to my child  Irsquove talked to a few children about this and they saidyou donrsquot talk to us, we feel abandoned.In , The Mental Health Foundation published a poll of parents exploring how, in an era of -hour news and social media, they felt their children were responding to larger world events andthey were able to adequately discuss the issues with their children. Around a third of parents said their children were anxious around global warming and climate change.Off the back of their poll, they published some advice, which, they suggest, might be relevant to parents concerned about how they handle their childrenrsquos exposure to climate crisis news. ldquoThe advice that wersquove developed, says Julie Cameron, head of programmes at The Mental Health Foundation Scotland, ldquois that trying to have a news black-out and shield your children isnrsquot helpful. Likewise, of course, neither is extreme over-exposure.Cameron suggests taking time to watch the news with your child, particularly an age-appropriate show like Newsround, and making sure that there is plenty of opportunity for conversation following it. ldquoItrsquos taking the time to explore this with them. Itrsquos okay to acknowledge that this is quite scary and tricky stuff and that none of us have complete control over it. You also need to reassure them that itrsquos okay and in their day-to-day le they are safe. Amongst their advice too is that itrsquos good for adult mental health to get ldquocivically involved. ldquoThis is probably applicable to children too. We say become civically active, become engaged.That activism can be good for mental health is something that Hickman echoes. Itrsquos also a frequent reflection from those young people who are deeply involved in the climate strike. ldquoStriking helps me deal with it, says Muller-Stuart. ldquoItrsquos definitely empowering. Because otherwise you can feel so helpless ndash like yoursquore the only one. You go to a global strike where there are thousands of other people and itrsquos more empowering and it makes you think itrsquos not just you. Therersquos a lot more hope. Another emotion that climate strikers frequently express is anger ndash often at the older generations. As John Thorne, secretary for Climate Psychology Alliance Scotland notes, ldquoIf yoursquore , yoursquove done very little to cause this issue, and yoursquove got a total right to be angry about it and thatrsquos a good thing. Because being angry and upset means we do something.But it would be wrong to paint a picture of a modern world ided into adults who are in denial and young people who are the truth speakers and sufferers of eco anxiety. Itrsquos not quite like that. Many adults in the environmental and other radical movements, or working in renewables, or researching related science, have been trying to address this issue for a very long time. Adults get despair too ndash and grief, and another more hampering emotion, guilt.Another problem, Hickman says, parents find, in dealing with their childrenrsquos climate-related distress, is that there is nothing in their personal histories to relate the current crisis to. ldquoIf your child comes home upset because of bullying, as a parent you can call on your own experience of dealing with those problems. But we havenrsquot got our own history of dealing with this.Of course, all of us will recall some global or national threat from our own childhood: the nuclear threat, HIV Aids. Hickman believes this is not quite the same. ldquoWhat makes this subtly dferent is the fact that wersquore all culpable for this, even through the small decisions we make. There is also a great deal of uncertainty attached to it. It may be man-made, but itrsquos not in our control ndash we donrsquot know when the tipping points will be. That makes us utterly vulnerable and hugely aware of our dependency on our environment.These are things I hear echoed by many young people. They are acutely aware of their own impacts, yet at the same time of their smallness in relation to the problem. ldquoItrsquos so big, says Charlotte Muller-Stuart, ldquoand therersquos so much. Itrsquos also hard to switch off from. You canrsquot really brush it off. Everything that you do, every single day, is somehow affecting the environment in some way.We are lucky, in this country, to be, as yet, relatively little impacted by climate change. This makes it easier to comfort our children, tell them they are currently safe. Thatrsquos not the case for all children. Hickman has also interviewed children in the Males, who are on the frontline of sea-level rises. ldquoThe children there, she observes, ldquoare saying itrsquos happening now.

The spat was about politics and is made worse by considering that theyrsquore all on the same side, at least in party termsAlas, Vinersquos husband is Michael Gove, the Brexiteer. Cameron was a Tory Remainer. Brexit, I guess, has put a strain on many friendships. Scottish indie was another issue that did the same. But is it worth it  Over politics In Goversquos case, you might find a friendship under strainhe did the dirty on you, as he did with Boris Johnson. But thatrsquos not politics as such. Thatrsquos personality or character failure.As for Cameron,any of my friends said, ldquoHi, Irsquove just been out killing animals for fun, like he does, then Irsquod probably vomit on them. Even then, once theyrsquod been cleaned up, therersquod still be a chance wersquod remain friends. But thatrsquos not about politics. Thatrsquos about realising your friend is a psychopathic killer who, like all hunters and shooters, should be kept under -hour police surveillanceYou could fall out with them for being Tories, but it would still be possible to remain friends. I had a Tory friend in my early twenties, and even that friendship survived a fist-fight during the minersrsquo strike. So I guess disagreements over politics is nothing new.But everyone seems so angry now and so obsessed with politics. You might think we were angry back in the day to have a fist-fight, but it was just a decent and proper way to clear the air. It would be betterpeople today would spend five minutes discussing their opposite stances before calmly saying, ldquoOK, letrsquos just jook it out then we can get back to normal. Once yoursquove had a fist-fight about politics, you tend to avoid the subject afterwards.But, today, folk bang on and on and, usually, I find myself listening in near-silence, literally for years now, just thinking: ldquoPlease shut up. I only stick around for the free drink. And I needed a stf one after reading about Lib Dem plans to have a Minister for Happiness. Lib Dems: the very thought of them plunges one into melancholy.If you want to be happy, avoid politics. Restrict yourself to a brief dabble once every four years at the polling station.

What good does that do It doesnrsquot help when that Greetinrsquo Thunberg lassie blunders aboot the planet spreading doom and gloom.

And almost all of Scotlandrsquos once-thriving tidal pools were left to the elements and the raging sea to drt into sad decline.Now, however, as outdoor wild swimming rises in popularity and the health benefits of enjoying a dip in the sea are once again being appreciated, renewed efforts are being made to revive interest in, and preserve, some of Scotlandrsquos many seawater tidal pools.In Wick, a group of volunteers is stepping up efforts to reinstate The Trinkie, a natural rock pool which emerges from an imposing shelf of Caithness stone and which until a few years ago was still a popular summer haunt for brave swimmers.Now more appreciated for its nostalgic value and for its rock pools than as a swimming location, the Trinkie Heritage Preservation Group has launched a determined effort to save it from crumbling andit to something resembling its former glory.Meanwhile, at Tarlair pool in Macduff, Banffshire, efforts are being stepped up to restore the A-listed s architectural gem which sits alongside the seawater pool, paddling pool and boating pond, which once boasted a tea pavilion, boating lake, changing rooms and ing board.In the East Neuk of Fe, where tidal pools were popular in fishing villages and seaside communities, a community action group is within touching distance of receiving pound, of funding to restore Pittenweemrsquos tidal pool which once featured a slide and ing  but which has lain unused for decades.The ambitious project to revitalise the pool, which can be traced back to , is said to have already captured the imagination of a new generation of outdoor swimmers, with summer crowds recently packing the previously abandoned pool.Further north in Moray, locals faced with the loss of the small tidal pool at Portknockie recently raised almost pound, for repairs to a leaking valve and other wear and tear to ensure its survival for future generations to enjoy.Catherine Patterson, secretary of the Trinkie Heritage Preservation Group, says there has been a surge of support from local people keen to see storm damage at the Wick pool repaired.ldquoWe have been getting an overwhelmingly positive response to our efforts to save The Trinkie, she says.ldquoIt was badly damaged in a storm a few years ago which has left a signicant hole in its main wall. Itrsquos deteriorating and it needs attention before further damage is done.The group has had a structural study carried out and is in the throes of raising the pound, needed to do the work.ldquoI learned to swim there as did generations of local people, adds Patterson.ldquoOur recent survey had tremendous responses from people who have fond memories of it and who still go there to explore the rock pools and look for crabs.ldquoWe want to restore it for its historic role in the area where people gravitated to, and enjoyed, visiting.Interest in tidal pools is thought to have been sparked both by a resurgence in interest in wild swimming in Scotland, plus a wave of nostalgia for a simpler age when summer holidays were spent closer to home.Far humbler than full-scale lidos with their properly constructed and heated swimming pools such as at Stonehaven and Gourock, tidal pools tend to emerge from the rocks, usually supported by manmade walls and access points, and which naturally replenish regularly with a fresh flood of seawater.They rose in popularity among Victorian and Edwardian swimmers who wanted to enjoy the bracing outdoors.Tidal pools cropped up around the coast, including in Dumfries and Galloway where Victorians invested over pound in the construction of a distinctive oval-shaped Powfoot tidal pool in a bid to encourage outdoor swimming ndash although an unfortunate incident when a group of young girls nearly died after being stranded by the tide did endear it to many.The UKrsquos most northerly pool, in Scalloway in Shetland, was bulldozed in  to make way for a car park.Burgh councils in holiday spots along the East Neuk and East Lothian seized the opportunity to attract tourists, with tidal pools springing up in St Andrews, St Monans and Cellardyke, North Berwick.The one at Dunbar eventually grew to become Scotlandrsquos largest open-air tidal pool with its Olympic standard ing board, pavilion and added attraction of the annual Miss Dunbar Bathing Suit Competition.Even in their heyday, many pools had little in the way of safety features, and were often accessed by just a set of slippery concrete steps or a rusty handrail.Lack of water filters meant taking a dip could mean dodging seaweed and occasional debris.At Pittenweem, the long rectangular tidal pool emerges from the line of blackened rocks which stretch into the Forth, accessed either from the sandy beach or down clfside steps chiselled from the sandstone.Once one of the most popular tidal pools on the Fe coast, it originally included a ing board, clftop pavilion and changing rooms for swimmers.According to David Thomson, chairman of the West Braes project in Pittenweem which is driving forward plans to restore the pool to its former glory, there are hopes that it can be restored in time for next summer.ldquoThe pool used to be incredibly packed with swimmers, with a paddling pool, boating pond and ing board, he says.ldquoThe council stopped maintaining it in the s and it was a shame to see it start to decline. Cracks started to appear and we realised thatwe didnrsquot do something it would be lost forever.The group is close to finalising pound, of funding from Fe LEADER and Fe Environment Trust, with work planned to start in February.Thomson adds: ldquoIt was a case of use it or lose it.ldquoWe have already seen renewed interest in it from wild swimmers who travel here to use it, and local families.ldquoThey have realised we have this beautul thing on our doorstep and we should try not to lose it."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-labour-39-s-self-destructing-brexit-policy---negotiate-reject---incoherence-stilts","story":"Labour are of course correct that the Liberal Democrats have made a nonsense of their own party name by refusing to recognise the democratic vote for Brexit in .

But parliament is going to have to take a good look at itself when this is put before MPs on October .The Benn Act, that compels the government to avoid no-deal, will surely be null and voidparliament rejects the only deal on offer. The only certainty then will be Article , which triggers Britains departure from the European Union whether or not there is a deal. MPs voted by a majority of  to trigger Article  in . They have voted down every alternative since then.I dont actually believe that Boris Johnson wants a crash-out Brexit: he is proud that he has managed to get movement from Brussels. But make no mistake. If parliament continues to preicate, and fails to come up with a majority for any kind of compromise, then Britain is scheduled to leave the EU on October . It is irresponsible to demand a further extension of Ait is to no purpose.It sickens me to say it, but there is a half-decent Brexit deal on offer and MPs will have to think very carefully before rejecting it. The alternative will not be revoking A, or a referendum, both of which have been rejected by MPs. The alternative will be a hard-right Brexit. And parliament will be as much to blame as Boris Johnson."},{"url":null,"title":"rewilding-scotland-39-s-39-baby-steps-39-not-bringing-back-wolf","story":"Such suggestions have regularly grabbed headlines, but Steve Micklewright, convener of the newly-formed Scottish Rewilding Alliance, believes they have unfairly taken over the debate about rewilding.Instead, he said, the focus must be on rebuilding the environment from the ground up ndash ldquobaby steps ndash and in convincing landowners and managers, and people living in areas where rewilding is proposed, that it can bring positive benefits to their economy and lives.The alliance, which has its launch today, is made up of conservation groups including Scottish Wildle Trust, the Royal Zoological Society Scotland, the John Muir Trust and Mountaineering Scotland.Micklewright, chief executive of woodland charity Trees for Le, says improving woodland, protecting peat, and restoring habitats for the smaller, less controversial creatures and plants that have disappeared from much of Scotland, are the alliancersquos priorities, alongside using rewilding to boost and secure rural human populations.He was a key speaker yesterday at Scotlandrsquos first-ever conference to promote the rewilding concept. Publicity for the event said that, with a backdrop of ldquocrashing global bioersity and climate breakdown, Scotland can become a ldquoworld leader in restoring its land and seas to good health.It suggested a ldquobold approach but Micklewright, speaking exclusively to The Herald on Sunday, urged caution.He said the time was right to lobby for rewilding, with a Scottish Government that wants to be seen to be progressive: ldquoWe need to work on how we talk about rewilding, and how we communicate about it effectively and how we get Scottish Government policy to enable rewilding.ldquoWe need to be clear about what it means.What it doesnrsquot mean, he is clear, is ldquoextreme rewilding where large tracts of land are completely unmanaged. Thatrsquos because of invasive alien species, which would take over, and the lack of large predators.As a result, under any rewilding scheme for the foreseeable future, plenty human management of deer and plants such as rhododendron will be needed.ldquoRewilding in Scotland is about baby steps. Wersquore not ready in many ways to let nature fully take over some parts of Scotland, therefore we need to intervene for a very long time, he said. ldquoThe idea has been suggested that rewilding is another form of Highland Clearances, getting people off the land so we can bring back a wilderness. Rewilding isnrsquot that at all: humans are a vital part of the landscape and enabling rewilding.ldquoIf rewilding happens there will be more jobs here in land management and showing people whatrsquos here, in tourism, and in sustainably using what the landrsquos providing. Itrsquos about repeopling as well as rewilding ndash the two are very compatible.Asked about apex predators ndash animals at the top of the food chain ndash he said: ldquoIntroducing wolves is the last thing we want to do because wersquore not ready ... and the landscape needs to be prepared for something like that.ldquoMore importantly, these animals arenrsquot going to come back on their own so itrsquos a conscious decision to bring them back and wersquore not ready for that conversation yet.ldquoItrsquos a major distraction and cause of ision, whereas most of what rewilding is all about, most people would buy into.ldquoApex predators are a long, long way down the road. Just by doing preparation for the land to be wilder doesnrsquot mean we will ever bring back predators because there may never be the will to do that.He said ing the lynx was more likely than the wolf, but added: ldquoWe would have to work out exactly what the concerns are and what we need to do to make sure those concerns are dealt with.The organisers of this weekendrsquos conference, Scotland: The Big Picture, is a group of film-makers, writers and photographers who campaign for rewilding. Director Peter Cairns backed Micklewrightrsquos approach, saying he felt some charities and campaign groups are nervous of talking about rewilding: the word has become ldquotoxic.ldquoFrom a UK perspective it has become synonymous with theof large carnivores and farmers being evicted off their land, he said. ldquoReintroduction is an element but only one element.Landownersrsquo organisation Scottish Land  Estateswas represented at the conference. Sarah-Jane Laing, its executive director, said: ldquoUsing the term lsquorewildingrsquo can cause problems because it means many dferent things to dferent people.ldquoIt is crucial, before any change in land use begins, to consider robust, scientic evidence and to consult with those who will be directly and indirectly affected, including those who live and work in rural Scotland.She said many SLE members do ldquorewilding work: ldquoTherersquos already lots of activity taking place in Scotland supported by SLE and our members, from wildcats and red squirrels to peatland and pinewood projects."},{"url":null,"title":"rewilding-scotland-apex-predators-distraction-complex-debate","story":"In trying to put the apex predator debate on the back burner, the Scottish Rewilding Alliance accepts there will always be problems in Scotland with the idea of restoring large carnivores.Not least because on an island wersquoll never see the naturalof animals such as the wolf and lynx, as has happened in Europe and North America. It would have to be a positive decision, and that will raise oppositionConservation has traditionally been about saving habitats and species. The concept of rewilding takes things a step further, rebuilding wild habitats already degraded and, crucially, reintroducing species removed by man.Rewilding appeals because, when manrsquos environmental impact is leading to potential catastrophe, it gives something back, but reintroducing animals to ecosystems radically changed since they were last here is fraught with dficulties.The keynote speaker yesterday at the Scotland: The Big Picture conference was Sean Gerrity, pictured, the American behind the American Prairie Reserve project. For the last  years it has been trying to rewild , square miles of Montana, while maintaining the human population and rural economy. It has  bison, after reintroduction.Gerrity has walked the -mile West Highland Way in recent days and said: ldquoThere are wolves in the Netherlands now, working very nicely, there are wolves back in Germany ... from what I saw you have more than enough space along the northern West Highland Way for wolves and brown bears.Such ideas will always face opposition from farmers, land managers and local people concerned for the safety of livestock, children, pets and people.Apex predator the white-tailed eagle was reintroduced from Norway to Rum in , almost  years after the last Scottish specimen was shot, and has spread to Mull and the surrounding mainland.While itrsquos a hit with tourists, its presence is resented by sheep farmers, as lambs appear to be a regular feature of some birdsrsquo diet.It seems those involved in the restoration believed that as there was little predation on sheep by eagles in Norway, it would not be a problem here, but failed to appreciate sheep here are reared dferently, living all year, and lambing, on open hillsides.The past decade has seen suggestions the Eurasian lynx should be reintroduced. The medium-sized woodland cat ndash the size of a Labrador ndash would prey on roe deer, whose growing numbers damage trees.Proponents say it would be highly unlikely to prey on livestock, but Oban farmer Angus MacFadyen, chair of NFU Scotlandrsquos Environment and Land Use committee, who has seen stock affected by sea eagles, said: ldquoThere is no appetite for such reintroductions ... species reintroductions have hijacked the rewilding agenda.He pointed out many farmers are involved in work such as protecting native species, carbon capture, agro-forestry and bioersity schemes that are part of the wider rewilding agenda.Some wealthy estate owners and charities are trying to restore the ecosystems of the uplands which have been denuded of trees and stripped of wildle.For example, Paul Lister wants to fence his ,-acre Alladale estate in Sutherland and reintroduce wolves there.Listerrsquos plan has run into dficulties because of Scotlandrsquos access laws. Even more modest rewilding faces objections: estates which drastically cut deer numbers to restore trees act as a ldquovacuum, sucking in animals and reducing the number to be shot by paying guns on neighbouring estates.This year, beavers illegally released in Tayside, which now number around , were given protected status,  years after the last native beavers were shot.The animalsrsquo dams buffer rivers against floods and provide rich habitats for other species, but they cause serious flooding in arable fields.Other reintroductions are likely to cause less of a stir.Nature charity Trees for Le wants to reintroduce wood-ants to some Scottish woods, and the Atlantic Woodland Alliance has just been set up in Scotland to encourage the spread of west-coast woodland and its mosses, lichens and flowers."},{"url":null,"title":"50-scots-shaped-world-three-hidden-heroes","story":"However, we knew it would be an impossible task to cover everyone and so asked you, our readers, to send in suggestions of people we might have missed.Here are three ideas we received this week ... do you agree William MurdochI would respectfully wish to draw attention to, in my humble opinion, one major omission ndash William Murdoch.He was born on August , , in Lugar, near Cumnock in Ayrshire.

In August , at the age of , he walked, yes walked, to Birmingham to seek employment with the then fledgling company set up by James Watt and Matthew Boulton, steam engineers.Much has been documented concerning the massive impact created by James Watt in the production of steam propulsion but little is known of Murdochrsquos contribution. Initially being a little envious of the talent displayed by Murdoch, it was only later in the design stage that Watt credited him with his important input.However, William Murdoch will be best remembered for his own invention: coal gas lighting.

This is because four fths of Scotland’s carbon footprint is generated through the heat and energy required to grow, make, process, transport and provide materials that are often tossed aside at the end of their le.Only by considering how to make products with less reliance on raw materials, and by remaking items at the end of their original le into goods that can be used time and again, will businesses be able to signicantly reduce global emissions.Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, who launched the organisation’s corporate plan before an auduence of business leaders last week, said: “We must radically change the way we think about and consume our goods and materials, and we must do that now.” “Too many businesses assume that reducing the cost to the planet means increasing costs for them. “But as we have and will continue to make clear, the opportunities are plentul, with massive savings to be made. “The current way of working cannot continue in the years ahead and successfully adopting a circular economy approach is the only long-term option.”Everything has value and in a circular economy nothing should be wasted. In simple terms, it can be explained as ‘make, use, remake’ as opposed to ‘make, use, dispose’. The ultimate goal is to maintain and improve our quality of le, while simultaneously reducing our material consumption and, by extension, our impact on the planet.Mr Gulland added: “Many Scottish firms are already leading the way, with our help, changing how they design and trade goods to keep materials in use for as long as possible to maximise their value. “Successful circular economy enterprises range from refurbishing computers and upcycling furniture to producing sustainable animal feed using waste generated by our world-famous whisky industry.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.kincardineshireobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Felicitasis just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"   is just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"  Throw a Porridge Party for Mary’s MealsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.kincardineshireobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Left to right - Fiona Cooper, treasurer, Katrina Suer, chair, and Catherine Houston, vice-chair\"  Scouts plea for hut renovation support viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"KINC | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"KINC | Article Teaser\"Zero Waste Scotland estimates that the circular economy would save Scottish businesses collectively at least £ billion every year through benefits including the creation of longer-lasting relationships with customers, as firms switch from a model centred on simply selling products to providing products as services.

He said: #We want to thank our residents for doing a great job in increasing the amount of metals they recycle at the kerbside.#However, we want to take that even further now by focusing on foil. I was amazed to learn that an average household can expect to use  foil trays and  metres of foil wrap each year.#The good news is that recycling a tonne of aluminium saves nine tonnes of C emissions and four tonnes of bauxite, the raw material from which aluminium is made. And aluminium can be recycled indefinitely.“So it’s clear that each household converted to foil recycling really does make a dference environmentally. The council also gets a goodfor metals recycling, which helps offset the costs of all our waste disposal activities in Orkney.“But we know from speaking to the public that some people are unaware they can recycle foil in Orkney, or aren’t aware of the benefits. That’s why, with Alupro’s help again, we’ll be highlighting foil recycling during Recycling Week and beyond.”As part of awareness-raising, the council will be installing banners provided by Alupro at recycling centres and other public places around Orkney.OIC’s waste team are also featuring facts and figures about foil recycling on the EcoActive Facebook page, and carrying out visits to schools over Recycling Week.In Orkney, householders can put aluminium foil and foil trays in the metal recycling banks at one of the council’s Household Waste Recycling Centres , or into their recycling bin. The advice is to just rinse off food residue and put in your recycling binalongside other metals you can recycle such as food and drink cans and tins, and metal lids and tops from jars and bottles.For smaller pieces of foilit#s best to make a larger ball of foilby scrunching pieces together # it will prevent smaller pieces falling through machinery during the recycling process.For more information about waste and recycling visit the council#s website or email recycling@orkney.gov.uk .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Successful generators still sell the electricity they produce on the wholesale market but receive a #top-up# payment over the course of the -year contract.Changes made to rules which had forbidden all onshore wind projects from competing in the electricity market in  meant projects in the Western Isles, Shetland and Orkney were able to compete.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it’s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.“Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.”Though they may have won favour with the government, Hoolan#s two Orkney projects have previously been met with protest from the public and rejection by councillors. More than  protestors took to School Place, last September, when the projects appeared before the OIC planning committee. Though there were no statutory objections to either project, there were  letters of objection and  of support for the Costa project. The Hesta Project, meanwhile, received a total of  objections and nine letters of support.Though councillors elected to reject the wind farms, this decision was later overturned by the Scottish Government. This sparked criticism from former planning chairman, Councillor Owen Tierney, who accused the government of #lacking faith# in the local planning system.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I look forward to the project progressing.”Led by ZeroAvia, developers of hydrogen fuel cell powertrain solutions, HyFlyer will demonstrate a phased approach from battery power to hydrogen power, integrating the new technology aboard a Piper M-class six-seater aircraft which will perform test flights out of Cranfield and Orkney.Project partners Intelligent Energy will optimise its high power fuel cell technology for application in aviation while EMEC Hydrogen, producers of green hydrogen from renewable energy, will supply the hydrogen required for flight tests and develop a mobile refuelling  compatible with the plane.The HyFlyer project will see conventional piston engines in propeller aircraft replaced by electric motors, hydrogen fuel cells and gas storage.If all goes well, ZeroAvia, based in Calornia, are aiming to supply the technology to commercial manufacturers by .Following this demonstration, the next goal then is to power an aircraft, carrying up to  passengers, to travel  miles.According to the Air Transport Action Group, aviation is responsible for  per cent of CO emissions from all transport sources and is one of the fastest growing sources of global emissions.Val Mtakhov, founder and CEO of ZeroAvia, said: “The substantial backing provided by the UK Government underlines the potential that hydrogen holds as a fuel source for commercial aviation and provides signicant validation of ZeroAvia’s approach to zero emission flight.“Our project goal of  NM is equivalent to the distance from London to Edinburgh and will prove that zero emission aviation, powered by hydrogen, can play a key role within the UK and other countries’ transport strategies — enabling net zero targets to be met and improving productivity and regional prosperity.”Richard Ainsworth, Hydrogen Project Specialist at EMEC Hydrogen, said: “HyFlyer is another key step in Orkney’s aim to decarbonise leline transport services for islanded communities.#Hydrogen has the potential to help meet our emission commitments where electrons and batteries can’t.#This project sees us one step closer to meeting our fuel and energy needs from abundant local renewable energy resources using green hydrogen.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

All energy consumers pay for the cost of investment in new network capacity so the regulator ensures that it obtains the best deal possible for them.Ofgem launched a consultation in December last year on proposed changes to SSEN’s plan in an effort to ensure value for money for consumers.Following consideration of consultation responses and further analysis, the regulator has decided to approve the plan subject to the conditions set out in its decision.Approval is conditional on a total of at least MW of new wind farm projects on Orkney either being awarded a Contract for Dferenceor being judged likely to be developed by December .Ofgem would expect to be satisfied that new wind farm projects are likely to be developed despite not being awarded a CfDan independent audit states that the project is financially viable, has signed a relevant grid connection agreement and has been granted planning permission.However, SSEN has stated disappointment that the regulator is maintaining its position that the MW of new renewable electricity generation needs to secure planning permission and demonstrate financial viability prior to granting approval for the construction of the link.Ofgem has extended the date in which developers need to meet these conditions from December  to December . SSEN has said this means, in turn, that the construction of the transmission link may be delayed for at least a two-year period,the full time is required to secure the MW target, or shorterthe need is met at an earlier stage.SSEN’s Transmission and Distribution businesses now intend to consult with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to help establish the optimal #whole system# solution in an effort to make the most of Orkney’s renewable potential.Talking about Ofgem#s decision, Rob McDonald, managing director for transmission with SSEN, said: “Whilst we are clearly disappointed with today’s decision, our commitment to work with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to unlock Orkney’s vast renewable potential has not changed.“With both the UK and Scottish Government committed to net zero emissions, we firmly believe Orkney and Scotland’s other two major island groups will have a key role to play in the fight to prevent the worst effects of climate change.“We now look forward to working with developers and other stakeholders on Orkney to collectively explore the best way forward to unlock Orkney’s renewable potential.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This policy, says Thornberry, shows the Lib Dems are “kind of Taliban”.By any measure, this is an idiotic take. But this is where we are. This is how low Labour has sunk under the pitul leadership of Jeremy Corbyn.Thornberry’s remarks to The House magazine came after Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said thatshe became prime minister before the Brexit deed was done, her government would revoke Article . The Labour frontbencher was not alone in reacting furiously to this position. From across the political spectrum came howls of anger. The Lib Dems were undemocratic, they were prepared to treat the electorate with contempt.For sure, in these ided times, they are plenty of voters ready to lap up these attacks on Swinson. But polls published in the aftermath of the row over the policy showed that others are not quite so furiously angry. One showed the Lib Dems in second place behind Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party while other had them just a point behind Labour.If it was running candidates in the next UK general election, the Taliban would kill for polling results like those.Of course, people who cling to the belief that Brexit will mean a great national liberation are not going to like Swinson’s policy. Of course, they are going to attack it. But it is not, no matter how loudly they screech, undemocratic.In order for the Lib Dems to be able to revoke Article  and stop Brexit in its tracks, the party would have to win a majority at the next general election. Swinson would require a democratic mandate to do what she wants. How depressing that this perfectly obvious fact is ignored by the likes of Thornberry.In Scotland, we have more experience than our neighbours on these islands of living through the aftermath of a binary referendum. We understand how referendums can impact on subsequent voter behaviour. Following the  independence referendum, the SNP received a considerable boost to its electoral fortunes. Anyone who’d voted Yes in the referendum wasn’t about to back Labour or the Conservatives, were they But the nationalists weren’t the only ones to turn the result of the referendum to their advantage. Under Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tories styled themselves the defenders of the Union. While Labour squirmed and wobbled on the constitutional question, Davidson was unequivocal that a vote for her party was a vote to prevent a second independence referendum.In the  Holyrood election, the Conservatives knocked Labour into third place.The Lib Dems’ position on Brexit makes perfect political sense to me.While career-long Eurosceptic Jeremy Corbyn refuses, against the wishes of the majority of his party members, to take a firm anti-Brexit position, Swinson has the space to become the champion of those who believe that departure from the EU will have catastrophic consequences.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is now fighting for Brexit at any cost. He would rather “die in a ditch” than ask the EU to postpone our departure date of  October.Idiots and the terminally naive may believe that such a clear position can be defeated by nuance . It cannot.Brexit dominates our politics and ides the electorate. There is no mileage to be gained by opposition parties in trying to win over those now rallying around Johnson’s No Deal flag. Rather, the prize – the only prize currently on offer – is becoming the leading opponent to Johnson’s Brexit “plan”.Labour is currently bogged down in yet another crisis of its own making. A now abandoned plot to abolish the position of deputy leader in order to punish the current holder of the position, Tom Watson, for daring to speak out about issues such as anti-Semitism and Brexit is yet more proof that Corbyn and his cronies are more interested in leftist sectarianism than they are in providing credible opposition to the Conservative Party.Those Labour members who continue to delude themselves that their leader might be a viable champion for their pro-EU beliefs should seek out online an interview conducted by ITV journalist Joe Pike last week, during which Corbyn refused eight times to answer the simple question of whether he was pro-Leave or pro-Remain.Swinson’s position on Brexit is bluntand, I think, stands a good chance of capturing the mood of a great many voters. Davidson has shown that, when it comes to binary matters, it is best to pick a side and then stick to it.The chances of the Lib Dems ever being in a position to enact this new flagship policy are, it has to be said, slender. Recent polling might have the party neck and neck with Labour but Boris Johnson’s Tories continue to be the clear front-runners with voters.But, given the Lib Dems were all but destroyed by a voter backlash against their five years in coalition government with David Cameron’s Tories, being able to revoke Article  is not the only prize for Swinson. The revitalisation of her party would be quite the achievement.Politicians from left to right may insist that what voters want is for Brexit to be over and done and for MPs toto dealing with the domestic agenda. I wonderthere’s a degree of projection in such remarks.So far as I can see, Brexit shows no sign of becoming less important to the electorate. And while this is so, Swinson is quite right to take a hard Remain position. If ever there was a time to pick a side, it is now.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn defends neutral stance in second eu referendum","story":"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has defended his plan to go into a possible snap general election without saying whether he would campaign to remain in the European Union in a second Brexit referendum.The Labour leader hopes to negotiate a new Brexit deal with Brussels and put that to a public vote against the option of staying in the EU.Mr Corbyn promised a special Labour conference for party members to decide whether to endorse a new Brexit deal his government would negotiate, or back Remaining in the EU.\"What we have said is that we would want to hold a consultation, a special conference of our party at the point that we have got this offer from the EU, weve got this as a remain - and hopefully reform - option,\" he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show.\"Because I do think even those that are strongly in favour of remain would recognise the EU needs to have some reforms.\"The Labour leader said he would “go along with whatever decision the party comes to” on Brexit, and did not rule out giving Labour MPs a free voteBoris Johnson brings a deal back to the Commons.Mr Corbyn risked angering Labour’s pro-EU membership by suggesting the UK could be better off after Brexit, with the right deal.“Please remember why people voted Leave, why people voted Remain, but also remember there is more that unites all of those people – over austerity, over investment, over education, over housing, over health, over a green industrial revolution – than there is that ides them,” he said.Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly said the comments show Mr Corbyn “can’t lead his own party”.“Jeremy Corbyn this morning refused nine times to sayLabour would support Brexit eventhey negotiated a deal with the EU themselves, showing Labour offer nothing but dither and pointless delay,” Mr Cleverly said. “Jeremy Corbyn can’t lead his own party, let alone the country – he can’t even make up his mind on the most important issue facing the country.“He would delay Brexit until at least  and even longerthe EU demand it – Brussels would be in the driving seat and Corbyn would accept anything from them.”Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake, whose party has pledged to revoke Article it forms a majority government, said: “Jeremy Corbyn has once again refused to deny thathe becomes Prime Minister his government will be a Brexit government.\"This will be deeply concerning to millions of Labour supporters who want to campaign to stop Brexit and cannot get any clarity from Labour.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit means a border in ireland jean claude juncker confirms","story":"A no-deal Brexit will result in a border on Ireland and checks on goods crossing between Europe and the UK, EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker confirmed.Mr Juncker insisted that Brussels was \"in no way responsible\" for the consequences of a no-deal scenario, saying the blame would lay squarely with the UK.He also hit back angrily at claims from Brexiteers that his an unelected bureaucrat, calling that a \"typical British lie\".In an interview on Sky News Ridge on Sunday programme, Mr Juncker said \"we can have a deal\"alternative arrangements called for by Boris Johnsons government provided the basis for replacing the controversial Irish border backstop.The Prime Minister has demanded that the backstop - a contingency plan to prevent a hard border by keeping the UK aligned with many of Brussels rules - should be scrapped.Mr Juncker said: \"We have to make sure that there will be no hard and physical border between the two parts of the Irish island and things have to be done on a level playing field.\"If these three objectives are met by the alternative arrangements, then we dont need the backstop.

There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September. Acts on the bill include Niteworks, Elephant Sessions, Lau, Tide Lines and Peat and Diesel as well as DJs Erol Alkan, Optimoand Leon Vynehall.."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/barra-hospital.jpg","title":"consultation events for barra","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineComhairle nan Eilean Siar are to visit Barra next weekfor two consultation events that will help inform a feasibility study into thecreation of a combined school and hospital facility in Castlebay.The proposal caused confusion and anger earlier thisyear, when it was first publicised, as both the comhairle and NHS Western Isleshad already progressed a plan for a new hospital to replace St Brendan’s.

Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

Bangladesh finally won its freedom from East Pakistan in  after a bloody, -month war of independence which left up to three million dead.Of late the developing country has been in the headlines for providing shelter to , Rohingya who have fled persecution in neighbouring Myanmar.“Coláiste Feirste was honoured to welcome the Bangladeshi delegation,” said Seán Mistéil. “Minister Chowdhuryexplained the importance of mother languages to nation building and economic well-being. That resonated powerfully with our students.”Minister Chowdhury toured the site of the Gaeltacht Quarter’s next development project: a triangle of disused land which represents one of the last building sites fronting the Falls Road.“We have bold plans to transform this triangle of land into a Gaeltacht housing and tourism project,” added the Coláiste Feirste Chairman. “This vibrant and visionary social development initiative will promote the collective economic capacity of the wider Spórtlann na hÉireann and Coláiste Feirste site. We believe that maximising this hub of interdependent and unique elements is best achieved through a one site vision that connects all of its parts. We have this coordinating vision in place and it has enterprise and exchange at its heart. It is infused with environmental and economic promise and includes a wealth of cultural, sporting and human potential.”The visit of the Bangladeshi delegation was hosted by London-based Study Circle and facilitated by the growing Bangladeshi population of Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"bone man at key palestine hearing","story":"A BONE man is in the Hague this week as an international observer at a historic hearing on the Palestine-Israeli conflict.Eddie Whyte, who has lived in Norway for over thirty years, is also a member of the Palestine Justice Campaign.Eddie attended the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands as the case got underway yesterday .The case has been brought by Dutch citizen Ismail Ziada against the former Chief of General Staff of the Israeli Defence Force , Benny Gantz, and former Commander of the IDF Air Force, Amir Eshel, over the bombing of the Ziada family home in Gaza.The attack in July  killed six family members from three generations of the Ziada family, including Ismail’s -year-old mother, three brothers, his sister-in-law, a -year-old nephew and a visiting friend. Mr Ziada, who is of Palestinian origin, contends that the attack on the family home was a violation of international humanitarian law and constituted a gross violation of internationally recognised human rights principles.Mr Gantz and Mr Eshel claim immunity from the Dutch court and contend that Mr Ziada should have presented his claim in an Israeli court. Mr Gantz is running for office against Benjamin Netanyahu in the Israeli national elections this week.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Eddie said: “The case is historical in that it is the first time a Palestinian has been able to make use of civil litigation on the basis of universal jurisdiction to gain access to justice for war crimes.“The pursuance of the case has been made possible by an online crowdfunder which received widespread support in Ireland from iniduals, trade unions and human rights organisations and prominent people like Senator Frances Black, award-winning filmmaker Seán Murray and musician Mick Blake.

Two of the sculptures from the popular Julia Donaldson-penned Gruffalo tale were completely destroyed after they were set ablaze while others were defaced. Colin Glen Forest Park is home to the unique Trail and has visitors and families from across the city visit daily to see the attraction. Mother-of-two Nicola Marley said that it is “upsetting” for her children when their “favourite character or activity is signicantly damaged or missing” along the Trail.“I participated in a project with the Princes Trust to create a small memorial garden for victims who have lost their lives as a result of mental health issues,” she said. “A lot of hard work and time went into it, many close friends and family of the victims use the garden as a peaceful space to sit and reflect. It is sad that this has now been destroyed too. The park would be a nicer and safer placethe constant vandalism stopped.”Another parent, Janine Belton, spoke of how the Gruffalo Trail “gives the children a wonderful experience and provides them with some learning within nature.” “However, the animal statues have been destroyed, leaving the children confused and sad as they believe that the animals were being ‘hurt’,” she said. Bernadette Devlin, from Colin Sure Start said that vandalism on the Gruffalo Trail was impacting the learning and development of children in the area.“We use that facility a few times a year to bring parents and our children from nought to four age range,” she said.“It promotes the kids’ speech and language, it promotes their social interaction, it helps them learn about their environment and, most of all, it allows them to have fun. It’s local and it’s free of charge, but they are unable to enjoy it as much because of the vandalism of the statues on the Gruffalo Trail. It’s a health and safety issue too because the children like to get their photos taken with the statues, but obviously they can’t do that now. There is one near the entrance and you wouldn’t even be able to identy what it is now.“We just want to make people aware of the impact it’s having on the families who are living in the community.“It’s resource that we’ve had many an enjoyable outing to, and we would like to continue to do that. It has so many benefits for community, butthis vandalism continues we’ll no be able to use it. The safety of the children is paramount to us. We would be very wary of bringing families there because of the vandalism.”Sinn Féin Councillor Séanna Walsh described those behind the destruction as “a handful of disgruntled vandals who are attacking their own community”.“Colin Glen Forest Park is a major asset for this area, the community, council and departments are investing heavily into it and we are looking at a £ million investment package for it,” he said. “The Glider has really opened up the opportunity for people and families to access the park and we have a handful of youngsters who are turning up to try and vandalise it.“The park is set to launch its latest attraction, the toboggan, soon and planning applications are in for zip lines and mountain bike trails. There are big projects planned for the park. We would ask those who behind this vandalism to stay out of it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"it could pay to back the boks in japan","story":"World rankings are a funny thing.

That’s Ireland, who are rated as   shots to lt the Webb Ellis Trophy.That’s Ireland who were obliterated - in last month’s warm-up game at Twickenham.It seems back-to-back wins over Wales at Cardf and then Dublin were enough to promote Joe Schmidt’s side back to number one. Yet, Ireland have a painful history at the Rugby World Cup and have failed to make it past the quarter-final stage in eight previous attempts. In , they topped Pool D, but were humbled - by a ravenous Argentina side in the quarters. Their pain was only lessened by the fact that hosts England failed to make it out of Pool A behind Australia and Wales. However, the  winners look a dferent proposition four years on and Eddie Jones’ side are a real threat. They are   to top a Pool C group containing France and Argentina and look set to take on either Wales or Australia, who should finish first and second in Pool D, in the quarters. Pool B looks a shoot-out between world champions New Zealand and South Africa, while Ireland’s opening game against Scotland on Sunday could well determine who tops Pool A. Hosts Japan might have something to say about that and neither side will take them for granted after they caused one of the biggest upsets in the history of the competition by beating South Africa in their opening game of the  World Cup when managed by the aforementioned Jones. Either way, Ireland will face an almighty challenge to better their horrendous World Cup record as they will face either New Zealand or South Africa in the last eight.I think both Ireland and the All Blacks will top their group meaning it will be Scotland versus New Zealand and Ireland against South Africa. While Ireland have proven that they can beat any team in the world on their day, I can’t help but feel like the World Cup arrives  months too late for Schmidt’s men, who seem to thrive when they are written off. The decision to leave Devin Toner at home has ided opinion, while captain Rory Best is now  and will retire after the World Cup. Fitness doubts continue to linger about Johnny Sextonand Keith Earls, while Robbie Henshaw has been ruled out of the Scotland game with a hamstring injury and Ireland look destined for another quarter-final exit with most firms going   on that outcome. Elsewhere, I like the look of Wales at   to top Pool D and I think they’ll end up playing France in the quarter-final. If my predictions are correct, that would leave Warren Gatland’s side taking on South Africa in the last four. Wales are one of the few teams who should match the brute force of the Springboks and I wouldn’t be surprised to see them reaching the decider.That being said, almost every betting preview I’ve read has tipped South Africa as the winner and as much as I hate hopping on the bandwagon, they looked to have assembled one hell of a squad. The other semi-final could be the game of the tournament with world champions New Zealand looking like they are on a collision course with England. Australia could throw a spanner in the works in the quarter-finals, but I’ve a gut feeling fear that England will go very close. Final Prediction Thankfully, their outright odds are   are far too skinny for me to consider the unthinkable, but they may well reach the decider with an England versus South Africa final priced at a tasty-looking  . Back in , the same countries contested the decider in France with South Africa winning - in a cagey affair at the Stade De France and I fancy a repeat of that result at the ,-capacity International Stadium in Yokohama.A certain Bryan Habana was the star of the World Cup  years ago, scoring eight tries and Cheslin Kolbe could be worth a wager in the top-tryscorer market at  . The -year-old winger scored two tries at the weekend as Rassie Erasmus’s side defeated hosts Japan in their final warm-up game -. When you consider that Ireland’s Jacob Stockdale is as low as  , Kolbe looks outstanding value while George North could also be worth an each-way punt at  . The Kolbe South Africa double is also available at  , while those looking a patriotic punt could do worse than back Iain Hendersonto score the first try for Ireland in Sunday’s opening game against Scotland with the Ulster ace available at  ."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"meabh set to sing the anthem at croke park","story":"AN Under- Lámh Dhearg footballer will perform Amhrán na bhFiann in front of thousands of GAA fans on Sunday ahead of the Dublin -Galway All-Ireland Senior Ladies Football Final. -year-old Méabh McNeill told Daily Belfast that she is “super excited” to be singing in front of up , fans at Croke Park ahead of the finale to the ladies football season. “When I was seven myself and my brother went to Scéim Samhraidh at our club, Lámh Dhearg,” she said. “One of the events was learning and singing the national anthem. Two of the leaders at the time Orla Nic Shíomóin and Orla Nig Fhearraigh thought I could sing and had a lovely voice. They approached my dad and askedit was okay for me to sing in the Scór na nÓg. I’ve been singing every year since.”Méabh spoke of how the club’s Cultural Officer, Ronan McHugh “asked me to come back last year to teach the kids how to sing the anthem”. “That is the thing about our club, the kids that attend the summer schemes, and there are now three running, end up coaching younger kids coming through which is fantastic,especially the U- girls.”“I then started singing the national anthem at club events such as juvenile and senior dinners. “Antrim Cultural Officer Bronagh Lennon asked my dadI could sing at some championship games and then onto County Antrim league games. Bronagh has been a great influence and mentor, not only to me but to other kids in the county with her encouragement.”Méabh’s extremely proud dad Joe said all the family will be travelling down to Dublin to support her on Sunday.“There is a big festival on at the club on Sunday and the game will be on in the club after that. We are just so proud.”The Blessed Trinity College student has always had a passion for the performing arts and has performed lead roles in New Lodge Arts High School Musical and Belfast Musical Drama Society’s Hairspray. Following her momentous pitch debut at the Jones’ Road stadium on Sunday, Méabh will be straight into rehearsals for her school’s production of Beauty and the Beast of which she will perform the role of Belle. “I sang the national anthem in front of the Artane Band at Clones, that was a huge honour and an amazing day so imagine what it was like when my dad broke the news to me that I had been invited to sing our national anthem in Croke Park in front of an estimated , people. I’m just so excited.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"one womans journey of discovery on lyric stage","story":"HOUSE lights dim, stage lights up and our scene is set.

He attended Holy Cross Boys Primary School in the district and is also a past pupil of the old St Gabriel’s school.Leaving school at , Thomas admits that the academic world was not for him and he left home soon after to work in England.“School just wasn’t for me,” he explained.“I wasn’t academic but always fascinated by art and photos in newspapers and magazines such as The Observer and Sunday Times magazines.“I left home at  and went to England. There wasn’t much work here at the time and I just wanted to get away from Belfast with all the conflict going on.“I saw so much trouble and bloodshed on the streets. My community was under siege.“You couldn’t get in or out of Ardoyne without getting checked by British Army or RUC.“I was away for a year and worked in construction on building sites in London. I decided to come back because to be honest, I missed the place.“I didn’t really like London at all. It was far too quiet compared to back home.”Thomas ed to Belfast and turned his attention back to one of his hobbies and interests he had from a young age – photography.“I wanted to pursue a career in photography,” he added.“I went to night school where I learnt the basics but I wanted a job so I could work for the community using photography.“I managed to get an interview with the founder of Andersonstown News in West Belfast, Basil McLaughlin and Máirtín Ó Muilleoir who told me they were starting a new newspaper for North Belfast.“I was familiar with the Andersonstown News and liked the fact that they provided a voice for the community in West Belfast during the Troubles.“My interview was  years ago and I haven’t looked back since.”In  years, Thomas has established himself as a well-known and talented photographer and there wouldn’t be many in North Belfast who haven’t recognised him out and about doing the job he loves.Still, much has changed over the years in North Belfast and in photography.“North Belfast has changed in some ways but many issues remain today like housing and the unfair points system.“Community relations have improved with integrated education but even today, there are still sectarian attacks and peace walls remain up iding communities.“There are still people out there fighting for peace.“As for photography, I started off developing my own black and white images before it moved on to the digital age which takes up a lot less time and I can produce more photos.”Thomas has enjoyed many successes over the years and in , showcased  years of his work in the local media at an exhibition for Féile an Phobail.Back in May of this year, he scooped four awards at the Northern Ireland Press Photographers Awards, including first place in the Inidual Study and Sports Action categories along with a Provincial Merit Award.

It ought to be a resignation issue but wont, given the proximity of a general election in late Autumn or early .Amid the noise, bluster and faux outrage, there will be a sizeable number of Labour MPs privately anxious to avoid a resumption of Parliament. Why would they want to be dragged from the fun of a party conference by the Brighton seaside to hear parliamentary arguments played on a repeat loop for the last year  While it is unlikely that the Supreme Court, should it find against the Government, will determine the date Parliament should resume, the pressure for an immediate restoration would be huge. That could take a wrecking ball to the Conservatives gathering in Manchester at the end of this month.In truth, Parliament prorogued is probably as effective as Parliament sitting. MPs wasted the last year voting against all options. The Liberal Democrats have now decided that all options are off now, anyway. They will simply cancel Brexit. This from a party that supported a referendum.Any chance of a deal will owe precious little to Westminster, where posturing and pantomime had long displaced any serious consideration of the issues at stage. Instead, progress will be a product of often fractious but, of late, somewhat more measured exchanges involving the UK and Irish governments, the EU and the DUP.Arlene Fosters party made a signicant concession in accepting all-Ireland - in effect, EU - alignment in agriculture and food, butthat is the limit to the DUPs movement, there is still huge distance to travel. More than % of cross-border trade is in other sectors and the demand for the backstop remains for those aspects.There is a reasonable chance that the backstop is re-labelled as it is politically toxic - but a renaming is not a dispelling. Resolving the issues will require much more moderation and considerable fudging.Assurances might be given to the DUP that any checking of goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to, at most, token checks. A revival of Stormont could be talked up as part of a triple-lock on any EU expansion of regulations covering all-Ireland trade, involving the Westminster and Dublin parliaments and the Northern Ireland Assembly. Some concessions to the technocratic approach to customs and regulations checks offered by the Alternative Arrangements Commission might be forthcoming. The sum of modest parts might be sufficient to claim victory in modying the Withdrawal Agreementor upholding all its principles .The DUP needs a win to take to its own party conference at the end of October, which, like Sinn Feins Ard Fheis three weeks later, might take on the appearance of a pre-election rally. Given the DUPs long-standing opposition to the backstop, the party needs to show how it made a substantial contribution to its modication. Bilateral discussions between Arlene Foster and the Taoiseach indicate that neither party wants to be responsible for a no-deal failure. Leo Varadkar has got most of his electorate onside in the blame game. It might be harder for Arlene Foster at an election, even allowing that the DUPs support has held up perfectly well in the three years since the EU referendum.The endgame will probably not become clear until the European Council meeting in mid-October. It may be autumn but it is neither mellow nor fruitful. Just very misty, with little sign of the fog clearing.Jon Tonge is Professor of Politics at the University of Liverpool.

No, it was put in place in order to preserve the rights of the internal market and of the island of Ireland.”But in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Mr Juncker said there would have to be checks.He added: “I’m not an architect of new border stations. The British have to tell us exactly the architectural nature of this border.“I don’t like a border because after the Good Friday Agreement, and this Good Friday Agreement has to be respected in all its parts, the situation in Ireland has improved. We should not play with this.”He said: “We have to make sure that the interests of the European Union and of the internal market will be preserved.“An animal entering Northern Ireland without border control can enter without any kind of control the European Union via the southern part of the Irish island. This will not happen. We have to preserve the health and the safety of our citizens.”When askedthe Prime Minister of Luxembourgs decision to hold a press conference next to an empty podium where Boris Johnson was supposed to be was helpful, Jean-Claude Juncker said \"I rather consider that this was not very helpful\" #Ridge pic ioTwORlNq— Ridge on SundaySeptember , He said the EU “is in no way responsible for any kind of consequences entailed by the Brexit” as “that’s a British decision”.He suggested that some MPs are “forgetting about the history” of Northern Ireland and Ireland.Mr Juncker’s meeting with Mr Johnson in Luxembourg on September  came just hours before the country’s prime minister Xavier Bettel criticised the Tory leader and left an empty podium for him at a press conference.The European Commission president said: “I don’t knowthis is helpful. I rather consider that this was not very helpful but it’s his decision.”Mr Juncker also criticised former UK prime minister David Cameron over the build-up to the  Brexit referendum, claiming he failed to explain the agreement reached with Brussels.“We agreed the deal back in , I think, between David and ourselves but this deal was never explained to the British public. Never.”Former prime minister David Cameron has warned Boris Johnson that “breaking the law is not a good idea”.With the Supreme Court hoping to announce its decision this week on the legality of the Prime Minister’s prorogation of Parliament, Mr Cameron told Sky News’ Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “No deal is not a good idea. Breaking the law is not a good idea. Focus everything you’ve got on getting that deal, and that’s what he’s doing, to be fair to him.”Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the Government will respect the Supreme Court’s ruling on the Prime Minister’s move to suspend Parliament in the run-up to Brexit.Mr Raab told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show: “Of course we will respect whatever the legal ruling is from the Supreme Court.“But I think we are getting a little bit ahead of ourselves.”Mr Raab said: “We will see what the Supreme Court will decide.“We are confident, we wouldn’t have appealed the casewe weren’t confident in the position that the Government had taken.“I can reassure you, of course we are going to abide by the Supreme Court judgment.”Askedthe Government would prorogue Parliament againit wins the case, Mr Raab said: “I think, let’s wait and see what the first judgment decides and then we’ll understand the lie of the land.”Pressed on whether Northern Ireland could have dferent EU customs arrangements to the rest of the UK, Mr Raab said: “No, of course, that would be wrong.”"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The cases would be the first ever Ebola infections confirmed in the East African country.The United Nations health agency says it was made aware on September  of the death in Tanzania’s commercial capital, Dar es Salaam, of a patient suspected to have Ebola. A day later, it received unofficial reports that an Ebola test had come back positive. On Thursday, it received unofficial reports that a contact of the patient, who had travelled widely in the country, was sick and in hospital.A rapid response is crucial in containing Ebola, which can be fatal in up to % of cases and is most often spread by close contact with bodily fluids of people exhibiting symptoms or with contaminated objects.The WHO statement said the lack of information from Tanzania made it dficult to assess potential risks.The Ebola outbreak based in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo has infected over , people and killed nearly , of them. A few cases have been confirmed in neighbouring Uganda as well, and other neighbouring countries have been preparing for the outbreak’s possible spread.This is not the first time health officials have raised serious questions about the suspected Tanzania cases. On Monday, the US health and human services secretary, Alex Azar, told reporters in Uganda that he and others were “very concerned about the lack of transparency” in Tanzania.Critics have shown increasing alarm as Tanzanian President John Magufuli’s government has restricted access to key information and cracked down on perceived dissent. Politicians recently approved an amendment to a statistics law to make it a crime to distribute information not sanctioned by the government or which contradicts the government.The World Bank was among those expressing concern at that amendment."},{"url":null,"title":"70 year old marathon man dedicates last run memory","story":"A Derry man who has been running competitively for the past forty years will take part in his last full marathon next month in memory of former club member, Martin Gallagher.Harry McNulty is one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club and a familiar face in the local running circuit.At the age of  he has decided to bow out of full marathons but will continue to compete in shorter distances and will no doubt be seen sporting the famous purple colours of his club as he treks through the streets of Derry or tackles the back roads of Donegal.He grew up in Melmore Gardens, Creggan, and now resides in the Waterside area of the city.The -year-old has run  half marathons and will compete in his st, and final, full marathon on October  in Dublin.Harry comes from a family of seven, five boys and two girls, and his brothers Dessie and Brendan were considered the runners in the family. Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"department weighing medical school options","story":"The Department of Health is assessing the cost-effectiveness of locating a Medical School in Derry and said any final decision will require ministerial sign off.The Medical School forms part of Derry’s City Deal proposals and as such the local council is engaging with the UK government to see “ this project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.”The Ulster University has been for some time considering the development of a Graduate Entry Medical Schoolto be located in Derry and this project proposal features heavily in the Derry City  Strabane District Council’s economic regeneration plans for the region.With the support of the Local Council the University partners have been engaging with a number of NI Departments in an effort to progress this proposal.A spokesperson for UU confirmed that as part of its latest business case it aims to have its first academic year of enrolments for the GEMS in  .The Northern Ireland Department of Healthis acutely aware of the pressures on the medical workforce across Health and Social Careand its key role in leading the transformation of services set out in Delivering Together.Accordingly, DoH commissioned a Medical School Places Review, led by Professor Keith Gardiner, to determine the optimum number of medical school places that Northern Ireland requires per year. His report, published on  January , raises challenging, long-term, strategic and cross-cutting questions with major financial implications.Amongst other issues, it recommends expanding medical training places by at least  per year, potentially costing up to an additional £m per year when fully implemented. This report is a key consideration of UU in putting forward its proposal for a medical school in Derry.While DoH has been assisting UU in the development of its Outline Business Casefor a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee Campus, this is separate from any decision on medical student expansion in Northern Ireland. Feedback was provided on  July  to the fourth iteration of the OBC.Any commissioning of additional medical places for Northern Ireland must address comprehensively the full range of available options, with a particular focus on the assessment of value for money and affordability for health and social care, the report says.“For example, rather than simply expanding medical student numbers, it will be important to explore lower-cost measures likely to increase the supply of medics over the short-term and which enhance and maximise the signicant investment currently being made in undergraduate medical education.“DoH is developing a business case to consider these matters. Given the cross-cutting nature and potential for signicant associated costs with the Medical School business case, the DoH Permanent Secretary has advised that any decision on this or other long-term options, must be considered by Northern Ireland Executive Ministers.”It added: “The provision of HE places in NI or the establishment of a medical school in Derry is a devolved matter, however, the Derry  Strabane City District Council is presently engaging with UKG to considerthis project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.“The medical school is one part of a wider package of proposals currently under consideration with other draft proposals included that could complement existing specialties at the Magee Campus.“The development of the Council’s final bids for a City Deal from the Inclusive Future Fund is still ongoing and as of August , there has been no official final bid submitted for either funding stream to UKG, including no formal bid to provide funding to a Derry medical school.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: projected image of what Magee will look likeexpanded with Graduate Entry Medical School by the riverfront."},{"url":null,"title":"derry homeowners left shaken burglary waterside area city","story":"Detectives are appealing for witnesses and information following the report of a burglary at a house in the Grovemount Court area of Altnagelvin, Derry, on Thursday  September.Detective Sergeant Boyd said: “It was reported that entry was gained to the property between am and pm on Thursday.

The door is now wide open for an independent higher education institution for the North West.It provides us with a once-in-a-letime opportunity for the city-region, as long as we are prepared to grasp it. It is now almost  years since the campaign for a Derry university first began.Specically, the report raises a number of questions, which must be answeredwe are to redress what parliamentarians are now referring to as ‘the last-remaining civil rights issue’.These include:What legislation will be necessary to ensure that the new Derry-centred university will transcend both sides of the border, as regards teaching provision, RD, student intake and administration What legislation will be required from Dublin, London and Europe, to ensure revenue funding for a standalone cross-border university in the North West If a HE provider from Southern Ireland, where student fees are lower, were to become a partner in the new NW university, would fees here also be lower Is there any impediment to the National University of Ireland applying for a Charter to establish a university whose main campus is Derry  The report suggests that the institution seeking degree-awarding powers should be ‘physically operating’ in Northern Ireland. Can Derry Strabane Council be the anchor ‘operating’ partner, with NUI as the provider Can an accredited further education provider, such as the North West Regional College, apply for degree-awarding powers  What processes must it complete Derry Strabane Council is applying directly to the United Kingdom Governmentfor funding for a medical school for the North West. What action is council taking as regards applying to ‘UKG’, and other governments, for funding for an independent university for the North West Can Derry Strabane Council now operate its proposed Medical School with a new HE providerat Magee Will central government now increase the MaSN Cap, which restricts the number of HE students in the North, to accommodate the development of a new university in the North West Can central government ensure that the new independent NW university stays viable by ensuring that the minimum cap for the new institution remains permanently at ,  In February , the Department for the Economy, wrote to UU asking for ‘its rationale for locating additional higher education places in the Magee Campus’. Seven months on, UU still had not replied to its most signicant funder. Given the crisis in third-level education in the North West, and the need for the region to entrust its educational provision in the hands of those who will take it seriously, what other providers partners has Derry Strabane council approached as regards developing HE provision in the North West googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAs an interim measure, we call on Derry Strabane council to establish a dedicated Higher Education Development  Scrutiny Committee immediately.This committee must meet urgently with the National University of Ireland, Letterkenny IT and the NW Regional College, as it draws up a strategic plan for a new, independent cross-border university.It must also liaise directly, and urgently, with Donegal County Council and the governments in London, Dublin and Brussels to discuss funding opportunities and administrative alignments.There is no time to be lost. These arrangements cannot wait for the re-establishment of Stormont or the settling of Brexit. This is much too important an issue.The momentum is with the North West and with the campaign for an independent university."},{"url":null,"title":"government report casts doubt magee expansion","story":"A report published by the Secretary of State for NI has cast further doubt over expansion at Magee by raising a number of concernsThe report states that in , DfE received a joint proposal from Ulster Universityand Council for a scaled expansion of the University’s Magee Campus to , full-time students from its existing ,, as well as an additional  full time students delivered via the North West Regional College .The proposition was the delivery of an increased supply of skilled graduates, togetherwith regional benefits that could flow to the North West.Planned expansion of the university campus is largely dependent on City Deal funding.At a recent Council meeting, it was revealed that projects linked to Ulster University will receive £m, at least a third of the City Deal funding, which currently stands at £m but is projected to be £m-£m with the Council expected to contribute £m and other partners making up the shortfall.The UU projects include the Graduate Entry Medical School, whose financial viability has been cast into doubt by Head of the NI Civil Service David Sterling. Alongside that are centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automationand a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence .Julian Smiths report says the proposals to expand Magee had signicant funding consequences from a capital infrastructure perspective, approximately £m, and from a resource funding perspective.The proposal would require Higher Education in NI to be placed on a sustainable footing, comparable with England, from which expansion would take place.According to the report, there would also be, as with any requested expansion or increase to student numbers, resource grant consequences of funding the proposed additional places at UU and NWRC, and associated student support costs, circa £m.\"The £m capital cost was highly indicative and based on an assumed cost per square metre per student.\"The Department for the Economyundertook initial work to determine how it would look at the case,there was an agreement on how the sector as a whole could be sustainably funded, as any expansion in student numbers would not make sense without this in place,\" it said.In February , DfE wrote to, and is awaiting a response from, UU requesting that an update be made to the case, according to the report.DfE asked for a more accurate assessment of capital need, which was \"very theoretical\" in the original proposal and created a signicant cost requirement. It wants a review of the number and subject level mix of additional students required to ensure an underpinning alignment with graduate postgraduate economic need in subject areas proposed.Furthermore, the department requested information around phasing of the project to assessthere are \"more suitable break points\" in the proposal and a potential to scale any expansion both in terms of student numbers and capital development.And sought the \"rationale\" for locating additional higher education places in the Magee Campus, as opposed to other geographical locations with further and more detailed explanation in relation to sub-regional economic benefits.This information will be critical to enabling a strategic approach to HE provision and in feeding into any final business case that might be put forward for this proposal, it concluded.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"magherafelt based actor blown away role movie linked jurassic world franchise","story":"By Cathal McGuiganA Magherafelt-based actor has said he was “blown away” when he learned he had been cast in Battle at Big Rock, a short film thats part of the Jurassic World franchise.Chris Finlaysonplays American biker Greg in the film and aims to build on this role and some experience as an extra to land more acting roles.Battle at Big Rock was posted to Youtube on Sunday and had been viewed more than three million times by Thursday evening. Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American. They couldnt believe it when I said Id just came down from Magherafelt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ulster university responds questions regarding city deal funds medical school","story":"The Derry News posed a number of questions to Ulster Universityover the continued uncertainty on the establishment of a Medical School at Magee College.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshFirstly, we asked does UU have any update or response regarding the medical school and concerns raised by David Sterling around the need for ongoing funding which UU is not prepared to invest   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Following cross-party political and health and social care support in  for Ulster University’s Graduate Entry Medical School, the University has continued to proactively develop the project, working closely with the Department and other relevant partners. Our responses to any remaining clarications within the Graduate Entry Medical School business case were submitted to the Department of Health at the start of July, following prompt and close engagement with the Department and other relevant partners. Our proposed first academic year of projected enrolments outlined within the updated business case is  .“As the Department of Health has previously confirmed that any decision on funding can only be made by Ministers, the University is not actively recruiting medical students as yet for  entry until that decision on funding can be reached.· If funding was confirmed, all other elements of the proposal for our medical undergraduate degree programme have been firmly on track including continued progress with the GMC, clinical placement opportunities and the development of a curriculum to meet the needs of healthcare locally.“We value the continued support of all those who share our vision for medical education and we continue to work with the General Medical Council, St George’s University of London and local clinicians and partners building on our existing leadership in medical and healthcare provision to take forward graduate entry medical education for Northern Ireland.\"What does UU say in response to local councillors representatives who have claimed that UU has neglected the Magee campus for decades and should not be given money as part of the City Deal but should instead invest its own money in Derry   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Ulster University continues to invest in the Magee campus, most recently with the state-of-the-art £m teaching block which signals our ambition for higher education in the city, already enhancing campus le and paving the way for enhanced future capacity at Magee.    This and other investment priorities for students have resulted in a very strong performance for the Magee campus across all elements of the  National Student Survey, reflecting the very positive reaction from our students to these recent investments in University le at Magee.  With all four faculties of the University represented on the Magee campus – across health sciences, arts and humanities, business and computing and engineering, we are pushing boundaries and breaking new ground in emerging sectors as a progressive university, shortlisted for the prestigious Times Higher Education University of the Year Award, .“Our contribution to the City Deal opportunity is a signicant step forward in our collective opportunity to realise the full ambitions of this vibrant university city.  Our City Deals proposal will see us apply our expertise to help maximize the city’s potential in this unparalleled opportunity to boost economic growth and prosperity.  In our continued collaboration with industry partners, we look forward to driving innovation in personalised medicine, cognitive analytics, robotics and automation, leading to both new research posts and learning opportunities for additional students.  The proposed riverfront innovation hub will build upon the expertise of our first data analytics Institute, opened in  and headquartered at Magee campus, and which cemented our reputation as a global leader in this field. Also integral to the City Deal remains our commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point.   City Deal recognises the crucial role our University can play as an economic engine in the North West and is a major boost to the collective ambitions of the city and region.  We look forward to the development

across world class research and progressive student learning works hard for the benefit of all in the city region. The City Deal bid has education, innovation, job creation and skills development at

In the fth minute a free was given away by the lsquoFin defence and Cormac Venney slotted over from the m line.In the sixth minute a superb full-pitch move from the lsquoFin was finished by Breannain McComiskey, restoring the two-point lead.A minute later Garland was clinical when he drove to the net to put the lsquoFin firmly in the driving seat. Shea Croskery raced through moments later and drove for goal, but saw his effort go wide and Dundrumrsquos relief was palpable.Instead of going eight points behind, Dundrum did well to re-group and points from Aidan Fegan and a second Venney free cut the deficit back to three points.Oran Flanagan sent over the next three points in the second quarter of the game with Glavin doing the same for Dundrum. Garland and Croskery also raised the white flag with their strikes to leave the lsquoFin with a half-time lead of - to -.Fegan got the first point of the second half for Dundrum with three minutes gone and a third free kick of the game was landed by Venney by the end of the third quarter.While the lsquoFin had not yet scored, it wasnrsquot for the want of trying as a few opportunities were missed and Dundrum lsquokeeper Eamon King pulled off a superb double save, the first from Croskery and the follow up from Chris Doran.Oran Flanagan was having a good game and he sent over his fourth point of the match and a superb effort from Shane McCann restored the lsquoFinrsquos four point half-time advantage with ten minutes remaining.Dundrum continued to threaten, but other than two more excellent points from their standout player Kyle Glavin, the lsquoFin defence held strong and kept the dangerous duo of Venney and Fegan scoreless the remainder of the game.Dundrum half forward Fegan was sent to the line after getting a second yellow in the final throes of the game.

The upgrading of the pitch is certainly sustainable financially, given the amount of usage it would get.ldquoWe have lost  teams to other leagues in the past few years and they have all cited poor facilities as their main reason for moving to play in the the Lisburn or South Belfast Leagues, he added.Mr Torney said it was essential that proper facilities were put in place to enable the league to avoid weekly postponements of games.ldquoWe are left every year with a fixture congestion because of postponements and in order to arrest the haemorrhaging of clubs from the league we must address this issue immediately.The league are being supported by South Down MP Chris Hazzard, who has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to ldquofinally deliver fit for purpose pitches for the local community in Downpatrick.He continued: ldquoThe current provision of sports pitches at Dunleath Park is nothing short of a disgrace.ldquoDunleath Park is used extensively by the Downpatrick Youth Football League with hundreds of young footballers playing each weekend, but yet againthis week, parts of the pitches have been closed to the public as raw sewage has come to the surface.ldquoIt is an absolute shame that in the shadow of our fantastic new leisure centre here in Downpatrick our local young people are expected to make do with substandard pitches that not only flood for most of the winter months, but are regularly polluted with raw sewage.Mr Hazzard believes that Downpatrick deserves much better treatment.ldquoAs the county town, Downpatrick deserves to have the very best in local sports provision, and that simply isnrsquot the case at the moment.ldquoIt is deeply disappointing that so many of our young footballers are left to travel to Lisburn and Belfast each weekend to play football. That must not be allowed to continue.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWhilst there is no getting away from the fact that Dunleath Park is in a flood plain area, I would have sympathy with local sports clubs that feel that this is too easily put up as a hurdle to any investment, and that the council should actively consider a range of solutions in order to deliver suitable facilities.ldquoI want to thank those local sports clubs and Downpatrick Youth League representatives who continue to work tirelessly in order to provide local sporting opportunities for our young people and I will now be making representation to senior council management in order to make all their voices heard..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan forest cycle in the park family event in aid of Knockevin Special School  ","story":"ALL roads lead to Castlewellan Forest Park this Sunday for a special event to raise money for Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick and celebrate the benefits of cycling for everyone.The lsquocycle in the parkrsquo event is being organised by the schoolrsquos Parent Staff Association to raise funds to help purchase new bikes for pupils to help them experience nature and the great outdoors.Sundayrsquos all ability event mdash which runs from am until pm ndash is being billed as a celebration of cycling and will have something for families and special needs adventurers, hard core mountain bikers, club riders, children and young people.The event is being hosted by the Kilmegan Velo Cycling Club with its chairman, Sean Warnock, inviting all cyclists to make their way to the forest park for the event.He said: ldquoThe aim is to get families and friends to experience cycling in a safe setting but full of adventure and we have events for all abilities.ldquoThere will be family trail quests, agility skills for kids, a full time-trial on the red trails, special needs bikes and a Sunday club fuel stop.

A corporate body has almost been directed to include a political representative on its deputation. This will create tensions which this council and district can do without.Mr Sean Quinnthought it was ldquorather arrogant of the minister to make the suggestion and he believed that Mr Powell was like previous South Down MPs, who, he said, had not satisfactorily served the constituency.Official Unionist councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, said she would resent it as much as anybodyshe felt the councilrsquos powers were being usurped, but on this occasion she thought it was only natural that Mr Powell should join the deputation.She told councillors: ldquoMr Powell has worked consistently very hard for all sections of the community and nobody could accuse him of working for one party or another. He is one of the best constituency MPs at Westminster.A motion by Mrs Smyth to invite Mr Powell on the deputation was defeated by nine votes to seven mdash a defeat which did not go down well with Official Unionist, Mr William Finlay, who told the SDLP members: ldquoThat was just a political vote. You are not worried whether people in the district get a job or not.BALLYNAHINCH mdash The streets of Ballynahinch will have Christmas lighting this year mdash at leastthe townrsquos Chamber of Commerce have their way.At a well attended meeting of the Chamber on Tuesday evening, it was unanimously agreed to purchase the lights in an effort to brighten the townrsquos main thoroughfare for the festive season.Whether they are erected and illuminated, stress the Chamber, now depends entirely on the business community and townspeople of Ballynahinch.This step forward was made possible by support from a number of traders in the town and the exhaustion of the chamberrsquos present funds.The Ballynahinch committee feel that what other towns in the locality have achieved they can emulated.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Councillor Mr Eamon OrsquoNeill said this week he is still hopeful that some industry can be attracted to the vacant factories at Castlewellan and Annsborough.Mr OrsquoNeill, who has been fighting for Government intervention since the factories closed last month, revealed that efforts have been made to attract new industries.He told a meeting of Down councillors that although nothing had yet happened, he believed that the efforts to attract new industries had been lsquoconscientiousrsquo.ldquoIt is a lamentable situation with two factories lying idle but I still remain hopeful that something will come out of it, said Mr OrsquoNeill.MOURNES mdash A planned motor cycle competition on the slopes of Slieve Donard in Newcastle has been turned down by local councillors.Councillors agreed on Monday that the event would encourage the improper use of the Mourne Mountains because it was planned in an area of outstanding natural beauty.ldquoEvents such as this should be discouraged to preserve the amenities of the area, said a council spokesman.The event, called lsquoEndeavour Motor Cyclersquo, was to have been staged by the Mourne Motor Cycle Club.DOWNPATRICK mdash Army bomb experts carried out a controlled explosion on an explosive device which had been placed on a windowsill of the Northern Bank at the junction of St Patrickrsquos Avenue and Market Street, Downpatrick, on Thursday evening.Police received a call at .pm stating that there was a suspect device at the premises and the bomb experts were called in.

We need to build trust between everyone involved so that we can find practical ways forward to a safe and secure future.”Dr Denis McMahon, Permanent Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, welcomed the report which he said complements the department’s vision of “a living working active landscape, valued by everyone”.S Club : This is why Rachel Stevens

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their free dog welfare workshops, delivered as part of the Charity’s ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, enhance the National Curriculum and seek to provide children between the ages of seven and  years with the knowledge and understanding they need to act responsibly and safely around dogs in their homes and those they may see out and about.Each workshop benefits pupils by involving a pretend dog as its focus, with the aim of developing compassion and consideration for all living beings.Not only do children - whether dog owners or not - learn how to behave safely around dogs, they also learn all about the commitment involved in owning a dog through a creative and interactive learning experience.Last year, Cathy Clyde, Dogs Trust’s NI Education and Community Officer delivered workshops to , children. This year they are on track to improve on this number yet again. With the growing success of the ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, Dogs Trust now employs  education and community officers across the UK to provide workshops in their designated regions.Cathy said: “Through debate and discussion, our responsible dog ownership workshops encourage learners to embody important values around dog ownership such choosing the right breed or type of dog for your le style, as well as understanding that dogs are a lelong commitment and not a disposable commodity. I would welcome the opportunity to work with schools in the area and encourage them to get in touch, as pupils really do get a lot out of the workshops as do their dogs.”For more information about ‘Be Dog Smart’ visit www.bedogsmart.org.ukFor more information or to book a ‘Be Dog Smart’ workshop, contact Cathy Clyde on    or email cathy.clyde@dogstrust.org.ukFuneral details for Francis McCarville

A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glyn_121.jpg","title":"ni business leaders to outline major job creation plan at downing street and westminster","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland industry leaders will outline their plans to create tens of thousands of new jobs to Downing Street, hundreds of MPs and company leaders today as part of a major business delegation visiting London. Trade NI – the new alliance between Hospitality Ulster, Manufacturing NI and Retail NI – is unveiling a -year plan called ‘Vision ’ at a Westminster reception on Wednesday afternoon, as the UK’s political system enters its most volatile period in a generation. With just weeks before the UK is expected to leave the EU, more than  guests are confirmed to attend the event that will be addressed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith MP and the shadow Secretary of State, Tony Lloyd MP. Business leaders are also due to attend a later event at Downing Street, and a lunch at the Irish Embassy. Trade NI’s “transformative economic plan” will set out key policy priorities that have the potential to create , jobs and to make Northern Ireland a high growth economy. In a joint statement, Trade NIs Colin Neill , Stephen Kellyand Glyn Roberts , said: “Northern Ireland is facing a huge challenge as it struggles politically and economically with a growth forecast of around % or below. This is simply not good enough and we can’t sit idly by and let events overtake us. We must break the cycle of limited economic growth.” “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “We need to be bold and ambitious about creating % or even % growth over the next few years, but that requires decision makers to be pressed into action and a series of policy and legislative decisions to be taken and driven through. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer.” “Our Vision  document sets out a bold new ten-year plan for creating , new jobs and creating a high growth economy. We want to make Northern Ireland the best place in the UK and Ireland to shop, socialise, locate and start a business “The Vision  plan sets out to create a better ing business environment and attract further inward investment that will lead to a revitalised economy taking on the challenge in turbulent times.” “We want to make Northern Ireland an eco-system of innovation.Trade NI is keen to work with all business organisations, chambers of commerce, trade unions and voluntary sector representation to create a new progressive partnership for change in Northern Ireland.” And Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, sponsor of Trade NI’s Westminster reception, said: Danske Bank is proud to be one of the main sponsors of Trade NI’s Westminster reception. Trade NI is seizing the initiative and ensuring that the voice of the local business community is being heard loud and clear at a time of upheaval and uncertainty.” “The vibrancy of the Northern Ireland private sector is imperative to the strength of our economy and we need to ensure that local businesses are protected and well positioned to be able to compete globally in the post-Brexit environment.” Emma Gilthorpe, executive director, Heathrow Expansion, said: “Heathrow is delighted to support the launch of Trade NI, echoing Heathrow’s commitment to connect Northern Ireland to global growth and to share the benefits of an expanded Heathrow with the businesses and communities of Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/dm11.jpg","title":"tech entrepreneur named catalysts innovation founder","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by Ulster Business A top tech entrepreneur has been named as Catalyst’s Innovation Founder for  by a  of leading judges.
