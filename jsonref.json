Share buybacks could be negotiated with lenders.Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “It is good to see the government continue to listen to business concerns and make improvements to existing schemes.“These important changes could make a real difference to larger firms in particular and alongside the other lending support schemes will help ensure that more businesses of all sizes get access to the finance they need to help weather this unprecedented economic storm.”Figures last week showed British businesses have so far received almost £15bn of emergency financial aid through government-backed rescue loans with successful applications from more than 304,000 companies.This left 36,000 firms to borrow £6bn-worth of funds through the Cbils scheme and only £359m of loans to be agreed through the coronavirus large business interruption loan scheme. A further £18.7bn was borrowed through theCCFF loan scheme."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/268674c24c2292d7c484a0e40c226c8730a331be/210_0_7869_4724/master/7869.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b54721208758d0d9e742cb993a50b01","title":"britain trust coronavirus government pandemic public","story":"No government could have been completely ready for the pandemic, but taking the public for fools has destroyed all trust Waves of panic radiate from the government. Each day ministers sent out to steady the ship in press conferences and broadcast studios tip it a bit closer to capsizing. Asking Michael Gove to soothe the teachers on Sunday with his, “Teachers will be safe in schools” line was about as reassuring to those he called “the blob” as Chitty Chitty Bang Bang’s Child Catcher summoning children from their cellars. When there are differences of opinion between scientists on what counts as safe, only honesty about what is in doubt earns political trust. But daily, they blow their credibility away.Paralysis during their leader’s brush with death has given way since his return to alarm at their helmsman’s zigzag steering. His 13-minute address to the nation did more to hole the ship than buoy it in public opinion. No efforts were made to ease in his new back-to-work message. Without consulting teachers, care home managers, mayors or leaders of the other nations, of course he faced a backlash. Stay alert? It hasn’t exactly tripped off ministerial tongues since then.Boris Johnson swept to power on brilliant messaging, his spinners turning straw to electoral gold with “Take back control” and “Get Brexit done”, but all that’s gone. He likes to be liked, yet approval ratings are tumbling: Opinium polls showed a +42 net approval rating for his handling of the virus in March that has fallen to -3. YouGov’s +51 net approval rating on 27 March has plunged to -2. Keir Starmer’s personal rating overtook Johnson’s last week. The government was sent into a flat spin by Starmer’s trouncing of Johnson at prime minister’s questions over the appalling care home death rates.Fresh from a mega-victory and an age from the next election, why should the government panic? Because serial bungles, missteps, policy reversals and a vanishing connection with honesty risk damaging it beyond repair. No one knows all the right numbers yet, but trust shrinks when the government misuses them anyway. After Prof Tim Spector warned that Britain’s failure to list all 14 primary symptoms of the virus meant between 50,000 and 70,000 people with Covid-19 were wrongly not being told to self-isolate, the government dashed to add “loss of sense of smell” to its official list of symptoms. But expressing uncertainty is alien to ministers who were selected for an absolutist Brexit cast of mind.One report last week said that Johnson had warned the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers that they faced an agile opposition and a “slippery opponent”. How revealing: there’s nothing slippery about Starmer. But Johnson, captain of the chancers with his hand-picked crew of fly-by-nights, fibbers and fabricators, fears being shown up in unflattering contrast to Labour’s frontbench of serious, earnest policy heavyweights. Politics is not a game for them, as it always has been for Johnson, but he’s bereft when his old bluster can’t beguile away deaths.Trust is ebbing away just when it’s most needed to persuade anxious parents to send their children to school it’s frittered away on slippery pledges made to fill front pages for a day, but that are bound to be exposed soon after. We could walk down the well-trodden path: the government tacking wildly between herd immunity, tracking and tracing, then neither tracking nor testing, then locking down, then relaxing it but only to visit estate agents and garden centres, but not family. “Only following the science,” ministers claim, or as one wit put it, the political science. But they get that political science badly askew.Take Matt Hancock’s dumbfounding claim on Friday: “Right from the start we’ve tried to throw a protective ring around our care homes … we’ve made sure care homes have the resources they need.” What sentient voter doesn’t know that to be a flat-out lie? No testing and no PPE, as care homes – some close to bankruptcy – were pressured to take untested, possibly infected, hospital patients, without enough doctors, staff, training or isolation space. Taking the public for fools destroys trust.No government could have been fully ready as the tsunami of horror swept in. No reasonable voter would have expected everything to have been waiting, just in case. True, a decade of cuts had left us exceptionally unprepared and the government preferred failed private companies to handle PPE, testing and tracing over better equipped local authorities. Yet it might have kept the public’s trust with honesty and transparency, consulting everyone, publishing everything, admitting failures.But on it goes, the absurd targets missed and lied about, graphs of global comparisons hastily dropped. Hancock promises all staff and residents of care homes will be tested by early June – but will that be every week, with prompt results?“Following the science” often means ducking behind the scientists to let them take the flak: Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government’s chief scientific adviser, and Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, are, after all, civil servants, not independent. The most hapless figure giving cover to ministers has been the deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries. Before lockdown she backed Johnson’s plan not to ban large gatherings, noting: “We’ve looked at what sorts of interventions might help manage this as we go forward, push the peak of the epidemic forward, and in general, those sorts of events and big gatherings are not seen to be something which is going to have a big effect. So we don’t want to disrupt people’s lives.” She defended a fatal halt to tracking and tracing: “There comes a point in a pandemic where that is not an appropriate intervention.” She called the UK “an international exemplar in preparedness” and told doctors to have a “more adult” conversation about the lack of PPE. She reiterated advice that it was “very unlikely” care homes would be infected.This government of world-class spinners and top-dollar public opinion manipulators are learning nothing: on Friday Hancock’s disingenuous figures on how many tests had been carried out – almost double the number of iniduals actually tested – were instantly tripped up by the BBC’s Reality Check. As trust evaporates, why keep setting new targets the government will miss?Politicians in a panic grab for two life rafts: internal fall guys and public enemies. Internally cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill is taking a beating, while Hancock protests it’s not fair he’s being blamed. But finding public enemies is their favourite of the two. Despite a surge of public appreciation, the BBC is battered in the rightwing press. Teachers were set up for the enemy role, and are being bounced into opening schools at an arbitrary date. Gove extols the Danes for a smooth reopening: they did it with extensive union consultation. When the British Medical Association backed the teachers, doctors came under attack: that certainly won’t end well.Local authorities and the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations are as ever cast as enemies, too, with none of them consulted. But if “levelling up” is still Johnson’s aim, councils ask why extra funds are flowing to richer places rather than poorer ones – for example, to Wiltshire more than to Knowsley on Merseyside. Sadiq Khan, meanwhile, is the Tories’ favoured regular enemy, as they force him to raise public transport fares in London.But political aggression towards public servants is as tin-eared a response to public sentiment as Priti Patel’s refusal to lift the £625-a-year NHS surcharge on foreign health and care staff for the privilege of caring for us: doesn’t she hear the clapping? Brexit negotiations heading for no deal are, ministers hope, a winner – but they may not succeed in hiding chaos at the ports and a fall in GDP amid the coronavirus economic crisis.Everything about this low-grade, callow crew makes them the most unfit government in living memory to cope with this great crisis. Rishi Sunak has done well to spray the meltdown with money, but his real test is still to come. For the rest, they learn nothing from their errors, eroding any trust in the notion that their prime motive might be serving the public’s best interest, not saving their own skins. Boris Johnson looks an ever more inadequate figurehead for their floundering ship."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ae422e6d461c913b7132f8142dc7d4622abad3d/0_23_5448_3270/master/5448.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e19936226085f7c1a2e7559be0d7bc1","title":"sage advice britain coronavirus science government policy","story":"The public deserves to know what happened in the secretive scientific debates that have informed government policyA week ago Jeremy Hunt, the chair of the health select committee review of the UK’s Covid-19 response, said that some actions represented “the biggest failure of scientific advice to ministers in our lifetime”.On Saturday, however, when Sir Mark Walport, chief executive of UK Research and Innovation, and another core member of Sage, was asked the same question on Radio 4’s Today programme, he responded differently. “Advice from the scientific community was always to test as much as possible,” he said. It was a question of logistics – the capacity wasn’t there. In other words, Walport saw no failure of scientific advice to government ministers – simply a failure of people in labs and Public Health England to respond to the scientific advice.This is odd because on 15 March he was interviewed on Sky News and made no mention of a testing strategy to reduce transmission: he defended continuation of mass gatherings and the UK’s “world-class” modelling for the outbreak. Later, when interviewed again on 29 March, he said social distancing was the best way to reduce transmission and that testing was needed only for health workers, and for when outbreaks flared up. He also wanted a balance between “clamping down” and keeping the economy going. The best advice, he said, was “coming from the modelling community”.This question about testing policy is far more than a matter of bureaucratic sophistry. The government’s decision on 12 March, when the UK had 590 confirmed active cases and nine deaths, led to the uncontained explosion of the Covid-19 epidemic. Imperial College London researchers have estimated the baseline R value – the rate at which people are passing on infections to others – at that time to have been just below four. Between 12 and 24 March, when the national lockdown started, cases exploded. By 28 March, Imperial researchers estimate that more than 1.8 million people in Britain were infected. The official death toll in the UK from Covid-19 stands at nearly 35,000 people, though estimates from the Financial Times put the number of lives lost at more than 62,000.Grieving families need to know what advice was given and how it was acted on. I have repeatedly called for a rapid and no-blame audit of Sage advice, to take the pressure off its members, so that we can learn the lessons from the scientific debates that might have led to well-intentioned misjudgments.It’s clear that in the early stages of the outbreak, Sage was over-focused on using pandemic influenza as a guideline – a virus with a much lower death rate, a lower R value (around 1.3) and a short incubation period, which makes testing redundant. Its modelling and behavioural subcommittees were labelled with the prefix SPI – scientific pandemic influenza groups. And its rigid contain-delay-research-mitigate strategy comes from the influenza handbook. But this was coronavirus not flu. And it simply didn’t listen to advice from the World Health Organization’s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who, when declaring a pandemic on 11 March, said: “The idea that countries should shift from containment to mitigation is wrong and dangerous.”Understanding these discussions and decisions must come from the accurate, full and public release of the Sage meeting minutes from 28 January up to the present day. And from the evidence of Sage academics who volunteered their time and expertise. This can be done without blame or pointing fingers. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, said the minutes would be released when the epidemic is over – we are coming towards the end of the coronavirus surge, so that time is now.Sage has been bedevilled by a lack of transparency and balance. If independent public health experts had not been excluded from the core committee, which is dominated by modellers, virologists, clinical academics and behavioural scientists, the influenza-driven “herd immunity” strategy might not have materialised. If the blame is now subtly being shifted to public health colleagues by core members of Sage, then this heightens the necessity for full transparency. MPs and the scientific community should press for the unredacted release of meeting minutes immediately.Those minutes have assumed greater importance given the slow and fragmented response by the UK in mounting a sustainable and locally integrated system for finding, testing, tracing and isolating Covid-19 cases. Four months into this epidemic, we are not even close to having a system ready for lifting the lockdown. As an editorial in last week’s British Medical Journal declared: “Meaningless political soundbites promising to recruit 18,000 contact tracers, test 200,000 people a day, or invest in unjustified contact tracing apps, ert focus and could lead to more deaths.”The government has thus far provided the names of 60 contributors to Sage – but its core decision-making group should also be listed. Over the last two months, the British public has complied with social distancing meticulously. It has witnessed, at first hand, the greatest public health disaster in a century, and the deaths of thousands of innocent people, including more than 180 health workers and volunteers, and more than 200 care workers. The public deserves the hard data, scientific opinions and the minutes of Sage meetings – not recollections in the media from senior members – to help us all understand how we got here.• Anthony Costello is professor of global health at UCL, and a former director at the World Health Organization"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f1f9528877d89ff3a50de0f2aaae5813ff0c294/0_107_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4832b233b984d01715388fa329eace2a","title":"we should be overhauling the school system not rushing to send children back","story":"The ease with which exams were ditched shows that we could craft a model built around emotional and social development, not constant invigilationThe hierarchy of who cares most about lovely little children is confusing. Parents, I would have thought, are up there. Except the bad ones who are not home schooling, have not bought several laptops and are frantically trying to manage working at home, too.Then there are the awful ones who have to go out to work. Do they not care? Some, like me, have sacrificed their children for their political principles and sent their kids to state schools. I always love this phrase: it is wonderful that my children are still alive despite my attempt to serve them up as offerings to the fake household gods of fairness.Then there are the teachers who could be “heroes”, but are reverting to type as some kind of communists as they do not want schools to open just yet. Strangely, they are supported by many doctor heroes, who we presume do care.I heard an interview with a teacher who is also a parent and does not feel safe going back to work. I nearly malfunctioned, because, in the current discourse, this is a category error. Good teacherbad parent or bad teachergood parent?Even though I have tried to stay alert, I need some guidelines about who is the enemy of the people now. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, doing “caring” is alarming enough. “We owe it to the children” to open schools, apparently. Then along comes Michael Gove, who told local authorities unsure about all this: “If you really care about children, you’ll want them to be in schools. You will want them to be learning. You will want them to have new opportunities. So look to your responsibilities.”I can only conclude that I don’t really care about children, then, because, no, I don’t want kids to be in primary school by 1 June. Nor do people in many other parts of the UK, especially where the virus is still to peak. This date is only a target in England, with Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish schools all expected to reopen after the summer holidays. Many teachers are worried not only for themselves, but also for what they might pass on to their families many parents do not want their children used in an experiment on contagion.As far as we know, children tend not to suffer badly with the virus, while a study in Australia has suggested that they are not significant vectors of infection. But that is one study and “the science” is an ever-expanding, moving body. We do not know enough.We do know, however, that the physical distancing required seems almost impossible with the youngest schoolchildren. Do we pick them up when they fall over? Why can they bring in lunch boxes but not pencil cases? All these details have to be ironed out in very little time.Of course I see that year 6s and primary 7s need to say goodbye to their friends before they move on to secondary school. Of course I see that teachers can identify the most vulnerable kids in reception, year 1 and primary 1. But none of this is to do with education as such. Schools have to be reopened as giant creches to get adults back to work so the economy can go back to “normal”.This is an illusion of control and normality from a government that has failed to care. Education has always been one way in which the elite has bypassed the state. The NHS cannot be bypassed, because private medicine provides few ICUs. Teachers are a far easier group to demonise. Gove was always at war with “the Blob”, egged on by his overextended Spads, such as Henry de Zoete. He got burnt out working for Gove and once tried a week teaching in a primary school: “I realised that I couldn’t do it.” Really? I thought any fool could teach.Reopening schools requires trust between local authorities, teachers and parents, but the government is packed full of those who have systematically undermined that trust and denigrated teaching. Telling people they are safe is not the same as making them feel safe.Now is the time to re-evaluate the ideology that has driven the system. The sudden ditching of exams may have repercussions, but the ease with which it was done could point us in a new direction. We want to get children back to school for their social wellbeing as well as for their consumption of information. Kids miss their friends.We need to ask what education is for. Lockdown has exacerbated every inequality. Richer families spend much more time on schoolwork than poorer ones and are more likely to send their kids back to school. We hold on to the idea that education is the route out of poverty, but school is only one factor in this.The emotional and social development of our children is paramount, not a rushed, unsafe return to constant invigilation. Teachers are not childminders, nor are they risk-averse. You try standing up in front of 30 15-year-olds.As a strategy, alienating “the Blob” is as dumb as comparing the virus to a mugger to be rugby tackled. But what do I know? I have not had the benefit of the most physically distanced form of education – a top boarding school. Strangely, these will not be required to open in two weeks’ time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/216bc73ce7414857860cc502ff5a546079641d02/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34361b9c4957e064b30eae02e28fd3a8","title":"second coronavirus wave r number uk test and trace mass gatherings travel","story":"Outbreaks don’t follow a straightforward pattern. To minimise risk, we must limit mass gatherings and deploy proper testingAs the UK begins to ease lockdown restrictions, attention has turned to the prospect of a second wave of coronavirus cases. In Germany, where shops and restaurants have tentatively reopened, the reproduction number R has risen to 1.1. In Seoul, a recent outbreak of at least 170 infections has been linked to five bars and nightclubs. Even in South Korea, one of the most successful countries at controlling the virus, there’s no room for complacency.As a veterinary epidemiologist, I study how viruses spread between animals and animal populations. The principles of viral transmission are much the same in humans (indeed, many scientists work on both). The concept of a second wave in public health is often linked to factors outside of human control. This might include the birth of infants who are susceptible to a particular disease causing the wavelike patterns we see in childhood illnesses, or environmental factors that influence the seasonality of influenza. But for Covid-19, the anticipation of a second wave has more to do with actions within our control.Shifts in social behaviour create more opportunities for human contact. In China, the entry of people with coronavirus across the Russian border is one example where easing restrictions resulted in new cases of the virus. Meanwhile in Germany, outbreaks of coronavirus linked to abattoirs where employees live in poor housing conditions is a reminder that the R number can also increase when vulnerable iniduals are exposed to the virus for the first time.The potential rise in R after lockdown measures are relaxed is something that epidemiologists are well aware of. If the government delivers an effective testing and contact-tracing strategy that can bring the virus under control by the time lockdown measures are lifted for everyone, new cases of Covid-19 would theoretically be little cause for concern – as health authorities would have measures in place to identify and curb incipient outbreaks.What’s of greater concern to epidemiologists are indications that the R number is rising uncontrollably, or in a way that increases the exposure of the most vulnerable or puts health systems under great strain. In other words, what’s as important as the R number is the total number of cases across a population that an increase in R would cause. While the increase in Germany’s R number is concerning, this would be far more alarming were it to occur in the UK, where there are currently many more cases of coronavirus.Regional differences in the value of R are also important. Easing the lockdown in areas with greater health resources, fewer Covid-19 cases and where more people have already had the virus, may be practical compared with another part of the country where outcomes of an increasing R would be more severe. Differences in the R number among particular risk groups, such as care home residents, are also likely to be more meaningful than the value of R for the country as a whole. Again, we’ll need a widespread programme of testing and tracing to determine these risks, and enable health authorities to rapidly contain incipient outbreaks.For Covid-19, a single contact can endanger an otherwise isolated community. Once an infection is introduced, the results can be disastrous. In network science, this pattern is described as a “small-world” effect. The concept originated from the idea that iniduals with apparently little in common often have connections they are unaware of. What this means for public health is that even if only a handful of people have the potential to expose other communities to disease risk, in communities that are geographically distant or isolated, the impact of those few people on the spread of a virus can be significant. In the case of coronavirus, many areas in the UK have only experienced small outbreaks so far, creating fewer opportunities for the effects of “herd immunity” to curb the risk of a future outbreak.To understand why mass gatherings are so important for infection, we can use a second concept borrowed from network science, that of “scale-free networks”. This is when some iniduals in a network have a disproportionate number of contacts compared with the average. Gatherings are one context in which a single inidual who is infected with Covid-19 could have many more contacts with other people than average. Emerging scientific research suggests that some iniduals may be responsible for infecting many more people than others. One crucial question, which scientists haven’t yet answered, is whether these patterns are driven by more contact or differences in infectiousness.Mass gatherings become more significant if such events occur frequently, with at least some of the same iniduals returning repeatedly to the same place. This is often the case for scheduled football matches or religious services, both of which occur weekly – an interval conveniently similar to the time it takes a person infected with coronavirus to become infectious to others. Gatherings both increase the opportunities to become infected and increase the chances of infecting other people. If a few people who are infected with coronavirus come into contact with many others, the risk of a rapid spread can become uncontrollable. And some events present both kinds of risk: drawing in many people from great distances, and holding them together in close contact for an extended period.Lowering our chance of a second wave will require minimising the impact of both of these factors. This means restricting large gatherings, especially where iniduals might repeat these over the course of a single infection, and restricting movements over long distances, or those with a higher probability of putting vulnerable groups at risk. Crucially, it also means having in place a testing and tracing strategy that allows health authorities to identify new cases of Covid-19. These concepts are intuitive, but what network science tells us is that the risk associated with even a small change in patterns of human contact can be substantial.• Rowland Kao is the Sir Timothy O’Shea Professor of Veterinary Epidemiology and Data Science at the University of Edinburgh, and a coronavirus modeller with Scotland’s Health Protection Agency."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6070189afe34a01d9f6ded51f28270fc2a12c4c/0_188_5029_3017/master/5029.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfd9b9527ad0d3e42c387f667170fc4e","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of treasure","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘treasure’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘treasure’.Share your photos of what treasure means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 20 May at 10am.

I perceived them as two separate entities,” he says. “Then I thought, as I was aiming for headship maybe I would get some useful CPD out of the course, so I put my name down.” The course – the Courageous Leaders programme – set up in 2016 by Robinson, head of Hilltop Infant school, in Wickford, Essex, with money from the Department for Education’s equality and ersity fund, changed his life and helped him gain promotion. He is now head of two of the trust’s primary schools, Waterman primary and Stambridge primary, in Rochford, Essex he no longer hides his sexual orientation, and acts as a mentor on the programme.“It was only when I was put on the spot in a circle of people on the Courageous Leaders programme that I realised I was not being my true self,” says Saunders, 30. “We talked about different scenarios, such as whether you would bring your partner to the summer fete. I said no, I wouldn’t do – my partner is my home life and school is my job.“‘Why is it all right for the teacher next door to take their partner, but not you?’ I was asked. It challenged my thought processes and I realised that if I wanted to become an authentic leader I had to be open. By keeping my worlds separate, I wouldn’t achieve it.“I also felt a responsibility to the children to ensure that the teaching staff represented society,” he says.On paper, the UK is one of the world’s most liberal societies. Same-sex couples can marry, adopt children, enter into civil partnerships and can claim legal protection against discrimination from the 2010 Equality Act. In 2005 transgender people finally got the legal right to change gender.But the legacy of the Thatcher government’s section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988, repealed in 2003, lives on. It essentially forbade schools and local authorities from acknowledging that gay people existed, and even today high-profile cases of gay teachers being hounded by religious groups create a climate of fear.Robinson, who had hidden her own sexuality when she started teaching in the 1980s, started the Courageous Leaders programme because she believed LGBT teachers were missing out on promotion, as they were afraid to put their heads above the parapet.The year-long programme involves three days of face-to-face training, including lectures, guest speakers and workshops, with the aim of instilling leadership skills and boosting confidence through sharing experiences and mutual support.She summarises the success in a new book, Courage in the Classroom, that includes chapters by lesbian, gay and transgender teachers about overcoming prejudice and learning to be themselves.“At the end of the year, all but one of our 15 courageous leaders on the course had gained promotion,” she says. “They wanted support to acquire the skills to achieve that but, more importantly, they wanted a safe space to discuss their vulnerabilities, with colleagues who understood exactly how they felt about their sexuality and its impact on their career.” Catherine Lee, deputy dean for education at Anglia Ruskin University and the book’s editor, and also a leader on the programme, says changes to protect minorities at the macro level do not necessarily mean teachers feel any safer, or are included in their staffrooms and classrooms. She is donating profits from the book to the programme.“At the university we work with hundreds of schools and I am not aware of more than a handful of LGBT teachers in head or deputy-head roles. This is what the course is addressing,” says Lee, who left teaching in 2010 after a 20-year career when a parent claimed she was a bad influence for living with a female partner.“They are likely to live outside the catchment area, they don’t go to social events, they sometimes even avoid the staffroom because they don’t want to talk about what they did at the weekend,” she says.“What those on the Courageous Leaders course tell us they appreciate most are the networking opportunities, being able to check in with each other and get support. If there had been a group like that when I was teaching in schools it would have helped tremendously.” One LGBT teacher mentioned in the book is Catherine Halliwell, who helped students set up an LGBT society at her girls’ grammar school, Nonsuch in Sutton, Surrey.“I got an email from 15-year-old students asking if I would support them setting up an LGBT society. It was very much student-led and had a big impact. It didn’t all happen at once, lots of little steps added up and now we have a pride week in July with LGBT flags in reception and an LGBT film festival,” Halliwell says.The society’s founder, Cerian Craske, 20, now studying English at Cambridge, recalls it started with about 20 girls meeting in an IT room on a Wednesday lunchtime.“Then we put on things such as the big gay bake sale and it really took off and attracted girls of all ages and their friends, who came to support them,” she says. “It was an amazing thing for the school to support LGBT students and teachers so they were able to be themselves. It was so important to me that I could see an adult who was LGBT and having a happy life.”Alex Townsend, deputy head of Bedford sixth form college, attributes his promotion in January to the confidence he gained on the course to be himself.“I jumped from business studies teacher straight to deputy head and I can’t credit the programme enough for what it did to show me that I could use my ersity positively, rather than hide it,” says Townsend, 31.“The biggest thing for me was the very first five minutes of the first day when I found myself in a room full of gay teachers for the first time. That would have been profound in itself, without all the training we had and the amazing speakers.” He says: “I never used to be comfortable wearing a rainbow. I’m ambitious and I had always resisted the idea that my sexual orientation could inform any part of my progress through life. To my detriment, I had gone to the other extreme by not allowing it to be part of it in any way.“All that changed when I met other people on the course. I came back to college and started an LGBT social group for students and then set up a scheme of LGBT pastoral support officers. I don’t have to walk down the street in a parade to make a difference – I can do it where I work.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a96bb755c2a7ffc9629e0bd5c863277b679baab/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85250ca977db445cab1d69afc6d09cec","title":"coronavirus offers chance to create fairer uk food supply chain say experts","story":"A radical 10-year plan should draw on community crisis responses to fix ‘faultlines in our food system’A radical 10-year recovery plan for the UK food system should draw on local and community responses to the Covid-19 crisis to create a more erse, sustainable and fairer supply chain, say experts.The pandemic exposed fragility in the food supply system: farmers poured away more than a million litres of milk, supermarket shelves were stripped of flour while millers were unable to sell it, and potato farmers were forced to hoard stocks. Meanwhile, food banks faced unprecedented demand as household incomes plummeted.Sue Pritchard, the chief executive of the Food, Farming and Countryside Commission, said: “The pandemic has exposed the faultlines in our food system.“We’ve seen big gaps in availability of food, especially for the poor and vulnerable, and significant economic impacts on producers. This crisis demonstrates that people and business are ready to build back better.”Prof Tim Lang, whose new book Feeding Britain exposes the fragility of the UK food system before Covid-19 struck, said the crisis has concentrated power even more into the hands of the supermarkets.“This reduced economic ersity by hammering other supply chains and wasted vast resources. It’ll be hard to rein back this concentration of power.”The crisis in food supplies caused by the pandemic came as the agriculture bill, the biggest change to British agriculture and food production since 1945, was reaching its final stages in the House of Commons.The Tenant Farmers Association is calling for the bill’s introduction to be delayed until 2022 while farmers, producers and experts reflect on the problems exposed by the pandemic.An inquiry has been set up by the environment, food and rural affairs committee to analyse how Covid-19 has affected the food system. In its evidence, the TFA said the crisis exposed how inflexible the system was. Farmers who supplied to restaurants and takeaways had their outlets cut off, and were unable to ert their produce to people who needed it.“At a time when consumers were queueing up at retailers keen to buy meat, dairy and fresh produce, it was unacceptable that this demand was unfulfilled despite the fact that sufficient quantities of food were available in the country.”The TFA said the government had handed the monopoly to supermarkets in response to the crisis but the retailers had done little to change their buying patterns and source food from farmers whose markets had dried up. Some supermarkets sourced meat from Poland while British farmers were forced to stockpile.Pritchard said there were many examples of resilience in local communities which emphasised the need to build a more erse food system.Feedback, an environmental charity, said: “There is a chance for the government to treat this moment of crisis as an opportunity to reshape supply chains in ways that will be helpful in the long-term for supporting producers and reducing the environmental impacts of food production.”It is calling for the creation of a national food service to create a joined up and equitable approach to preparing and distributing meals at the local and community level.Anna Taylor, the executive director of the Food Foundation, said the Covid-19 pandemic was having a material impact on what millions of adults and children were able to eat.“We desperately need a social security system which protects everyone’s right to good food, now and in the future. The system must support those who have gone into this crisis already struggling, and the millions more who have been added to their number. What we eat remains fundamentally important for our health: we need to rebuild our food system so that good food, which helps us stay healthy, is the norm.”Minette Batters, the president of the National Farmers’ Union, which is calling for legal guarantees against imports from countries such as the the US with lower environmental and animal welfare standards, said the government must support British farmers. “There will be a danger – and this will be a continuing danger – that as we come back to normality, we do not want to see other product dumped on this marketplace,” she said in evidence to the environment, food and rural affairs committee.“I think that is a very live challenge. Government getting behind the ‘buy British’ message, and loving British food, is incredibly important.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5601d6e287abb8d9533b007c9e9b37bec54a20a4/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fda2e8ad330d35e06d3c8017de71dc9","title":"how renewable energy could power britains economic recovery","story":"Harnessing power from sun, wind and sea could spur UK’s post-pandemic economy while tackling climate crisis, say expertsIn the first months of 2020 Britain relied on renewable energy like never before. The power generated by clean energy projects eclipsed fossil fuels for the first time ever, making up almost half the electricity used to keep the lights on.As the UK emerges from the financial maelstrom of the coronavirus pandemic, analysts, economists and environmentalists argue that the renewable energy industry could – and should – play a greater role, powering a green economic recovery too.The companies harnessing energy from the sun, wind and sea hold the potential to spur the UK’s economy by attracting billions in investment and creating thousands of green jobs across the UK’s regions while accelerating Britain’s climate ambitions.Britain’s clean energy sector proved this point in the wake of the 2009 financial crisis. At the time Britain’s largest business group, the CBI, calculated that the green economy contributed a third of the UK’s economic growth in 2010-11.The CBI report concluded that the so-called “choice” between going green or going for growth was a false one because green business was already on track to become a major pillar of Britain’s future growth.“After the last financial crisis, the UK’s green economy contributed substantially to new fiscal growth, supporting tens of thousands of jobs and finding new export markets around the world,” says Nathan Bennett of RenewableUK.“Once again, our industry will play a proactive role in getting the economy back on track, as we move out of lockdown. Renewables are a UK-wide opportunity to have a sustainable, forward-looking recovery and to boost productivity across the economy.”Today, much of the risk shouldered by renewable energy investors a decade ago has fallen away alongside plummeting technology costs. The UK’s commitment to pursuing a carbon-neutral economy by 2050 alongside its established financial support frameworks offer far more certainty to willing investors than in the past.The investment case for renewables is flattered further by the relative gloom shrouding investment opportunities elsewhere: fossil fuels have fallen from favour among a growing number of investors due to climate concerns and the collapse of global market prices for oil, gas and coal in recent weeks.Economists believe the renewable energy industry’s hard-fought financial clout combined with public policy support could create an economic and employment juggernaut capable of spurring the UK’s post-pandemic recovery while tackling the climate crisis too.“The climate emergency has not gone away,” says Bennett. “If anything, the Covid-19 pandemic has underlined the need to make sure our economy is sustainable and resilient in the long term.”Globally renewable energy could power an economic recovery from Covid-19 by spurring global GDP gains of almost $100tn (£80tn) between now and 2050, compared with a business-as-usual scenario, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).Irena said the coronavirus outbreak had exposed “the deep vulnerabilities of the current system” and urged governments to invest in renewable energy to kickstart economic growth and help meet climate targets.Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, one of the UK’s biggest renewable energy investors, says it is no overstatement to say that “the economic and environmental advantages of investment in a green recovery are aligned as never before”.Scottish Power is poised to invest billions in the UK’s renewable energy industry in the coming years, including an onshore wind renaissance after the government’s U-turn on blocking financial support for onshore turbines.The investment plans mapped out by Scottish Power and other renewable energy giants have remained intact through the pandemic while oil majors have slashed billions from their spending plans and warned that job losses are likely later in the year.“The best thing about it is that you’re investing for the next 40 years in clean energy,” says Anderson. “There’s a whole load of other infrastructure work you could do in the UK, but the thing about investing in renewables is that it is just as good at creating jobs and kickstarting the economy - but the added benefit is that you’d be tackling climate change at the same time.”The Social Market Foundation believes there could be long-term benefits for workers too. The thinktank called last week for the government to help train those left jobless by the looming financial recession to work in the low-carbon economy. The government could spur the economy, accelerate its climate ambitions and help kickstart social mobility, it said.The “net zero” industries - which include clean energy, electricity networks, car-charging infrastructure and energy efficiency – could help provide new jobs for many of the 1.4 million people expected to be left unemployed following the pandemic.The SMF has estimated that in some parts of the country, the number of green jobs that need to be filled to meet the climate goal is equal to half the number of people who were unemployed before the coronavirus crisis.“There is a pressing need to provide better support for those who lose work in this crisis,” says Kathryn Petrie, the SMF’s chief economist. “But also an opportunity. A well-designed guarantee of work and training could protect people from lasting damage, support UK skills and support the greening of the economy.”But the potential upsides could still slip away without decisive action to grasp the opportunity to reset the UK economy on a sustainable green foundation.The International Energy Agency’s executive director, Fatih Birol, has called on governments to devise stimulus plans that put the green energy agenda at the heart of the economic recovery. Anderson says there is not a moment to lose.“This is our message to the government: now is the time to do it. Investors are very keen to push money this way, and into these projects. The UK has a fantastic opportunity to grab a huge slice of the world’s renewable energy investment today. Now is the time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbf5e130d0d1d1c9d49292ce3dc809b098432bd7/0_0_5636_3383/master/5636.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c22d3828e69036f9de094a5715d58e81","title":"renewable energy investors increasingly look to uk says report","story":"Decision to lift blocks on wind and solar projects has boosted ‘attractiveness’ rankingThe UK has become more attractive to renewable energy investors following the government’s decision to lift its block on financial support for onshore wind and solar projects.Britain has climbed the rankings of a biannual global survey of investors to take the sixth spot in EY’s “attractiveness index” for renewable energy ahead of a major clean energy auction next year.The auditing giant said the government’s decision to include onshore wind and solar energy projects in the auction had helped the UK climb one rung on the rankings list, to just below Germany, Australia, France, China and the US.The US topped the rankings for the first time since 2016 – in spite of the federal government’s ongoing support for fossil fuels – in large part due to plans to invest $57bn (£47bn) to install up to 30GW of offshore wind by 2030.China has fallen from the top of the rankings to second place as Beijing looks to wean the market off subsidies, and the coronavirus pandemic cut its growing appetite for energy.“Certainly, renewable energy is not immune to the economic disruption being wrought,” said Ben Warren, the author of EY’s report. “But many of these effects are likely to be short-term. Already, manufacturers in China and Europe are restarting production. Utilities have worked hard to keep generation going in difficult circumstances. And power demand will rebound as economies get back to work.”He said investors remain confident in “the long-term picture for clean energy”.“The need, after the pandemic, to ensure greater economic and social resilience will work in favour of distributed power sources, such as wind and solar, and the applications offered by battery storage,” he said.The UK’s decision to remove a block against onshore wind projects earlier this year followed a government pledge to cut emissions to virtually zero by 2050 – a feat that its official climate advisers believe will require a tripling of the UK’s onshore wind-power capacity in the next 15 years.Renewable energy developers are working towards the 2021 auction, despite the uncertainty created by the coronavirus pandemic, to help spur a green economic recovery once lockdown measures are lifted.Luke Clark, of RenewableUK, said EY’s report is right to highlight the economic opportunity offered by renewables after the pandemic.“Our sector’s plans to invest tens of billions of pounds in vital new energy infrastructure all over the country have not changed, and the government is supporting our work as it remains committed to reaching its legally-binding target of net zero emissions,” he said.“The UK’s low-carbon economy will stimulate new growth, boost productivity and support tens of thousands of jobs as we work on projects at home and secure new export opportunities around the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/609e1079ab7988fd7eeabb7202381c4846842199/172_6_936_561/master/936.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d5a543b91ad2b3ad641c176cbf36669","title":"bfi films for under fives","story":"The BFI Player has put up a selection of films from decades past aimed at an audience more used to the allure of YouTube. Who’ll be the winner?It has been roughly one billion years since the schools closed. Your strict rules about screen-time limits have long since melted away to nothing, and now your children have watched everything. They’ve completed CBeebies. They’ve massacred Netflix. They dipped their toes into Disney+, but you pulled the plug when you realised how retrospectively awful it all is. If it wasn’t for YouTube, and its limitless fan-made videos of Sonic the Hedgehog cartoons reacting to different Sonic the Hedgehog cartoons, you’d be at a total loss.But help is now at hand. BFI Player, a streaming service that we should all be making much more noise about, has just launched a free Fives and Under collection, throwing open its freshly digitised archives to offer your young ones something fun and intelligent to watch.At least this is the theory. The collection, apparently road-tested on the curators’ own children, is stunningly varied. On one hand, you have a silent 10-minute retelling of Alice in Wonderland from 1903 on the other, there’s Molar Mischief, a two-minute toothpaste commercial from 1946, in which a stop-motion policeman crawls around in someone’s mouth intimidating germs.Again, in theory, there is something for everyone here. But had BFI Player considered the aggressively microscopic attention s of my own two children, aged five and two? There was only one way to find out. If they liked it, great. If they didn’t like it, it’d still count as a day’s worth of home-schooling. Here’s what I chose for them.1. X Rays (1897)A one-minute silent film in which a couple are filmed with an X-ray camera and promptly turn into skeletons.A word of advice: if you’re going to show the BFI Player to your children who have grown up in an age of video calls that can magically turn your face into a sentient pizza slice, maybe don’t start with a film that hinges on what is now a relatively pedestrian special effect. “But this is 120 years old!” I told my kids. “How do you think the people changed into skeletons?” This was met with silence, shrugs and an unusually heartfelt plea to watch something that had Sonic the Hedgehog in it.2. Bunty the Bouncing Bassoon (1963)A colourful, six-minute George Moreno animation about Bunty, a bassoon that bounces.Next, I tried something more overtly colourful. And Bunty the Bouncing Bassoon is truly beautiful a slice of gorgeous mid-century animation that unfortunately doesn’t have much of a story. There is a bassoon. He bounces. Some people sing about how he bounces. Then he stands in a cinema and presents the audience with the lyrics of the song about how he bounces. It’s a bit like watching the opening credits for a cartoon, except the credits happen to last for six full minutes. My five-year-old remained engaged for the bulk of the duration. My two-year-old, on the other hand, was a harder sell. “It’s horrible,” he told me two minutes in. “Are you sure?” I asked. “HORRIBLE,” he screamed.3. How the Whale Got His Throat (1981) A 10-minute cartoon adaptation of Rudyard Kipling’s Just So story, commissioned for French television but made in South ShieldsNow this was much more like it. The bright colours and Sheila Graber’s sing-song narration grabbed my kids’ attention from the outset, and they both made it all the way to the end. My two-year-old enjoyed pointing out all the fish, and my five-year-old kept asking questions about the plot all the way through. It’s a little rough around the edges, but it’s a charming little film. There are more of Graber’s Just So Stories on BFI Player. Something tells me we’ll watch them all.4. Falling in the Water (1973)A Charley Says public information film about the dangers of playing on riverbanks.Now, there is a chance that my own nostalgic excitement at seeing a perfectly preserved piece of my own childhood played a part in my children’s enjoyment of this. But still, this had them hooked. I’m not sure whether or not the public information message of the film sank in – especially with my two-year-old, who very stubbornly refuses to learn the concept of fear – but they did spend the rest of the day mimicking Charley the cat’s strangled yowl of a meow. So that was fun.5. That Noise (1961) Roobarb director Bob Godfrey animates performance artist Bruce Lacey as he pulls faces and sings a song about an irritating noise that only he can hear.This is a film about someone essentially having a nervous breakdown, and my children reacted accordingly. They were nowhere near the screen by the time it ended, and it took an exhausting amount of persuasion to get them back onside. It’s a shame because, had they stuck it out, they would have seen the bit where Lacey looks as if he’s about the say the word “shit” and then doesn’t.6. A Colour Box (1935)New Zealand-born artist Len Lye paints abstract shapes directly on to a strip of film for four minutes, and weirdly this is an advert for the Post OfficeWe end our experiment with the weirdest film of the lot. A Colour Box is beautiful, but it is just mindless squiggles on a screen that – hilariously – ends with a message about how to affordably mail parcels. By this point my kids have entirely removed themselves from the screen, with my five-year-old trying to present a Super Mario walkthrough video to me with the same care and attention that I had when presenting him with a 120-year-old experimental film. So in that sense it was probably a success. And we will return to the BFI Player, if only to watch more public safety films from the 1970s."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cec25862e0f4a51877fa6dae999a5b5326810f3/0_207_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b6136c76f2c02395cdda75e92bb6060","title":"my favourite film aged 12 dirty dancing","story":"Patrick Swayze’s dance instructor Johnny swept me off my feet when I was an awkward teenager. Would I still have the time of my life rewatching this feelgood classic?Growing up, there weren’t many films that I had watched so many times that I knew not just the lines but also the songs off by heart, but Dirty Dancing was one of them. I was way too young to see it at the cinema when it first came out in 1987, but caught it a few years later on TV, recording it on to a VHS tape so I could replay my favourite scenes. I was thrilled. I was a bookish kid who felt intensely shy and awkward. And there on my screen was a not-that-shy but definitely studious and awkward teenager being swept off her feet, literally, by Patrick Swayze.That’s pretty much where any similarities with Frances “Baby” Houseman, played by Jennifer Grey, end. I wasn’t from a well-off family, didn’t go on fancy holidays and couldn’t dance to save my life. But living in a drab town in the deepest suburbs of Surrey, I did know what it was like to be bored with your perfectly fine but humdrum life and hanker for something more exciting, however briefly. Although I was only 12 so my options were limited. Dance was Baby’s escape, mine was the film. And the story of her holiday romance with dance instructor Johnny Castle (Swayze) transported me to a world of 1960s nostalgia and great music.Rewatching it many years later, it didn’t take me long to remember why I had loved it so much. It’s the first time we – and Baby, who has just arrived with her family to Kellerman’s resort in the Catskill mountains – see Johnny in action. He’s not so much dancing with his super flexible partner Penny as melding into her as they show off their skills in a packed ballroom. The effect is electrifying. The dance sequences throughout the film are equally as thrilling flitting between sweet and playful to flirty and sexy and then downright raunchy. I have always adored a good dance movie – I’m a sucker for a sassy shake of the hip and a well-choreographed musical number.But the main reason that VHS tape was played over and over again when I was 12 was that Dirty Dancing was one of the most swooningly romantic films I’d seen in my young life. After Baby breaks the ice by sneaking into a secret staff party – “I carried a watermelon!” (see, awkward) – Johnny starts to teach her how to dance and slowly mambos his way into her heart. The chemistry between Grey and Swayze is magnetic. She is supremely likable as the naive and opinionated daddy’s girl while Swayze is effortlessly charismatic as the rock star of the holiday resort with his leather jacket and bad-boy attitude.I was pleasantly surprised to be reminded that the film wasn’t just teen fluff. Sure, it has its fair share of saccharine moments but there’s real substance, too. There are subplots involving more serious issues such as abortion and the class conflict that bristles between the hard-up dance crew and the snobbish young waiters from rich families. Baby’s sister Lisa starts dating one of the latter, Robbie, who turns out to be a creep.Something else I’d forgotten is just how feminist it is. Baby is smart, has a strong moral compass and genuinely wants to help other people. She stands up to her disapproving dad, who is angry that she’s been seeing her working-class lover behind his back, with a moving speech about inequality. And Johnny may scoop her out of a corner but it’s Baby who ends up saving him, not the other way round, in a reversal of the well-worn romantic trope. She’s the one who sticks up for him after he’s falsely accused by a jealous ex of stealing someone’s wallet. While he reveals to her in a scene of aching vulnerability that he was the one who was taken advantage of by the rich older women clamouring to seduce him.But, of course, it all comes back to the dancing. In the final climactic scene, Johnny returns after being fired to make sure he and Baby have their last chance to shine at the resort’s talent show. Cue goosebumps as the first bars of Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes’s iconic theme song come on, and Swayze and Grey take to the stage to dance up a storm, ending with that lift. It’s cheesy but undeniably fun.Not that long ago, I watched the sequel, Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, because Romola Garai, who plays the lead, is one of my favourite actors (so underrated!). And yes, it’s terrible. But nothing can tarnish my love for the original. Even after all these years, this feelgood classic still has the power to put a big stupid smile on my face. Did I have the time of my life once again? You bet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7a35af141e25dd4cef06d8eb0cbf8243f4da36e/0_69_4832_2898/master/4832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0ecb05ea6674e1ce22636b158c0eace","title":"michel piccoli a life in pictures","story":"The prolific actor Michel Piccoli, who has died aged 94, acted in dozens of films for virtually every major French director across seven decades, including Godard, Malle and Rivette here are some of the highlightsPeter Bradshaw on Michel Piccoli: a fierce, strong performer who became the object of cinephile fan-worship"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/206a42f178655b73d1e49824b7707943709d7102/0_1534_4905_2941/master/4905.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd96cb4d84e9bd31b09c15fca748d557","title":"nigel slaters recipe for baked tomatoes with tuna and borlotti","story":"Cut 450g of assorted tomatoes in half and put them in a mixing bowl.

No matter, it gives the impression of one of those recipes that has been simmering quietly in the oven for hours. By all means eat it straight from the oven, but this dish seems better for being eaten warm rather than piping hot, so give it a few minutes in which to relax. I like to serve bread with this supper, maybe ciabatta or a baguette, thinly sliced, toasted and drenched in the juices from the pot.Tomatoes aside, this is very much a store-cupboard supper. Use canned chopped tomatoes if that is what you have. Cannellini, flageolet or haricot beans will work instead of the borlotti. If tuna isn’t your thing, you could turn this into a slightly different, and indeed vegetarian, dish by using a jar of preserved artichoke hearts in its place – in which case I would add some green olives, too.The Observer aims to publish recipes for fish rated as sustainable by the Marine Conservation Society’s Good Fish Guide"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8329cba57b0cf37411ffe46a0a393e261baa8487/0_0_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7310e007f066c47addaa634f09c8f8df","title":"i already knew the moment dogged donato gave deportivo the title","story":"Exactly twenty years on, Donato retells the story of sealing La Coruña’s only title, and how he still wanted to play past 40“When John Toshack came as manager, he said there was nothing left for me to give at Deportivo de La Coruña, that was it,” Donato Gama da Silva says. “I was like: ‘oh, mate’.” It was summer 1995 and the Brazilian was well past his 32nd birthday. Eighteen months later, Toshack was gone Donato, on the other hand, was still there. In fact, eight more years went by before he left, during which he won a Cup final against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu on their 100th birthday and Depor’s only La Liga title, 20 years ago this Tuesday.By then, Donato was signing one-year deals, on the assumption that any day soon, his body would give way or he would give up. But he always fought against the tide and against time. “The first contract at Depor when I joined from Atlético in 1993 was four years. There were protests: how can a player about to turn 31 sign a four-year deal? After that I signed annual deals. It was a war, a fight. It’s not easy being a veteran at a club that often has no interest in a veteran being there. I don’t know why. But the fans supported me always, appreciated me.”How could they not? On the eve of the final game of the 1999-2000 season, Donato and Víctor Sánchez del Amo had practised corners at one end of Riazor. Three minutes in, their chance came. “When we got the corner, I already knew,” Donato says. First to the near post and the ball, he headed it into the net and pulled up his shirt to reveal the message beneath: he dedicated the goal to Antonio Orejuela, a former Atlético player in intensive care with a heart problem.The symbolism did not end there. In ’94, Super Depor, the club’s first great team, lost the league on the final day when Miroslav Djukic took the responsibility no one wanted, including him, and missed a 90th-minute penalty. The fear had been palpable. Djukic wasn’t supposed to be taking it.Donato was, but he had gone off late in the game. “If I had been on, we might have won another league. I don’t know if I would have missed or not but I knew which way I was going and it wasn’t the way the goalkeeper did. I’d practised all week. Left side, left side, left side. Even in the hotel: ‘Left side, left side, left side’. I thought I was going mad. And then when there is a penalty, I’m watching from the bench.”“I didn’t take the penalty in ’94, and I score the goal in 2000. For me it was like a reward. People loved me already and that goal was the crowning moment.”It wasn’t the last. The cup came two years later, plus two runners-up spots and a third place. Still in the team, Donato was 40 years and 138 days old when he scored against Valencia in May 2003.There’s a long pause. “... bad,” he finally says.“In my last game the manager took me off on 44 minutes. Me: ‘What’s happening here? What a strange thing to do. Wait until half time.’ It was as if it was a testimonial, but in the dressing room the manager says: ‘It’s not over, I’ll speak to the president’. And I was like: ‘Jeez, I was preparing my leaving speech.’”The city hosted their biggest-ever party 20 years ago this Tuesday, when a 37-year-old who was supposed to be a long way past it – but still had a long way to go – proved quicker, cleverer and better than the rest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a14a2e0d41cd1b6a35eb1bde1701aed9f08c8cd9/1088_2015_880_528/master/880.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e4a9801c712769b0ae94412465409445","title":"grammar correct language","story":"If you find yourself doing it, consider this: are you genuinely attempting to help, or just trying to gain the upper hand?After Sunday’s episode of reality TV drama 90 Day Fiancé, people were left with an important question: is it ever OK to correct someone’s grammar?The show follows long-distance couples in a pressure cooker: when the foreign lovers of American citizens move to the US, with just 90 days to decide whether to get married before their visas run out. Sunday’s episode saw couple Stephanie Matto and Erika Owens hash out what went wrong in their failed relationship, and some viewers suggested that a screenshot showing an exchange between them might sum their problems up.“I’m so sad about this,” Owens texts Matto, seen in a WhatsApp chat. Then she adds: “I feel so lead on.”There are a select number of situations in which someone is allowed to correct someone else’s grammar: if you are a teacher if you are paid to correct grammar or proofread work or if you are a parent. Then it’s acceptable to say: “Actually, it’s you’re, not your.”In some cases, the question is blurrier. Perhaps you’re learning a new language, and you have either asked, or the other person assumes, that you’d appreciate not looking silly every time you get something wrong. If you are a waiter and your boss corrects your grammar because they’re worried about the impression you give off, or if you’re the nanny to someone’s children and the parents are worried you’ll impart incorrect wisdom … then it becomes a little more subjective.Some might say that if good grammar isn’t in the job description, it shouldn’t count it could certainly end up feeling like an overreach of someone’s power if they continue to correct you.But if you correct someone’s grammar in the middle of an argument, even if you are in any of the above positions, you are most likely wrong. Sure, they may have meant fewer, rather than less. But it is both a power move and a way of detracting from what the person is saying, of putting them down instead of listening to the substance of their argument. Slate summed up exactly what’s wrong with this when it coined the term “language bully” in 2013. There’s nothing wrong with knowing more than others, writer Matthew Malady wrote, but “those who use their advanced knowledge to embarrass or humiliate others are the absolute worst”.If correcting someone else’s grammar is routine for you, consider this: are you genuinely trying to help, or are you just trying to gain the upper hand? Are you listening to what the other person is saying, or simply looking for an excuse to show them that they are wrong? And really, does it really matter that they confused their and there, or could you let that one go this time?

The chances of these gigs going ahead have been limited for a while, yet there has been no statement from the band or Ticketmaster. Until recently, Ticketmaster replied to emails to say it would keep people updated if anything changed.The gigs are now less than three weeks away and obviously have no chance of going ahead. I’m lucky that we haven’t booked hotels or transport, but others will have, and many have posted their frustration on Twitter.I’m confident we’ll eventually get our money back, but I think the handling is unbelievably bad and should be called out.

Ticketholders are now told that gigs have been postponed to a “date due to be announced soon”. As the concerts have been effectively rescheduled, rather than cancelled, Ticketmaster is likely to keep you in limbo until the new dates are agreed with promoters.Ticketmaster is encouraging fans not to “reach out directly” with a refund request because of the huge backlog of cancellations and rescheduled events.

And having been an undocumented migrant, Soolking’s own liberty is hard wonThirty-year-old Algerian rapper Soolking was just hitting his stride before the world was put on lockdown. His commercially appealing blend of pop, reggaeton and Algerian raï (think Arabic and then add Auto-Tune) has generated a dizzying one billion streams on YouTube, with millions of them generated in the UK hailing from the small coastal neighbourhood of Staouéli in Algiers and now living in Paris after time spent there as an undocumented migrant, his story crosses borders and generations.Thankfully, the technology that has helped his music travel also means that I can speak to him while we are in lockdown in our respective countries. Speaking from the sofa in his Paris apartment, he explains what took him to France in 2013. “The dream was to succeed,” he says. “I wanted to succeed a bit in music, at least, but I never thought it would be like this.”But Soolking is not just another rapper with big numbers on streaming platforms. His music has come to be a source of pride for a nation who up until just a few weeks ago had been taking to the streets every week to protest since early last year, when Abdelaziz Bouteflika announced his candidacy for a fifth presidential term. Overwhelming public pressure forced him to resign, but protests against the regime continued as young people in particular kept pushing for a better quality of life. With two-thirds of Algerians under the age of 30, many have only ever known the country with Bouteflika in charge, and are looking for new voices that can speak to them.Soolking is one of them. One journalist for El Watan, the main newspaper in Algeria went as far as saying “for young Algerians, he is on a level in terms of image with Riyad Mahrez”, the national football captain and Premier League star.Soolking’s song Liberté became an unofficial anthem of the protests. “I write because we are the golden generation,” he sings. “Free all those that are taken hostage  That’s all we have, all we have is freedom.” I went to Algeria last year and saw the protests one Friday, where thousands of people flooded the streets, young people passionately belting out the lyrics to this song, waving the Algerian flag: a poignant memory.“It is nice to see,” he says humbly, though he accepts that the song has been reclaimed by the people. “It’s not a Soolking song any more. It’s a song for young people, and the original version comes from Ouled El Bahdja, a group which makes music in football stadiums. I wrote the lyrics, re-did the music a bit with them and it has become more than a stadium song – it has become an international song.”Talking about a song called “Freedom” during a lockdown seems ironic, so I wonder what he thinks the word means at the moment. “Freedom is doing what you want, where you want, living where you want, being who you want, being free.” He pauses a moment, before adding: “Of course there are limits. You can’t do bad things. But it is about living the life you want … I feel free and freedom is priceless.”While lockdown presents limitations and frustrations, especially for an artist who should be out promoting a new album and lining up tour dates, Soolking has already known a lack of freedom, including when he was living in the shadows as an undocumented immigrant: harraga, as we say in Arabic.“You can’t do anything without papers,” he says. “You can’t travel if you go in the street and get caught you can get put in jail or they can deport you. But I didn’t feel that too much because I’m a calm person. I don’t make problems, I work, I don’t go out a lot.”There are a number of popular artists in France who are second-generation Algerian immigrants – Sofiane, Rim’K, Lacrim, and Ademo and NOS, the brothers who make up vastly successful rap duo PNL, for example – but Soolking was born in Algeria, and his struggle to success makes him hugely relatable to a young audience there.He sees his circumstances as having set him up to work hard for the life he wants: “For the people back home life’s so hard that going to another country without papers, a house or anything at all is do-able because they live in such precarious circumstances, with poverty and difficult lifestyles. That is strength – misery gives us strength.”That strength is evident in Soolking’s more heartfelt songs, such as Guérilla. A powerful 2018 French radio performance cemented his name as a big player in the music scene and racked up over a quarter of a billion views on YouTube. “I dreamed that we weren’t poor any more and that our sad stories were nothing but words,” he sings.Guérilla samples the 1982 Algerian raï track Ya Zina Diri Latay (Pretty Girl, Serve the Tea), a detail not lost on a generation of Algerians who grew up listening to their parents’ cassette tapes. His new album Vintage plays with a similar kind of nostalgia, mixing it with modern sounds. The cover art features Soolking, sitting on a bed, with posters of iconic artists of previous generations: Tupac, Biggie, Bob Marley, Michael Jackson and the godfather of raï, Cheb Hasni. Oh, and Scarface.With all the nostalgic throwbacks, I ask him what he misses of Algeria. “My parents, that’s all. France is pretty similar to Algeria in many ways.” What about Algerian culture? “Well, exactly, the culture is what? Religion, Ramadan, and those things. For me, my parents are what carry the culture and religion in the family, so I don’t really miss anything else.”Besides, now that the world has started opening up to him, he wants to make the most of it. “I would like to discover more of the world,” he says, raving to me about the nature, cuisine and people in Thailand, where he performed just before Paris went into lockdown. “I want to go and see loads of countries, cultures and new things – I can’t just stay in one neighbourhood with one lifestyle.”He has to stick to that sofa for now. But while none of us know when we might be able make plans for the future, we can at least cross borders through music and reflect on what we value – including the kind of freedom that Soolking values so dearly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67ffffa7fa1edcc8e8fd4ea3d4e5b025fa8d6a36/0_57_1249_749/master/1249.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d5553fcadc37f332111be2629651672","title":"the 100 greatest uk no 1s no 14 kate bush wuthering heights","story":"Written when Bush was 18 years old, this eerie gothic tale of lost love and longing cemented her iniduality from the very beginningHad the teenaged Kate Bush listened to the wishes of her record label, Wuthering Heights would not have been her debut single. EMI preferred the pop-stomp of James and the Cold Gun to the eerie, circular song that introduced her to the world. But by her late teens, Bush clearly knew herself and wisely pushed for Wuthering Heights instead. When it saw the light of day, in early 1978, it was a hit. By March that year, it had become a No 1 hit, the first single written and recorded by a female artist to top the British charts. It replaced Abba’s Take A Chance on Me, and remained at the top for a month.It is sometimes worth remembering the incredible fact that Bush wrote Wuthering Heights when she was 18 years old, though perhaps its keen ear for adolescent angst is part of what makes it so special. She had been inspired by an old television adaptation of Emily Brontë’s novel, which led her to seek out the book. Written from the perspective of the ghost of Catherine Earnshaw, a young woman pleading with the brutal Heathcliff, whom she loves and hates, to let her soul into the house, the song is a gothic melodrama that builds until it is thick with intensity. It is a magnificent achievement, though the writing of it was seemingly painless. “Actually, it came quite easily,” Bush recalled later, telling the story of a single moonlit night at the piano. The vocal was said to have been recorded in a single take. Bush found out that she and Brontë shared a birthday, and the fates were aligned.The casual story of its creation belies the odd unwieldiness of the song itself. The piano gently heralds the arrival of this haunted tale of lost love and longing, then that tight, high melody reels you in. It loops and lilts, ascending, descending, as Bush’s vocal urges the story on, like Catherine striding across the moors. In the BBC’s 2014 documentary The Kate Bush Story, artist after artist recalls hearing it on the radio for the first time, thinking some variation of: what on earth was that? “You can hear one note of a Kate Bush song or one note of her voice and know what it is,” said Annie Clark, AKA St Vincent, and it has been that way from the start.The spectacle of Bush as a performer inspired similarly wowed and unsettled reactions. She made two videos for the song, and appeared on Top of the Pops with it five times in 1978, cementing her public image as an ethereal spirit, embodying the essence of Cathy through a combination of wide eyes, floaty fabrics and wild choreography, still fondly mimicked and parodied today. Wuthering Heights turned Bush into a pop star, the rules of which she continues to bend to her own will: her iniduality was set in stone from the very beginning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3063777210d8c4a14de57fb69a03dfec6fc2026/3_0_5899_3543/master/5899.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=066ef2ea7659238c2e0a229e01771ce0","title":"blind date takeover looking for love in lockdown podcast part 2","story":"In the concluding part of our Blind Date takeover, two more couples meet remotely for a socially distanced evening of drinks and dinnerIn part 1 of our Blind Date takeover last week, three couples met up via Zoom and let us listen in to what a first date sounds like in the age of lockdowns.

Thrown almost overnight into a virtual classroom, they are using video games and creating group chats or escape rooms for pupils. The internet gives teachers access to subject experts from around the world who can deliver masterclasses via video link to an entire year group.The health emergency is creating new opportunities, which they say will transform the way they teach forever.Lee Small is head of computer science at Ribblesdale high school, in Clitheroe, Lancashire. He says: “We have had to think differently and dynamically. I think we will go on to put some of these different technologies to use in the classroom to support students’ learning alongside traditional teaching methods.”Ribblesdale has Microsoft Training Academy status, which means it is at the forefront of using cutting-edge technology in its teaching. It is also a Demonstrator school, one of 20 schools and colleges identified by the DfE and delivery partners that have demonstrated excellence in their use of technology to support teaching and learning, and have the capacity to help others.Teachers realised immediately that if remote learning was to work they would have to design shorter lessons that were quick to engage pupils, with speedy outcomes, otherwise students risked becoming passive observers.The key was to use platforms that pupils were familiar with. At Ribblesdale that meant tapping into the video game Minecraft. “It’s an amazingly popular game and is an incredibly powerful teaching tool,” says Small. It has been invaluable in English lessons to support children who struggle to express themselves in the written word: “They’ve been able to design their story in the Minecraft world and then write about it when they see their idea on the screen.”In Warrington, Cheshire, teachers at the King’s leadership academy learned how to use the principles and theory of video games, with graded challenges and teamwork, to design more engaging remote lessons: “We’ve had to make the lessons more exciting and had to make sure that the children find a purpose in what they are doing,” says principal Shane Ierston.In Berkshire, maths teacher Lewis Hart, of University Technical College (UTC) Reading, says lockdown has made him think more creatively about how he teaches and collaborates: “I can’t rely on a combination of verbal and written. I’ve had to come out of my comfort zone.”Hart turned to YouTube for inspiration: “One of my favourites is the 3Blue1Brown channel, devoted to high school maths but it looks at it in a different way, at the deeper underlying fundamentals, which has been a really good way of getting students to look at familiar topics in an unfamiliar way.”UTC Reading is part of the national network that is using technology to enhance teaching in the traditional and virtual classrooms. The Surface laptop, for example, has dual far-field studio mics and an HD camera which ensure that teachers can be heard and seen clearly when in contact with students or colleagues.The school has used Microsoft Teams so teachers can continue their teacher training during lockdown. It has also created a video bank of lessons so students who may have missed classes can catch up in their own time, and there is potential to work remotely with school refusers in future. Siobhan Tyson, UTC’s director of science with additional responsibility for professional development, says the technology is transformative: “It is giving us flexibility and it’s definitely going to have an impact on future teaching.”Teachers admit it can be a constant battle to keep their tech skills ahead of their pupils’, or what their pupils expect. Ribblesdale has 10 Microsoft Innovative Educator Experts (MIEE) – staff skilled in delivering the Microsoft schools programme who share their expertise with colleagues. But Small points out: “Teachers don’t have to be experts in a piece of software in order to use it, they just need to be able to use it to give a platform to students to be creative and foster their independence.”Collaboration with peers has been crucial during lockdown as teachers share remote teaching ideas, so the Surface can be useful as it is designed to encourage closer working and allows teachers to easily share resources. English teacher and vice-principal at King’s, Katie Sharp, says working collaboratively has, for her, been essential during lockdown. “I’m a person who likes working with people, so this has been quite a culture shock for me. But we’ve been able to share links to each other’s lessons, which means we can give feedback if I see something I like, such as a quiz, I can ask how they do that.”This new way of working has also prompted teachers to think about how digital technology has a role in marking and assessment, says Small: “We’ve been looking at how we can use AI to support students in their grades, for example we have an app on Teams where we can tell how long students have engaged with the content.”But remote learning only works if pupils have access to a device and reliable broadband. Schools have sometimes used the pupil premium to cover device costs and given pupils dongles to tap into phone technology if broadband is poor.Teresa Skeggs is headteacher of Peartree Spring primary, in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, where each year-group has access to devices of various kinds. It uses Microsoft 365 to deliver its whole-school email, while its server and some of its laptops “consistently” rely on Windows 10. She says: “What we are delivering now is a more in-depth version of what we have always done – we’ve always had blended learning.”Five tips for online teaching:1. Think differently about how you teach. Teaching remotely is more than just going online. Technology used creatively can be transformative.2. Keep your talking to a minimum – bite-size chunks of around five minutes. The voice is important but students do not need to see you to hear you. Captioning all videos means they are accessible to everyone.3. Consider dropping your headshot into the corner of the screen if you feel students still need to see you when talking. Use pictures with captions as well as slides to illustrate as you talk. Keep things simple.4. Lessons must be engaging and inclusive, gain student interest quickly and have quick outcomes. Use programs and platforms that are familiar to pupils to create a fun learning experience of quizzes and games.5. Create small groups on tools such as Teams to encourage group discussion. Encourage students to ask questions through a chat panel.Interested in finding out more about how to create engaging online learning environments?

Headteachers explain how it’s doneWhen it became apparent that the school lockdown was imminent, principal Vicki Redhead and her team at Bishop Creighton academy, a primary school in Peterborough, wrestled with a tricky issue. How can you make online-only learning as safe as possible? They came up with a simple solution. The devices they used at school were already set up and locked down. Why not just let children take those school devices home?“Otherwise, those devices – which were bought for the benefit of the children – were just going to sit in a cupboard,” she says. “Luckily, we had already made the decision that every child should have their own device. You’d never ask a child to share an exercise book.”Today’s tech makes it much simpler to make those tweaks – and schools which had been exploring its possibilities before the lockdown have already considered many of the big questions around online safety. Choosing devices that can be rolled out with ease is a key consideration in reducing IT complexity. At University Technical College (UTC) Reading in Berkshire, pupils had already received training on professional behaviour both face-to-face and online. “They know what’s right and what’s wrong, and the consequences of doing something that is outside what we would consider professional,” says principal Jon Nicholls. “And they get it. We have close ties with industry, and our students understand professional boundaries.”However, a secure platform is also crucial. UTC Reading’s Microsoft Teams package has considerable functionality for keeping both students and staff safe online. All student data is held securely. Only invited students can attend classes – nobody else can join. Teachers can invite students into small groups for additional support work without other students being aware. Another teacher or learning support staff member is always online to actively monitor student chat. And lessons are recorded and stored – including any chat – so they can be checked if any concerns are raised by staff or students.Choosing the correct platform can also help to solve the problem of device access. There has been an explosion of cloud-based learning platforms and tools in the education sector that are designed to be used solely in a web browser, says Brendan Tapping, chief executive officer at Bishop Chadwick Catholic Education Trust, a multi-academy trust that serves south Tyneside, Sunderland and east Durham.“This has overcome many of the hurdles that students would have faced when trying to complete work from home. The cloud-based learning platforms allow students to complete their homework anytime, anywhere from almost any device, including their own mobile phones,” he says.These platforms are also key to allowing staff to easily communicate, collaborate and share learning resources, tips and strategies, helping to replicate face-to-face staffroom discussions and prevent teachers themselves from feeling isolated.But although being online has its own risks, the biggest risk for a child is living in an environment where threats exist – and lockdown could mean more risk for them. How can schools keep track of them in an online-only environment? Again, they’re using established best practice combined with tech and the art of good communication.At Ribblesdale, the school’s online learning platform, Teams, logs everything – including how often a child logs on to the platform, which the school can then monitor. “If a child is not accessing any work, that’s the first potential warning that something is wrong,” says Cox. “But we won’t use technology if it’s not the most applicable way of safeguarding. We might simply decide to phone up a child if that’s the right thing to do.”Regular communication has also been paramount at Bishop Chadwick Catholic Education Trust. “All pupils and parents receive regular wellbeing phone calls from a familiar member of staff, with our most vulnerable pupils and parents or carers being spoken to on a daily basis,” says Tapping. “It’s key to ensuring our families feel fully supported and we can ensure we keep our community as safe as possible in their virtual learning world.”And as school leaders begin to contemplate what school life might look like in the future, Redhead is optimistic that the key to staying safe online is having that strong safeguarding culture embedded in the first place – and that hasn’t stopped in lockdown. “I’ve got 200-plus children accessing Teams, and nobody’s misbehaving!” she says. “Nobody’s using it inappropriately, and that’s not because I’m telling them not to do it – that’s around the culture in the school. We shouldn’t be afraid of tech. It’s where our children’s futures are going to be.”Five tips for online security1. Ensure staff are trained in online safety and recognise the security risk posed by phishing emails.2. Choose a cloud-based, secure online learning platform which allows recording of lessons and chats.3. Keep lines of communication with pupils and other agencies open – if necessary, just make a phone call.4. Encourage parents and pupils to use school devices which are already locked down, and loan them out if necessary.5. Think of tech as an enhancement to safeguarding, rather than a barrier to it.Interested in finding out more about safeguarding pupils online?

He replied immediately, enabling her daughter to complete the task. Brown was impressed – it felt like one-to-one tutoring, but Daisy was attending school online via her Microsoft Surface, studying from the family’s kitchen table.Before the school closures, it was impossible to imagine children decamping from classrooms to embark on online learning, and harder still to picture parents as proxy teachers. Yet for Brown and other parents, this is the new normal. Technology is making it possible allowing teaching to continue uninterrupted, enhancing students’ creativity, productivity and collaboration, and enabling parents to engage with their children’s learning journey.Brown works as a support staff member at her daughter’s school, and considers the school’s remote-learning provision the silver lining to the cloud that is the current crisis. “Daisy joins her form group every morning via video link, then follows her normal timetable – it’s working fantastically,” she says. “It’s lovely to hear her classmates chatting away and helping one another with their work.”Distance learning isn’t new. But the pandemic has drastically accelerated the development of online education, and technology is at the forefront of this modern educational reform. Microsoft Teams – used in 175 countries by 183,000 institutions – is equipping students with a learning environment that is accessible, inclusive and collaborative.For parents thrust into the role of home educator, it’s natural to feel anxious. But supporting your child’s online education doesn’t mean replicating the school environment. Melanie Dalpra from Reading, whose daughter, Maia, is in year 11, says: “Even Maia’s school isn’t trying to replicate it – she has three 45-minute online lessons and the rest of her day is given to independent study.“I think that’s a really good model – don’t let Covid-19 push your child out of the centre of their education.”Safeguarding is also a key consideration for parents. As education moves online and children rely on technology tools for learning, parents need peace of mind that the devices they use are equipped with world-class security measures. Microsoft offers tools for every task with security built in, from chip to cloud.A particular advantage of Windows 10 Pro is its inbuilt security solution, including streamlined security updates, safe searches and no retargeting of students with online adverts – features parents may already be familiar with through the tools they use at work. Microsoft 365 allows users to move seamlessly and securely from one device to another without complexity.For home-learning to be effective, Ciaran O’Halloran, head of drama at Our Lady and St Patrick’s college in Knock, Belfast, recommends focusing on healthy routines rather than slavishly following the school timetable. “A lot of the things that happen in school happen in order to manage hundreds of people effectively,” he says. “We spend a lot of time organising and socialising children so they can function in the school environment but without that, parents can be much more responsive.”Parents who want to support their child’s online learning do not need in-depth knowledge of the topics their child is studying, either. “I certainly don’t know everything and my kids know that,” laughs Dalpra. “You’re not an encyclopaedia we look things up together and they’re learning to ask for help, which is a really useful life skill.”With so little time to prepare for online learning, many households find themselves sharing limited resources. But Microsoft apps have the advantage of being accessible on all devices – meaning students can begin work in one place and move to another device seamlessly as required, reducing pressure on the main family device.“Microsoft apps don’t necessarily require children to work within them,” says O’Halloran. “A screenshot of task instructions on Teams can be viewed on a phone.”Equipping young learners with tools that enhance productivity and enable collaboration in this way – at the same time as encouraging them to flex their creativity – is key to developing the cognitive and problem-solving skills that will benefit them throughout life.For some children, online learning offers unexpected respite from the challenges of going to school. Dalpra, whose three children have Asperger syndrome, ADHD and dyspraxia respectively, says quarantine can create opportunities to reconsider your child’s needs. “One of the advantages of online learning is that you can control sensory stimulus and adapt learning materials to suit the needs of inidual learners,” she says.An inclusive learning experience is vital for all young people. Giving your child access to tools that include special features to address a range of inidual needs is essential, especially for those with specific learning needs. Free accessibility tools – such as Immersive Reader – are built in to all Microsoft products to help empower students of all abilities to learn without stigma and at their own pace. Immersive Reader provides a full-screen reading experience, designed to increase readability of text – students can change spacing, read text aloud, and sound out words by syllable.It’s difficult to imagine schools reverting to business as usual, and the new educational landscape will surely continue posing challenges for parents. But whatever the future holds, the technology is on their side. For parents worried about how to adapt and survive, Dalpra has a pearl of wisdom: “Children develop if they’re in a nourishing environment, and just feeling heard can transform a child’s education.”Five tips to support online education1. Put mental health and wellbeing above academic progress. If learning isn’t going well, play a board game or go for a walk together and revisit the task later. The Do Not Disturb function in Teams can also help with children’s concentration.2. Have fun. This is a difficult time for children, but learning should be enjoyable.3. Encourage your child to ask teachers for help – not all children are used to doing so.4. Stick to a daily routine but allow time for play, relaxation and boredom.5. Remember that you’re dealing with a person, not just a student. Show your child that you’re still learning too, and approach it together.Interested in finding out more about how to support your child’s online learning experience?

Online teaching has revolutionised the way students are learning today and the current crisis has accelerated the transition to online learning even more.Approximately 1.37 billion students are now learning from home as a result of the lockdown, including more than 2.38 million students studying at UK higher education institutions, and almost 60.2 million teachers are no longer teaching from the classroom.Oliver Fisher, co-founder of Springpod, says that most students have adapted to the rapid change of moving everything online well. “Teachers have always provided other activities alongside the core curriculum but the crisis has forced them to explore the huge amount of resources available online,” he says.Matt Jenner, head of learning at the FutureLearn online platform says that the lockdown has turned remote learning from optional to mandatory. “More schools, colleges and universities are now realising that learning online can offer immense flexibility you’re not tied to location, topics or a timetable,” he notes.Charlie Kilner, a sixth-form student at Millfield school in Somerset, says he has actually found the transition to moving everything online very smooth. “We’re lucky to use devices regularly already so the real transition was just getting used to seeing my teacher over Microsoft Teams.”Kilner, who recently set up a podcast with his media studies teacher, Aimee Coelho, for people to record their stories of life in lockdown, believes the current crisis has fuelled creativity. “Our podcast was made possible through Teams and other online chat forums. We’ve been overwhelmed with the number of submissions from across the globe, from Geneva, Chile and Palau,” he says. “I think lots of great educational content can be made at times like this.”Technology has certainly come a long way in the past decade and can be adapted to suit most subjects, including art. School devices, such as Microsoft Surface, can be used with a Surface Pen to write and sketch. Maia Dalpra, a GCSE student at University Technical College (UTC) Reading in Berkshire, says the online lessons for her GCSE classes are typically held in real time with one teacher answering questions as they come up on the online chat function. This makes her feel just as involved and more like an Open University student than a GCSE one. “I like the fact that I have more independence and that they’re trusting us to organise our time.” The lessons are also recorded so if any student misses one, they can watch it later.Dalpra has gone from having a full school day to three 45-minute lessons each morning online, but feels that this has actually given her an opportunity to develop stronger organisation skills. “I think having more free time is helping me prepare for university. I have the afternoon to study, write essays and reports, and research stuff. If anything, I’m more productive than I was before,” she says.Chloe Godsell, a partnership manager and university admissions expert at Crimson Education, says trust has become more important than ever in the changing relationship between the teacher and student. “Trust between teachers and students plays a much bigger role in online learning than with traditional methods,” she notes. “Teachers are more reliant on students to complete assignments, but similarly, students are reliant on the teachers to deliver the lessons to a different standard.”Dame Kathy August, a former headteacher, director of education and Department for Education senior adviser, says that a teacher’s personality is also hugely important. “Personalities play a big part in the transmission of ideas and values, and I think it can sometimes be harder to transmit that through an online model.”August also believes boys might struggle slightly more than girls with online learning. “As a sweeping generalisation, based on my own teaching experience, I’d say boys might find time management and organisation more difficult. They might be better at getting to grips with the technology but be a little more chaotic.”Dr Lynne Livesey, a deputy vice-chancellor at the University of Central Lancashire, says interactive games can help engage disinterested learners. “Using games in education is just another way to learn, but it can be just as effective. The skill rests with teachers knowing when to use the right tools and then ensuring they’re accessible to everyone.”Daisy Brown, a year-eight student at a high school that gives all students the chance to buy or rent a laptop from year 7 onwards, says one of the things she’s enjoying most about online learning is the educational games. “The teachers use online quizzes and other interactive tech games for design and technology,” she says. “Our touchscreen devices make it easy to answer questions right away and mean the teachers can reply to us straight away too.”There are some things, however, that simply cannot be done during lockdown. Rosie Jacobs, a sixth-form student at Stoke Newington school in London, says: “For my geography A-level I’m supposed to be looking at the area around King’s Cross but that’s not really something I can do at the moment.”That said, being confined to the house doesn’t necessarily stop you learning about the rest of the world, with virtual reality allowing students to journey from the ruins of Greece to the Sahara desert.Jacobs points out that there are some other useful features in online learning, which probably work better for teachers. “One of our teachers mutes us all while she’s carrying out the lesson,” she says. “And that probably makes it more productive for her!”Godsell adds that, ultimately, what began as anxiety-inducing and unfamiliar has become the new normal. “There have been steep learning curves for everyone involved, and many lessons learned along the way. The most important one is that students need to be able to interact and engage with the teacher and each other for real learning to happen,” she says.Five top tips for students:1. Use the online chat function to ask questions as you go. There’s a Raise Hands feature in Teams to signal that you want to speak.2. Try and create a timetable to work from so you have a structure to the day.3. Ask a friend if they will be your study buddy for some collaborative working.4. Remember to take regular breaks throughout the day, and the Do Not Disturb feature in Teams can help with this.5. Use quizzes and interactive games to make things more fun.Interested in finding out more about how to get the most out of online learning, now and in the future?

Barely a day has gone by without him being sent out on to the government frontline. But the effort is clearly beginning to take its toll. In the past few weeks his normal Tiggerish enthusiasm and goodwill to all has given way to something rather more vulnerable. A man who feels himself not just under attack from a country that wonders why the health secretary hasn’t done rather more to protect the nation’s health, but also from the prime minister and cabinet colleagues who have been lining him up as the scapegoat in the inevitable public inquiry.The initial sign that Matt was not coping so well was in his snappiness. His tetchiness with MPs and members of the media whenever his version of events was challenged. Now though it’s looking as if Hancock is moving through the denial and anger stages of grief toward the bargaining and depression stages.There’s still a way to go before he comes to any form of acceptance but now there is a discernible sadness to his public performances. An emotional fragility that can barely be kept at bay. Other people’s anger he can just about deal with. It’s their compassion that will get him in the end. The Dear Matt text in which he is dumped with the words, “It’s not you, it’s me.”For his Commons coronavirus statement, it was all Matt could do to hold it together for an hour. Hardly surprising as he knows better than anyone that much of what he’s saying is pure fantasy. Though the truth might set him free, he’s just not quite ready for the admission of failure. So he began as if the coronavirus was a mild inconvenience, rather than the worst public health crisis for 100 years.We’d passed the peak – please, no one tell him about the probability of a second wave – and by and large everything was totally in control. The government had done brilliantly, hospitals had coped and NHS mental health services were there for anyone who needed them. Provided they were able to wait six months without falling apart completely for a referral to a professional.Care homes had had a protective ring thrown round them from the very start of the pandemic. As a description of the government’s handling of the crisis it could hardly have been more inaccurate. But this wasn’t about the public. It was about throwing a protective ring around Matt’s psyche. This was as close to reality as he could bring himself to get.There were a few new announcements. From now on anosmia – a lack of smell or taste – would be added to a persistent dry cough and high temperature as coronavirus symptoms. And anyone with any of these symptoms could now get a test if they could log on to the NHS website and find a testing station with capacity to see them. Best of all, Matt was able to report that he had beaten his target of recruiting 18,000 tracers – he didn’t know if they were yet trained – and now had 21,000 people on the books. Though given Hancock’s dodgy record on false accounting, it was quite possible that some of the new recruits may have been counted twice.Some politicians believe you need to be cruel to be kind. Labour’s shadow health secretary, John Ashworth, takes the opposite view and is kind to be cruel. He’s long since stopped being angry with Hancock over the government’s mishandling of the crisis and now just talks to him like an awkward teenager in whom he’s disappointed. It had been a bit late to include anosmia, hadn’t it? There hadn’t always been a protective ring around care homes, had there? And what was the point in easing lockdown restrictions before there was a comprehensive test and trace system up and running to replace them?Matt was now on the verge of breaking down. His eyes bloodshot as he tried to hold it together. Pleading for one last chance to make the relationship work. There was definitely a protective ring around care homes. Things would change. Get better, he promised. Having already forgotten that his new test and trace operation was supposed to have kicked in two days ago. Just one last chance, he pleaded.“We are ready and preparing,” he said, apparently unaware that the two were mutually exclusive. You’re either ready or you’re preparing. A few Tory backbenchers tried to put a socially-distanced arm around him and reassure him he was doing OK, but most just melted away. Matt left the chamber alone. Hopefully to have a long sob in private. He might just find it cathartic.Fifteen minutes later, Priti Patel made a rare public appearance as she reintroduced her immigration bill. Most of us have long since concluded that the home secretary has been kept hidden because she is fundamentally useless. But now some MPs were wondering if she might not also have had the coronavirus. Because there was a total lack of taste in announcing plans to keep low-paid overseas workers out of the country, when they are doing more than most to keep the NHS, care homes and food deliveries running.Still, Patel did want to pay a small tribute to those doing jobs she considers unskilled. Not least because she has also proved that being home secretary is low-skilled work. So, as a compromise, she proposed that everyone should continue clapping key workers at 8pm on a Thursday. Just to help them on their way to the deportation centre. She’s all heart, Priti."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abed730917cece76362ab8a1bc7d627e42446683/0_150_2244_1346/master/2244.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d7d5ab50d294e341931bbe7c1f95805","title":"first human trial results raise hopes for coronavirus vaccine","story":"Eight initial volunteers in US produced an antibody response from Moderna’s RNA vaccineThe first results from human trials of a vaccine against Covid-19 have given a glimmer of hope after a US firm’s study produced positive results in a group of eight volunteers.These results – which come a day after the UK government revealed a deal to secure 30m doses of a rival Oxford University vaccine, should it be successful – showed that each of the participants produced an antibody response on a par with that seen in people who have had the disease. And they suggest that the vaccine is safe for use in humans.Part of a first-stage trial of 45 people run by the US company Moderna, the results are from a preliminary safety study and do not demonstrate that the treatment will work. But they will be a sign of encouragement for experts and governments desperate for a breakthrough in the battle to bring an end to the coronavirus pandemic – widely believed to be impossible without a vaccine.Although both programmes are in the early stages, the findings also appear to put the US research ahead of the UK’s. While the Oxford vaccine was shown in a safety study to protect macaque monkeys against pneumonia, it did not stop infection – which could leave people liable to spread the virus, even if they do not get sick themselves.With the backing of the British government, the Oxford group is partnering with the drug company AstraZeneca to make 30m doses for the UK – if the vaccine works. It is to receive £65.5m to fund its work. Imperial College London, which also has a vaccine under development, has been awarded £18.5m. In the US study, run by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, all eight volunteers made neutralising antibodies which were tested in human cells in the lab and stopped the virus from replicating. The higher the vaccine dose, the more antibodies the volunteer produced.However, as with antibody tests, there will still be questions over whether this response is enough to prevent people from being infected by the virus. This approach does not stimulate another arm of the immune response, from the T-cells. It is also not known whether an antibody response will last.Many different companies and institutions around the world are racing to develop a vaccine in record time, using different approaches. The World Health Organization has a list of 76 contenders. Moderna was the first in the world into clinical trials with an RNA vaccine, which uses a segment of genetic material from the virus itself, called messenger RNA, to provoke the immune system into making antibodies.Imperial College is also developing an RNA vaccine, although its approach is different. Robin Shattock, professor of mucosal infection and immunity, who is leading the Imperial trials, said the Moderna findings were encouraging. “While it will be important to scrutinise the actual data, the reported findings are in line with expectations that vaccine candidates should provide levels of neutralising antibodies that are at least equivalent to convalescent subjects,” he said.“This is a promising start, but efficacy data will be key followed by an ability to scale in a manner that provides global access should this vaccine be successful.”Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine, also gave the news a cautious welcome. “Well, it isn’t bad news and there are a number of good points that suggest optimism that this vaccine may work,” he said.Oxford University has published results of safety trials in macaque monkeys. While the vaccine prevented the monkeys from developing pneumonia, it did not block the virus from infecting the animals.Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology, University of Nottingham, said that the Oxford results were encouraging in that they prevented serious illness, but that if the vaccine works the same way in humans, it may not prevent the spread of disease.“If this represents infectious virus and a similar thing occurs in humans, then vaccinated people can still be infected, shed large amounts of virus which could potentially spread to others in the community,” he said.“If the most vulnerable people aren’t protected by the vaccine to the same degree, then this will put them at risk. Therefore, vaccine efficacy in vulnerable populations and the potential for virus shedding in vaccinated people needs very careful monitoring.”Moderna has so far only released results for the youngest group of volunteers. It intends to press ahead to the next stage of human trials involving 600 people shortly, with a much bigger trial involving thousands set to begin in July.• This article was amended on 19 May 2020.

It assesses whether there is any alcohol in their sweat.The first tags are expected to be fitted this year once probation staff have been trained and the monitoring contract agreed. When up and running, as many as 2,300 are likely to be fitted on offenders every year.The initiative follows successful pilot projects including one carried out in London when Boris Johnson was mayor. People who are found to be breaching an alcohol abstinence order can be brought back before the courts to face further punishment, which could include imprisonment.Announcing the national rollout, Kit Malthouse MP, the crime, policing and justice minister, said: “Alcohol-fuelled crime blights communities and puts an unnecessary strain on our frontline services.“Smart technologies like sobriety tags not only punish offenders but can help turn their lives around. While prison will always be the right place for many criminals, tough community sentences like this can help cut reoffending and protect the public.”Keith Hunter, the police and crime commissioner (PCC) for Humberside, said: “During the trial in our area they provided rehabilitation agencies a real opportunity to work with the inidual and get them to recognise and change their behaviour.“Undoubtedly their use will help reduce the number of victims of alcohol-related crime, many in domestic situations, and aid the rehabilitation of offenders as they become a standard feature of the criminal justice system.”The tough community sentences not only punish offenders, according to the Ministry of Justice, but also help their rehabilitation by forcing them to address the causes of their harmful behaviour.The sobriety tags sample an offender’s sweat every half-hour to determine whether alcohol has been consumed. They are said to be capable of distinguishing between alcohol-based products, such as hand sanitisers, that could be used to mask alcohol consumption and can also detect when contact between skin and tag has been blocked.They will not be used on people who are alcohol-dependent or have certain medical conditions. Judges have been calling for many years for tougher non-custodial sentences.“I no longer need a drink to manage my emotions which is down to the tag and my probation officer – I’m much happier with my life now and pleased that more people can benefit from my experience of wearing the tags.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86302dbcc55f07d65c45bb3baf8c864e36bd4320/0_2_3600_2260/master/3600.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=aaca459ab5347472b08e47238f53ef89 1290w","title":"suwanji madanayake the spinner who wants to play into his 50s cricket","story":"The Sri Lankan cricketer started in 1991 and wants to play on for a few more years, saying clubs ‘need my experience’The scorecard wormhole starts innocently enough. You are daydreaming of a match, pull it up and spot a player you didn’t realise was in the team. Curiosity takes over. When did he debut? What did he average? And his great aunt played Test cricket before the war? I wonder what her average was … and, so it goes.That’s how it went for me last month, on the 90th anniversary of the first Test triple ton - Andy Sandham’s 325 in 1930. Who played in that game? Much to my delight Wilfred Rhodes, in his 58th and final appearance aged 52.Next, naturally, I clicked on Rhodes’s debut, an astonishing 31 years earlier. And what do you know, that Ashes match at Trent Bridge in 1899 was both WG Grace’s final Test outing and Victor Trumper’s first. Mind blown. Yes, in that moment, I was frustrated that Rhodes did not continue a few months further into 1930 to play against Don Bradman when he hit his first triple – missing the chance to link the defining careers of The Don and The Doctor – but you can’t have it all.I found myself similarly delighted last year when listing players from the 1990s still padding up. Of particular interest was finding out that Marcus Trescothick made his bow in 1993 under the captaincy of Chris Tavaré, who started his own lengthy career in 1974. When tweeting this upon Trescothick’s retirement, Test Match Special’s master statistician, Andrew Samson, told me he could go one better: Suwanji Madanayake, who started in 1991, was still at it.Indeed, he was again this year. In February, Samson noted that the Sri Lankan was the first cricketer since Eddie Hemmings to win first-class caps in four different decades – the latter doing so from 1966 to 1995. He added that Madanayake became one of 16 players to play first-class cricket before the age of 17 and also after 44. Grace was also one of those Fred Titmus the most recent.Except that Madanayake did not begin before his 17th birthday. This is the first point the charming left-arm spinner – the same bowling discipline as Rhodes – clarified with The Spin when we contacted him. Many years ago, a website recorded his birth year as 1974 and it stuck. He was actually born in 1972 and turns 48 in August. When walking out at Kandy on that November morning, bowling to Aravinda de Silva, the Soviet Union was still six weeks from collapsing.There were dreams of higher honours, quite reasonable ones if not for Muttiah Muralitharan. When his long period at the top finally ended in 2008, Rangana Herath, another left-arm tweaker, got the nod as the younger of the pair during that transition. “All of my clubmates ask why I didn’t play in the national side,” Madanayake laments. “Rangana had his chance and fulfilled his target and I was unlucky.”But to view Madanayake’s career as unfulfilled misses the mark. Instead, this is a man who cherishes the game and savours being able to talk about Kumar Sangakkara’s days as the young fella in his dressing room. Or turning out in the same team as the man with the most initials to ever play the game: ARRAPWRRKB Amunugama. This gratitude extends to his thanks to the bank that has let him put cricket first over the 24 years of his employment.All told, he has played first-class or List A cricket for some 14 teams in Sri Lanka across those 29 years. Adding clubs in England and Australia, where he has been an enthusiastic import, that number swells to “about” 30. “It is demand,” he says in the best traditions of the touring pro. “When you are performing well, the clubs ask you to come. They are good offers. That is why I move.”Madanayake’s most productive spell as an overseas player came in England, from 2007 to 2011. Across those five seasons, primarily in the Liverpool league, he claimed a ridiculous 335 league wickets while collecting more than 2,700 runs for good measure, including a haul of 794 in 2010. For Ormskirk, Maghull, Wigan, Ipswich and Barlaston, he utterly dominated. Why not stay put at one place? “I was getting old, so I had to take the offers.”It still rankles Madanayake that four seasons – between 2013 and 2016 – do not count towards his first-class numbers because Sri Lanka Cricket reclassified the ision he was playing in. Instead of 133 matches and 371 wickets (at just 21.9 apiece!) he calculates that this should be more like 200 and 500 with a best of eight for 45. But this didn’t dissuade him: he has turned out for four top-flight teams since, also finding time for a couple of Australian seasons as recently as 2018.He bamboozled them there, just as he did the English clubbies a decade earlier, with his “magic ball”. Yes, after decades in the nets, he has a mystery delivery – like every wily twirler. “It comes into the batsman to hit their pads or bowl them. It looks like a leg spinner but it’s not. It’s a surprise.”Madanayake’s celebrations remain as enthusiastic as a pup, for there is nothing he enjoys more than duping a batsman not even half his age. “They look fit but don’t use their brains. Without a brain, you can’t play the game.” In the short term, he has a job to do: keep Kalutara Town in the top flight with four rounds still to play post-Covid. If they drop? Simple, he’ll find another home.Samson says the last player to play into their 50s was another Sri Lankan, Somachandra de Silva, finishing at 52 in 1995. The most recent regular Englishman was Ray Illingworth when returning to captain Yorkshire in 1982 and 1983. Madanayake believes he can “easily” join this club in 2024 after breaking the 30-year barrier next November. “The kids ask why this old dog is still playing, but the clubs need my experience.”As for English cricket, Madanayake is not finished either. In fact, he wants me to tell prospective clubs that he is ready to serve, both as a bowler and a coach – earning his level two ECB badge in the past. “I have vast experience there,” he says. “There is a lack of spin in England because they don’t know how to spin and grip the ball in those conditions. I did it – my stats show that. So, I can teach the kids.”On the available evidence, those clubs should form an orderly queue.• This is an extract from the ’s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

That places the Surface Go 2 in the low-end PC bracket and makes it Microsoft’s cheapest current PC, undercutting the Surface Pro 7 by £300.Tested here is the £529 Intel Pentium Gold 4425Y version with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of faster SSD storage with the £125 Alcantara Type Cover.Not a lot has changed since the original. The Surface Go 2 has a slightly larger 10.5in screen, which helps boost the real estate you have on there. Other than an extra 22g in weight, the magnesium body of the machine is identical to the original Surface Go, at 8.3mm thick, 245mm long and 175mm tall. It weighs in at 544g. By any metric the Surface Go 2 is a tiny portable PC, that’s easy to carry or fit in a bag, much like Apple’s similarly priced and sized iPad Air.The 10.5in LCD touchscreen is great. Crisp, bright, good looking and responsive. The kickstand on the back continues to be fantastic, while the build quality is top notch.The new Pentium Gold 4425Y performs more or less the same as the Pentium Gold 4415Y in the original Surface Go, according to both benchmarks and real-world experience. That means it’s not exactly fast, but is capable of more than you might imagine.Photo editing in Affinity Photo was a just little slow for complex tasks, word processing and general office duties were no bother, while the new Chromium-based Edge browser handled 10+ tabs with ease. Only a little slowdown was noticeable when you tried to do too much at once, such as updating apps, browsing and using a word processor all at the same time.The tablet even managed to power a 4K display at 60Hz via USB-C without issue.When just used for video playback the Surface Go 2 lasted closer to eight hours, streaming video via Netflix.Like the recent Surface Pro X and Surface Laptop 3, the Surface Go 2 continues Microsoft’s trend of more repairable devices, and was awarded a score of three out of 10 by repair specialists iFixit, which is two-points better than the previous generation Surface Go.Some of the components are modular but not user-replaceable, except for the detachable keyboard, and repairs must be performed by authorised service providers. The out-of-warranty service fee for the Surface Go 2 from Microsoft is £236.40.The Surface Go 2 ships with Windows 10 Home in S mode, which restricts the installation of apps to those from the Microsoft Store for greater security. Turning off S mode is a one-time operation that cannot be reversed, but it takes just a couple of clicks.S mode is great if you live within Microsoft’s ecosystem, or if everything you need is in the Microsoft Store, but it blocks the installation of programs such as Chrome, WhatsApp desktop and Signal, which aren’t available.As a productivity machine the Surface Go 2 is solid. It managed everything I do as a journalist without much fuss, including simple word processing, spreadsheet-wrangling, browsing, note taking, image editing and video conferencing. It would struggle with serious video editing.The slightly larger 10.5in screen helps with split-screen multi-tasking, such as Evernote on the right and PDFs on the left of the screen, but still requires lots of sideways scrolling in documents and websites.As a home-entertainment machine, things are little trickier. The great screen and good speakers make the Surface Go 2 good for video, but there’s still an large app gap compared to Apple’s iPad.The Microsoft Store sells movies and TV shows, and has a great Netflix app, including offline downloads, Virgin TV Go, Demand 5 and iTunes. But others such as Disney+, Amazon Video, Google Play Movies, ITV Hub, BBC iPlayer, All4 and Sky Go have to be viewed in a browser.BBC iPlayer and Sky Go have fairly clunky programs that allow offline downloads, but they are not in the Microsoft Store, so not accessible in S mode.Reading apps are equally few and far between, with no Kindle, Comixology or Marvel Unlimited apps at all.One big advantage Windows 10 has over Apple’s iPad OS is support for multiple users. This includes limited and monitored kids’ accounts, which work great with Windows Hello face recognition.The Surface Go 2’s Type Cover keyboard is the same as the previous version and is cross-compatible, costing £100 or £125, depending on the material.The Type Cover is one of the best keyboards available on any laptop or tablet, matching those available for the larger Surface Pro 7, but with a slightly smaller layout, which took about five minutes to get used to.The keys feel great and the trackpad is smooth, responsive and accurate. It will beat any keyboard and trackpad fitted to any Windows laptop or Chromebook under £500, and should have been included in the price of the tablet.The Surface Go 2 once again proves that budget Windows PCs can be good.It won’t win any awards for speed, but it will handle most things without locking up or driving you nuts. The magnesium body and 10.5in screen are far better than what you’ll get elsewhere for under £400, while the kickstand and range of accessories are great.As with the original, the app gap means the Surface Go 2 is a better productivity machine than media-consumption tablet. But it’s also good for sharing with the family, and is up to being your only computer or used as an ultraportable second computer.The 64GB version will be slower as it uses eMMC storage instead of the faster SSD technology. And while £399 is an extremely attractive starting price, it doesn’t include the essential £100 Type Cover keyboard.Other than wifi 6 and Bluetooth 5 support, only the slightly larger 10.5in screen really separates the lower-end Pentium Gold Surface Go 2 models from the equally excellent original, so look out for cut-price deals.At the real price of £499 or more, you can certainly get a more powerful Windows laptop, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a better experience. The gutsy little Surface Go 2 is simply great.Cons: relatively short battery life, no USB-A ports, £100 keyboard essential but not included, relatively slow performance This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

I have never stood on the deck of a Greek ferry, watching the islands slip by, without thinking of the magnificent, mercurial character of Odysseus. And the descriptions of Greece! “Rosy-fingered dawn” is undeniable. Some people have problems with the “wine-dark sea”, but really, take a good look at the right time. The only problem is picking the best translation. I’m a fan of Lattimore, Fagles and Fitzgerald. I am also very excited to read a new one by Emily Wilson. In fact, I’ve read the same book in several different versions, which must count for something, including a bad attempt at the original Greek. It’s a foundation for all reading.Mary Renault was one of the writers who sent me to Greece in the first place. I read her in my early teens and her “historical” takes on myth are still a firm favourite. This, and its sequel The Bull from the Sea, are a retelling of the life of Theseus, and the first book has action in the Peloponnese, Crete and Athens – all places that have played an important part in my life. Renault does not shy away from the difficult aspects residing in these tales. There is dark stuff here, and no real heroes, either. If you enjoyed Game of Thrones, Renault might be where to go next.The location of the unnamed village in Little Infamies is not given, and Karnezis has said it is not necessarily even Greek, although all the names and details point in that direction. I like to imagine it in the Peloponnese, but perhaps only because that’s the region whose villages I know best. A series of interconnecting short stories lays bare the local life, and anyone familiar with this environment will find it deeply familiar. Even the mythological touches make sense – you’re always half-expecting a centaur to pop up in Greece and engage you in conversation. There are dark secrets beneath the surface of the village, but Karnezis always treats his characters with deep affection.With all this myth and nature roiling around it is good to remind ourselves that the Greeks are also famous for science, maths and logic. Not that this book is without emotion. Uncle Petros is a mathematician laid low by an unsolvable problem, and generally considered a failure. Only his unnamed nephew still thinks he may be redeemable. Don’t be scared off by the maths: this is essentially a study of a human relationship. In between all this we get a superb rendering of a certain facet of Athens, with its old houses and apartments, courtyard gardens and elegant decay.Crete, particularly its mountains and southern coast, was one of my first loves in Greece, so I have to include a couple of books about the island. I must also include some Kazantzakis. Zorba is too obvious, although I do recommend it, and it (secretly) took its inspiration from the Peloponnese, despite being set in Crete. This brooding tale of Captain Michalis (the original title of the book) takes place during the Turkish occupation, and the fact that the local Turkish bey is his blood brother shows the complications of the time. It all boils up into a properly Shakespearean tragedy while showing the characters’, and the author’s, deep love of their island.Caves are important in Greece, providing a connection between our world and the hidden one. Herakles and Orpheus both descended to Hades through one, and Theseus’s labyrinth is surely another. I once climbed down a steel ladder into a deep cave in the Cretan mountains. At the bottom was a rather macabre shrine to a local saint, lit only by my feeble torch. I had an absolute panic attack, and blame much of it on this book, an intriguing mix of adventure story, mythology and horror. It’s not a masterpiece – Durrell’s non-fiction on Greece is better – but it nails that chthonic feeling that rests just below the blue skies and waters of Greece.Talking of dark undercurrents, this little-known book by a famous author gets beneath the skin of Greece magnificently. It is partly set in the Mani, a rocky and often barren part of the southern mainland where my family lived for several years. It is a starkly beautiful area, dotted with tower house fortifications and small Byzantine chapels, but there is always something lurking in the landscape. Imagine a breeze through olive trees for a moment, and then see what DeLillo does with it: “Wind blew across the olive groves, causing a wild tremor, a kind of panic, treetops going silver.” Anyone who has visited this part of the world outside of the somnambulant summer will instantly know this.This is possibly my favourite book on this list, mainly because I have spent many an evening reading it to my kids. The Greek myths can be deeply weird and confusing – check out the Robert Graves version if you don’t believe me – but children seem to cope with them much more intuitively than adults. The premise behind this collection is genius. Atticus, a tale teller, sets off from his home in Crete to a festival of stories near Troy, travelling through much of Greece. On the way, in exchange for food, lodging and transportation, he relates the myths that are appropriate to the area, starting with the birth of Zeus and ending with the Trojan war. It’s ostensibly a kids’ book, but I would happily read this to myself, and much of my knowledge of Greek mythology rests on it.

With Portugal further easing lockdown restrictions on 18 May, restaurants and cafes are beginning to reopen across Porto. Café Porta do Olival is among them. A cheerful neighbourhood joint directly outside my office in the city’s historic centre, it serves mostly locals. This is fortunate as there isn’t a tourist to be seen.The sparkle in Sonia’s eyes gives away her smile, which is hidden behind the mask that all cafe and restaurant staff are now obliged to wear. We chat briefly. She is elated to be back at work, she tells me free of the confines of home and, more importantly, excited about the prospect of some money coming in again.A boom destination in recent years, central Porto is dependent on tourism these days. For Sonia, and many like her, the last few months of confinamento have been tough. Nor is it over yet. Normally all hustle-and-bustle, business at Café Porta do Olival is noticeably slow. The usual trio of grannies gossiping in the corner are nowhere to be seen. No workmen popping in for a quick espresso no hum of the television news nor the scramble over the sole copy of the daily Jornal de Notícias. Social-distancing rules leave only two lonely tables inside, in fact. The rest are consigned to the flagstone pavement.Today’s reopening is not as I’d imagined it. Confined to home since mid-March, I’d played over this moment many times. My first sip of machine-made espresso a look over the newspaper perhaps a cheeky pastel de nata. In my mind’s eye, it would be a joyous moment, full of noise and merriment, but this relative quiet is disconcerting. On reflection, it’s perhaps not so surprising. People are still wary. There’s a nervous guardedness about the city, like we’re enduring a collective first day back at school.I’m surprised also by the emotions stirred up by the lack of tourist crowds. I thought their absence would be, well, liberating. A chance to seize back the city a welcome break from hearing English spoken at every turn. But it’s not like that. Tourists may be here today and gone tomorrow but, in a way that I’d never appreciated before today, they’re an intrinsic part of the city. An annoying one, at times, certainly. On my cycle into work, someone will almost always step into my path while staring down at a map or city tracking App. But today, nothing. No queue snaking across the road outside the Lello bookshop. No selfie brigade snapping away beneath Torre dos Clérigos bell tower. Not even a single open-deck tour bus to push me over into the curb.I’ve never experienced the city without its touts and tour groups, so I have no reference point for this emptiness. Perhaps that’s why I miss it? But my friend José, who lives downtown and joins me for a coffee, also confesses to a certain saudade – longing – for the daily hubbub. Yes, local residents love to moan about the influx of tourists: the high rents the constant noise the hike in prices. But, as he readily admits, the city is livelier and more liveable now than it’s ever been.This reopening of cafes, restaurants and museums is a first step to seeing that vitality return. For now, in the absence of foreign tourists, many Portuenses are rejigging their businesses to attract local residents. My chef friend Pedro, for example, is relaunching his popular restaurant with a new concept (“little chats, little dishes and big glasses of wine”). Another friend, Juan, who owns a gorgeous boutique hotel, is hoping to lure exhausted Porto-based parents to take a “city break” on their own doorsteps. Others who are more dependent on overseas visitors, such as Sergio at Porto Running Tours or André at Taste Porto, are busy getting everything in place for the moment the borders reopen and planes return to the skies.Portugal has been here before, of course. A decade or so ago, the financial crisis almost brought the country to its knees. “That was bad,” says José. “Really bad.” He hopes this time recovery will come more quickly. For now, as a flight attendant, he’s grounded. Much like me. Like all of us. Yet at least we now have the chance of meeting up together to eat, drink, and – banal as it may sound – be merry.We talk tentatively of meeting up with our kids tomorrow Serralves Contemporary Art Museum has an open day. “An excuse for another coffee,” José suggests. Halfway out of my seat, my mask strapped back on, my smile is lost on him. Nonetheless, I hope he spots the sparkle in my eye."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14cbb14d367aadc2e544106eb9f117aa3237a166/1090_326_5447_3269/master/5447.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb65455d308f88ccc81f8ac2944b9796","title":"thorne gets horn netflix tv writer jack seedy paris jazz sizzler the eddy","story":"He’s the gritty chronicler of disaffected Britain. So what tempted the writer of This Is England to tackle the Paris jazz scene? Clue: not the jazz. As it launches on Netflix, he tells all Thanks to lockdown we’ve become a nation of telly addicts – what else is there left to do? So when I speak to Jack Thorne, the multi-award-winning writer of His Dark Materials, This Is England and new Netflix drama The Eddy, I’m keen to know which prestige TV shows he’s bingeing on.“Anything with Keith Lemon in it,” he says. “Me and my wife get an hour to watch TV at night, otherwise we’re not going to be able to cope with Elliott” – their four-year-old son.Being cooped up at home is nothing new for the writer – who admits to a period of “about seven and a half years when I didn’t really leave the house” due to a mixture of dedication to his work and social anxiety (“I’m very, very awkward”). But watching so little television is certainly novel for Thorne. The 41-year-old grew up in Bristol and Berkshire, and would spend five or six hours a day in front of the TV – mostly on the sofa next to his mum – running straight through from EastEnders to Tim Piggott-Smith in The Chief before the news kicked in at 10.And it didn’t stop there. “My mate lived near the school, so we’d go over at lunchtime and watch Neighbours,” Thorne says. “And then I’d watch it again in the evening. I’d watch the same show twice. In one day. I was a relatively clever kid – what was I doing? I could tell you the entire story of Tony Stamp in The Bill from the moment he started to the moment he left the force.”These might not be the viewing habits you’d expect of someone who has won Bafta and Olivier awards, but Thorne always had his sights set on the small screen. “I remember when I was on work experience at the Royal Court telling Max Stafford-Clark that what I really wanted was to write TV. And he said, ‘What the fuck are you doing here then?’”Whatever it was, it worked. Thorne has managed to combine a prolific screenwriting career with high-profile theatrical endeavours, from Harry Potter and the Cursed Child to the National Theatre of Scotland’s adaptation of Let the Right One In. “I love making theatre,” says Thorne, “but I understand TV because I’ve watched an awful lot of it.”It’s this voracious appetite that perhaps prepared him for the breadth of subject matter he has covered, from interracial adoption in Kiri to the murderous teens of Glue. Thorne moved quickly from theatre into screenwriting, working on Skins in his 20s. It was there that he met a 17-year-old Daniel Kaluuya, long before Hollywood came calling. Despite their differences – “he’d watched Fresh Prince of Bel-Air 400 times, but he’d never seen the Bill” – they hit it off and would later work together again on his apocalyptic teen drama, The Fades. That was Thorne’s first solo TV commission and, despite being cancelled after one series, it won the Bafta for best drama. Its world of angels, the risen dead and apocalypse, could have been offputting to the academy but whatever fantastical scenario Thorne plots out, he manages to make it accessible and grounded.While Netflix has been keen to talk up the involvement of Damien Chazelle, Oscar winning writer-director of La La Land and Whiplash, Thorne says the show was “a massive collaborative effort”. It originated from an idea by acclaimed music producer Glen Ballard and, along with Alan Ball (the creator of Six Feet Under), Chazelle was brought on board to direct before he had hit the big time, while Thorne was the last to join. But it was Thorne who was tasked with crafting the story. The protagonist even shares a name with his son. “We’d just failed our third round of IVF having decided that we’d definitely call him Elliott if he was a boy,” Thorne tells me later over email. “I stole his name for a TV character, essentially.”Which must make it all the more frustrating that some have framed the show as Chazelle’s response to accusations of racial insensitivity in his past projects. La La Land prompted a backlash due to the way it framed a white protagonist as the true spirit of jazz, counterposed with John Legend playing a commercial sell-out. The Eddy also has jazz at its heart, but this time there is a black leading man: Moonlight’s André Holland as club owner Elliot. And that had nothing to do with Chazelle.One advantage of having a successful track record is that Thorne is able to bring such voices on board, and elevate talented writers who might not have had the opportunity yet. “There’s degrees to which I’m trying to bring forward people,” Thorne admits, “but I’m not arrogant enough to think that I’m Father Christmas.”What interested Thorne in The Eddy was not, as one might assume, the music – “I’ve got to be honest, jazz wasn’t really the thing”. He spends far more time talking about city infrastructure (his dad was a town planner), Grenfell and the exclusion of working-class urban communities than he does fivefour rhythms or Louis Armstrong. What really drew him to this story, he says, was the version of Paris it would allow him to examine. This isn’t the picture postcard view, all pretty bridges and the Eiffel Tower. It’s life in the grittier arrondissements.“There’s something about Paris, because of the ring road,” he says. “The exclusivity it creates. I’d spent a lot of time there, I hung out in those places, mostly talking to dealers. I’d seen the lack of infrastructure. There are these incredible high-rise blocks, and then there’s just one shop serving the community. It’s really exciting to explore the melting pot of Paris, with the melting pot of jazz.”Thorne might predominantly write crowdpleasing work but political messages lurk under the surface. He brooks no argument about TV as the opiate of the masses and has been gratified to see the medium garner more respect at a time when it is one of the only forms of culture left to us. “I follow a few famous people on Twitter, who normally talk slightly disparagingly about TV. And it’s been really interesting to see them being so enthusiastic about Quiz or Normal People.”Thorne knows his colourful shows are not exactly Ken Loach – “I’m not as clever or as brilliant as he is” – but doesn’t believe there’s only one way to put forward progressive ideas in entertainment. “I think fantasy allows you to ask the big questions: what’s the point of life, what are we trying to challenge, what are we trying to protect?”And so he worries about what will be left of the arts once the coronavirus crisis has passed. Thorne has been a passionate advocate for a more inclusive attitude towards disability in the industry – and believes things had started to improve. But with money bound to be tight it would be all too easy for things to slip backwards. “I could feel the landscape changing and I’m petrified that when I go back, the theatres won’t have the resources or the energy to support that,” he says. “Because the Arts Council isn’t going to be able to support them all.”Thorne’s next project was set to be a lavish retelling of A Christmas Carol at the Old Vic theatre – which is still due later this year. It’s another adaptation for a writer who is perhaps best known for taking on others’ work.“I love doing other people’s stuff,” he admits. “I learn so much. I’ve spent about four or five years trying to think Philip Pullman’s thoughts. He is one of the cleverest, most soulful writers I’ve ever encountered. And I hope that by spending time with him, I’m making myself into a better writer. If I just wrote my own stuff, I would probably go down that cul-de-sac of being a slightly tormented, anxious, weird man.”And yet that is what he plans to do in the next phase of what he somewhat bashfully calls his career next. “I’m trying to self-generate a bit more,” he says. “I’m trying to be a more conscious about my choices. I feel like I’ve been given a lot of stories, and now I need to work out what stories I want to tell.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24bca06caf266e6447dc3360602d291c37d34402/0_0_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fce761cc227cb2a224a81d9148060496","title":"people who are shielding how do you feel about the new lockdown rules","story":"As restrictions ease for people who are not subject to health conditions, do you feel forgotten about, isolated or cut off?The UK government has set out its plan to leave lockdown, but the changes will not affect everyone equally.

Vinter, a Leeds-based journalist, had sent a Saturday morning tweet which contained a simple request: “I would like to see the last normal pic on your phone.”Within hours she had thousands of replies, including one from the woman best known for her part in a political scandal involving the former US president Bill Clinton.“I spotted Jon Ronson had replied, and a couple more fairly high-profile people and then I noticed Monica Lewinsky had,” said Vinter. “I thought: that’s weird, how did she find my little tweet out of nowhere? Then I saw there were thousands of replies.”Vinter’s simple tweet soon took on a life of its own, with almost 8,000 replies, revealing people’s desire for a glimpse of life before lockdown. The hashtag #lastnormalphoto began trending this weekend, with people from across the globe posting the last picture they took before the lockdown measures brought normal life to an end in March.Pictures range from mundane snapshots of life, such as parents and children embarking on their final school run before classrooms were closed, to more joyous occasions including birthday parties with people hugging and chatting in groups – with barely 2cm between them let alone 2 metres – before lockdown made physical distancing mandatory.There’s a shot from the Champions League tie between Liverpool and Atletico Madrid on 11 March, while several people sent images from meet-ups with elderly relatives. Lewinsky sent a picture of a bouquet of flowers she had received.“There are a lot of things that people would have chosen to do if they knew it was coming. It’s a frozen moment in time, I suppose,” said Vinter.Originally inspired by a BBC article, which asked for readers to send photographs, the hashtag is the latest photo callout to become popular on social media. Others include Covid-19 specific themes (#beforesocialdistancing, #sociallydistanced, #nosocialdistancinghere), the nostalgic (#happiertimes, #untilnexttime, #misstheolddays) and the exasperated (#whenwillitend, #2020cancelled).Vinter, who works for the Yorkshire Post and founded the Overtake news site, says there is a question mark over whether the pictures are actually the last ones taken before lockdown, or the most social-media-friendly option.“You could tell some of them were curated,” she said. “It wasn’t actually their last normal picture. It was one they had chosen because it was cool or they thought it made them look good. So there’s an element of narcissism involved.”Vinter puts the popularity of the hashtag down to a combination of that narcissism and nostalgia, as people scroll through their phones and pick out a snapshot of their former life. “It’s nice for people to reflect on what they were doing especially because life changed so quickly,” she says. “People had a feeling that something was going to happen, but no one knew the necessary extreme it would go to.”Vinter’s own entry to the hashtag was of her in a charity shop as she sized up a mirror that she was considering buying. “There was a weird 1970s mirror that I liked, so I’d just taken a picture of it. I wanted to have a think about it and imagine where it might go in my house and then go back for it,” she said.“Obviously the charity shop is shut, but I’m hoping it’s still there and no one has got to it in the meantime.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef010b60dff4602cdd6d13006c6836058808cd90/0_0_6144_3688/master/6144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47b3c72f7ebf8cb1307fbf8b1ef66b2a","title":"more than 1800 private planes landed in uk during covid 19 lockdown","story":"Figure includes privately owned planes, business jets, cargo aircraft and military flightsAt least 1,800 private aircraft landed in the UK during lockdown, official figures have shown, with no requirement for arriving passengers to provide contact details for purposes of tracking the spread of coronavirus.In response to a question from the Conservative peer Baroness Anelay of St Johns, the Home Office said that between 17 March and 14 April, 1,812 private aircraft flights landed at airports in the UK.The figure include privately owned planes, business jets, cargo aircraft and military flights. A breakdown was not provided.In the written answer, the Home Office minister, Baroness Williams of Trafford, said: “There is no Public Health England requirement to record contact details for arriving or departing passengers for Covid-19 purposes.”The UK’s border policy before and during the lockdown is facing increased scrutiny. The government previously revealed that just 273 out of the 18.1 million people who entered the UK in the three months prior to the coronavirus lockdown were formally quarantined.Since 13 March, government policy has been to inform passengers arriving at the border of the measures in place in the UK through posters, screens and leaflets. There has been no enforced quarantine or thermal screening.On 10 May, Boris Johnson said that air passengers arriving in the UK would soon be required to self-isolate. It is now understood that this will also apply to land and sea arrivals.Experts have questioned the scientific basis behind introducing such a policy at this stage in the pandemic and the travel and tourism industry has warned of dire consequences for the sector if such a policy is pursued."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fd4e9e7b77121ed3801e5f5d8ce666736940aa7/0_0_5168_3103/master/5168.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b89402c13ab9748e1250fe7b0adfd3a0","title":"china presents itself as rival to democracy and plays uk says labour stephen kinnock","story":"Foreign policy spokesman Stephen Kinnock says UK needs to stand up to Chinese economic intimidationChina’s authoritarian rulers are presenting themselves as a viable rival to democracy and have played the UK economically, Stephen Kinnock, Labour’s foreign policy spokesman on China, has said.In a significant hardening of the party’s stance towards China, he also described David Cameron’s golden era of engagement with China as “an abject failure”, adding the UK has been naive about China’s intentions. Kinnock called for what he described as a “respect-based realism” towards China, and said he feared at present the UK had insufficient strategic independence from China to stand up to the country’s intimidation.The UK, he said, “had rolled out the red carpet for China and got very very little in return”. He pointed out that the UK is running a £22bn annual trade deficit with China.“It feels like it has been one-way traffic on the economy,” he said. “You can have a debate about trade figures but I think to a large extent we have been played … by a narrative that there was going to be an alignment of the international rules-based order, that there was going to be a slow but steady alignment with democratic norms. That clearly has not happened and the relationship has been too one way.”Kinnock also proposed smarter and beefed-up takeover rules to protect UK firms by including new national security criteria.He called for a reset based on mutual respect and questioned whether China at present had any respect for the UK. He revealed he had recently met China’s “wolf warrior” diplomats at the Chinese embassy in London and found them to show very little respect and instead be largely aggressive.Kinnock has recently been appointed to the opposition frontbench by Keir Starmer, and his remarks are understood to be part of a Labour review of its stance on China and mirrors a similar shift in thinking on the Conservative benches.Speaking to the Radix UK thinktank on Monday night, he said that “managing the rise of China is the number one geopolitical challenge the world is facing” and added there was no single global challenge that can be handled without engagement with China. “All roads lead to China,” he said.But he said there was very little evidence that the west was exacting influence over China’s political trajectory. “If you look at the increasingly hard line they take on human rights issues, the Uighurs, what has been happening in Hong Kong or the position on Taiwan, there is very little evidence of any kind of success in terms of exerting or projecting our influence,” he said.He warned China was increasingly a systemic rival, seeing “its model of responsive authoritarian government becoming something that it sees as a viable alternative to democracy.“That is a message that is being consistently pumped out. Particularly after what has been a quite messy response to managing the coronavirus issue, China is putting itself forward as ‘look, our model of governance is the one that the world should be adopting’,” he said.He insisted that his criticisms did not detract from his admiration of China’s remarkable achievements over the past 30 years, or his call for mutual respect, adding: “There is a big question whether it is mutual and I am forced to draw the conclusion that, as things stand at the moment, it it not. I have had a conversation in recent days with someone that might be described as a wolf warrior diplomat and I would say there was very little respect in that conversation. There is a tone of what I would say was real aggression coming forward.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0de5dfc4fdfc5465e4b618de9ad479c172baaf9e/0_148_3895_2337/master/3895.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aac1189dde192cff60313274e598209d","title":"china puts city of shulan under wuhan style lockdown after fresh covid 19 cases","story":"Measures tightened further in city of 700,000 close to Russian border that has been deemed a high-risk areaChinese authorities have sealed off the north-eastern city of Shulan, home to about 700,000 people, after an outbreak of coronavirus, imposing measures similar to those used in Wuhan.All villages and residential compounds in the city were closed off, and only one person from each household allowed out for two hours every second day for essentials.The development came as Beijing signalled it could ease some border restrictions as it prepares for the start on Thursday of its signature political event, the Communist party’s delayed annual congress, also known as the “two sessions”.In Shulan, residential compounds were restricted to just one entry and exit for emergency vehicles, and banned non-residents and vehicles from entering. If there are confirmed cases in a community residence, no one can enter or leave.Last week, the city was reclassified as high risk after a cluster of cases emerged connected to a woman with no known history of travel or exposure to the virus. In response, authorities ordered the temporary closure of public places, schools and public transport.On Monday however these restrictions were increased further, with China Daily referring to the city as “the latest pandemic hotspot in the country”. It said hundreds of people were under medical quarantine, and that life might not go back to normal for weeks.Jilin province authorities said that due to the “severe circumstances” of the epidemic in the areas surrounding the city of Jiaohe, public transport inside the city and between the city and neighbouring counties would be stopped until further notice.The north-east of the country, which borders Russia and North Korea, has emerged as an area of serious concern, as cases appear to have been brought in from across the border, and then begun to spread locally.At least 34 people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 in Jilin province in the past fortnight.Despite the highest level of lockdowns prompted by just a few dozen cases, Chinese media have said the country can handle more imported cases and will likely begin opening up again.Chinese media has reported the country is likely to ease its border controls after the two sessions meeting, which begins Thursday.Relaxed entry rules could apply to Chinese students overseas who want to return home after graduating, and business travellers, but not large numbers of tourists yet, according to academics quoted by the Global Times.Zhou Zijun, a public health expert at Peking university, told the paper China “can now properly handle a small level of imported cases”.Discussions were reportedly beginning between countries including China, Japan and South Korea, about opening channels for business travel, with strict testing requirements.On Monday China reported six new cases of Covid-19, of which three were local transmissions. Two were in Jilin province, and one in Hubei. The national health commission also reported 17 new asymptomatic coronavirus cases.Chinese authorities are particularly sensitive to the possibility of further outbreaks, just days out from its annual “two sessions”, which had been postponed from March because of the coronavirus. While there are extra measures in place to ensure the meeting of party delegates goes ahead safely, it is a sign that Beijing believes it is beginning to go back to normal.At the end of April tens of millions of people travelled for the first time in months over a five-day national holiday, and quarantine requirements on people arriving in Beijing were lifted.Housing officials in charge of residences have been warned they will be removed from their roles if there are new outbreaks, prompting speculation this could backfire and lead to local cover-ups. Some officials in Wuhan – where another small outbreak recently prompted an ambitious plan to test all 11 million residents – and Jilin province have already been removed from their posts, Chinese media has reported."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=35ab56c83366dca86e1a6280dbb22b10","title":"hong kong blocks tiananmen square vigil with gathering ban","story":"Restrictions were due to end but Hong Kong extends social distancing measures for 14 days Hong Kong has in effect banned an annual vigil for the Tiananmen Square massacre by extending its physical distancing measures for another 14 days.After two consecutive days without local transmissions of Covid-19, the city state’s authorities announced some restrictions would ease, but those limiting gatherings to a maximum of eight would be extended for another 14 days.The restrictions were due to expire this week but will now end no earlier than 5 June, the day after Hong Kong’s annual vigil commemorating the Chinese army’s brutal crackdown on protesters in 1989.The event has been held every year since 1990. It is the biggest and traditionally the only major commemoration of the incident allowed in China, sometimes drawing more than 100,000 people.Macau has traditionally held a photo exhibit on “tank man”, but last week authorities withdrew approval.At a press briefing on Tuesday afternoon, Hong Kong’s secretary for food and health, Sophia Chan, said the city did not have the right conditions yet to relax physical distancing laws and denied the extension was designed to stop the vigil.“All along we have extended bans by 14 days,” she said. “The latest measure has been following the 14-day rule and our overall consideration is about public health and there is no other factor coming into account.“We are talking about major gatherings,” she emphasised later, and denied there was a double standard for religious gatherings, which would now be allowed, because they were restricted to half the usual capacity and had to be inside a religious place.“We don’t want people to gather. If they gather there are risks.”Police and authorities have been accused of using anti-epidemic laws to break up or prevent protest action, which is beginning to ramp up again amid increasing encroachments by Beijing.Lee Cheuk-yan, chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, said it was unreasonable to ban political rallies while schools and religious activities could restart. Lee told Asia Times that the organisers would meet to discuss alternatives to the vigil, traditionally held in Victoria Park in the city’s east.Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, earlier said there had been 23 straight days with no local infections before an outbreak was detected in a small family.“We need to remain vigilant but there is no need to panic,” she said.She said Hong Kong had never imposed a full city lockdown, but instead prohibited group gatherings of a certain size “because large crowds make it very easy to transmit infectious disease”.Restaurants and bars have been allowed to reopen in recent weeks under strict conditions, but amid hot weather in the city, crowds have packed out some parts of the entertainment districts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3287ebeec82a7a5eedc8707815d373d96db198c/0_25_2265_1360/master/2265.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=98a7a9c2a1d7c90a7f3d998308d860db","title":"uk coronavirus home test kits run out as eligibility list is expanded","story":"Apparent shortage comes day after Matt Hancock expanded list of people who can get testThe NHS appeared to run out of its daily allocation of home testing kits within hours on Tuesday morning after Matt Hancock said anyone aged five and over with symptoms could get tested for coronavirus.Those trying to order a home test kit were left disappointed as the NHS website said they were not available as early as 10am, while a recorded message on the government’s 119 line said: “We’re very sorry.

A short message on the NHS page read: “We are experiencing very high demand.

It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers – not the public.\u0026nbsp“Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,” the WHO has stated.Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.\u0026nbspThere is no robust scientific evidence – in the form of trials – that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.Also underlying the WHO’s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..The requirement to keep 2 metres distance between people means only 50 MPs can attend the chamber in person, while up to 120 can join proceedings remotely via Zoom. With the support of the Commons Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, most staff are being encouraged to work from home.At Tuesday’s 2pm meeting, Rees-Mogg is expected to vote against renewing the “virtual parliament” standing orders as he seeks to move back towards a traditional, “physical”, parliament.Hoyle, who will also attend the meeting, last week made it plain from the floor of the house that he would close down the Commons if more than 50 MPs occupied the chamber. He is expected to argue that his priority is to keep MPs safe and for everyone to be treated equally and safely by any changes to the virtual system.Last Wednesday, Rees-Mogg told the Commons MPs could not “hide away” while other workers returned to work, raising concerns that the government simply wished to avoid any bad PR they might get for not being seen to be at work.“They wish to hide behind a veneer of virtual parliament … I want to get back to a proper parliament because democracy is essential,” he said.There may be room for a compromise between Rees-Mogg and the unions over a potential restart of bill committees, which scrutinise legislation in detail, and statutory instrument committees. It is understood that the leader of the house is keen for both to restart while unions could be open to a discussion.The unions will argue that the government is at risk of breaching their own guidance to employers, which states that “employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions”.Reps are concerned about the impact if there is an end to virtual voting. They will argue that social distancing measures mean votes could take an hour to resolve.The Prospect deputy general secretary, Garry Graham, said: “Staff have made herculean efforts to enable parliament to work remotely, keeping MPs and staff safe and ensuring our democracy is unimpaired.“We will not allow people to be put at risk simply to create good PR for the government.”Amy Leversidge, the assistant general secretary of the FDA union, said: “Parliament must set the example to all other employers across the UK and follow the government guidelines to continue to work at home where possible – the commission should make the decision that the house will renew the standing orders.”Some parliamentary veterans doubt Rees-Mogg is serious about a full return to parliament. They claim he is prepared to lose in a fight with the Speaker and the unions so ministers can blame them when questioned why MPs are allowed to work from home while others are told told return to work.“This is a canny move by Jacob, and it is probably done with the sanction of those close to No 10,” said one senior MP."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ed764457914a8e364a0e0cb91cc24187bc23867/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=641c0f1d6861cc0d3671b98a713b76e1","title":"what is involved when taking a coronavirus test in the uk","story":"Whether drive-through or done at home, the procedure is the same – but trickier for childrenAnyone in the UK aged five and over with symptoms is now eligible for a coronavirus test. The Department for Health and Social Care says it is currently unsuitable for children under five.The options are to get a drive-through appointment or a home testing kit but either way they involve a similar procedure.On 18 May, Matt Hancock announced coronavirus testing is being extended in the UK to anyone over the age of five with symptoms.Before then,\u0026nbspeligibility had been limited\u0026nbspto a series of groups including key workers, those aged over 65, people who could not work from home, or people who lived with someone from one of these groups.Those with symptoms can now\u0026nbspuse the gov.uk website to book home test kits or appointments at drive-through centres across the country.The test involves taking a swab of the nose and the back of the throat, which can be done by the person themselves or by someone else.Taking swabs from children is likely to be challenging given the intrusive nature of the procedure but experts say that the key is to get them to stay as still as possible. Among the suggested methods for putting children at ease are getting them to count to three or take a deep breath. They can also hold something that may provide comfort such as a soft toy, favourite blanket or stress ball. Alternatively, they could be given a tablet computer to watch, although, for the nose swab test, the child will have to look up so it should be placed above them.The NHS guidance is to place the tip of the cotton bud gently just inside one of the nostrils and gently wipe it around the inside of the nose before repeating for the other nostril with the same swab. It says that no force is required and there is no need to push the bud far into the nostril.Obtaining the swab from the throat involves opening the mouth wide, sticking out the tongue and wiping the soft tip of the swab several times across the very back of the throat, behind the arch. Ensure you swab the sides of the arch where the tonsils protrude and try to avoid swabbing the tongue and teeth, NHS England warns that taking the throat swab may make you gag but should not be painful.Washing hands before and after is crucial and home testing kits provide guidance on how to pack and dispatch the samples."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cab8555ba1496271f03db96166d075da6e80ace9/327_263_3180_1909/master/3180.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8eb1c86bbbfbb79244c32105115d43d","title":"pitch perfect the deserted playing fields of cologne in pictures","story":"As Germany’s Bundesliga becomes the world’s first major football league to resume during the coronavirus pandemic, Mika Volkmann’s drone photographs suggest the amateur game in Cologne still has some way to go"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ae9df9be23344f55a90a55c8e2800000f5300b6/0_18_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=376534da9947d9cc8dd599819f0b7574","title":"uk coronavirus live latest updates","story":"Overall deaths in England and Wales in week up to 8 May were down for the third week in a row, at 12,657At the start of the coronavirus crisis politicians and their scientific advisers seemed united, an impression created by Boris Johnson appearing with Prof Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, its chief scientific adviser, at the first government press conferences. But these days Johnson rarely shows up and the scientists and the politicians are engaging in the preliminary rounds of a ‘blame game’ battle that will no doubt come to a grim and acrimonious conclusion at the long-awaited public inquiry.Ministers stress they have been following the science, and this morning Thérése Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, took that formula to its logical conclusion by effectively saying it meant that, if the wrong decisions were taken, that was because the scientists gave the wrong advice. (See 9.32am.)This morning Prof John Edmunds, professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of Sage, the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, has been giving evidence to the Lords science committee and he offered a different perspective. His department has been responsible for some of the modelling that has helped to inform government decision making. But, when asked about whether schools should open, he insisted that ultimately this was a decision for politicians, not scientists. He said:Clearly the decision to open primary schools or not is a political one. It is not a scientific decision. Scientists can offer some advice.It looks like the risk to children is low and that the vast majority don’t have significant symptoms ... It may be that they are less likely to transmit to others as well, and so the risk to others may be relatively low.But, overall, you have to weigh up those risks with other things, risks to the community, problems with children - clearly, we can’t keep children off school forever. Weighing all of those things needs to be done by politicians.The National Trust expects to take a £200m hit to its finances after closing all its properties during the lockdown.Hilary McGrady, director general of the National Trust, told a parliamentary committee the financial blow had come after the charity shut its properties on 20 March. The £200m figure represents nearly a third of the charity’s total income in the last financial year, meaning the organisation is facing a significant shortfall.While McGrady said that National Trust parks and gardens would be first to reopen, the charity’s houses are unlikely to reopen before late August. She told the digital, culture, media and sport select committee that the estimated impact of Covid-19 “is going to be in the region of about £200m to the trust this year”.The trust is “desperate to open” as soon as it is safe to do so, she said, highlighting the value of the spaces for the nation’s mental wellbeing. She added: Our members want us to be open, but they do want us to open safely. And we will do this in a really controlled and careful way, that’s why we’ve introduced the booking system.“But it is incredibly important just for, apart from anything else, the mental wellbeing of the nation that they can get out, and access places like the National Trust.“We offer incredibly safe spaces for people to be able to visit and just, you know, have a bit of space and have access to nature and we think it’s really important to get doing that sooner rather than later.”The trust received a total income of £634m in 2019, according to its accounts, up from £595m the year before. In 2019 it banked £192m from investment income. The market value of its investments totalled £1.3bn last year.Wagamama is to reopen dozens of its restaurants across the country to expand its home delivery service.The Japanese-inspired restaurant chain, which has been forced to shut its doors to customers amid the Covid-19 pandemic, launched a trial at five of its delivery kitchens earlier this month. After the “successful” trials in London and Leeds, the company will reopen 24 more sites on Thursday with a further 20 next week. In total, the chain hopes to have 49 sites open for delivery by the start of June, expanding to 67 by the end of the month.Sites opening on Thursday include those in Newcastle, Sheffield city centre, Liverpool, Manchester Spinningfields, as well as several in London.Wagamama said it had devised a schedule of reopening new sites that would allow staff to slowly return to delivery-only work at their own discretion. Emma Woods, the Wagamama chief executive, said: Over the past couple of months our focus has been on creating a safe working environment for our team members and our two-week trial has enabled our teams to return to work safely.The next logical step for us is to open additional sites throughout the UK, this will still very much form a test and learn approach for the business.The Queen has discussed “the state of the world” and the Covid-19 pandemic with the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau.The 94-year-old monarch, who is also Queen of Canada, spoke to Trudeau yesterday – the day of her official birthday in the country. Trudeau tweeted: We talked about the state of the world, Covid-19, and more. I also thanked her for the hopeful messages she has sent during these difficult times, and I wished her the very best this Victoria Day.”Victoria Day - 18 May - is the Queen’s official birthday in Canada. As monarch of the Commonwealth, the Queen has a strong bond with Canada. It has been her most frequent overseas destination, visiting it more than 20 times.As a young child in the 1970s, Trudeau met the Queen several times through his father, Pierre Trudeau, who was one of Canada’s longest-serving prime ministers.The government has issued a response to the ONS death figures figures out today. (See 9.44am, 10.11am, 10.42am and 10.56am.) A spokesperson for the Department for Health and Social Care said:Every death from this virus is a tragedy and our deepest sympathies go out to the families who have sadly lost relatives.Supporting the social care sector throughout this pandemic is a priority. We are working around the clock to give the social care sector the equipment and support they need.We are ensuring millions of items of PPE are available to care workers, using our increased testing capacity to test care home residents and staff regardless of symptoms and introducing our new £600m infection control fund to help prevent the spread in care homes.The Treasury has quadrupled the value of loans available to larger businesses affected by coronavirus. In an announcement this morning it said that companies would now be able to receive up to £200m from the coronavirus large business interruption loan scheme, which previously had a maximum payout of £50m. It said that loans under the expanded scheme would be made available to firms from Tuesday 26 May.So far only £359m has been made available to businesses through the coronavirus large business interruption loan scheme. But almost £19bn has been made available through the Covid corporate financing facility, more than £8bn through bounce-back loans, and £6bn through the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme.And here are two charts from the ONS report that illustrate excess death figures. The figures relate to England and Wales.This chart tracks the figures for all deaths, and the figures for coronavirus deaths. Excess deaths are those above the five-year average.And this chart shows that, although deaths not involving coronavirus were above average for six weeks in early spring, in the week ending 8 May deaths not involving coronavirus were actually below the long-term average. But, overall, the death rate that week was still well above the long-term average because of the coronavirus deaths.This chart from the ONS report helps to illustrate this point.The Treasury has this morning published new figures about the impact of its various coronavirus job and business support schemes showing, among other things, that 8m jobs have now been furloughed, at a cost so far of £11.1bn.A “significant percentage” of patients admitted to hospital with Covid-19 had blood clots in their lungs, a study has revealed. As PA Media reports, research carried out by a team at the Brighton and Sussex Medical School (BSMS) has found infection caused by coronavirus to be associated with a high incidence of venous thromboembolism, a condition in which a blood clot forms in the deep veins of the leg, groin or arm and can travel to the lungs, leading to pulmonary embolism.The study, published in the Clinical Medicine Journal, was carried out at the Brighton and Sussex university hospitals NHS trust, including two acute hospital sites in southern England.The figure given by the ONS statistician Nick Stripe for UK excess deaths (see 10.11am) is broadly in line with the forecasts for this number that other specialists have been producing.Yesterday the Financial Times’ Chris Giles, who has been doing his own modelling for excess deaths, posted these on Twitter.And yesterday Jamie Jenkins, a former ONS official, produced his own latest daily estimate.Nick Stripe, head of the health analysis and life events ision at the Office for National Statistics, told the BBC a few minutes ago that the total number of excess deaths in the UK - the number above what might expected at this time of year, judged by a five-year average, was just under 55,000 by early May.Scientists, and ministers, have repeatedly said that the excess death figures will ultimately prove the most reliable guide as to how badly the UK has been hit by coronavirus.Stripe told the BBC:Across England and Wales up to 8 May we are now looking at an excess deaths figure of just under 50,000. If we look at the UK as a whole, that is just under 55,000 excess deaths.Stripe said that within the next couple of weeks the ONS planned to publish more research looking at why the excess deaths figure was so high. But he said a report published by the ONS on Friday, on deaths in April, did shed some light on what was happening. He went on:That showed that deaths from dementia and Alzheimer disease had gone up very, very significantly during April, as had deaths from something known as “ill-defined conditions”. That is often where the certifying doctor puts things like frailty or old age on the death certificate. Usually in the very old, where there might not be a specific morbidity, but the patient has been unwell, you’ll often get these ill-defined conditions. And they were up significantly as well in April.Stripe said there could be two reasons for this increase. First “normal care pathways” could be disrupted ie, fewer patients were going to hospital, because the hospitals were concentrating on coronavirus. Second, coronavirus might be a factor in these deaths, without doctors being able to confirm that. He explained:There may be some cases where Covid is present but it is not obvious to the certifying doctor that that is the case.And it may be the case that this big jump in the number of dementia and Alzheimer deaths could explain part of that reason there. It could well be that in the very old, if the patient is not able to describe their symptoms very well, there may be many other co-morbidities, that perhaps the doctor has not felt able, in the absence of a positive test, to put Covid on the death certificate.The Office for National Statistics has just published the latest weekly death figures for England and Wales. They cover the week up to Friday 8 May (or week 19, as the ONS calls it).Here are the main points."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4256586.1589827722!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"galway could go out again but it was only the weather that was back to normal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t  A quiet Eglinton Street in Galway city centre on Monday. Photograph: Joe O’Shaughnessy.It was the day for which the nation has been pining: the freedom to play a socially distant game of golf or tennis - within five kilometers from home - and then the unbearable excitement of stopping off at the hardware store on the way home.Galway could go out again. Sort of. So needless to say, the weather was a drag.Galway city responded to phase one of Irelands’ great economic re-awakening with a few small queues of customers outside the retail parks but the city’s high street won’t feel right again until the day the many, many pubs can throw open their many doors. If someone dropped a coin at the top of Quay Street on Monday noontime, you might have heard it hit the cobbles down around Sally Longs.Farrell’s garage on Brendan’s Avenue is a city institution run by brothers Gay and Patsy. They also work in sculpture and art when they aren’t fixing motors. Monday morning was the first time their garage has been open in seven weeks. “It is just nice to get back in again and get something done,” says Gay.“There was no warning really as such. We just had to shut up shop and get out of it. We did one or two emergency jobs for HSE people during the lockdown. That was it.”They have had work booked in for weeks so they are going to be busy in the weeks ahead. But the road outside their business remains quiet. “Normally you see cars going up and down Brendan’s Avenue.”Still, this was a start. It was possibly Oscar Wilde who declared that you know your youth has passed when you find yourself standing examining electrical drills in an aisle in Woodies on a Saturday morning.This may be true but it is also true that the Irish have a strange and needy relationship with the DIY and gardening behemoth. Any promise of sunshine prompts national raids on the barbeque and outdoor furnishing sections.It may have helped the safety policy that this Monday was overcast and cool. Still, with Woodies having spent half a million euro on Covid-19 safety measures, the lines outside the Terryland and Wellpark branches were considerable. You had to really want that bag of compost, that ten litres of masonry paint in order to wait. And many people did.The story was similar in other stores. DID Electrical had been operating as an online facility but on Monday its doors were opened - and monitored. “Take your time,” said one customer who told the door-staff that he was after a vacuum cleaner. “The sooner I get it the sooner I have to go home and do the hoovering.”The new shopping reality is going to demand patience. The number of customers permitted in stores at once is dependent on square footage and staff available. So at DID’s Briarhill branch, for instance, six people are allowed browse the aisles at any one time. The stores were busy and the arrival of people was fairly constant.In the city though, things remained slow.“It is different,” says Tadhg Byrne of Thomas Woodberrys wine shop on Middle Street.“Different. Interesting. Quieter and busier because it is all deliveries now. We open from 11 to 4 and then do the deliveries in the evening. For the first week I think we had four walk in customers. It is getting progressively busier. The two busiest days for walk-ins were last Friday and Saturday.“In fairness, people were staying at home. They were making the effort. You do see more people walking around.

Each week the school run requires Irish parents to drive 7 million km. Photograph: Getty ImagesPollution from cars has dropped by 50 per cent across Ireland since the start of the lockdown laws, research has shown.The number of private cars on the roads has dropped by more than 85 per cent since the restrictions began.Researchers at Marine and Renewable Energy Ireland (MaREI), a research centre in energy, climate and marine at University College Cork (UCC), has revealed the impact of Covid-19 restrictions on Ireland’s energy-related pollution levels.Since Covid-19 restrictions came into force the use of planes, trains and vehicles have all dramatically fallen.The analysis examines Ireland’s pollution levels prior to lockdown measures and compares it with those levels during lockdown.Among the findings is that pollution from cars has dropped by 50 per cent, but air pollution from solid fuel burning has not changed.In Ireland, the average commuter spends 28.2 minutes driving to work, equating to around an hour per day. That means for every week Ireland is in lockdown, people will reclaim five hours that would have otherwise been spent in their car.ConsumptionThe energy we use for transport accounts for about 40 per cent of Ireland’s energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions from private cars are nearly twice the amount of flights.Travelling to work and school accounts for more than a third of the journeys taken by Irish people each year.Each week the school run requires Irish parents to drive 7 million km in total, emitting an estimated 1,200 tonnes of CO2 emissions.Electricity has become our primary source of energy during lockdown, providing power for office work, lighting and entertainment.Electricity usage patterns now replicate a weekend demand profile seven days a week.The analysis shows that the demand for electricity has seen a decrease of between 5 per cent and 10 per cent over seasonal expectations since early March as a result of the Covid-19 measures.Meanwhile, nine out of 10 flights have been cancelled since restrictions commenced, and if flight restrictions continue, it would be the equivalent of switching off the State’s largest electricity generating station at Moneypoint, in Co Clare, for six months, the research shows.In Ireland, flights are responsible for 3.3 million tonnes of CO2 emission every year, which is the equivalent of one car driving 363,000 laps of the planet.The World Health Organisation estimates annual deaths of 1,500 per year are attributable to outdoor air pollution in Ireland.Data from the European Environment Agency (EEA) has shown how concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) — a pollutant mainly emitted by road transport and to a lesser extent electricity generation — have decreased in many European cities.NO2 has been linked to increased levels of lung conditions ranging from asthma and bronchitis to respiratory-related hospital admissions and emergency room visits.Nitrogen dioxideThe Environmental Protection Agency has reported a decrease in concentrations of up to 50 per cent of nitrogen dioxide at many monitoring stations across the National Air Quality Monitoring Network.UCC researcher Dr James Glynn said: “Covid-19 lockdown measures across the globe are creating a natural experiment for climate and energy researchers to observe how extreme demand scenarios can drive large scale fossil fuel demand destruction and collapse oil market prices.“By exploring the impact these restrictions are having on Ireland’s pollution levels, we are also seeking to understand feasible actions to mitigate climate change.“We need to make long-term, equitable and sustainable changes to our lifestyles, to our economy and to our energy system.“Climate change mitigation is a marathon event requiring rapid and sustained steady changes in how we consume energy.” – PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Paul FaithAFP via GettyWith the lifting of some Covid-19 restrictions this week, Ireland has moved on to a new phase of its battle against the virus.The liberties we have reclaimed since Monday are for now meagre and tentative, with the fear of a second wave of the epidemic not far from our thoughts.Yet how we fare from here on is to a large extent in our hands, inidually and collectively. A flexible, nimble and directed approach to keeping Covid-19 in check can yield impressive results in terms of winning us new liberties and easing restrictions according to the timetable in the Government’s plan and, perhaps, even faster.So far, our performance is midtable at best, in international terms. There is the sense of a half-defeat being wrestled from the jaws of victory. We had extra time to prepare before the virus came here compared with other EU countries, and to put in place a coherent strategy informed by the best scientific advice.This helped us win the battle in our hospitals, where ICUs were comfortably able to cope with the surge of cases that came their way. With the experience gained, there can be confidence that hospitals can cope even better should the virus stage a substantial return.Yet even as this was happening, coronavirus was making its way into nursing homes and other care settings with devastating effect. Apart maybe from Canada, Ireland has the highest proportion of Covid-19 deaths occurring in care homes. For reasons that have yet to be fully explained and will require formal investigation, the disease ripped through these settings before effective action was taken.That situation has now been stabilised, but a new challenge has arisen in meat factories. As with care homes, the problems here have as much to do with staff practices outside the workplace – arising from the sharing of accommodation, for example – as behaviours on the job.Three controlsGovernments effectively have three means of controlling the epidemic now, during the post-lockdown phase testing and contract tracing, travel restrictions, and social distancing.The greater movement allowed to us as we move through the phases of the Government’s plan is likely to lead to more cases, but we can clamp down on spread by ensuring rapid testing and contact tracing is in place. And, if we choose, we can double down on border controls to protect against the importation of fresh cases.The HSE’s promise to test and trace contacts of the vast majority of cases within three days is welcome, although an even shorter turnaround time would be better. Border controls will matter more as international travel resumes and the airports fill up again, which is why the filling-in of a passenger locator form becomes obligatory from this week.As society loosens up, we will see more cases in private homes and workplaces. We need to reduce the proportion of cases caused by community transmission, which currently account for 60 per cent of the total.To some extent, we can lessen the risk by redesigning our shared spaces – for example, by getting rid of cramped accommodation units. Great outdoors?Our default advice is still to stay at home, but for the limited social interaction that is now allowed, the outdoors is the best option for the coming months. In Japan, which has one of the lowest Covid-19 death rates, epidemiologists advise people to avoid “the three Cs – Conversation in poorly ventilated, Close, Crowded spaces”.Despite the focus recently on masks and asymptomatic transmission, it is important to remember that the way this virus is passed on is mainly through close and prolonged contact, and mostly by people who have just started to show symptoms. This happens most in enclosed environments such as households, long-term care settings and high-density public transport.Conversely, short, casual interactions are low risk, provided you keep your distance. And, it is worth repeating, children do not pose any greater infection risk than other people.By acting smartly, we can stamp out new outbreaks quickly, rebuild the economy and even buy ourselves room to experiment a bit – for example, by getting some children back to school on a trial basis.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4256646.1589829988!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"workplace safety watchdog may not be able to make surprise inspections","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe HSA will confirm to the Oireachtas committee that it is assigning 67 field inspectors out of its 109-strong inspectorate to check on workplace safety under the Covid-19 Return to Work Safely protocolThe Health and Safety Authority may not be able to carry out surprise inspections due to restrictions to protect against Covid-19, its chief executive Dr Sharon McGuinness will tell an Oireachtas committee on Tuesday.“As a general rule, authority inspections are unannounced. However, due to the fact that workplaces may have different working arrangements in place to protect against Covid-19, the authority may need in a number of cases to arrange a suitable time to visit,” the head of the workplace safety watchdog will tell the committee.The authority will also confirm to the committee at Tuesday’s hearing that it is assigning 67 field inspectors out of its 109-strong inspectorate to check on workplace safety under the Covid-19 Return to Work Safely protocol.InspectorsDr McGuinness will say the authority must retain a cohort of inspectors to ensure the authority’s “other legal obligations are met across our various mandates”.It plans to focus Covid-19 inspections on sectors due to open under the Government’s reopening plan and based on complaints received.Ahead of the hearing, Dr McGuinness told The  in an interview that determining whether a fatality from Covid-19 resulted from an infection contracted in a workplace or a work activity was a “real challenge”.She said that it was “very tricky” to determine whether a coronavirus death was a result of workplace activity.“One of the challenges for all of us in relation to Covid is that there may have been worker fatalities where Covid was a factor – whether it happened in the workplace or not, or as a result of a work activity, is a different question,” she said.“It is not as simple to say a worker contracted Covid and there was a fatality. We have to check that that actually happened in the workplace or was it attributable to the work activity going on?”Dr McGuinness encouraged greater engagement between employers and employees under a protocol published by the Government to ensure that workers adhered to health and safety guidelines at home where there were large numbers of workers living in shared rental accommodation.Clusters“Covid is everywhere and our remit is very much in the workplace. People coming to and from work, how people live outside work, none of that is in our remit but clearly the activities and actions in that regard can have an impact in the workplace,” she said.A spokesman said that more than 200 complaints received by the HSA in March and April in relation to non-adherence to Covid-19 guidances did not require on-site inspections.The spread of the virus in meat processing plants where there are 12 clusters – or one in every four plants in the country – with as many as 600 infected workers is attributed in part to the number of lower-paid foreign workers sharing accommodation outside of workplaces.The State’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan told the Department of Health’s week-daily Covid-19 briefing that the national outbreak control teams issued guidance in different languages on risks facing employees who are travelling to work together or sharing accommodation.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4257190.1589887816!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 testing system being redesigned end to end oireachtas commitee hears","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe chief medical officer, Dr Tony Holohan,  arriving at Leinster House before the Oireachtas Covid-19 Committee sitting. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Ireland’s testing system for Covid-19 was one that was “patched together” but is now being redesigned “end to end” by the HSE, secretary general of the Department of Health Jim Breslin has said.He told the special Oireachtas committee on the coronavirus committee, meeting in Leinster House, that the target for testing is three days for 70 per cent of all tests. “There will be further improvement and texting back negative results will speed things up.” The requirement for the use of private hospital facilities would continue because there could be a further surge. “We’re not a health system endowed with capacity,” he said in response to questions from Fianna Fáil health spokesman Stephen Donnelly.He said the Government would have to review the use of private facilities. He said a majority of consultants had signed up for the public system and that private patients would be offered the choice of whether they wished to stay with their private consultant or transfer over to the public system.Meanwhile, Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan said that 97 per cent of people tested were getting their negative results back by text. He said there was a fixation on 100,000 tests a week but it may need to be more fluid.In a reply to questions from Sinn Fein health spokeswoman Louise O’Reilly, Dr Holohan said that 30.15 per cent of health care workers had tested positive for Covid-19 but there had been a substantive fall in the rate of infection in recent weeks.Dr Holohan also referred to comparisons with Sweden, which has opted for a different herd immunity system. He said Sweden faced a greater challenge than Ireland because it had almost 400 people in intensive care. If population figures were adjusted for Ireland, that would mean 200 people in intensive care when there are currently 50.He also rejected comparisons with New Zealand and said it was on the other side of the world and “direct comparisons are not entirely valid”. He said Ireland is “closer to the epicentre of the virus in a way that New Zealand was not” because the epicentre is in western Europe and not in New Zealand,, which is 2,000km from another country.BuildingDirector general of the Construction Industry Federation Tom Parlon is also expected to tell the committee that there was no “big bang return to work yesterday” and that it will take months to return to previous levels of production.“Larger contractors allowed a reduced work force on site yesterday to assess sites, test new measures and embed new protocols in safety culture. It will take months for the industry to reach previous output levels.”He will also say that companies are reporting a “significant drop in productivity.”“It’s understandable that the public is afraid. The pandemic has shut down our society but it has also paralysed us. We now know that we must restart our economy in a manner that prevents the spread of the virus or we face horrific long-term economic, social, and psychological consequences.”Also on Tuesday, the country’s largest trade union is to call on the Government to put in place a compensation package to support the 7,600 healthcare workers who have contracted the disease.Siptu wants all staff who suffered infections to be compensated for loss of earnings – including premium payments such as for weekend or unsocial hours work – due to illness, as well as the costs of future medical care.CounsellingThe State should also cover the cost of counselling services, according to Siptu health ision organiser Paul Bell, who said he feared many health workers would develop post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the pandemic.Separately, the Senior Civil Service Association has warned senior civil servants must be protected from “aggressive or bullying behaviour, contrary to fair procedure and natural justice” when they give evidence to the special committee.In a letter sent on Monday to the head of every department in the Civil Service, the group warns that its members must have their “rights to constitutional and natural justice fully represented” in the hearings held by the committee.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus vaccine first human trial shows signs creating immunity","story":"The first coronavirus vaccine tested on humans appears safe and generated antibodies which stopped the virus replicating, according to early trial results shared on Monday. Eight healthy volunteers saw few adverse effects after taking two doses of the potential vaccine, according to Moderna, its manufacturer based in Massachusetts. It appeared to trigger an immune response - the critical requirement of a working vaccine - producing neutralising antibodies in all eight of the patients. The levels of those antibodies were similar to that found in people who caught Covid-19 and then recovered. Dr Tal Zaks, Moderna’s chief medical officer, called the result a “first important step”, with much more testing needed. Some medical experts urged caution, seeking more data. A second phase of trials with around 600 people will begin soon, while a third involving thousands of people will start in July. Moderna\u0027s stock price was up 40 per cent in pre-market trading as the results emerged.  The positive news is only one step in the long road to a potential vaccine.Even if the coming trials are successful Moderna\u0027s vaccine would not be available until between January and June 2021. However, given there is some doubt that a vaccine can even be found, the results provide hope that a breakthrough can be achieved. US stock markets surged in early trading as the news emerged, with the Dow Jones industrial average initially up 3.5 per cent.Currently there is no proven treatment or vaccine for Covid-19. Dozens of companies across the world are scrambling to develop a vaccine. Three different doses of the potential vaccine were trialled by Moderna. The positive results were found in those who tried the low and medium doses. Only one participant who took these doses had any adverse reaction, a redness around the point of injection on the arm which eventually cleared.People who took the high dose saw more adverse reactions, including fever and headaches. The higher dose is expected to be eliminated from future trials. The company also announced that when the vaccine, called mRNA-1273, was given to mice who were then exposed to coronavirus the virus would not multiply in their lungs. Stephane Bancel, chief executive of Moderna, told The Washington Post: “We are very, very happy because first the vaccine was generally safe.Peter Jay Hotez, who is developing a coronavirus vaccine at the Baylor College of Medicine, told the paper that it would be important to see the exact level of antibodies produced in each participant. When Moderna\u0027s trial started in March it was believed to be the first time a potential coronavirus vaccine had been tested on humans. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"gary lineker apologises ex footballer became running joke bbc","story":"Gary Lineker has apologised to a former Premier League footballer who described how repeated jokes about him on BBC show They Think It\u0027s All Over negatively affected his mental health.Luke Chadwick said he had grown to dread the sports-based quiz programme, which featured Lineker as a team captain for eight years, after he was targeted by panellists following his debut for Manchester United as a teenager.Speaking to the BBC at the start of Mental Health Awareness Week, Chadwick, 39, said the show had magnified attention on him at a time when he was receiving abuse over his personal appearance.He said: I became a picture of fun, and that was probably the hardest thing.I used to dread it coming on the telly. I wouldn\u0027t watch it but then I\u0027d get a text off someone saying \u0027oh you\u0027ve been on that show again\u0027 as if it was a joke.Obviously people were finding it funny, but it was eating away at me a bit inside while that was happening.Former host Nick Hancock yesterday apologised after admitting Chadwick had become a running joke on the show.The comedian told BBC Breakfast he was full of admiration for the present Luke Chadwick and full of sympathy for the young Luke Chadwick.He said: I\u0027m appalled for him and at myself. Of course the worst thing for Luke was that it became a bit of a running joke.“We should have been thinking about the person, but that\u0027s what can happen. The terrible thing about comedians and comedy shows is that if you\u0027re getting laughs, you think you\u0027re doing a good job.And Lineker, who hosts Match of the Day and is now the BBC\u0027s top earner, followed suit, tweeting: I was part of that show, therefore, I too would like to apologise to Luke Chadwick for any hurt caused.Chadwick, who now coaches at Cambridge United, won two Premier League winner’s medals at Old Trafford but said abuse over his appearance negatively affected his self-esteem.He said: “People knew who I was because I played for Manchester United and I always assumed they\u0027d be saying horrible things.Being a quiet, nervous boy anyway, it sort of intensified that and maybe stunted my growth as a person.They Think It’s All Over ran for 11 series between 1995 and 2006.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uk can learn europes easing lockdown","story":"As Covid-19 began to surge across Europe earlier this year, Boris Johnson issued a clear warning of what was to come.“The numbers are very stark, and they are accelerating,” the Prime Minister told the nation on March 22. “We are only a matter of weeks – two or three – behind Italy.” On Monday, for the first time in two months, Italy finally began to emerge from one of the strictest lockdowns in the world.Italians will once again be allowed to visit museums and restaurants, while some shops will finally reopen. In Spain, officials announced similar restrictions would be lifted in some areas.The news might raise hopes, therefore, that the UK government is poised to do the same, perhaps in two or three weeks\u0027 time. Not so, according to leading scientists, who say this country\u0027s trajectory has fallen further behind our Mediterranean neighbours. Instead, the British public will likely be waiting “much longer” for normal life to return.The reasons are many and complicated, of course. But the main obstacle is this country’s stubbornly-high infection rate, compared to our European neighbours.On March 22, when the Prime Minister issued his warning, confirmed UK cases stood at 5,683, with a death total of 281. Two weeks before, on March 7, Italy had been in a similar situation with 233 deaths and 5,900 cases.Italy hit its peak number of 6,557 Covid-19 cases on March 21, but since then, daily cases have fallen steadily and quickly. Last Sunday, the Italian government announced only 675 new cases, a fall since the peak of nearly 90 per cent.Spain released figures on the same day showing that, from a peak of 8,271 cases on March 26, new infections had fallen to just 1,214, a fall of 85 per cent.Yet in the UK, figures show that from an early peak of 6,199 cases on April 5, the number fell to 3,534 on May 17, a drop of only 43 per cent.In short, the daily number of cases in the UK is falling much more slowly than in Italy and Spain. The UK\u0027s downward curve is far flatter.Professor Azeem Majeed, head of public health at Imperial College London, said the comparatively high infection rate in the UK meant lockdown measures would likely last far longer than in Italy or Spain.However, the UK government would have “the clear advantage” of seeing the effect of relaxing restrictions in other countries before deciding how to act, he added.“It helps to look at what’s happening in Italy and Spain, of course it does,” he said.“In some ways it will be useful to the UK government, because evidence will be coming in from those countries. “But the fact remains that the infection rate in this country is not dropping as fast, and that’s a major problem.“We are now far further than two or three weeks behind, in terms of trajectory.”Experts are split on the reasons why the UK’s number of daily cases remains so stubbornly high.Some leading scientists claim that the Government enforced total lockdown too late, meaning the virus became more deeply embedded, and harder to shift.Italy first began shutting down towns and cities on February 21, before ordering total lockdown on March 9. Spain followed a week later. It was not until March 23 that Boris Johnson finally ordered the British public to stay at home.The terms of the UK lockdown are also fairly lenient, compared to measures taken elsewhere in Europe. In Spain, people were banned for seven weeks from leaving their homes even to exercise, while in Italy the carabinieri patrolled the streets, arresting or fining anyone outside without good reason.Dr Bharat Pankhania, a senior consultant in communicable disease control, claimed the UK would now “pay the price” for delaying lockdown too long.“The later you lock down, the longer it takes to get out of it,” he said.“It’s not surprising that we are plateauing, compared to those countries. We should have shut down much earlier, and had a testing and contact tracing in place to prevent the virus spreading.“We didn’t do that, and now we pay the price.“At the start of the epidemic we were said to be roughly three weeks behind the other countries, in terms of transmission. When it comes to leaving lockdown, I’m afraid we are now far further behind.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"archers lockdown ambridge residents no longer talking","story":"Characters in The Archers will no longer have conversations with one another as recording alone in lockdown forces the actors to stick to soliloquies.The cast of the BBC Radio 4 soap will instead talk to themselves, recounting the day’s events out loud, and episodes will feature only a couple of characters.“Instead of multiple characters interacting, each episode will have fewer characters who will be sharing more of their private thoughts with the listener,” a spokesman said.The soap is currently on hiatus while actors record new episodes, each working alone from makeshift studios in their homes.The idea of having characters speak to one another on the phone was rejected in favour of soliloquies.Jeremy Howe, the programme’s editor, said the old scripts were thrown out and storylines rewritten to give us a picture of life in lockdown.New episodes will begin on May 25 and the first week will feature only David, Josh, Tracy and Harrison. The line-up has been slimmed down “because of the sheer logistical complexity of what we’re doing”, Howe said.Normal recording was abandoned in mid-March when growing fears about the pandemic meant the situation became “less like recording in Ambridge and more like fighting the Battle of the Alamo”.Writing in Radio Times, he said: “If The Archers was to carry on, we had to find a new way of making the programme. We had to start from scratch and we had to figure out a new way to make The Archers so that everything - absolutely everything - could be done remotely. It was probably the biggest challenge the programme has ever had to face.“We binned 12 scripts and five weeks’ worth of storylines that were about to be written. We then started inventing stories that were set in Ambridge, where the coronavirus had now arrived, that could be told in a way that both reflected the lockdown and could be recorded in the cast’s homes. I told the team – keep it simple.”He said of the cast members’ new working environments: “I’m not sure what your picture of a home studio is - but in our world it’s a microphone on a stand, with a cable linked to a computer and everything sound-proofed by as many duvets as the actor can cocoon themselves in.”He added: “David Archer once said, .The sun will always rise and there will always be cows to be milked. Life always goes on.’ So it will be in Ambridge.

However, the arithmetic may now give MoDem more leverage over policy-making in the final two years of Macron\u0027s five-year mandate. His reform drive has been stalled by the coronavirus pandemic, just as he was seeking to regain momentum after weeks of pension reform protests and before that anti-government yellow vest protests.Richard Ferrand, a close Macron ally and president of the National Assembly, acknowledged the loss of LREM\u0027s absolute majority but said the government could count on the votes of 342 MPs with MoDem\u0027s support.A parliamentary group does not have the formal structures of a party. It is, however, highly likely that any parliamentarian who joined the new group would be ejected from Macron\u0027s party.The new group will be chaired by Paula Forteza and Matthieu Orphelin, a close ally of former environment minister Nicolas Hulot, who quit Macron\u0027s government in frustration at the president\u0027s climate change and green energy policies.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel restrictions live worlds largest airline cap passenger","story":"Ferries to Greek islands will restart in JuneWhen can we go on holiday again?Can I take a UK holiday yet? Will holidays be cheaper after coronavirus?What are the rules for day-trips this weekend?For when should I reschedule my holiday?Greece could be the first country to allow British holidaymakers to visit via an “air bridge” that negates the need for a two-week quarantine on arrival.The popular European destination still requires all arrivals to isolate for 14 days but Greek tourism minister Haris Theoharis said the measure could be dropped should the UK offer the same.On Monday, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said Britain could agree “air bridges deals that work outside of travel restrictions with other countries that have low coronavirus infection rates. Greece has had fewer than 3,000 cases and just 165 deaths. “So if we don’t impose quarantine for people coming to Greece from the UK from some day onwards, then we would welcome if the UK extended the same thing.”Greece has said it will reopen its tourism business, including sea ferries to its islands, from mid-June.Follow live updates on the day\u0027s news below.More reaction to Grant Shapps’ comments on ‘air bridges’ linking the UK with other countries with low coronavirus infection rates. The head of the tourist board in the Algarve, Portugal, has said the region is primed for such an arrangement.“If British holidaymakers are allowed to fly to countries with low coronavirus infection rates via “air bridges”, without having the need for quarantine, the Algarve will be the place to be,” said Joao Fernandes, president of Algarve Tourism. “There is a big British community living in the Algarve willing to bring back their family and friends like they do every year so this would be great news and opportunity for them to.”He said that Portugal has not imposed any quarantine measures on arrivals but that thermal testing was taking place at airports. “The Algarve is one of the least affected regions in Portugal, and so we are now in a position to carefully start a gradual reopening of its economic and social activity,” he said.The Association of Independent Tour Operators (AITO) has poured cold water on the concept of ‘air bridges’, warning that the Government needs to think before speaking when it comes to plans for the return of travel this summer. “We are hugely hopeful that holidays will be able to commence from the UK into Europe in July or August this year, but there are a lot of hoops to go through in the short interim period.He said there are positive signs coming from the Continent, where countries including France, Italy and Greece have revealed the details of their reopening, but the UK has not yet followed suit with such plans.Antler Holdings was forced to call in administrators on Monday after falling victim to the coronavirus crisis.

Their actions are helping protect everyone who lives in, visits and enjoys the Lake District.”He asked that people continue to “exercise locally” and check the park’s car parking website to see when sites become full.New Zealand\u0027s ski resorts could provide a blueprint for Alpine towns in a post-pandemic age as they look to reopen in time for the southern hemisphere\u0027s winter season. The country\u0027s ski resorts will begin to reopen at the start of June with new restrictions in place, including social distancing in lift queues, increased cleaning protocols and new signage to remind guests of hygiene standards. Among those planning to open are Cardrona and Treble Cone near Wanaka, Coronet Peak and The Remarkables close to Queenstown and Mt Hutt, a short drive from Christchurch.“Our mountains will look slightly different but our passion for winter is just as strong as ever and we’re doing everything we can to make sure it’s an epic season,” said Paul Anderson, CEO of NZSki, which operates Coronet Peak, The Remarkables and Mt Hutt, in a statement.The world’s largest airline will keep flights capped at 60 per cent capacity through at least July in a nod to social distancing in the air, according to an industry source. Delta Air Lines, which carries more than 200million passengers a year, said that it will limit the number of people allowed on its planes as it resumes flights next month. But someone familiar with the matter has said the policy will be in place into July, according to Reuters.The news raises the prospect of more carriers imposing limits on passenger numbers on flights this summer 60 per cent capacity in a typical short-haul aircraft could mean middle seats would be left empty. EasyJet was one of the first airlines to suggest the measure earlier in the year but it has been dismissed by many as being too costly to implement. Delta’s workings are based on the assumption that consumer perceptions of safety will be key in reviving air travel and that they will be willing to pay a premium for comfort. A spokesperson for the airline, which has a codeshare arrangement with Virgin Atlantic, said: We announced a policy on seating capacity through June 30. Nothing has been decided beyond that but we are continuing to monitor the situation and make adjustments as necessary.Qantas could restart up to half of its flights in July but has warned that social distancing measures are impractical on aircraft and could lead to the cost of air travel increasing nine-fold. The Australian flag carrier’s chief executive Alan Joyce said the airline would not be leaving middle seats empty but would provide masks and cleaning wipes to passengers. Social distancing on an aircraft is impractical, he said. It only gives you 60 centimetres (23.6 inches) between passengers.He said to meet Australia\u0027s standard for social distancing of 1.5 metres on the ground, an Airbus SE A320 operated by low-cost arm Jetstar could fill just 22 seats, rather than the normal 180.That means airfares are going to be eight to nine times more than they are today, he said. It economically will not be justified.Instead, Qantas will simplify catering, step up aircraft cleaning and ask passengers to limit movement around the cabin once seated.Good morning and welcome to the travel news live blog.

A rise of 50,000 to 1.3 million out of work is entirely manageable and we entered the coronavirus pandemic with very high levels of employment anyway, even if average pay packets have barely risen in a decade.We also know that the Job Retention Scheme, the central pillar of the government’s measures to mitigate the fallout of coronavirus, is working. Without it the unemployment number would now be much, much higher. Millions of productive ties between employer and employee would have been severed and millions of people’s incomes would have fallen much more sharply. The economic blow of coronavirus has been softened significantly.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUnfortunately, that’s about where the good news ends.The top-line figures are for January to March, before the economic effects of coronavirus fully kicked in. The early signs for April are much more concerning. The benefit claimant count shot up by 856,000 to 2.1 million to its highest level since 1996. Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Close to a quarter of the labour force is now on furlough, meaning they are off work while the government covers 80 per cent of their salary up to £2,500 a month.That’s a good thing in the short term because it keeps money in people’s pockets and keeps connections between employees and their jobs. But, in many respects – indeed, by some official definitions – someone on furlough is unemployed. We know that lengthy periods out of work can have permanent impacts on somebody’s future job prospects, quality of life, mental health and productivity. Economists refer to this process as scarring and it is particularly noticeable if the extended period of joblessness happens when someone is young. People aged 18 to 30 have been disproportionately put out of work by the pandemic, whether they’re on furlough or unemployed. They disproportionately fill the jobs that have been lost on shop floors, waiting restaurant tables and pulling pints in pubs.Many of those jobs, along with those lost in tourism and other hard-hit sectors, will not come back soon. The reality is that, even when the economy “opens up”, it cannot go back to business as usual and it won’t get anything close to how it was before until effective treatments or a vaccine are found and produced in large quantities.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No one has yet put forward a credible plan for a socially distanced passenger flight, given that air circulates around a cabin containing hundreds of people for hours. Testing every passenger will entail huge queues at airports and much reduced capacity. Lots of people may be wary of flying in any case.Pubs and restaurants ran on tight margins before the crisis. Many say they won’t survive if they have to seat people 2 metres apart and close off some tables. Would anyone want to go to a socially distanced nightclub? It would seem to defeat the point of the whole exercise.This means that, without the right intervention, millions of people will be unemployed when the furlough scheme ends.So what is the right intervention? No one can claim to know the definitive answer to that question yet. However, consensus is beginning to build around a few important measures.UK unemployment surged to 1.3m in first three months of yearFirst, the sectors most under threat need renewed support. Does the government want to protect as much of the UK’s tourism, hospitality and airline industries as it can until the economy can fully restart? Or will it let it go to the wall? Given that those industries may not reach full capacity for two years or more, some analysts have advocated what amounts to a government bailout, with the state taking an equity stake in businesses or giving them direct grants. Keeping thousands of hospitality and airline workers on furlough who will not have a job to go back to for a couple of years is not feasible. But leaving them to fend for themselves when there are few, if any, relevant job vacancies, would be unconscionable.Therefore, we need planning and detailed research to estimate the numbers and types of jobs that will be lost as well as those that are more in demand in the post-lockdown, pre-vaccine economy. This must be followed quickly by retraining and support to shift people into those new jobs.This will not be easy, particularly because the geographical impact of job losses will be highly concentrated. A study last month by the Royal Society of Arts found that in parts of the UK reliant on tourism such as Cornwall and parts of the Yorkshire Dales, including the chancellor’s own constituency, up to a third of jobs are at risk. That’s much higher than in London, Cambridge, Oxford and a number of other affluent areas. We already have some idea of the skills in extra demand. The government says it’s recruited 17,000 people to help track and trace infections. It may need many more. Workplaces will need more people properly trained in and responsible for health and safety. If more of our lives are online we need more IT technicians. We will likely need more delivery drivers and cleaners. Job vacancy numbers also out today show that there has been an increase in health and social care positions (just about every other area saw a big drop-off). This presents a problem for the government because healthcare workers take years to train.It is imperative that we start training now where possible, using the online tools many of us have become more used to using during the lockdown. Companies must play a role in delivering this too but the recovery depends to an overwhelming degree on government policy and coordination. The state is going to have to become active in the labour market in a way that has not been seen for decades.Voices from many corners have also called for a stimulus package that would put people to work as part of large-scale investment in green infrastructure to achieve the UK’s net-zero emissions target.The furlough scheme has been a relatively blunt, but very effective, weapon in the Treasury’s arsenal. The next stage will have to be more nuanced, more targeted and therefore much more difficult to get right.Rishi Sunak has demonstrated that he understands this problem. The chancellor’s recent changes to the furlough scheme made it more flexible and will allow people to gradually go back to work and increase their hours by the end of October.Unemployment is almost certain to rise as the furlough scheme is tapered down and employers address the reality that they can no longer afford some of their staff.To ensure this process causes as little pain to as few people as possible, the government, alongside businesses, needs to start now to help them into new employment.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Schools have been told to prepare for early year settings, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 to return to the classroom in smaller sizes from the start of next month, and to start reintroducing more face-to-face lessons for Year 10 and Year 12 students. All primary school students would also be back in school for a month before summer under the government’s goal – advice one headteachers union has told its members to ignore as it is not “realistic”. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent spoke to Steve Chalke, the founder of the Oasis trust – an academy trust with around 50 schools in England – and Alex Rawlings, the headteacher of Quarry Bank Primary School in the West Midlands, about their differing views on plans to get children back to school as the country faces the coronavirus pandemic. 1. Are you planning on reopening your school(s) on 1 June? Do you support these plans?Steve Chalke: “Yes. But it is an important thing to say that some won’t be reopening at all, because they never shut. I think that has been lost in this conversation. Many of our schools have stayed open throughout to care for and work with the children of key workers and those who are most vulnerable. What we will be doing on 1 June is scaling up what we are doing. Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“Our plan at one school is different for the plans for each of the other schools. We have 35 primaries. The reason they are different is because we have 35 different buildings. Some are bigger, some are smaller, some have wider corridors, some have narrower corridors, and they have different size classrooms, for example. “We are supportive of the government plans to open schools on June 1 because we are ready. Oasis is having a conversation in each locality with its school leaders, its parents, its community. We are talking with the unions and the government and that is why we are going to open on 1 June.”Alex Rawlings: “We are planning on a phased return of school on 2 June. We will be using 1 June to prepare the classrooms and school site. Our children in early years will start on 2 June followed by our year 1 and year 6 children on 8 June. We will remain open for our key worker and vulnerable children.“I wholeheartedly support the return to school for children, but only when we know it is safe.“The government has not done enough to convince a lot of parents nor school leaders that it is safe to return.”2.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSteve Chalke: “In some of our schools, we are doing a rota. Instead of having children in all day, we are having a cohort in the morning, and a different cohort in in the afternoon ... There is a gap when we can cleanse everything, clean it down, wipe everything. “Some schools will have fewer children in a classroom than others. The government has said you can have up to 15 in a classroom. Depending on the sizes of our classrooms, we are deciding how many children can go in them.“We have ordered and have got PPE equipment ... Any staff member or any child that wants PPE, it is there for them.“The way Oasis is geared up is there is a central team that supports all our schools. Some of this work, like ordering of PPE, has been done centrally so we can make sure all our schools have got that. We prepared a whole list of questions for our schools to ask themselves as they get ready.“We have done a full risk assessment of each inidual schools, so we have had a meeting for all 35 schools ... and we worked out the bespoke plan for each of the schools in that meeting.” Alex Rawlings: “I’m currently putting together plans to return as safely as we can. Some of those plans include additional hand washing stations, spacing of tables and chairs in classrooms, purchasing lidded bins so that waste can be disposed of according to the governments guidance, and buying coloured wristbands so groups of children can identify themselves from other groups and keep their distance.“It is however incredibly hard to plan for the reopening of school when the guidance changes on a daily basis. Boris Johnson originally said only reception, year 1 and year 6 children were to return, then the guidance made reference to nursery and even now government officials neglect to mention nursery children returning also.“Schools had invested significant resources to planning a return that made sense to them and their communities. The government also released a document on Friday night explaining that schools should avoid using rota systems to accommodate children. Hundreds of schools would have been back to square one of planning, with only two weeks, including half-term, until schools are expected to open to those year groups.”3. What are the main difficulties schools face with regards to opening during coronavirus?Steve Chalke: “You should never do anything you haven’t thought about and carefully planned for. To open without doing the planning we have been able to do is a risk too far.“But then there is another answer. In the end, it isn’t PPE and it isn’t actively planning and risk assessment forms that get you there: it is trust.“The real foundation on which phased return to any school is built is trust. By that I mean, trust between school staff and leaders, and trust between parents and the school. If you have got all that trust going on and good communication, that is the final ingredient you need to open school. If you don’t have trust and a good relationship, it will be really hard because scaremongering breaks out and rumours start flying.”Alex Rawlings: “Inconsistent guidance from government which causes a lack of confidence in reopening and the logistics of following the guidance are hugely limiting.“Gavin Williamson said we were having a tentative start of reopening schools, when actually he has insisted that four out of eight year groups attend school. Those classes are halved, which requires double the space and double the supervision, which means that schools have to be at 100 per cent staffing capacity to safely open. With lots of adults shielding or self-isolating, schools do not have the staffing capacity to reopen – we will only just be able to, hopefully.“The most difficult aspect to sort is to try to increase parental confidence in school’s ability to keep everyone safe. Everyone knows it is going to be impossible to keep 3 and 4-year-olds apart at a distance of two metres. In every workplace in the country you are to socially distance unless you have adequate PPE. Schools have been told that social distancing isn’t attainable whilst working with children and that it isn’t recommended that schools use PPE routinely.“Adults will never have confidence in government plans to reopen until they can tell everyone what makes a school classroom uniquely safe when compared to any other workspace in the entire United Kingdom.”4. What are the benefits of getting children back in the classroom, as opposed to home learning?Steve Chalke: “I think they are huge. A report done for the Institute of Fiscal Studies has shown a massive gap between the rich and the poor in the amount of homework study being done. It said the more middle class you are or wealthy you are, the more digital access you have, more laptops and and the more time parents have got to spend with you ... But it is much worse than what they are saying.They are saying across this period, wealthy children will have done seven days more work by the end of this than others. I think this is woefully underestimated. All our schools are in poor communities, some of our kids haven’t been receiving dinners as government system has failed all together.“Why do we need to get these schools open? For learning to continue. Around four million children in England live in poverty. The children commissioners office say two million live in homes where there is domestic abuse, where there is parental substance misuse or parental mental health issues. All of those figures come before lockdown. How do you think those figures have gone up? The longer these children wait for a return to school, the greater the negative impact on their learning, their health and on their safety.”Alex Rawlings: “The benefits to getting children back are clear – children will receive improved education provision and they will see their friends, which is really important.“Parents have worked incredibly hard with their children at home but it is very difficult to turn a dining room in to a classroom and it is obviously not as successful as being in a classroom environment.”5. What are your concerns (if any) about the plans to reopen on 1 June?Steve Chalke: “Where the type of things we have been talking about haven’t been done, I would be very wary of opening a school. But I think there are still two weeks to go.“My advice is to a school that is on its own, that don’t feel they have got the support they need, I think I would really happy to provide people with an understanding of the kind of approach we have adopted.”I’ve been a teacher for 23 years – re-opening schools is dangerousAlex Rawlings: ”Children are being used as guinea pigs.“The government are trying to push a narrative that if you care for children then you will promote the reopening of schools. Every member of our school staff cares deeply for the children in their care and want nothing more for them to return, but only when it is safe to do so.“There has not been enough time, clear guidance or scientific evidence to suggest that it is the right time to do so.“Everyone keeps referring to the Danish model and how that has worked. It is a ridiculous comparison. Denmark’s deaths are in the hundreds, ours are in the tens of thousands. Denmark were one of the first countries to close its schools (we were one of the last) and they returned when only a few hundred people were in intensive care being treated for coronavirus, we have thousands.”6.  Do you feel the science is clear enough to show schools are safe to reopen on 1 June?Steve Chalke: “Yes. I think the problem is the unions and all the people commentating on this aren’t the scientists. So what we have tried to do throughout the whole process has really talk to people who are in the middle of the science. I heard Brian Cox say – and I agree with this totally – anyone who tell you they are following the science doesn’t understand science. Science is a debate.”Alex Rawlings: “On Friday night, the government released the science that was supposed to convince schools that it was safe to open. This document contains no science, just a regurgitation of their own guidance.A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We want children back in schools as soon as possible because being back with their teachers and friends is so important for their education and their wellbeing.“Plans for a phased return of some year groups from 1 June, at the earliest, are based on the best scientific and medical advice. The welfare of children and staff has been at the heart of all decision making.”They added: “We have engaged closely with the unions throughout the past eight weeks, including organising for them to hear directly from the scientific experts last week, and will continue to do so, including to develop further guidance if required.”Department for Education\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Anyone with this symptom should isolate for seven days while other household members should isolate for 14 days.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAdding anosmia to the list of symptoms could be a crucial move as the government looks to set up a test, track and isolate system to control the virus after lockdown restrictions are lifted.But officials have faced criticism that the addition of loss of smell has come too late.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Professor Tim Spector, head of the department of genetic epidemiology and leader of the Covid symptom study app at King’s College London, told the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that 17 other countries including the US had altered their list of symptoms beyond a cough and fever.While the KCL app uses self-reported symptoms that are not verified, Prof Spector said using its data he estimated between 50,000 to 70,000 people in the UK with Covid-19 were not being told to self-isolate because their symptoms did not match the official definition.He said: “We list about 14 symptoms which we know are related to having a positive swab test, and these are not being picked up by the NHS.”The loss of smell and taste has been repeatedly reported as a symptom of Covid-19. Health minister Nadine Dorries reported losing 100 per cent of her taste and smell when she contracted the virus in March.Last week, the British Rhinological Society and ENT UK criticised the government for being slow to act. In a joint statement, the two bodies said they had warned eight weeks ago that anosmia was linked to Covid-19, adding that there was now “overwhelming evidence” it was a main symptom and accused the NHS and health officials of “clinical negligence” for not adding anosmia to the official list of symptoms.Carl Philpott, professor of rhinology and olfactology at Norwich Medical School, said: “The announcement that the chief medical officers have now recognised smell and taste disturbances is extremely welcome, albeit much later than other European counterparts and at least two weeks after the WHO added it to their list. This will hopefully now be another measure by which the pandemic can be contained, especially as in some people it may be the only symptom or may precede other symptoms.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“This is particularly pertinent in healthcare workers where reports of smell and taste disturbances have been commonplace, meaning the transfer of infection from colleagues to each other and to uninfected patients will have been happening unchecked. There will also be a recognition that although many patients will recover these senses, the need for ongoing support will be faced by a minority in whom these sensory losses persist.”Briefing journalists this morning, deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van Tam said the government’s scientific advisers on its new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group, or Nervtag, had carried out a “granular” assessment of Public Health England’s database of the first few hundred Covid-19 cases.He said: “The reason for making the change now is that there has been a signal around possibly the importance of the anosmia as a symptom of Covid-19 for a while now. It’s been important to continue to look at that. And be sure that we consider it, and introduce it at the right time, when we think it’s going to make a difference moving forward, to how we pick up cases.“We do know of some cases where it appears early, but in many cases, it does not appear early.”Why are loss of smell and taste symptoms of coronavirus?He added: “The question for Nervtag has always been at what point can we be sure that by adding anosmia, or anything else, such fatigue, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, definitely improve and help us to pick up cases. That work has now been completed and that’s why we’ve got to the position we have now. It’s not just about whether or not anosmia exists. It’s about what role it plays in identifying cases, and that’s taken time to work through those data.”He said while anosmia could last for many weeks, no one would need to isolate longer than the official advice of seven days.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This information is vital because the presence of mud suggests that water once existed on Mars, which meant that the planet at one point likely had a stable environment, an atmosphere, and a magnetic field that would allow liquid to form on the planet.Creatures found deep beneath the sea give hope for life on Mars“If these features are indeed results of sedimentary volcanism, this is saying to us that in these areas somewhere in the subsurface has to be a source of mud. In other words, there has to be, or had to be, some sort of aquifer containing liquid water to mobilise the fine-grained sediments and take them to the surface of Mars,” said Petr Brož, a scientist at the Institute of Geophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, to CNN. Brož published the scientific work alongside Ondřej Krýza, Lionel Wilson, Susan J. Conway, Ernst Hauber, Adriano Mazzini, Jan Raack, Matthew R. Balme, Matthew E. Sylvest and Manish R. Patel.The researcher also believes that this kind of mud could be present on other bodies in our solar system, such as the dwarf planet Ceres, because of its mountains and bright deposits in its Occator crater which could be caused by water, rocks, and salt that have reached the surface. As such, there may be water beneath the planet’s cold skin.It is possible the same conditions are true for Jupiter\u0027s moon Europa, Saturn\u0027s moon Enceladus or Uranus\u0027 moon Triton. Ceres inhabits a space between Mars and Jupiter in the asteroid belt.Created with Sketch.Beautiful panorama is final photo from Mars opportunity rover Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The left section of a panorama photograph taken by NASA\u0027s Mars Opportunity Rover, the final picture taken before losing contact with earthA panorama picture of the surface of Mars, the last photograph taken by Mars\u0027 Opportunity RoverThe middle section of a panorama photograph taken by NASA\u0027s Mars Opportunity Rover, the final picture taken before losing contact with earthThe right section of a panorama photograph taken by NASA\u0027s Mars Opportunity Rover, the final picture taken before losing contact with earthAnnotated panorama explains the various landscape featuresLeft section of the annotated panorama explains the various landscape featuresMiddle section of the annotated panorama explains the various landscape featuresRight section of the annotated panorama explains the various landscape featuresThe left section of a panorama photograph taken by NASA\u0027s Mars Opportunity Rover, the final picture taken before losing contact with earthA panorama picture of the surface of Mars, the last photograph taken by Mars\u0027 Opportunity RoverThe middle section of a panorama photograph taken by NASA\u0027s Mars Opportunity Rover, the final picture taken before losing contact with earthThe right section of a panorama photograph taken by NASA\u0027s Mars Opportunity Rover, the final picture taken before losing contact with earthAnnotated panorama explains the various landscape featuresLeft section of the annotated panorama explains the various landscape featuresMiddle section of the annotated panorama explains the various landscape featuresRight section of the annotated panorama explains the various landscape featuresHowever, this new information does not mean that exploration of Mars’ surface will be easier – at least not by satellite. “Mud flows can look quite similar as magmatic lava flows on Mars... so in principle we are complicating the future exploration of Mars via satellite images, as we are proposing that two very different mechanisms caused similarly looking features, which will be hard to distinguish from each other,” Brož said.It is estimated these mud flows could be between a few hundred of million years old to two billion years old. The earliest concrete evidence of life on Earth, for context, dates at least approximately 3.5 billion years ago.While human missions to Mars are still not possible, the researchers managed to simulate the conditions of the planet on Earth. Simulating conditions of Mars, such as a low atmospheric pressure and temperatures as -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit) they found that mud did not freeze immediately but rather produced a skin – which would then break as more mud spilled from cracks and froze again.Scientists want to catch interstellar objects with ring of satellitesSalad could be grown on Mars, scientists sayNasa\u0027s Perseverance rover is carrying a hidden message to MarsNot mentioned in the publication, were other experiments where the flows were repeated under a hot Martian environment the planet can reach 20 degrees Celsius for short periods of time. Mud under those conditions “was jumping over the surface as if levitating,” said Brož.This is not the only groundbreaking research about the Red Planet that was recently announced. Researchers at the University of Tokyo managed to simulated the interior of Mars for the first time, giving more information about how Mars was formed 4.6 billion years ago.

An obvious reflex is to sell off a valuable asset at the highest price possible, but one that is the least critical as possible to our future.”He continued: “A painting is easy to move and therefore to hand over. And we have a lot of paintings … In 2020, we have to get the money where it is. So sell family jewellery … The price is the crux of the matter and the main subject of controversy. The price has to be insane for the operation to make sense. I estimate that it would take no less than €50billion (£44.7 billion) to acquire the Mona Lisa. I was told that my estimate was very overvalued, even far-fetched, but each time without real arguments.”Game of Thrones actor calls fans ‘ungrateful’ one year after finale baWhy the Star Wars prequels finally deserve some respectDistinguin also suggested that the Mona Lisa could be “tokenised”, with a form of crypto-currency allowing the painting to be easily exchanged between nations.“It would be like a big global subscription,” he explained. “Legally and technically, this solution would have many advantages: it would allow France and the Louvre to keep control of the painting. One can even imagine that this ploy would garner the assent of the great Leonardo da Vinci, he who painted but also mastered all the sciences and technologies of his time.”In 2019, the Louvre commenced work on a virtual reality programme that would allow visitors to experience da Vinci’s Mona Lisa up close and away from the crowds of tourists at the world-famous gallery.The painting was also dubbed the world’s most disappointing tourist attraction in April 2019, according to a survey conducted by Easyjet customers.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Only essential journeys are currently allowed under the country’s Covid-19 restrictions.Writing on his online journal, Gaiman said that he had done “something stupid” and wasn’t “thinking clearly”, adding that his “home life and work had been turned upside down by the Covid-19 lockdowns” in New Zealand.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGaiman and his wife, the musician Amanda Palmer, announced earlier this month that they had separated during quarantine, with Palmer remaining in New Zealand with their son.Gaiman wrote that he was “panicked and more than a little overwhelmed” by his circumstances in New Zealand, and followed UK government advice when deciding to fly to Skye. He admitted, however, that he was wrong to do so.Neil Gaiman defends 11,000 mile trip from New Zealand to ScotlandWhy the Star Wars prequels finally deserve some respect“Since I got here Skye has had its own tragic Covid outbreak – 10 deaths in a local care home,” Gaiman wrote. “It’s not set up to handle things like this, and all the local resources are needed to look after the local community. So, yes. I made a mistake. Don’t do what I did. Don’t come to the Highlands and Islands unless you have to.”He continued: “I want to apologise to everyone on the island for creating such a fuss. I also want to thank and apologise to the local police, who had better things to do than check up on me. I’m sure I’ve done sillier things in my life, but this is the most foolish thing I’ve done in quite a while.”Gaiman’s trip to Skye was previously described as “gobsmacking” by SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackwood, who said: “We will welcome all to the Highlands when it is safe to do so.

This results in extra cosmic rays entering the solar system.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNeutron counts from the University of Oulu\u0027s Sodankyla Geophysical Observatory show that cosmic rays reaching Earth in 2020 are near a Space Age peak” wrote Dr. Tony Phillips on his website. “So far this year, the sun has been blank 76 per cent of the time, a rate surpassed only once before in the Space Age. Last year, 2019, the sun was blank 77 per cent of the time. Two consecutive years of record-setting spotlessness adds up to a very deep Solar Minimum” Phillips also wrote, while suggesting that “excess cosmic rays...affect the electro-chemistry of Earth’s upper atmosphere and may help trigger lightning.”Astronomers find \u0027regular rhythms\u0027 coming from distant starsSome have speculated that the lowered output from the sun could result in a “Little Ice Age”, similar to the one that occurred between the 14th and 19th century and happened concurrently with mountain glacier expansion in the European Alps, New Zealand, and Alaska among other locations, and lower temperatures across the northern hemisphere.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

This can pose an increased threat to astronauts travelling through space” Pesnell says.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Its 48 coaches run a range of sports programmes, including basketball, tennis, table tennis, volleyball and yoga.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLuca Toth, a head coach at the charity, taught volleyball at the Central Foundation Girls’ School in Tower Hamlets. She tells The Independent: “I see sports coaching as a tool to get close to the girls and be a mentor figure. We teach them teamwork, to persevere and to handle disappointment.”Some 67 per cent of the young people Greenhouse mentors live in postcodes classed as “deprived”. Just north of the Greenhouse Sports Centre in Marylebone lies Church Street Ward, one of the most deprived wards nationally. Figures from 2017 suggest more than half of children in the area live in poverty.How to support our campaignA spokesperson for Greenhouse tells The Independent: “Lockdown came in and suddenly kids were completely cut off. One child could have had a breakfast club, a lunch club, a PE session and an afternoon sports session with us. A lot of the kids are going back to home lives that are very difficult, in confined spaces.”Some children that it mentors come from families where sport is not seen as a cultural priority. Others do not speak English at home. “The Joe Wicks PE experience might not actually cut through to them.”Joel Archard, a father of three, calls Greenhouse “a beacon of the community” over the phone with The Independent. His daughter Luna, now 12 years old, plays table tennis with Maria, another coach and mentor. “They didn’t let the lockdown stop them. They do zoom calls, and ask ‘how are you doing?’. It gives the kids a bit of structure to their lives.Greenhouse is also preparing for the end of lockdown. “Everything is pointing to the fact that the recession will hit the kind of families we deal with hardest, especially young people who have missed school,” says a spokesperson.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It now delivers close to 100 food packages a day.Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project and former COO of Greenhouse Sports, says: “The Felix Project is proud to have worked closely with Greenhouse Sports for many years. During this health crisis it’s great to see them open up their amazing sports centre at the heart of the local community. We applaud their innovation.”Help The Hungry campaign to feed vulnerable Londoners raises over £4mVolunteers cook for neighbours struggling without food during crisisMarathons and piggy-back challenges help The Independent raise £3.7mTwo other organisations that have innovated to support our campaign under lockdown are Holland \u0026amp Barrett and Daylesford Organic. Holland \u0026amp Barrett, a regular supplier of The Felix Project, has donated 2,000 units of vitamin D for elderly people stuck at home at risk of deficiency.Daylesford Organic has released a range of fermented vegetables with Felix Project branding. The farm shop offers “ferments” of radish and butternut squash as “unusual” garnishes for meals or cocktails. It expects to raise an additional £10,000 per year, and all profits from the products go to the charity.Luca, the volleyball coach from Greenhouse, expresses her concern about her children’s welfare through this crisis. “There is probably no privacy for many of the kids sharing rooms. I’m worried that the ones who were ok when we left will suffer, and those who weren’t ok at the beginning will come back worse.“We are dealing with so many people who need us. I have seen what a change we have made in these people’s lives.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

We couldn’t be prouder to donate and help them to get food to people in the most difficult situations.”Another supplier to go the extra mile is Reach Food Service, a provider of premium ingredients to London’s gourmet restaurants, which has donated £10,000.In addition it has pledged £1 for every home delivery during 2020 of its newly launched Reach My Kitchen initiative – dispensing meat, seafood and poultry ingredients normally reserved for London’s top chefs directly to households – and which it estimates will raise its total donation to £50,000.Other food-linked organisations that have already supported our appeal include The Daylesford Foundation, which donated £100,000, and Hello Fresh with £25,000.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Richard Smith, supply manager of The Felix Project, said they had “really stepped up to the plate”.How to support our campaign“Some companies have hugely increased their supplies to us,” he said. “Innocent normally give us five pallets a week but this week we took 24 pallets off them. Same with Müller – their contribution has quadrupled.”Evgeny Lebedev, a shareholder in The Independent, said: “Our Food for London Now campaign has raised £4m in just seven weeks. With more than 1,500 reader donations, and the support of London companies, we have reached heights few expected.“We have told the stories of the people who are suffering during this pandemic. The homeless, the unemployed, the isolated. And we have saluted the innovative people who have applied their skills to helping them in this crisis.“The capital has heard our call, but the hunger crisis has not peaked – just look at the grim economic news from this week. We have committed to raising £10m to ensure the food security of Londoners for three years. So well done, but the hard part comes now. ”Here, 11 of Felix’s most prolific suppliers (in addition to Ocado) explain why they have chosen to partner with Felix, London’s biggest food surplus distributor.Felix suppliers and their generous food donations in April:The firm which produces online recipe boxes has donated 39 tons. Laurent Guillemain, its CEO, said: “We are proud to partner with Felix during the most extraordinary of times. Helping to care for our communities and the vulnerable is more important than ever and we will continue to support this incredible initiative that helps redistribute surplus food however we can.”A dairy products company which contributed 17 tons. The managing director of Müller Yogurt and Desserts, Bergen Merey, said: “Over three years ago I committed to this genuine cause, having read the story of young Felix. With a 14-year-old son of my own, I felt inspired by this wonderful initiative in his memory.”The restaurant and hotel supplier gave 12 tons. Murtaza Lakhani, its owner, said: “The twin issues of food waste and hunger are having major impacts on London. We are proud to make a commitment to Felix as well as to supply high quality food stocks and fresh ingredients so that vulnerable families, elderly people and our amazing NHS workers know there is a nutritious meal waiting for them at the end of the day.”The company which produces smoothies has donated 11 tons. Its head of refreshment marketing, Suraj Gangani, said: “We’re proud to have supported Felix in getting our healthy drinks to those who’ve needed them through this tough time.”The craft organic bakery gave 10 tons. Its spokesperson said: “We decided to change the way we approached food waste and engage with just one organisation, The Felix Project. They are an inspiration. We appreciate that the work of Felix will become more critical and widespread now and for the foreseeable future.”A meat supply company that gave 9 tons. Tim Woodward, CEO, said: “We are delighted to work closely with Felix. Since we started working with them we have delivered over 32,000 meals and 6,200kg of meat for cooking.”The company behind restaurants including The Ivy, Le Caprice, Scott’s and Sexy Fish contributed 8 tons. Richard Caring, its founder, said: “During these difficult times we must come together. The fantastic volunteers from Caprice Holdings restaurants and The Ivy Collections have been cooking 20,000 meals a week to supply, in partnership with Felix, some of London’s vulnerable communities. Together we can make a difference.”An online fruit and veg box company which gave 7 tons.

Working with Felix means we can prevent delicious food from going to waste.”The catering suppliers donated 7 tons. Sarah Reynolds, its head of corporate and social responsibility, said: “We have partnered with Felix for some years. Together with many of our customers, we have been able to ert surplus food to those who need it most. We are very proud of this relationship.”The supermarket and clothing retailer gave 6 tons.

In the original interview, the BBC’s Dan Walker said to Ms Coffey: “We’ve looked at last week’s figures, and at no point in those seven days did you get anywhere near 100,000 people tested. 60,000 on the Monday … only three times did it get to over 70,000, so those targets aren’t being met for numbers of people being actually tested.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?During the interview Ms Coffey said the government could be “proud” of the testing figures it had reached. Over on ITV, Morgan interrupted his own programme following the BBC broadcast and accused Ms Coffey of not having “the guts” to speak to him.After using his mobile phone to play the clip of what Ms Coffey said, Morgan said: “Theresa Coffey, if you’d been on our programme, if you’d had the guts to come on, I would have said to you: ‘There’s been no days, zero, nada, nil. What you just said was a lie.’ “You just told BBC viewers that there had been a handful of days when over 100,000 people had been tested. No, there have been a handful of days when you have conducted, apparently, over 100,000 tests. There hasn’t been a day when you have tested 100,000 people.”He added: “That’s another government minister avoiding us, lying through her back teeth to the country about what they’re doing with testing. It’s easy to be proud, if you’re basing it on a pack of lies.” Earlier this month, Boris Johnson said the government’s “ambition” was to hit 200,000 daily tests by the end of May and go beyond that at a later date. The higher target was announced despite the UK failing to hit health secretary Matt Hancock’s earlier commitment of 100,000 tests a day. The revised figure also fell short of the PM’s own promise from as long ago as 25 March that test numbers would “very soon” reach 250,000 daily tests.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Jobless claims surged by 856,000 to 2.1 million in April compared to the month before, as the number of hours people worked fell sharply in sectors such as hospitality and construction.Work and pensions secretary Therese Coffey told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the country should prepare for the unemployment rate “to increase significantly”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe government’s job retention scheme, which pays 80 per cent of workers’ wages up to £2,500, has been supporting 7.5 million jobs with payments totalling £10bn so far, said chancellor Rishi Sunak last week.Here are the different types of help you can claim if you find yourself unemployed as the lockdown continues.If you are a homeownerSeven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?In March, the government announced a three-month mortgage holiday for homeowners struggling to make repayments because of the coronavirus outbreak.You can apply for the three-month holiday with your bank, but according to the Financial Conduct Authority, you must make a formal agreement with your lender to any mortgage holiday before stopping direct debits or standing order.There are generally two ways to repay the missed payments during the holiday. You can either spread the cost of the missed payments over future monthly mortgage payments, or increase your mortgage term.If you are a renterIf you rent your home and have lost your source of income, you should speak to your landlord immediately to try and work out a repayment scheme, government guidance says.Under emergency coronavirus legislation, landlords in England and Wales must give three months’ notice if a repayment plan cannot be agreed to and they intend to evict you. The same ban on evictions applies in Northern Ireland, where it has been extended from 5 May for another 12 weeks. In Scotland, the law prevents private and social tenants from being evicted for up to six months.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Any employer with a UK payroll and a UK bank account will be able to claim from the scheme.However, you must have been employed on 19 March 2020 and on your employer’s PAYE payroll on or before that date in order to receive the payments.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A fan celebrates outside Celtic Park after Celtic were crowned champions of the Scottish Premiership.

According to HM Revenue and Customs, the scheme is temporary but may be extended. You can check your eligibility for this scheme here.If you are under state pension ageIf you or your partner are under the earliest age you can start receiving your state pension, and you are on a low income or out of work, you may be able to get universal credit (UC).Who is encouraged to return to work?UC helps you meet your basic living costs. In response to the coronavirus crisis, some changes have been made to the UC system, which includes an increased monthly standard rate. For example, single people aged 25 or over can now claim £409.89 per month instead of £317.82 at the previous rate.The government also removed the minimum income requirement for claiming UC and increased the allowance for private renters who are struggling to meet housing costs.You may be eligible for UC if you are aged 18 and over, but under state pension age, you have less than £16,000 in savings, you live in the UK and you currently receive any of the other benefits that UC is replacing and your circumstances have shifted.Check if you can apply for UC here.If you are unemployed or work fewer than 16 hours a weekIf this is your situation, you can apply for new style jobseeker’s allowance (JSA), which is a fortnightly payment that can be claimed on its own or simultaneously with UC.New style JSA is a contribution-based benefit, which means you may be able to get it if you have paid or been credited with enough national insurance (NI) contributions in the two full tax years before the year you are claiming in.In the context of the current pandemic, this means being credited with enough NI contributions in the tax years of 2018 and 2019 to be able to claim this year.However, if you receive a severe disability premium, you cannot claim new style JSA.If you are ill or have a disabilityIf you have a health condition or disability that limits your ability to work, or you cannot work because you are self-isolating from coronavirus you can apply for new style employment and support allowance (ESA).This is also a fortnightly payment that can be claimed on its own or at the same time as UC. It is also a contributory benefit and the same NI contribution criteria as the new style JSA applies here.It should be noted that you will need to have a note from your doctor in order to claim New Style ESA. However, you can start making your claim before you have one, and self-certify for the first 7 days if you have only just become ill.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That could be awkward. Politicians ultimately must make the decisions,” he told The Times.“There will be a post mortem on this. But I think the use of science and the re-establishment of experts is something that won’t go away. And I think it won’t be the backlash that, you know, the scientists, got it wrong.”But Ms Coffey stuck to the defence on Sky TV, saying the science had been followed “every step of the way”, adding: “I think that is what the British public would accept.”Created with Sketch.Care home hit by coronavirus: A rare glimpse of life inside Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Jack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPE at Newfield Nursing HomeJackie Wilson, a healthcare assistant, wearing PPE before going into roomsJack Dodsley, 79, speaks to a carer at Newfield Nursing HomeCarers working at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, sits with a carerJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPEA staff member at Newfield Nursing Home looks after a residentA carer helps Jack Dodsley, 79, from his chairA staff member at Newfield Nursing HomeA carer brings food to a resident at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPEA staff member puts on PPE at Newfield Nursing HomeJackie Wilson, a healthcare assistant, puts on PPE before she enters a roomA bench at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPE at Newfield Nursing HomeJackie Wilson, a healthcare assistant, wearing PPE before going into roomsJack Dodsley, 79, speaks to a carer at Newfield Nursing HomeCarers working at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, sits with a carerJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPEA staff member at Newfield Nursing Home looks after a residentA carer helps Jack Dodsley, 79, from his chairA staff member at Newfield Nursing HomeA carer brings food to a resident at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPEA staff member puts on PPE at Newfield Nursing HomeJackie Wilson, a healthcare assistant, puts on PPE before she enters a roomA bench at Newfield Nursing HomeShe said: “You can only make judgments and decisions based on the information and advice that you have at the time.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A July 2019 progress report published a year later said a formal consultation was on the way, but none has yet materialised.Gay conversion therapy may be banned in nine countriesFarage defends \u0027gay conversion\u0027 remarks from Brexit Party\u0027s WiddecombeMay vows to eradicate gay conversion therapy in LGBT+ planMs Badenoch suggested on Monday that there were no immediate proposals to change the law and made no mention of the promised consultation.Conversion therapy is a very complex issue, Ms Badenoch said in a written parliamentary written answer replying to a question about plans for legislation.There are a wide range of practices which may fall within its scope and we want to ensure we have a thorough understanding of the situation in the UK to inform an effective approach. Before any decision is made on proposals for ending conversion therapy we must understand the problem, the range of options available and the impact they would have. We will work to deepen our understanding and consider all options for ending the practice of conversion therapy.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Laura Russell, director of campaigns, policy and research at Stonewall told The Independent: Any form of ‘therapy’ that attempts to change someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity is unethical and wrong. These so-called conversion therapies have been condemned by all major UK health organisations as they try to shame a person into denying a core part of who they are, and this can have a seriously harmful impact on their mental health and wellbeing. The National LGBT Government survey found that 2 per cent of LGBT people have undergone conversion therapy, and a further 5 per cent have been offered it. We’d urge the Government to remain committed to take the steps they can to end this harmful practice.Created with Sketch.Top 25 LGBT moments in pop culture since Stonewall Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A song about a young gay man leaving home, accompanied by a video which shows desire, persecution, rejection and ultimate freedom, Jimmy Somerville’s anthem epitomised the experience of generations of gay men.Singer Dana International provided another big moment of visibility for transgender people when she won the competition for Israel with her song “Diva”.325 23. Angels in America (1991)Tony Kushner’s epic two-part play tackled the Aids crisis in the context of contemporary America and its many ghosts. A profound piece of theatre.Katy RaddatzMuseum of Performance and DesignMadonna took voguing from the ballroom culture of New York’s black LGBT scene and repackaged it for a global audience, bringing along some of its best dancers for her iconic music video. Her rap, which name-checks Hollywood screen legends, is one of pop’s campest moments.While “Vogue” was for mainstream consumption, the cult documentary Paris Is Burning went behind the scenes of the glamorous ballroom culture, exploring the darker reality of those outcast and stigmatised by a hostile society.625 20. Carol and Susan\u0027s wedding on Friends (1996)While Friends has often been criticised over its LGBT representation, this was one moment it did get right.As a rap song advocating for same-sex marriage, “Same Love” sends a impactful message of support from a traditionally hostile area of the music world.825 18. Britney and Madonna kiss at the VMAs (2003)An obvious and bizarre publicity stunt, but this split-second snog at the MTV VMAs is surely the most famous same-sex kiss of all time.Our beloved Miami foursome weren’t just camp icons – they were ardent LGBT allies. In one much-discussed episode, Blanche is upset that her brother is marrying a man. Sophia gives an impassioned speech, saying: “Everyone wants someone to grow old with – and shouldn’t everyone have that chance?”The gay kiss featured in this memorable video was a huge signal to a generation of kids that their feelings were normal, and that iniduality was to be celebrated. An LGBT anthem was born.1125 15. Stephen Fry introduces Grindr on Top Gear (2009)Grindr was brand new when Stephen Fry showed it off to Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson, and his estimated global audience of about 350 million. App downloads quickly shot up, and gay hook-up culture was never the same again.1225 14. Ellen DeGeneres comes out (1997)Now the most-high profile lesbian in the world, Ellen took the bull by the horns when she came out in a memorable episode of her sitcom, with a simultaneous cover of Time magazine on which she declared: “Yep, I’m gay.”Russel T Davies’s groundbreaking Channel 4 series was unapologetic in its portrayal of gay men and their sex lives, and taught a pearl-clutching British public about rimming.A powerful portrayal of a young black man coming to terms with his sexuality, Moonlight broke through barriers for LGBT, black and Muslim representation when it triumphed at the Oscars.One of the most successful TV shows in the world, Modern Family succeeded in portraying Mitchell and Cameron as parents just as capable of raising (and embarrassing) their daughter as any straight couple.1625 10. Boy George on Top of the Pops (1982)When Culture Club appeared on Top of the Pops to perform “Do You Really Want To Hurt Me?”, the androgynous look of its colourful frontman threw viewers and the UK tabloids into a spin.Lady Gaga’s love of the LGBT community, and her status as Mother Monster for all outcasts, was brilliantly channelled into this mainstream dance hit. In a rebuke to religious inspired homophobia, she delivered the poignant lyric: “I’m beautiful in my way, cos God makes no mistakes.”1825 8. Caitlyn Jenner on Vanity Fair \u0026amp Laverne Cox on Time (2014, 2015)Orange Is the New Black star Laverne Cox was the first transgender woman on the cover of Time magazine, while Caitlyn Jenner presented herself for the first time on the cover of Vanity Fair the following year. Transgender people were being seen, understood and appreciated like never before.Six months after being spectacularly outed after an incident in a Los Angeles public toilet, George Michael decided to own it, with this number one single, complete with an outrageously tongue-in-cheek video about cruising. Jaw-dropping to this day.Glee presented high-camp musical numbers and wacky plot lines alongside some of the first openly gay and transgender characters seen within a high school setting. Its impact on a post-millennial generation of kids forging their own queer identities was enormous.Perhaps the most famous LGBT film of all time, Brokeback Mountain was the first to put a gay relationship front and centre in a mainstream Hollywood plot.2225 4.

Launching the review, the sponsor body said: “It was always envisaged that when the sponsor body was set up in law, and the delivery body established, certain aspects of the programme would be reviewed.“But given the completely altered political and economic landscape, the review will need to be both deeper and more wide-ranging.”Sarah Johnson, the sponsor body CEO, said: “The restoration and renewal of the Houses of Parliament will be the biggest and most complex heritage project ever undertaken in the UK, protecting one of the world’s most recognisable buildings and likely to support thousands of jobs across the country.“The Sponsor Body has been set up to ensure that the project is delivered in the most efficient way that delivers value for money. It is entirely appropriate that we should pause at this time to consider the validity of recommendations made over five years ago before either the Sponsor Body or the Delivery Authority was formed.“The impact of the current health crisis on public finances and Parliament’s ways of working has made it even more essential that we review both the strategy for relocating the two Houses ad the scope of the restoration of the Palace.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the team plans a later-stage study with another , volunteers for a final answer and expects it to be tested in other countries.“This vaccine aims to turn the virus’ most potent weapon, its spikes, against it – raising antibodies that stick to them allowing the immune system to lock onto and destroy the virus,” said immunology and infectious diseases expert, Prof Saul Faust.He’s based at the University of Southampton which, alongside the University Hospital Southampton, is involved in Oxford’s research.Imperial College, meanwhile, is involved in two clinical trials testing a vaccine against Covid-.Its joined the Oxford-led clinical study, with trials conducted at multiple centres across the UK, including Oxford, Southampton, Bristol and London.Expected to run for the next six months, Imperial will be one of several sites carrying out trials of the vaccine.In addition to this work, Professor Robin Shattock at Imperial College London is leading on developing a dferent jab.This vaccine will be tested in human trials beginning in June, also at Imperials research facility at Hammersmith Hospital in the capital.The government is providing £. million to fast-track Imperial’s development of a coronavirus vaccine.Sir John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University, said the team should get a “signal about whether its working by the middle of June”.Lead researcher on the Oxford project, Professor Sarah Gilbert, has previously said she is  per cent confident it will succeed.WHAT’S the UK doing A potential vaccine being developed at the University of Oxford has begun its human trials — the first in Europe.HOW will it be produced The Oxford study has linked up with UK pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca to mass produce the potential vaccine on a not-for-profit basis during the pandemic.WHEN will one be available Most experts reckon by mid- but the Oxford team says researchers will knowtheir jab works by this summer.IS there a drug to treat the coronavirus Early results of a US trial suggest antiviral drug remdesivir cuts the number of days patients take to leave hospital by almost a third.HOW does it work Remdesivir, originally developed to treat Ebola, targets a cell enzyme the virus needs.IS it a game changer Potentially. Dr Anthony Fauci, leading member of the US coronavirus task force, said: “What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus.” But a second trial in China showed no benefit.WHO is looking for a drug cure There are around  clinical trials going on worldwide.About  research groups are pursuing vaccines with nearly a dozen in early stages of human trials or poised to start.Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates, for example, has committed hundreds of millions of dollars to developing a vaccine through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.Dr Andrew Pollard, who is leading the University of Oxford’s vaccine study, said: “We’re not really in a competition against each other. We’re in a race against a pandemic virus, and we really need as many players in that race as possible.Aside from Imperial and Oxford, other researchers in the UK are also making headway in the bid to create a lesaving jab.Experts from both the University of Nottingham and Nottingham Trent University are lending their expertise to Scancell Holdings Plc, which develops immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer.The company is adapting its cancer vaccine to develop a new jab to prevent future infection by the coronavirus, which causes Covid-.Scancell is designing a DNA-based vaccine which will be safely delivered into humans, whose bodies will then produce antibodies and T cells to kill the virus.Another potential vaccine is being developed by cigarette manufacturer British American Tobacco .The Benson and Hedges maker said on April  it could produce between  to  million doses per week by Junetesting goes well, but it will need support from government agencies.It claims to have found an antibody that appears to fight Covid-, using genetically modied tobacco plants, but needs US drug authorities to fast-track permissions.On April , Britains Business Secretary Alok Sharma said that the Government has set up a vaccine task force to accelerate the development of a coronavirus jab.Scientists in Australia have developed a lab-grown version of the virus, a major step toward creating a vaccine.Meanwhile, over in Germany, CureVac are also working on a vaccine, with majority investor and owner of football club Hoffenheim - Dietmar Hopp - revealing that a breakthrough could be made in the next six to seven months.Talking to Sport, he said: It has to be tested first with animals then with human beings.But I think it could be available in autumn at the time when possibly the next wave of infections will come."},{"url":null,"title":"free paper delivery 6 weeks","story":"This means no one has to miss out on their favourite daily read.Simply head online to delivermynewspaper then search your postcode and choose your local newsagent.Select “The Sun” and let us know how often you would like to receive your newspaper.Finally, fill in your details and click “Send My Vouchers”.Vouchers for  weeks of free delivery will be posted to your address.Take these vouchers with you to your chosen newsagent to claim your free -week delivery.Alternatively, you can get your free delivery vouchers by calling us directly on   .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So over time, probably over the next six months, we will have a three-week review.She also added that its plausible restrictions could be in place for longer than that.This is the first time the UK and Europe has had to deal with a pandemic on this scale since the outbreak of Spanish Flu in  that killed around  million people and infected  per cent of the world population.Weve had a few close calls with illnesses like swine flu in -, but it wasnt on the same scale as coronavirus.However, the reason we are in lockdown now is that we have a better understanding of how the pathogens work and what we need to do to stop them.China implemented what was then the largest quarantine in human history to try to contain the coronavirus, locking down at least  cities at the end of January.The lockdown on the eight-million-strong city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus, ended on April .Wuhan was completely barricaded, with people literally being welded into their homes.Six European countries in Europe - Spain, Italy, Denmark, Austria, Poland, and the Czech Republic - who have previously imposed restrictions are beginning to lt lockdown measures.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

and the number can also inform policy decisions about how to contain an outbreak.For example,a virus has an R of three, it means that every sick person will pass the disease on to three other peopleno containment measures are introduced.Its also worth pointing out that the R is a measure of how infectious a disease is, but not how deadly.Taking London as an example, with a current R value of . for coronavirus, it means that for every ten people who have the virus, it will be passed on to only four more people.The low R value means thateveryone continues lockdown and social distancing measures, London would theoretically be virus free by the end of May.The World Health Organisationestimated at the start of March that the coronavirus R stood somewhere between  and ..The UK is now generally below that because of the lockdown and the social distancing measures we have been doing over the past two months.In comparison, the seasonal flu is estimated to be roughly . while measles has a reproductive value of between  and .Despite this, these figures are not set in stone because a given pathogens R value changes with place and time.Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, told The : R is an indication of how much an infectious virus will spread in a population, and ious things impact that value.The susceptibility, size and density of the population that the infection is introduced into matters, as well as the infectiousness of the virus itself.Predictions of the R for Covid- are currently ied because no one knows exactly how many people have been infected in total.According to modelling published by Imperial College London, the R value stood somewhere between  and . in Europe before lockdowns came into effect.The most recent estimate of the nation-wide R-rate is said to be between . and .Below R is the important bit because it means the virus will likely peter out, but things are generally worse in the north of England to the point that the trend could reverse.New data released May  from Cambridge University suggests that in the North East and Yorkshire the R rate - the average number of people an infected person can pass the virus on to - is feared to be at around ..The South West has an R rate of ., slightly more than the North West which has a rate of ..Both the East of England and South East have a rate of ., followed by the Midlands with . and finally London with ..On May , , Boris Johnson urged the British public to help reduce the R value.In his address to the nation, he said: It depends on all of us – the entire country – to follow the advice, to observe social distancing, and to keep that R down.He added: We must make sure that any measures we take do not force the reproduction rate of the disease - the R - back up over one, so that we have the kind of exponential growth we were facing a few weeks ago.And to chart our progress and to avoid going back to square one, we are establishing a new Covid Alert System run by a new Joint Biosecurity Centre.And that Covid Alert Level will be determined primarily by R and the number of coronavirus cases.He continued: And in turn that Covid Alert Level will tell us how tough we have to be in our social distancing measures – the lower the level the fewer the measures.The higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be.During one of the Downing Street press conferences, Sir Patrick Vallance revealed that it was highly likely there is an R value in the community of less than one.This means that every infected inidual passes the disease to less than one other person.This shows the lockdown has had a positive impact on the coronavirus outbreak as to bring an outbreak under control the R value needs to fall below one.However, when the number remains higher than one, the epidemic will grow.Sir Patrick admitted that the R value could be higher in some care homes and hospitals.He said: As I’ve said, it’s not true that the R is necessarily below one in every hospital or in every care home, and that’s the important area that we now need to look at and make sure that the appropriate measures are in place to try and reduce the R there.But it doesn’t change the overall view that I’ve described, that the R overall is below one and therefore we expect to see the slowing and the turn of the epidemic.There are lots of infection control measures experts can use to push this number down and reduce the spread.A study in the Lancet in April, for example, estimated that travel restrictions in Wuhan caused R to drop from . to . after just one week.Sir Patrick said that the draconian social distancing measures introduced in the UK have had a substantial impact so far.This is because as less people come into contact with one another, there is less chance for the virus to spread.He said on Thursday, April : The social distancing measures are needed to reduce the levels right down to a low level.At that point there may be decisions about which ones to relax and which ones not to relax.It’s important to keep the R below one, and this is all about trying to reduce contacts, particularly between households, reduce transmission and keep the levels low across the community.And Sir Patrick added that even small changes in the measures that are in place could lead to the R going above one.According to a pre-print study from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the average number of people an inidual comes into contact with each day has dropped by  per cent since the UK’s lockdown began.“This would be sufficient to reduce R from a value from . before the lockdown to . during the lockdown, indicating that physical distancing interventions are effective,” the study, which tracked over , adults and has not yet been peer reviewed, concluded.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He has stuck to his promise and shown up every day, despite having to have surgery on his wrist and being in evident pain at times.Not only that, but he is donating the revenue from advertising on the show to the NHS. He embodies the perfect combination of qualities required to be a good business person: Do all you can, give something back and be ethical.In the past six weeks he has made more than £.million as new fans snapped up his -Day Plan well-being programme from his Body Coach site.But I really don’t think this was about making more money or becoming more famous.Bear in mind that Joe, who is only , has already made millions following the success of his cookbook and his online fitness classes.He really didn’t need to make more money or be more famous.I honestly believe he just wants children everywhere to experience the joy of fitness.There is a lot to like about Joe. But one thing I love about him is that one of his first le goals was to buy his mum, Raquela, a house. Having grown up on a council estate in Surrey, with Raquela and brothers Nikki and George, Joe always dreamed of being able to spend his earnings on his mum after she supported him in the earliest days of his career.“My mum’s always lived in a council house. We’ve never had mortgages. It wasn’t on the radar for us.“So when I could take that money I earned from that book and say ‘Mum, I’m buying your house. It’s yours’, that was an amazing moment for me.”Joe didn’t have an easy childhood. He has spoken about his father Gary still struggling with heroin addiction. But rather than repeating history, he actively decided to take a dferent path.He found exercise as a coping method. “I used exercise probably as a way to manage my feelings,” he has said.He said: “Because of my dad’s addiction, and the damage I saw it cause, me and Nikki steered clear of it. We weren’t smoking weed. We were training, exercising and playing sport. Along the line, I decided that wasn’t going to be my destiny.”Things in le either crush you or make you the person you were always meant to be. The strength of character it takes to turn your back on the path chosen by your first and most important role model — your dad — is immense.It would be so easy for him to have chosen the same path as his father or use his father’s addiction as an excuse for not making the most of his le.Joe has said he tries not to dwell on his past nor judge his dad. All that matters to him now is being happy and looking forward.The moral of this story is: Put the graft in, keep pushing yourself and never give up.But one of the many likeable things about Joe is how readily he credits Raquela for her role in his success, saying she taught them “right and wrong”, while his dad was “in and out of rehab”.She must be a hell of a woman to have brought up three boys so well. Joe and Nikki work together now, which is testament to the strength of their family ties.Knowing all this about Joe makes it all the more amazing he found his happy ever after when he married his model we Rosie in , and the pair now have two adorable children — Indie who’s  months and four-month-old Marley.It would be easy to resent his success. But how could anyone wish Joe anything other than happiness, given what he has overcome and also his approach to le I’m as keen as the next person for the lockdown to end and for normal le to resume – at least as much as it possibly can.But when I read about the fliers advertising mass gatherings, promising picnics and live music in cities across the UK this weekend, I couldn’t believe my eyes.At least eight events were being organised by anti-vaxxing group UK Freedom Movement, which claims the lockdown is illegal.Its posters headlined “UK Mass Gathering” said: “We say no to the coronavirus bill, no to mandatory vaccines, no to the new normal and no to the unlawful lockdown.”It is also urged people to gather in a major park in the eight locations, including London, Sheffield and Edinburgh, to “bring a picnic, some music and let’s have some fun and say yes to le”.Yes, lockdown measures are extreme and yes, we all want them to relax and for normality to .But what the organisers of this are failing to realise is that you can’t protest or demonstrate against a virus.And while there is so much still left for us to understand about how this particular virus works, to attend a mass gathering in protest seems like a fool’s errand.This event is clearly organised by idiots, for idiots.If only we’d all been quick-witted enough to self-isolate with someone who knows how to do our hair, like Kate Moss, who has been hunkering down with A-lister stylist James Brown.That said, Kate is an absolute beauty and clearly a supermodel, whether she is having a good hair day or a bad one.As luck would have it I am currently living with my mum.She has done a grand job dyeing my roots so far, but I think a blow-dry may be beyond her remit.Luckily, with a pandemic going on, and staff to worry about, I have more important things to think about than my hair.Twitter has been among the first companies to announce that it will not be bringing employees back into the workplacethey would prefer to work from home.And for more and more people, home is likely to be the new workplace – with meetings taking place on screens.The past few weeks have shown us that as long as people have a laptop and wi-fi, many can work from home.For lots of us, being allowed to do so means we save loads of money on travel and hundreds of hours of commuting time, while massively reducing our carbon footprint.And we’ll never have to buy a stale sandwich again.Meanwhile, companies will save a fortune on rent.All in all, this new way of working, for those who can do it, makes sense.Over the past few weeks we have all become much more aware of people’s proximity to us.And yes, with streets that have fewer cars than ever before, no doubt some of us are stepping into the road to avoid another pedestrian who could come within two metres of us.But police have felt the need to issue warnings to pedestrians not to walk into the road to dodge fellow pedestrians because it is dangerous .Seriously, is such a warning really necessary I know we have all been in lockdown for a while but surely we haven’t taken leave of our common sense and will remember to look left and right when we cross the road . . . won’t we It’s now been eight weeks since our Thursday night Clap For Carers began. And looking at this photo of Boris Johnson outside No from Thursday, it’s a good reminder that things are changing all the time.When you compare it to the picture taken of him just days before he was admitted to hospital it really shows the big dference a few weeks make.He looks more or less back to his old self. Also, it’s really cheering to see new mum Carrie looking so well and so happy.We seem to be seeing lots of people in their swim-wear at the moment, with not a. pool in sight!Normally I try to give thanks for my strong and able body rather than worrying too much about what it looks like.But it’s hard not to feel a tad wistful looking at photos of Kimberley Garner, who looks so fit and gorgeous she’d no doubt be awarded swimwear body of the week,such an award existed. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Even before coronavirus, it would have been impossible for anyone to guarantee the safety of every worker every day.But the Government has stressed it’s “extremely unlikely” a school could be the source of a Covid- outbreak.And given the risks frontliners take every single day, that assurance should be good enough for teaching unions.WE welcome the news that the Government plans to push ahead with legislation to end free movement and replace it with a points-based immigration system before the end of this year.The new system is exactly what Brexit-voting Sun readers wanted: it will let us welcome the brightest and best — including doctors, nurses and carers — to the UK based on what they have to offer, not where they come from.And it’s logical to get it introduced quickly so businesses have time to prepare before the transition period ends.Let’s hope MPs have the sense to back the bill.WE can all sleep a little more soundly in our beds now the Government looks set to hit its target of recruiting , contact-tracers by the end of next week.It’s been obvious for a long time that widespread testing and tracing is the best way to contain the virus: all the countries that have fared best have been doing it from the start.But thanks to dodgy advice from Public Health England, Boris and his ministers gave up on it back in March.What a relief they’ve finally seen the light.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They secured charitable grants and, after trialling ious apps, settled on aTouchAway, which is secure for hospital situations and enables three-way bedside calls between the patient, family and medical staff.There was just one problem – they needed tablets to run it on. “We had a few at St Thomas’ but they weren’t G,” Dr Meyer says. Step forward BT, which donated  G-enabled tablets to get the ball rolling. So, by mid-April, patients at Guy’s and St Thomas’ were connecting with loved ones using Louise and Joel’s initiative, named Le Lines.Now, just a month on, Le Lines has supplied , tablets to  intensive care unit sites across the UK, enabling , video calls bringing families together.There have been moments of pure joy. “One man regaining speech after coming off a ventilator proposed to his girlfriend,” Dr Meyer smiles.“And seeing patients sedated with a breathing tube in their throat respond to loved ones with a nod or a wink is so encouraging.”Professor Rose adds: “Seeing their loved ones’ faces anchors them back in the world.”There are funny conversations too – a lot of patients chat to their dogs. But, inevitably, there are heart-wrenching moments.“We’ve witnessed the saddest final conversations and goodbyes with the chaplain and prayers,” Dr Meyer says. “But I’ve seen what peace having family present through video calling brings to patients at the end of their lives.”Le Lines also allows medical teams to have face-to-face conversations with families, which is a far more personal way of engaging than over the phone, especially when they have to deliver the worst possible news. As Dr Meyer says: “We can show empathy over a video connection, picking up on emotional cues and body language.”Donations to Le Lines’ JustGiving page pour in, many – touchingly – from recovered patients who found comfort in Le Lines during the most traumatic period of their lives.“It’s an extraordinary example of what can be achieved between industry, charities, academic partners and the NHS,” Dr Meyer says. And BT continues its support, providing G WiFi hubs to intensive care units.When the coronavirus crisis has passed, virtual visiting will remain a brilliant service for families unable to visit loved ones in hospital due to say childcare, distance or cost – literally a leline bringing hope and light into even the darkest of hours.Diane, a grandmother from south London, was distraught when her husband was taken into hospital with Covid- in early April.She says: “The worst moment was the phone call saying his kidneys were failing and he was on a ventilator. I felt helpless, so far away from him. So when doctors told me about Le Lines, I downloaded the aTouchAway app on my iPad – then the hospital team took their tablet to my husband’s bedside. Seeing him on a ventilator for the first time was a shock, but I found comfort in telling him how much I loved him. ‘You’re doing so well,’ I said, and even though the circumstances were strange and scary, I felt close to him.“When, three days after he’d come off the ventilator, he could talk, his first words to me were: ‘I love you’. I cried. It was beautul.“One of the first things I asked him after he came home last week was whether he’d heard my voice when he was fighting for his le on the ventilator. Yes, he said, and it had given him strength.”As the Covid- pandemic began to spread in the UK, it was feared that the demand for ventilators would overwhelm hospitals.With an urgent need to increase capacity, the government turned to the private sector.British defence manufacturer Babcock International was one of those to answer the call. Five days after an email circulated from its head office, staff had a working prototype up and running. An ambitious target was set to design, develop and supply , ventilators, which the company is now firmly on track to meet. It has involved a huge effort, with staff working round the clock and some fine British innovation employing the legendary “Blitz spirit”.“It’s the most dficult challenge we’ve ever faced, but it’s fantastic to be able to provide some support and feel like we’re making a dference,” says Chris Spicer, head of future support for defence systems technology. “We all have relatives in vulnerable groups so it’s been an emotional experience.”Providing facilities management for a new hospital is no small task. But Interserve managed it in just  days.In early April the world-leading UK support services, construction and equipment services company was tasked at short notice with covering everything from maintenance and portering to cleaning and catering, at the temporary Nightingale North West hospital in Manchester’s Central Convention Centre.Former Royal Marine and fireman Steve Francis is site manager on the project. He oversaw a staff of  for the rapid rollout necessary to have the hospital up and running in time for its first patient on April , and to keep everything ticking over since.“It was an amazing experience. Everybody was enjoying their work, there were no complaints about anything,” he says, “We were just cracking on. The emotional side was seeing how quickly it was rolling out. The atmosphere was tremendous. Now we’ve got a great team here working selflessly knowing they’re making a dference.”The overwhelming demand caused by Covid for personal protective equipment has been answered by a number of private businesses.One of those is defence manufacturer BAE Systems, which responded to an urgent plea in March for face visors from local GPs in Barrow-In-Furness, where it has a facility. The company made a prototype in just two days, manufactured the order using D printers and delivered them direct to the surgeries.When it saw demand was increasing nationwide, BAE then stepped up production at its other UK sites and has now made and distributed , masks. It has also D printed a new invention, the Door Claw, which allows staff in care homes and other places to avoid touching door handles.“It’s amazing how many people were prepared to work really long hours to make things happen,” says technology director Dave Short. “And we’ve had a huge amount of feedback ranging from letters and photographs to videos – quite emotional responses, and that just drives everyone on.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is a greater risk there than there is marking kids’ work.”Ministers will make their final decision on whether to gradually reopen schools as planned on June  when they assess the lockdown next Thursday.The Sun understands schools in parts of England could be allowed to delay their reopening — but onlycoronavirus rates of infection have shot up locally.But four unions — the NEU, GMB, Unison and Unite — have ramped up their opposition.Their -step document tells union reps they should only agree to schools reopening more fullyevery demand is met.And they warn that evenevery single concern is dealt with, they still expect to oppose plans to gradually reopen schools from June .The document states: “It seems extremely unlikely at present that circumstances nationally will permit that.”They demand that teachers are allowed to wear masks and PPE — even though Public Health England says this would usually not be needed.And entire schools should closestaffing levels drop, the document says.SCHOOLKIDS are heaping online praise for teachers ahead of their possibleto school.One, Eva, sang a thank-you to Mrs Sprowell from Ordsall ­Primary in East Retford, Notts.Aarav from Rainbow Primary in Bradford drew a portrait of Miss Iqbal.Aarav said: “Thank you for sending me learning resources so I can keep myself busy at my home in this dreadful crisis.”Kevin Courtney, of the NEU, defended his -page check list.He said: “The checklist is detailed because there are so many considerations to take into account when dealing with a school situation, particularly as we are looking at our youngest children going back first.“Parents would expect nothing less.”Tory MP Robert Halfon, chairman of the education select committee, said unions should be “as concerned about the risk to many thousands of vulnerable children” of not being educated.Evidence shows kids are not as vulnerable to Covid-.The virus can live on paper for ying s of time, but government advice is to wash hands rather than avoid books.Professor Matthew Snape, from Oxford University, said “only a very small number of children” get sick from Covid-.He said: “Also, it seems the children who get Covid- do not become ‘super-spreaders’, unlike what we see in viruses such as influenza.”NOTHING in le can be called “risk-free” — but is there evidence ato schools is safe for kids and teachers The World Health Organization’s chief scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan has insisted: “There have not been big outbreaks in schools.”She added that “children are less capable of spreading” the virus.A test in Iceland found none of  under-s tested positive.Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter of the University of Cambridge has calculated the risk of kids dying from it is one in .million.There have been ­contradictory scientic claims on whether kids can be signicant spreaders of the virus.A recent German study of almost , coronavirus patients found that “children may be as infectious as adults”. It advised against “unlimited reopening of schools”.An Australian study found nine members of staff with coronavirus had come into contact with  students. But none had contracted it from the children.A nine-year-old Brit infected in France did not pass it on despite being in contact with more than  people.Early research from Denmark and Norway shows reopening schools has not triggered a spike in the disease.British scientists Dr Alasdair Munro and Prof Saul Faust found children do not appear to be super-spreaders. They concluded: “Governments worldwide should allow all children back to school.”UCL’s Professor Russell Viner backed them, but with safeguards.He said: “Around  children die in car accidents in Britain every year. But parents don’t say, ‘Never get in a car’. They buy child seats and wear a seat belt.”Statistics, of course, fail to highlight the suffering and loss felt by every bereaved family.Yet the current science seems overwhelmingly to signal that it’s time for primary classes to .A Department for Education spokesman said: “We want children back in schools as soon as possible because being back with their teachers and friends is so important for their education and their well-being.”The reopening of schools in  European countries has not led to a signicant increase in coronavirus infections, EU education bosses said today.Blaženka Divjak, Croatia’s education minister, said: “So far we haven’t heard anything negative about the reopening of schools, but it is probably too early to have final conclusions.”You’d think they would be keener than anyone to heed the science.But when Government experts or even the WHO contradict their desire to keep schools shut, they ignore it.Or they wheel out the BMA — asit represented medical opinion, rather than just being another left-wing trade union.Their latest wheeze, part of an absurd dossier of  demands, is to refuse to mark homework in case members catch Covid from a book. The risk is minuscule . . . nil,they take precautions.Most primary kids the Government wants toon June  get minimal homework anyway. And, as Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam says, they neither catch the disease severely nor pass it on like they do flu.It is impossible to ensure that teachers will be  per cent safe before they— as it is for any worker.There WILL be a statistically tiny threat as long as this disease persists. Le is full of them. This is another. Unions cannot demand an exemption.This protracted shutdown is already doing immense damage to pupils, especially the most disadvantaged.The truth is the unions are capitalising on a mainly middle-class reluctance toto work because many have lost perspective about the real risk.In fairness, that reflects the success of the Government’s “stay home” campaign.But now deaths and infections are falling steadily and the economy is in dire trouble we must sht gear.Publishing daily figures of Covid recoveries will help. Not least because the total will be in the millions, as opposed to the death toll of ,. Awful though that latter figure is, it remains a small fraction of the overall.So does the recent estimate of those now infected: some , in England, of a population of ,,. Only one in  has Covid, in some areas far less.The fact we can now test everyone with symptoms, and have , contact tracers, should drive even those figures down.Teachers, meantime, should ponder whether their unions have lost the plot.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Especially my track, Alive.”The music didn’t disappoint, either, ranging all the way from the excellent Icelandic entry, Think Of Things, to knock-kneed techno from some Russian live-wires called Little Big.My personal highlight, though, was the nutty Latvian bird, Samanta Tina, who turned up for her promotional video wearing a PPE mask and squirting a bottle of disinfectant everywhere.If ever it got a bit too “Eurovision”, though, there was a special guest on hand to calm the mood down.Sweden’s Mans Zelmerlow sang Heroes in his back garden , Italy’s Diodato slowly murdered Volare in a CGI amphitheatre and Ireland’s Johnny Logan had either aged quite dramatically or had to be replaced, right at the last second, by Julian Assange on the poignant What’s Another Year.The one constant, though, was Norton, who handled Eurovision’s new socially-distanced, time-delayed, non-competitive format as brilliantly as he did the old one and was in no mood to spare feelings.“Samanta Tina. She’s tried to represent Latvia six times, Lithuania twice and now she’s got through it’s been cancelled. You’d think she’d take the hint, wouldn’t you.”“Serbia’s answer to The Pussycat Dolls, when the question is — name a group that isn’t as good as The Pussycat Dolls ”It was a joy to watch after seeing so many hosts and shows fail spectacularly with “the new normal” and my only real complaint was that there wasn’t enough of him or the event.I wanted a vote as well, of course. But by the time I was ready for Norton to annihilate the regional juries, it was all over.Lesson learned, though. If I ever take this event for granted or complain about the running time again, you have permission to shoot me down in righteous flames.Meantime, stay hellzy.The Real Marigold Hotel, Britt Ekland: “I look in the mirror — it’s OK.

I’ve heard a lot of good stories, the President.Frontline workers take it, a lot of doctors take it, I take it.Im not going to get hurt by it, its been around for  years for malaria, for lupus.

half the usual size - to allow for social distancing.That is expected to mean more staff than normal will be needed to supervise regular classes, and that fewer will be available for remote teaching.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Headteachers, told thethat “splitting classes in order to reduce the risk of transmission requires twice the number of staff, leaving fewer teachers to support those other children still at home.”Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added that teachers “cannot be in more than one classroom at once”.Schools across the UK closed indefinitely in March amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, and normal classes replaced by online sessions and other forms of home learning.The gradual decline of new cases in the country has sparked a fierce debate about when schools should reopen with fears about the possible impact of the move.Kids across the country face falling behind without proper lessons and continued homeschooling from parents who are also trying to juggle their own jobs and working from home.Professor Alan Smithers, Director of Centre for Education and Employment Research at University of Buckingham, has accused unions of setting a spurious list of unreasonable and vague demands and warned that the future of the countrys children was hanging by a thread.And yesterday saw at least one union advise its members to prepare to reopen on June  after receiving assurances from government scientic advisers.But public health experts have expressed concern that opening schools too early could lead to a resurgence of cases, while teaching unions have said it could endanger the health of staff.A number of unions have called on the government only to reopen schools once safety measures like comprehensive testing of children and staff can be guaranteed.The last week has seen unions in talks with ministers and calling on the government only to reopen schools once precautions like testing for children and staff can be put in place.Yesterday, we told how parent Jemma Thompson would refuse to send her son back as she didnt want him to be treated as a guinea pig."},{"url":null,"title":"holidays this year safe","story":"Visit Britain boss Patricia Yates says the crisis could actually boost British tourism and urged the nation to take a holiday later in the year.Appearing in front of the DCMS committee, Ms Yates claimed staying in the UK was vital for the industry.She said: “To get British tourism up and running this summer, and this summer is hugely important is we need that domestic audience.“The worrying thing is the lack of confidence in the British public about travelling, so  per cent who have a holiday booked for July and September don’t think that holiday will take place.Only  per cent of people are thinking of booking a domestic holiday for the summer.And that’s much lower than competitor destinations, in Italy  per cent of their domestic holiday will holiday domestic.Ms Yates was also asked about Greeces offer today to not quarantine Brits for two weeksthey were allowed to come here without being detained.Greek tourism minister Harry Theoharis called for the UK to stop the two-week quarantine for Greek tourists, and would reciprocate the favour for Brits entering Greece in turn.She said: Its quite interesting, it would be good to choose the countries available to us for inbound markets.We have an international market, our regional director is saying America is ready to go.An airbridge between us and America could be very valuable to us.Ms Yates urged Brits to travel within the UK, and pleaded with the Government to do more to convince them.She said: It has to be the year of domestic tourism.There’s a real job to be done there in convincing people it’s socially responsible to travel and enjoy a holiday and that it’s safe to do so.”The tourism expert also claimed UK travel could be boosted beyond the next  months by the crisis.Brits are currently allowed to take day trips but cannot stay overnight.Hotels and hostels will be allowed to open as part of the Governments three phase plan, but this wont be til July at the earliest.Yesterday trips to France were looking more unlikely than ever this summer as it was revealed the -day quarantine exemptions wont include tourists.Spanish holidays are also unlikely - the country has since banned Brits until June  at the earliest, with UK tourists also forced to quarantine for  days.With the quarantine also enforced when ing to the UK, it could mean four weeks of annual leave for a two week holiday.Last month European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said she was optimistic people would be able to travel as coronavirus was brought under control.She also revealed Visit Britain had held discussions with the Government about an extra bank holiday in October.Ms Yates explained: I think that’s an idea that’s being considered, to have a bank holiday around the October half term.Because what we’re going to need to do is not just stimulate people in July and August but really extend the season this year for the domestic market.Yesterday Brits were given hope for summer holidays after Grant Shapps confirmed ministers are looking at travel bridges between countries with low Covid infections.The Transport Secretary said that the Government were looking at allowing people to fly between countries where the spread of the virus is low.Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Shapps said it the plan of only allowing travel between Covid-safe areas was just one thing being looked at, alongside the plan to quarantine all arrivals for  day.Everyone who comes into the UK will have to isolate for a fortnight under Government plans, which are set to begin in June.Mr Shapps said today in the House of Commons: The final details of the quarantine scheme will be released soon, coming in early next month.And he added: It is the case that we would indeed consider further improvements for example, things like air bridges, enabling people from other areas and countries who have themselves achieved lower levels of growth virus infection, to come into the country.So those are the active discussions, but will go beyond what will initially be a blanket situation.As it stands, only lorry drivers and key workers are expected to be exempt from the new quarantine rules, then they come in - dashing hopes of a summer holiday for many.But the idea of travel bridges to areas of low infection will give Brits a boost thatour rate of infections continues to fall, Brits may be able tto jet off on a getaway in the coming months."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus timebomb india cyclone amphan","story":"A MASSIVE cyclone is set to batter the coast of India, forcing tens of thousands of people to break the coronavirus lockdown to seek shelter.The country’s weather office said Super Cyclone Amphan had reached winds of up to  mph over the Bay of Bengal on Monday night and was expected to make landfall tomorrow.Such wind speeds could make Amphan one of the biggest storms to hit India in about a decade, said officials.India imposed the world’s biggest lockdown in March to contain the coronavirus which has infected more than , people and killed ,.The states of Odisha and West Bengal were moving families to more than , shelters in government offices.Schools and colleges were hastily converting coronavirus quarantine centres into cyclone shelters.But the need to maintain social distancing has left the authorities with a headache.“We have just about six hours left to evacuate people from their homes and we also have to maintain social distancing norms,” said S.G.

Class sizes will be halved and even kids’ artwork banned from the walls. Parents have been given a glimpse of how schools will operate when they reopen to more pupils as lockdown restrictions are eased. Class sizes will be halved, start times will be staggered and contact will be severely reduced for children in reception, Year  and Year  whoto primary school from June . Plans for the reopening were ramped up as the Government announced tests would be available to everyone over five who shows symptoms. It comes as the Department of Health revealed , people had died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, a rise of  on the previous day. The Health Secretary Matt Hancock insisted the UK proposals for schools tois “sensible”. He said: “It is very clear that the number of children who are badly affected by this disease is very, very, very small. “So, the proposals that we’ve made for schools are safe and they are sensible.” He added it is up to head teachers whether staff are allowed to wear face masks or visors while they teach. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, has urged the Government to write to him setting out the scientic evidence behind the decision. It is understood the Government has examined an Australian study which showed kids are “not the primary drivers of Covid- spread” in schools. The Government is looking at a phased reopening of primary schools from June . A planning guide – from the National Education Union, Unite, Unison and GMB – advises schools that two-metre social distancing must be maintained as there is a lack of scientic evidence that children do not transmit the virus. Political leaders in Liverpool and Hartlepool have pledged to keep schools closed while the infection rate remains higher in their regions. And Bury council in Greater Manchester said that while high levels of the infection remain in the North West “the borough will not be reopening schools on June ”.  Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said: “I worry the June  date is too soon for the North. “The virus is at a dferent stage in dferent parts of the country. It can’t be fair parents and pupils here are being told it’s OK for schools to reopen when their areas still face a higher risk than the South.” Cabinet minister Oliver Dowden repeatedly refused to rule out teachers, heads or council leaders being “penalised” for defying advice to open from June . Marsden Infant and Nursery School near Huddersfield, West Yorks, has laid out markings on the floor to keep children separate.  Head teacher Frances Swallow and colleague Sarah Yates were also pictured converting the assembly and dining hall into a classroom. At Kempsey Primary School in Worcestershire, children of key workers were photographed yesterday keeping apart while eating, studying and washing their hands. Elsewhere inidual head teachers are refusing to act, while some are warning of huge problems. Evelyn Davies, of Coldfall Primary School in north London, said: “You can’t get young kids to keep away from each other and to not touch each other, it is impossible.” Denmark became the first European country to reopen its primary schools on April . Other countries with schools back open include Belgium, Austria and Portugal.

Bury in Greater Manchester has now joined Hartlepool and Liverpool as they reject plans to allow teachers and childrento the classroom on June . The council has now written to all headteachers in the area outlining the reasons behind their decision. The statement claimed the reopening classrooms would “pose an unacceptable risk to pupils, staff and communities of vulnerable people.” Labour councillor for Bury Tamoor Tariq said on Twitter that the governmentaposs position is ill advised and not one we can follow. Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson warned last week that he would resist sending kids back at the beginning of next month, saying he had concerns about whether schools would be able to operate safely. He told BBC Newsnight: “I’m not going to take risks with children’s lives or with staff and teaching professionalsapos lives.” While leaders in Hartlepool said it they would be taking a measured and cautious approach to this. Last weekend, senior minister Michael Gove told parents it was safe to send their kids back to school - but confusingly added aposthere would be risksapos. He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr: “It is absolutely safe,” then said the only way to be sure was to “stay at home” as there is “always, always... a risk”. Teaching unions fear it is unsafe for pupils and staff to go back to school on June . And Labour wants the test and trace system to be put in place before schools .  Mr Gove told BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show: Yes, teachers will be safe in schools... Some of the best leaders in current education have said that it is absolutely safe for children to , absolutely safe for teachers and other staff toas well. But askedhe could guarantee no teacher would be infected as a result of ing to the classroom, he said: The only way ever to ensure that you never catch coronavirus is to stay at home completely. There is always, in any loosening of these restrictions, a risk of people catching coronavirus. You can never eliminate risk, but... it’s extremely unlikely any school is likely to be the source of a Covid outbreak, andfor any reason there are risks we can take steps to mitigate them. Universities aposcould rush to reopen campusesapos Universities could rush to reopen campuses when it is still unsafe to do so amid increased competition to attract students, MPs have been told. Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union , warned that leaving the decision to institutions could be dangerous as financial pressures could encourage them to reopen prematurely. The Office for Students , the higher education regulator, has urged universities not to make any promises to students that everything will be back to normal in the autumn termthis is not the case.

The President prompted shock last night when he revealed he has been taking the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine for a week and a half. He claimed: Iaposve had a lot of good stories, anditaposs not good, Iaposm not going to get hurt by it. Yet the US Food and Drug Administration is warning not to take the drug to treat coronavirus outside of hospitals or clinical trials. The FDA said it can cause a dangerously rapid heart rate, especially when combined with certain other drugs, and has not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing COVID-. Trump was slammed today by the UKaposs former chief scientic advisor Sir David King, who declared every word he says should be ignored. Sir David told ITV: This is not the pronouncements of a person who is listening to the scientists. He is making it up as he goes along. Yet the UK government refused to condemn Trump. Cabient minister Therese Coffey told BBC Breakfast: I think it surprised a lot of people last night when President Trump announced this. However, that really is a matter between him and his clinician rather than the government of the UK.  “What we are seeing is good ongoing work about situations regarding things like the vaccine development.” Askedthe comments were irresponsible, she said: “I really think it’s a matter between him and his clinician which I do not want to comment on. It is not the first time the UK has refused to criticise the notoriously prickly US President. Last month Downing Street refused to condemn the President for suggesting people could inject disinfectant into their lungs.Trump previously said as Dr Deborah Birx, the head of White House coronavirus response, looked on aghast: “I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning  “Because you see, it gets on the lungs, and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it’d be interesting to check that. So that you’re going to have to use medical doctors, but it sounds - it sounds interesting to me.” The President later claimed he was being sarcastic but there were reports of some US citizens drinking disinfectant after his comments. Englandaposs Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries said at the time: Nobody should be injecting anything. We should be using evidence-based and properly trialled treatments that we know will be safe. But ministers and No refused to join the criticism. Boris Johnsonaposs official spokesman said: We can only speak to the UK response and in terms of disinfectant, I’m certainly not aware that it’s anything that’s being recommended.

It came as ministers said tests will now be available to anyone aged five and over with symptoms. Loss of taste and smell were today added to the list of symptoms that should warn sufferers to self-isolate to prevent passing on the disease – months after other countries had included it. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs: “Everyone aged five and over with symptoms is now eligible for a test. That applies right across the UK from now.” The testing expansion is meant to reassure parents and teachers as schools prepare to reopen next month.But today Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab was unable to confirm the infection-tracking app would be ready for rollout before then.Mr Hancock said last week the NHS app would be ready by “mid-May” – but today No said it would be ready “in the coming weeks”. However, less than a quarter of IT experts believe it will be effective, a survey for the Chartered Institute of Information Technology found. It came as deaths rose by  to , – the lowest daily increase since lockdown began.

But he stayed quiet for  years, with the world only finding out about his heroism in  when his we found a dusty old scrapbook in their attic. It contained names, records and pictures of the hundreds of Czechoslovakian children that, had it not been for Nicholas, would have been sent to Nazi concentration camps with their parents.Today, on what would have been his th birthday, Sir Nicholas Winton has been honoured with a Google Doodle.This is the story of his extraordinary act of bravery. In December , British stockbroker Nicholas Winton set up a rescue mission for Czechoslovakian children, working out of a Prague hotel room. He met with desperate parents who knew that to save their childrenaposs lives, they would have to give them up and smuggle them to another country to be raised by strangers. They would never see them again. Nicholasapos work was incredibly dangerous. It involved bribery, secret networks, forgery, nine dferent railroad trains and a ton of paperwork. And it was also incredibly expensive. Donors in Britain sent money, with Nicholas also paying out of his own pocket to get the children to safety.  He paid endless bribes to Gestapo agents, and covered the expenses of children whose parents had already been killed or forced into hiding. In early , a few months after the operation began, Nicholas flew back to the UK and began looking for new homes for the children. With the help of his mother, he printed ads in newspapers and posted bulletins at synagogues around the country, asking for foster families to come forward. He appealed to the Home Office for visas that would allow the children to enter the country - and when they didnapost come through in time, he forged them. In March , he began to evacuate the children. Nicholas initially arranged for  to say goodbye to their parents and get on a train in Prague. They travelled through the Third Reich, through Nuremberg and Cologne, before eventually arriving in Holland and catching a boat across to Great Britain - and to safety. After the success of this first evacuation, Nicholas arranged for eight more trains to cover the same route.  Tragically, only seven of the trains made it. While the final train was making its way through Germany, Hitler invaded Poland and all borders were closed. The children never made it to Holland, and the train was never seen again. Nicholas had saved  children, bringing them to Great Britain before the Second World War started. Nicholas kept quiet about what he had done, not even telling his we or children about his heroic actions. But in  his we, Grete, found a scrapbook in their attic with documentation detailing what her husband had done. She gave it to a Holocaust historian, who in turn contacted the BBC. They invited Nicholas onto the programme Thataposs Le, where they showed the scrapbook and explained what Winton had achieved.

Mum Hannah Godwin, , noticed Leia had a rash and high temperature while sister Thea was “healthy and happy”. Leia was rushed to Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, from their home in nearby Risca three weeks ago. She was treated for an inflammatory disease in young children linked with an extreme reaction to Covid-. Hannah said: “It got dficult for her to breathe and she got transferred to critical care. “She went through a scary time. God knows what could have happenedshe hadn’t had the treatment early on.”  Leia’s arteries also began to swell to a le-threatening size. Hannah said: “The consultant said, ‘If there’s a rupture she’s not going to survive’.” Leia was then transferred to Noah’s Ark Children’s Hospital for Wales in Cardf, where she tested positive for antibodies to Covid- and was treated in isolation. Hannah and husband Simon, , hope she will be allowed home soon. Doctors plan to do genetic testing to understand why she reacted the way she did. They also want to take blood from Thea to seeshe has had Covid- – andso, why she did not react the same way.The news comes as the link between the illness and coronavirus remains unclear, with some children testing positive for COVID-, and others negative.A report by doctors in Birmingham last week indicated that there was a link between the two illnesses, but now the chief scientist of the World Health Organisationhas revealed that this may not be the case. Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Dr Soumya Swaminathan said: “Very recently there have been some reports of children getting admitted with a strange syndrome, something that looks like sepsis, something that looks like a disease called Kawasaki disease, which causes inflammation in the blood vessels.“Now, itaposs not very clear what the links are between Covid- and this syndrome. There are some children who tested positive for the virus and some who havenapost. “The WHO has discussed this with a group of international paediatricians about how to approach this, and the need to collect more data. We put out a note two days ago, which requests doctors to provide information in a standardised format so that we can quickly learn as much as possible about the syndrome.

He still cycles to restaurants and takeaways, picks up the food then rides to the customeraposs house to drop it off. But the reason behind many of his orders is now dramatically dferent, and heaposs no longer just delivering a lazy dinner but providing an essential service to the most vulnerable people in our community. Since lockdown was brought in, the delivery company has started working with convenience shops to take groceries to people who are self-isolating or shielding.  Robin, , has been a driver with the delivery company for four years, but admits he did consider quitting when the lockdown was introduced. He told : There were a couple of days when I felt like I really didnapost want to go out, but then as time passed I realised that I should. I was more concerned at the start, it was just a complete shock. It was a shock for everybody. People are so grateful for us to bringing their stuff to them. Itaposs a great feeling, it feels like youaposre contributing to keeping people safe. People used to order for a treat but now theyaposre ordering because they really need stuff and they donapost want to leave their house.  One moment that sticks in his mind is when a customer left him a thank you note and a chocolate bar to thank him for dropping groceries off to her. The note said: Hereaposs a wee treat to get you through the rest of your sht. Robin, who has been a Deliveroo driver for four years and lives with his girlfriend, who is also a key worker, said: Iaposve never been tipped in chocolate before. It was so nice and I really wasnapost expecting it. Itaposs good knowing youaposre helping people.  Robin does everything he can to protect himself and customers while out delivering, like all his Deliveroo colleagues. He uses hand sanitiser before entering and once heaposs left each restaurant, and does the same as he arrives at the customeraposs house. While there have been a lot more orders, the quieter roads have made the actual delivering part of the job much easier. Robin said: Weaposre not seeing as much of the customers, itaposs down from about  per cent to about  per cent. Weaposre leaving the food on the doorstep. But thereaposs still a little bit of contact from a distance. His fellow driver Alex Smith, , delivers in Horsham alongside his university studies.  He knew he wanted to carry on working as soon as he saw how grateful people were, and heaposs made a mini documentary about his time out delivering. He said: I was determined to carry on. I did it for a little bit, and then I saw how important it was to vulnerable people. Being able to help someone is really nice. There are vulnerable people who canapost get food, and being able to deliver to them is important. People are saying thank you for working, it just made me think that someone has got to do it and I want to be the one to do it.  What I like most is how grateful people are. People are really nice when youaposre dropping off. Like Robin, Alex is making sure heaposs doing everything he can to keep customers safe and following all the procedures, but admits he tries not to think about the personal risk. He said: Maybe I am more at risk but I donapost mind, people need to eat.

So, when planning her outfit for the special day Kate made a very thoughtful decision. In order not to steal any of the limelight and ensure all the fashion focus was on Meghan, Kate opted to rewear an old outfit for the day.

The rest of the country may be celebrating the gradual lting of lockdown but those deemed high risk are likely to remain in isolation much longer. But many of our most vulnerable people are finding remarkable ways of coping.A Channel  documentary, Old, Alone and Stuck at Home, tracks the lives of some who show incredible bravery as they tackle the lockdown. Here, a few of them tell how they’re managing in such dficult situations... Desmond Gittens, Grandad Desmond Gittens, , is being looked after during lockdown by daughter Aisha, , in her house in Notting Hill, West London, with granddaughter Malika. He moved there from his flat in Cricklewood, North West London, where some of his close friends in the Afro-Caribbean community contracted the virus and died. He is devastated that he cannot say goodbye to them properly. Desmond : I’m a diabetic, I’ve come out of prostate cancer and I’m being treated for other issues like high blood pressure.My independence is really important to me. I didn’t think the lockdown would last this long – I thought it would be two weeks at the most. But we’re getting on OK. I have a drone and there’s a garden where I can fly it. And we have a treadmill where I do  or  minutes’ morning exercise. I usually do a big morning walk in my neighbourhood, so I’m missing that. In all the time I’ve been here I’ve been out once. I miss my friends. A couple passed away but I couldn’t go to their funerals. And I’m missing the rest of the family. Initially I was being shielded for my age, not my ethnicity. But when you see the statistics about BAME people I realise it’s for both. I’m  and I know full well I’m not here forever. But I’m trying to make sure this virus doesn’t take me. Aisha : When I knew lockdown was imminent I talked to family members and we made the decision it would be betterhe stayed here.I don’t knowhe’d have managed on his own. I’d have been constantly worried. For Dad it’s hard. It’s not just about eating, it’s about getting on a bus, going to get things for a meal. A conversation with the people in the shop. It’s those simple things. But he can’t go out. What’s alarming is the lack of information. We don’t know why dferent sections of the community are more at risk.  These figures are shining a light on the racism and inequalities that exist in this country. Disparities in health, housing, education and employment. Yyvonne and Chris Milne, The couple from Malvern, Worcs, have spent lockdown looking after daughter Clare, , who was one of the first children diagnosed with brain condition Rett Syndrome in . They are anxious about transmission of Covid- and her ability to withstand it. Yvonne founded charity Rett UK and was made an MBE in . Yvonne : We started a week before official isolation because of the limits of the care home to public access. Also, we’re in the vulnerable group, being over . And we’re important to Clare for the future. We’ve battled to keep her alive. Rett Syndrome affects one in , females.It results in profound physical and communication dficulties. They have no speech. And she has abnormal breathing. Clare is in that group who are the most vulnerable. I’m frightened about Clare catching coronavirus. It seems like the focus is only just coming on to social care settings. There has been a lot said about the NHS and that’s quite right. But there are people in care homes who are just being disregarded – in le and in death.Hopefully, ministers will look more closely at what needs to be done. Our daughter is being cared for by people who love her, highly trained people. But they are not paid a good rate for the fantastic job they are doing. Before the virus struck, Clare would come home to us every other weekend and stay two nights. We used to visit. We can’t visit now. But she does come home with us once a week.  We use full PPE. All the time, we are taking temperatures. We feelshe loses contact with us, she will lose her interest in le At the beginning of this we didn’t think she could survive lockdown, physically and mentally.Clare had pneumonia and sepsis last November and was in hospital  days. They didn’t think she would survive. Her lungs were compromised. That makes us worry more about her getting any infection.We want to make sure whatever le she has left is as good quality and as easy as it can be. She likes to do things she has always done. She has a routine. When she’s here it’s similar to being in the home – there are set feeding times. But we can do other things with her here she enjoys. We have a fish pond and she likes that. We sing to her. There are special times. Susie Davies, With serious underlying conditions, Susie, of West London, has had oian and breast cancer and recently received large doses of chemotherapy. She is vulnerable to infection but has found many ways to keep busy.  Susie : I’ve found things perfectly OK. I seem to have a lot to do. I’d already limited my activities because I’m on chemo and my immune systems have fallen so I’m rather susceptible to bugs.I don’t go to any of the cultural things I used to do, like go to galleries, cinema or theatre. I was visiting friends as well but now I’m completely limited. But I do make sure I speak to people every day. I have a nice Zoom group where we set each other tasks every weeks. I want to counter this stereotype of older people and people being shielded in their houses. It is not depression and helplessness and people screaming out of a window. I’m reading and watching boxsets. I’m also sorting out my house. You have to look ahead – although I have no intention of dying. I want to organise my possessions so they have a home. I want mine to go to inidual people so I have been labelling everything. I don’t ever have a dull moment. I miss not being able to go out driving. That’s something I’d love to do but it’s justyou break down or something then you are really in trouble. The only place I really have to go is the hospital. I don’t think my cancer can ever be cured but I’m very lucky. I feel very well. The prognosis is ultimately not good but who knows  It’s not like I’m young and my le is being stolen from me. But I do see it as a kind of cosmic joke that I can’t go out when time is so important. I don’t see this as a battle. I see this as all I can do to help my body. We have real lessons to learn from this lockdown. This is a great opportunity to improve society and right so many wrongs.

I wish them the very best of luck.Itaposs since had more than . million views, leaving people in stitches with the witty remarks and hidden messages during the tour. Sandy, from Kinross, begins the masterpiece in the living room, saying all the furniture would be going with him as the flat comes unfurnished. Panning to the view, he adds: Thereaposs the bins just outside the living room window in the summer. Thataposs lovely when itaposs hot, before warning potential tenants about an ant infestation.  He shows the fireplace which doesnaposy work and some shelves where the boy who put them in must have been drunk when he did it as there is a  degree angle on them. Sandy calls the electric hob and oven complete p*** and films the washer dryer, adding itaposs not really a dryer unless you like your clothes still wet and smelling a bit funny. He adds that he thinks the boy who did the living room did the kitchen as well because he only did f***ing half of it.  A quick tour of the bathroom shows a message on the mirror reading: You will hate it here. He goes on to compare the flataposs uneven flooring to walking around a fun house before heading out to the garden, showing before and after pictures of his renovation job, describing it as a hellhole when he moved in. He informs viewers he plans to take his plants with him when he leaves so the garden will end up looking like the Somme.  Showing the fence situation, he says: Marvel at this feat of engineering, three separate fences, all p***. Sandy finishes up outside with a warning about the plutonium resistant rats and completes the tour in the bedroom, adding: Thereaposs a damp problem here and I told the lady about it but was told to keep the place well ventilated in f***ing January. He then pans to the mirrored wardrobe, showing him to be wearing only a pair of sunglasses, a mask, a black bra and matching underwear.

It hadn’t occurred to me how weird that was until I mentioned it on Twitter and I was immediately inundated with messages from friends and well-wishers. It was lovely, who doesn’t like a reminder that some people don’t wish them dead  But it also made me feel a bit guilty. Loads of people were checking in on me but I’m absolutely fine. I don’t feel worthy of concern because I know that all I’ve had to endure is a minor inconvenience compared to the severe experience so many people will be going through. I’d only tweeted about it jokingly anyway, because I was gagging for a Big Mac from McDonald’s. Still am, by the way. I found out I had to shield on the same day that I found out I had severe asthma. One logically led to the other, but it was news to me. Despite having had a string of chest infections over the last few years which have required strong medication, I didn’t realise I had severe asthma. I realise that sounds monumentally dense. Just so you don’t think I’m a complete moron, I knew I had asthma. I’ve been on inhalers all my le. I didn’t think I was taking them for a laugh. My asthma has rarely stopped me doing anything. In  I ran the London Marathon and until I had those chest infections, it hadn’t stopped me exercising. I’d had asthma attacks as a kid but I was always charging around playing football outside and I would like to use this  to apologise to all those households in Nottingham whose windows and cars were hit by my stray balls. . I presumed severe asthma meant you couldn’t walk a few steps without carting an oxygen tank around. Well, it turns out that due to two items of medication I’m on, I’m classed as having severe asthma. So that means I have to shield. One thing I need to make absolutely clear is this: I know I’m lucky.  I don’t have noisy or aggressive neighbours, I don’t have children to home school, I don’t have mental health issuesand I don’t have a disability - althoughsevere asthma gets me a blue badge, I’m up for it. The radio show and podcasts I hosts can be done from home so I’ve got plenty of work to be getting on with, I live with my girlfriend and I can chat to friends over Zoom. Oh and I’ve got a tonne of booze in. I should’ve mentioned that one first. All the conditions that could make it easier are present, apart from some outdoor space. When you add that all up, staying indoors in those circumstances is definitely a bit weird, but it’s not hell. The hardest part has been there being no football on the telly. If football was on, this could have been the best  weeks of my le. The next best thing after football, as we all know, is politics. No, really, please, don’t walk away. We are living though such a signicant period. Just as every personal experience of this crisis will be recounted for generations to come, every political decision taken will be scrutinised and debated well into the future.  Whatever your assessment of the government’s handling of the crisis so far, one thing that can give us all reassurance is the presence of Keir Starmer. Cynics like to believe that politics shouldn’t be about iniduals, but they tend to support parties led by awful ones. Iniduals can make a huge dference – look at what Starmer has done already. He’s calmly, maturely held the government to account. On top of that, even more impressively, he’s almost made Labour look normal again.That achievement cannot be underestimated. It would be like passing Frankenstein’s monster off as a real person without anyone noticing the stitches and bolts.There are still over two weeks to go until the earliest point that I’ll be allowed out. Which makes me sound like I’m doing time."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle harry celebrate wedding","story":"NewsMeghan Markle and Harry celebrate wedding anniversary after dramatic two yearsMeghan Markle and Prince Harry tied the knot two years ago at St Georges Chapel, Windsor Castle.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle said their vows in St Georgeaposs Chapel, Windsor Castle, on May , .In the two years since they tied the knot in front of the royal family, celebrity guests and a worldwide television audience of millions much has changed. The Queenaposs grandson Harry and former Suits star Meghan welcomed son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor last year. The latest addition to the Royal Family turned one on May . The couple also sparked the Megxit crisis and quit as working royals just one year,  months and  days after their high-profile wedding. Harry and Meghan opened up about their struggles dealing with royal le and the intense media interest, in a television documentary about their Africa tour in the autumn of . The Duke also addressed a long-reported rt between himself and his brother the Duke of Cambridge, saying they were on dferent paths and have good and bad days in their relationship. After a six-week break in Canada, Harry and Meghan issued a bombshell statement in January this year without warning the Queen and the Prince of Wales, saying they wanted to step down as senior royals to be financially independent, while still supporting the monarch.  The Queen held an emergency summit at Sandringham with Harry, the Prince of Wales and William. It was announced a few days later there would be no dual role for the Sussexes, meaning they would have to walk away from the monarchy completely. From March , , Harry and Meghan stopped using their HRH styles and ceased to be senior working royals, in favour of a le of personal and financial freedom. The couple, now living in Los Angeles where they have been in lockdown amid the coronavirus outbreak, are preparing to launch their new charitable organisation Archewell - named after their son.It will replace their now-defunct Sussex Royal brand. Plans to launch the venture have been delayed while the world battles the coronavirus. Former actress Meghan became the first mixed race person in modern history to marry a senior British royal when she walked down the aisle two years ago.  The Sussexesapos ceremony was a romantic, star-studded affair, with the duchess dressed in an elegant, minimalist boat-necked pure white wedding gown by Clare Waight Keller at Givenchy. Her five metre-long veil featured flowers from all Commonwealth countries and was held in place by Queen Maryaposs diamond bandeau tiara, loaned by the Queen. An emotional Harry was captivated by his bride as they met at the altar, telling her: You look amazing. Crowds flocked to see the newlyweds - the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex - who kissed on the West Steps of the chapel.  Guests in the gothic church included George and Amal Clooney, Oprah Winfrey, Idris Elba, Serena Williams, Carey Mulligan, James Blunt and James Corden, and a number of Meghanaposs Suits former co-stars. Dubbed a royal wedding like no other, the nuptials combined British traditions with ersity and modernity. Sounds of a gospel choir filled the venue, with US preacher Bishop Michael Curry delivering a y, impassioned, rousing address on the power of love. Prince George and Princess Charlotte were among the pageboys and bridesmaids, and the Duke of Edinburgh, recovered from a hip operation, put in an appearance.  There was drama in the run-up to the big day, with Meghanaposs father Thomas Markle pulling out of walking her through the Quire to the altar due to illness, and after being caught staging paparazzi photographs. But the Prince of Wales stepped in to perform the symbolic role. Thousands lined the streets of Windsor to watch Harry and Meghan as they went on a carriage procession in the Ascot Landau through the town and the Long Walk in Windsor Great Park.

Ministers have told schools to get ready for reception, year one and six toon June  - but only when all the tests are met as it will be safe to do so. Officials have issued advice to headteachers on ensuring classrooms and playgrounds are as safe as possible with class sizes capped at  pupils and desks kept two metres apart. However teaching unions and the government have locked horns over whether itaposs safe for kids to go back to school on June . Furious union bosses have ordered their members to refuse to engage with the government and have a string of conditions that must be met before theyaposllto their classrooms. Liverpool, Bury, Hartlepool and Gateshead councils have all said they will not be reopening schools on June . Downing Street suggested that a final approval could come as early as this week. A spokesman didnapost challenge claims that the final decision could come this week as next week is half-term He said: You can see from the discussions that have taken place ... that we are working to seek to resolve this as soon as we can. Officials are adamant that nothing will happen before June  while the Government will publish its scientic advice and SAGE minutes on safety in schools as soon as possible.  Union leader Geoff Barton claimed today that the government will make the final decision next Thursday which coincides with the next three-week review into the lockdown. He said: It is also important to understand that the government will only make the final decision on whether to press ahead with the reopening of schools when it reviews the latest science on May , and thatthe evidence does not support this decision at that time, it will be delayed.Yesterday Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the government was aposconfident children and teachers will be safeapos when schools reopen.Speaking on the BBCaposs Andrew Marr show, he said: “The clear scientic and clinical advice is that it is safe to have schools reopen, accompanied with social distancing.  The Governmentaposs roadmap gives no specic date on when a decision will be made on any changed but they will be announced at least  hours in advance.The five tests set out by Boris Johnson must be met before any relaxing of the rules.The Prime Minister said at the weekend that three of those five have now been met with work being done on the other two. Parents have been promised they will not be punishedthey decide not to send their children to school.  Liverpool city council became the first local authority to announced it would not be reopening its schools on June . It said the earliest date for lessons to resume in the classroom will be June  and only year six, the oldest children, would be allowed back. Until then it will continue to allow only the children of key workers and vulnerable pupils to attend school. Hartlepool council and Gateshead council have announced they also plan to delay the reopening of their schools.  Last night policing minister Kit Malthouse hinted that some schools in some areas may reopen depending on their infection rates. He was asked on Radio aposs Westminster Hour last nightthat could lead to dferentrates for schools in dferent parts of the country, is that something that could happen  To which he replied: In theory it could. It’s certainly the reason for us setting up this new bio security centre, as I think was outlined when it was announced, so we can monitor the progress of the virus across the country. Andlocalised action is required, it can be taken,there’s a localised outbreak.

They invited just their aposinner circleapos to the private evening celebrations, which was filled with dancing, booze and personalised touches. But everyone who got one of those very special invitations had to follow a lot of very, very strict rules, which allowed the couple to ensure their celebrations were completely private. As Meghan and Harry mark their second wedding anniversary, weaposve had a look back at all the dos and donaposts of the coupleaposs stunning May wedding. In the lead up to the big day, each guest was sent a seven-page instructions book, explaining exactly what they needed to do and all the things that were banned. When they arrived at the evening reception they had to surrender mobile telephones and any devices used for image capture. Bulky bags were also banned, and guests werenapost allowed to take presents into either the St Georgeaposs Chapel ceremony or the Windsor Castle reception. A dress code was also sent to guests as part of the invitation, asking men to wear either a dress unorm, morning coat or lounge suit, while women had to pick a day dress and a hat.  The guidance pack also included a long list of things people were banned from taking with them, and some of them were a bit odd. Perhaps the strangest prohibited item they felt they needed to list is swords. The reason behind the odd request was that by asking people to wear dress unorm, some may have wonderedthey should include the sword which is part of many of them. The couple also asked people not to wear medals on the big day.

Four men and four women in their s were fined after they pitched tents and lit a fire at ruins near Richmond, North Yorks, where they travelled from their six separate homes in West Yorkshire.  Inspector Mark Gee of North Yorkshire Police said: “Leaving home to camp overnight isn’t allowed. It’s a confusing time but ignorance is no excuse.” Parts of the UK were hotter than Calornia and Malibu yesterday, with highs of .C recorded in the South East. The temperature is expected to rise as high as C today. But thunderstorms and hail will soon end the mini heatwave. Ms Diamond said things will “start to change” on Thursday with storms bringing up to mm rain in three hours triggered by the remnants of ex-tropical storm Arthur off the US coast.

A study of , adults found a third think they chose the wrong GCSEs, with  per cent of university graduates wishing they had studied another subject. Languages, history, economics and IT are among the areas people wish they had more knowledge. But  per cent also believe the world of digital technology moves faster than they can keep up with, leaving them behind. As a result, a quarter would like to master coding,  per cent want to know how to build their own website, and a fth are keen to learn Microsoftaposs Excel programme. And  per cent of those polled have been using the lockdown as an opportunity to research e-learning courses. The study, commissioned by mobile network gfgaff to launch its new online hub aposgfgaff Academyapos, offers a series of online videos teaching digital skills. A spokesperson for gfgaff said: The great thing about humans is, youaposre never too old to learn a new skill or further hone the ones youaposve already got. At the moment weaposve all got a little bit more time on our hands and people are looking for new ways to fill that time. Itaposs the perfect opportunity to try out learning something new. We want to inspire and help people to do new things and to always put community first - this is where our new academy comes in. The gfgaff academy is all about providing snackable, easy online content that people can dip in and out of when they have the time. They donapost need to commit to a new course to learn new skills.  The study also found more than a third of adults believe they didnapost work hard enough in school, and a tenth claim they fell in with aposa bad crowdapos which stopped them maximising their learning potential. One in five felt they werenapost pushed hard enough by their parents, and  per cent said intelligence was seen as a bad thing during their school days. More than one in  have even felt the need to lie about their level of education, according to the OnePoll figures. Of these, four in  fibbed on their CV,  per cent embellished their education to their manager, and a quarter did it to try and impress someone they were flirting with. Despite feeling low about their knowledge gaps, four in  adults feel theyaposd be better at learning now than when they were in education. And one in five have gone back into education as adults, while the same amount have considered it - but never actually got round to re-entering the world of academia. More than one in three would prefer to do adult learning as a remote online course, but  per cent would rather get their pencil case out and learn in a classroom. However, feeling apostoo oldapos is stopping  per cent from going back into formal education. It also emerged four in  parents get most of their technological knowledge from children, despite feeling itaposs something they should already know. While  per cent of adults have tech in their house they donapost really know how to operate, including heating systems, TV boxes and sound systems. gfgaffaposs spokesperson added: Learning isnapost all about memorising Latin phrases in a dusty classroom. Upping your digital skills will help you to get the best out of the technology we use everyday and our academy can help you to do just that. But thereaposs no limit to what you can learn,you have gaps in your knowledge - from gaming to gardening, the world of education is never closed, no matter your age.The gfgaff Academy lessons - which cover skills such as building your own website, coding, starting a blog or setting up your own YouTube channel - can be accessed for free here.

I’ve not had anyone on to me about it all, there’s very little online about this week’s vote – I don’t think anyone really cares now.”Rangers vehemently led the call for a vote on an independent inquiry into the SPFL’s conduct during the coronavirus shutdown, as well as Dundee’s actions in changing their vote.That led to Gers fans bombarding online posts from the club and DSA social media, but Ross believes the reaction from fellow Dundee supporters is telling.He added: “Anytime the DSA are posting stuff on social media, we have to go through and delete loads of stuff.“It’s almost amusing now – Dundee fans responding generally laugh at them. Dundee have been getting hammered but they are not rising to it all and that, I think, shows the general feeling of the support.“It is bizarre because Dundee’s vote hasn’t affected Rangers really – our club has been affected more because there’s now no play-offs.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/5eb2ad98-bdb7-4063-8357-8341d9a5dc43-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/5eb2ad98-bdb7-4063-8357-8341d9a5dc43-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/5eb2ad98-bdb7-4063-8357-8341d9a5dc43-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/5eb2ad98-bdb7-4063-8357-8341d9a5dc43-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"dundee united dundee fc craig conway kyle letheren salford","story":"Dundee United hero Craig Conway and ex-Dundee keeper Kyle Letheren are free agents after leaving Salford City.Letheren, a Championship winner with the Dark Blues in , announced his departure from the high-profile League Two side co-owned by Manchester United’s Class of  legends including David Beckham, Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes on Twitter.He wrote: “I’d like to wish Salford City FC all the best for the future.

newest scheme up and running.Rainbow Rogues in Ellon is in the process of launching an Additional Support Needs Equipment Library, which will allow families of preschool children with additional  needs or disabilities to sample specialist equipment and sensory toys with their child before purchasing.The aim of the library is to reduce the amount of money that parents unnecessarily spend on items that are not suitable for their child#s development. However, the group require donations to begin operating the service.Rainbow Rogues manager, Jude Scofield, said: “When I joined the group as manager a year ago, this was one of the ideas I initially had.“I wanted to provide an additional service which was not just for the benefit of the families that attend Rainbow Rogues, but for families from across the north-east who have a child with additional support needs.”The scheme has been worked on over the last six of months. However, the Covid- pandemic has delayed it from launching.Jude added: “We are relying on grants and donations.

I don’t think it would have sat on the site very well.”The plans the architect submitted next became the beautul, soaring, granite-built His Majesty’s with its signature copper-dome.It is now one of Britain’s treasured “Matcham theatres” standing alongside the London Palladium, the Hackney Empire, and the Glasgow King’s. And let’s not forget the Granite City’s own Tivoli Theatre, which, while not built by Matcham, was re-modelled by the London-based architect.Matcham was the “go-to” architect for theatres at the turn of the century, which was why he was commissioned to build HMT by Robert Arthur, a theatre impresario who decided Aberdeen needed a bigger and better venue as the s dawned.It#s on a clf thatHowever, Matcham had his work cut out for him in building His Majesty’s from scratch on a site that at first glance is the last place you would put a theatre.“It’s on a clf that just goes all the way down from the viaduct,” said Alan.“His main problem was how was he going to fit a theatre into that dficult site.“It was a fair undertaking as to how he could actually do it,” said Alan, adding part of the solution was to have the theatre stage two floors below ground level, unique at the time.“But he was renowned for fitting theatres into all sorts or shapes and sizes.”When HMT opened in , at a cost of £, but delayed by four years due to a shortage of Kemnay granite, it was a stunning addition to the cityscape – and one proudly built by local craftsmen.“That is one thing to stress, that most of the work was done by local artisans from the actual building of it to the interiors including the plasterwork,” said Alan.It was the distance from Matcham’s London-based operation which compelled him to use the Granite City’s home-grown talent.The interior of His Majesty’s was equally attractive as the exterior, a symphony of Italian marble, polished mahogany, and elegant plaster decorations, with rich velvet drapes and seating against an off-white colour scheme.A frieze of the “the Goddesses Of Drama” ran across the top of the proscenium arch and was created by William Buchan of Belmont Street. He also sculpted the statues of Tragedy and Comedy sitting above the boxes.Alan said the style could be described as “as sedate Georgian with a touch of Baroque” from a designer, whose other theatre designs have included themes like giving an auditorium a circus feel, with elephants above the boxes, or a Roman look with chariots around the walls.“His Majesty’s has a lovely, restrained auditorium from Matcham. There’s just enough glamour and splendour to make it look good,” said Alan.It has a“One thing Matcham was good at was sightlines in auditoriums.#He used fairly new cantilever technology.#Theatres of that period usually had pillars all over the place, but he managed to introduce a patented system to hold up the dress circle, upper circle and balcony above which gave excellent sightlines.#No matter where you are in the theatre, you can see to the back of the stage.#The challenges of the site made for some unique feature at His Majesty’s – not least that it has a river running underneath it.“The Denburn was one of the problems he had to overcome and still runs underneath the corner at the back of the theatre,” said Alan, adding this quirk had been forgotten for many years until work on a new fly tower in the s uncovered a culvert carrying the burn.“So they had to put a new bridge in over the Denburn.#You can sometimes hear it on a quiet day after a lot of rain in the corner of the theatre I inhabit.”When it opened in , HMT had a unique feature. The dress circle, where the wealthy and beautul people of Aberdeen sat, was at street level. This meant the upper crust of the day could sweep out of their carriages at the front door and straight into their plush seats without having to climb any stairs.Alan said: “There are pictures knocking around of people in their carriages being met at the front door by the doorman and pageboys, then escorted in. The carriages then used to go and park up roughly where Victoria Park is now and the little page boys would be sent up there to get them all back in time to pick up the posh clientele.”The hoi polloi, though, were not quite so well-catered for. The cheap seats in the balcony had their own entrance and things were a little less refined for the working folk.“Back in Matcham’s day the classes were certainly kept very much apart, so he managed to introduce separate entrances at the front,# said Alan.#The posh folk went through the main door and the balcony entrance was further apart.#You tramped all the way up a concrete stairway to get to the very top.You were literally“Up in the balcony there were benches, you found yourself a space with your family and you were literally pushed up with a brush-like contraption to fit more people into the building. You basically sat there and lent on the knees of the person behind you… and then smoked. It must have been fairly horrendous up there.”The separation of the rough and smooth in Aberdeen society continued in the stalls where a wooden fence kept the workers in their place at the rear of the auditorium away from all the finery of the “orchestra stalls”.Another quirky aspect of His Majesty’s is that the steep drop from the viaduct meant that the stage is above street level.Matcham got round this by installing a lt to hoist scenery and props to the backstage area for the get-in of productions.Alan said: “Scenery arriving at the Joint Station would be taken up to the theatre on handcarts and then loaded onto the lt and hand-winched up to the stage level.#It would have taken some time in those days to get things up and down. I think that’s unique in British theatre.”Strange noises andIt was a highly dangerous contraption, which led to His Majesty’s having its own ghost, Jake.In  a circus was performing at the theatre and horses were being hoisted up to the stage door, but was overloaded.John “Jake” Murray leaned over to apply the brake but was decapitated by the spinning winch-handle. Soon after strange noises and odd sightings troubled the theatre – and still do, according to some.Alan’s personal favourite aspect of Matcham’s theatre is the view from the stage.He said: “You just think ‘this is really lovely and quite magnicent’.#When we have companies come into the theatre stand on the stage the first thing they usually say is ‘isn’t this gorgeous, we weren’t expecting anything as lovely and pristine as this’.We are“Despite all the changes over the years, the original concept by Frank Matcham has remained intact. It stands as an architectural gem and an important contributor to Aberdeen’s cultural heritage.“We are lucky to have it.”Frank Matcham’s other gt to Aberdeen was the Tivoli.The Guild Street theatre was actually the city’s original Her Majesty’s, before the Rosemount Viaduct building was commissioned to create a bigger venue.Mark Fox, chairman of The Frank Matcham Society, explained the architect worked his magic on the Tivoli twice, breathing new le into a building which was built in  by architect CJ Phipps.“The Tivoli was a major reconstruction on Matcham’s part and he visited twice – having in between those two reconstructions built His Majesty’s entirely,# said Mark.#Aberdeen was obviously an important place to him.“In , Matcham went in and did some alterations to theauditorium. It was a major rebuild in , increasing the capacity and changing exits and allowing boxes, to create a greater intimacy in the auditorium. It operated as a music hall then.”Mark believes Aberdeen is very fortunate to have not one, but two Matchams to its credit.“They are both prime examples of his master#s art. The Frank Matcham Society had a trip up in  so I have seen them both and they are such pretty interiors. There’s the Romanesque finish of His Majesty’s compared to that very delicate cake icing, Baroque, Tivoli auditorium.”Today Matcham theatres around the country are treasured – each one distinctive in architectural style and tone # although they weren’t built to last.“When the buildings went up, because they were very commercial ventures, they were seen as ephemeral buildings,” said Mark.“If a building didn’t work, the developer would think nothing of knocking it down and doing something . If it did work, the chances are they would knock it down to build something bigger so they could make even more money.”London-based Matcham was a prolic architect, creating some  theatres and re-modelling a further . Today only  survive, along with HMT and the Tivoli.Mark said: “We have to put our hands out and say very much thank you to bingo.#Becausebingo hadn’t take over the Tivoli, it probably wouldn’t have survived. Then it had all those years, from  when it still stood empty,” he said praising today’s work to re-open it and build it up.Those Matchams which still stand are loved for a reason, said Mark.“He knew what he was doing. He was being appointed by commercial operators to create these spaces to make money, but he understood they would only workthey pleased everybody involved.“He had an understanding of what the performer needed, so the acoustics in all the venues are very good, so performers love them. And the designs always ended up with a level of intimacy between the stage and the audience that no other architect has managed. He made sure every seat in the house had a good view of the stage.“His buildings have a magic about them. You don’t need to be a theatre lover to go into one of Matcham’s buildings and appreciate what he created. If you ask anyone what their image of a theatre is, eventhey have never been in one, they will describe a Matcham theatre.”His Majesty’s is one of the stars in Frank Matcham’s legacy for British theatre.And over its long history, HMT has attracted countless stars of stage and screen – including those who can justiable be called Hollywood legends.Vivien Leigh, of Gone With The Wind fame, starred in a production of Bernard Shaw’s The Doctor’s Dilemma in , while Tyrone Power starred in the same writer’s the Devil’s Disciple in , billed in the Evening Express advert as “a personal visit of the famous American star”.One of the biggest Hollywood hitters was Charlton Heston, who arrived at His Majesty’s in  to star in A Man For All Seasons.Sean Connery also graced the stage – in the chorus of the musical South Pacic in both  an  before he picked up his licence to kill as .Other well-known faces to have peformed at the theatre over the years include, Alec Guinness, Noel Coward, Eric Sykes, Sade, Lulu, Rowan Atkinson, Andy Stewart and Billy Connolly, to name but a handful.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/5e916d13c3d6f5.35188939-scaled.jpg ","title":"mcinally sceptical on regional hub viability","story":"Peterhead manager Jim McInally sees the merit in regional hub stadiums, but believes it will be hard to make it happen.Scottish football’s joint response group announced last week they had discussed the possibility of hub stadiums hosting multiple games over a weekend with fans able to attend while observing social distancing measures.In the north-east Pittodrie would be the natural choice as a hub.Blue Toon boss McInally, who is Scotland’s longest-serving manager, said: “It’s a good idea, but is there any chance of it happening “At the end of the day would the proposal be that Peterhead would be playing at Pittodrie  Aberdeen don’t let their reserves play at Pittodrie, so what chance have the likes of ourselves, Cove, Elgin and potentially Inverness and Ross County got of playing at Pittodrie “I felt it was a decent idea because it would allow fans to go to football.“We have an average crowd of about  for games at Balmoor, butwe played at Pittodrie we’d probably have roughly  there.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

have been tested and could be opened immediately to host tourists, Friedrich Joussen, TUI Group CEO said.Several other European holiday spots could also be among the list of destinations, including Greece, Cyprus, Croatia and Bulgaria, all of which Joussen described as ldquowell prepared for summer tourism.Austria and Denmark were named as possible destinations as well, being among a number of EU countries that are starting to reopen their borders.However, the roll out of flights to Europe will have to be done gradually, and in line with both government guidance on travel and the lting of EU borders.Holidays to Europe are also likely to be hindered by the  day quarantine period being enforced by many countries, with tourists faced with spending two weeks in quarantine in Spain before being able to start their holiday.In contrast, visits to France and Ireland will be unhindered by such rules.How will TUI make its hotels safe The package holiday specialist has outlined a ten-point plan, detailing how hotels will operate after lockdown is lted.Plans include restrictions on its popular self-service buffets, which are due to be reduced to a minimum.Instead, food and beverages will be served to guests by staff wearing protective masks, where possible.The measures will be implemented across all of the companyrsquos own-brand hotels, and will also be made ldquoavailable to joint-venture and partner hotels.Guests will face limits on their range of entertainment and activities, with football tournaments set to be banned.Only events, sports and entertainment that involve a small number of participants, and without close contact, will be made available.Other measures include online check-ins, maintaining social distancing in public areas, such as gyms and corridors, and reduced capacity in restaurants, with longer opening hours to spread guest usage.There will also be an increase in disinfectant dispensers throughout TUIrsquos hotels, and ldquoextensive new cleaning practices will be implemented for rooms.TUI said that its new  point plan is in addition to statutory regulations, which will be put in place at all of the holiday destinations where it operates.The

Their first request had been to buy a large toy car theyrsquod seen in some YouTube video, filmed by a wealthy family.You can picture the discussion after that. But thatrsquos when the alternative idea came to me.ldquoWell we could make a bogey cart, I said.Laughter at that expression followed of course, but I was sure I had the name right.It was from my childhood, so I Googled it and showed them what I meant, and they immediately agreed.Then I thought ldquowhat have I done  as I had no idea how to make one!I do have vague recollections of making semi-lethal bogey carts when I was wee using wheels from discarded prams and boxes or planks of wood. I still have a scar on my right knee from a bogey crash.If I could do it in my childhood, surely I could build one now I reasoned. Irsquom not very skilled at these things, but maybe thatrsquos because I havenrsquot tried.Besides, I had the expectations of my children to meet, and so I took on the challenge.It seemed to be a good lockdown activity. The first problem was the lack of materials. I recall a fish box was the best to use, and sturdy pram wheels but, during the lockdown especially, these items are not so easy to acquire.A friend kindly gave me a pallet, and I searched YouTube for advice. My heart began to sink.The videos were all made by people with workshops, tools and carpentry skills I lack. Their fancy-looking perfectly made carts just raised my childrenrsquos hopes.ldquoYea dad, one like that.I could feel my manhood was at stake.My daughter looked at me sympathetically and said: ldquoI know yoursquore busy with other things as well dad.So she gave me a generous five days to construct it.I managed to scavenge some wheels from a toy pram, helped again by a friend, and stood looking at the raw materials, trying to make a design in my imagination.I knew what a bogey cart was supposed to look like, but how to make something with the materials I had seemed a huge challenge.I set to work. I sawed and hammered, and made a good impression of looking like I knew what I was doing.But design challenges, in particular how to fit the wheels I had, which were on a frame, meant that the concept needed refined, and reduced in size.My daughter watched as I stood looking confused then determined then confused again.ldquoI overheard her asking her mum, lsquodo you think dad knows what he is doing rsquoSo I enlisted my childrenrsquos help, sawing and hammering together. At least this way we could all share in the glory, or shame, of the final product!At the time of writing I still have three days left to complete the task. In two days I have managed to make what I have euphemistically called ldquoa prototype a completely new concept in home-made go carts.It looks unsafe just now, but I must emphasise it is unfinished but the basic idea is there. I just hope BMW donrsquot steal the concept!The kids have named it the ldquobug, because itrsquos so small, and, well, looks like a bug!ldquoItrsquos a new kind of cart, a bug-cart! proclaimed my boy.I have three days to find a way to make this bug ldquofly safely.The lockdown is taking its toll on many families but the extra time it is giving some of us with family is one of the benefits. Finding creative activities to do during this time isnrsquot always easy.My kids have become hooked on screen activities which normally wersquod restrict. But these are not normal times, and I think parents need to give ourselves some slack and not worry too much. But there is a sense that this time has grounded many of us in simple meaning.Many of us are sharing skills, like baking, cooking, making things, learning activities, which before we often had little time to do together. But also rediscovering lost skills, or learning new ones by necessity, and making do with what we have like starting off making a bogie cart and ending with a ldquobug.The truth is, of course, itrsquos the quality of the time spent together as much as the quality of the final product that is important. Well, that will certainly be my story when the final version is unveiled!Itrsquos such a time of contradictory emotions I long for the end of the lockdown and the separation from other loved ones, and the loss and anxiety it means.But having this time to fill with meaning also feels like a huge privilege a kind of bittersweet liberation of my time.I have guilt about this, and like others, Irsquom trying to help out to compensate.But let us never forget that this time, and our safety, is made possible by the essential workers who are hard at work, keeping society going at such a dangerous time, and saving lives.Their skills and contributions have so often been taken for granted and unacknowledged.It has brought into sharp focus the  notion that low pay equates with ldquolow skilled work.The reality is that many who are low paid are, in fact, highly skilled and, as we are discovering, the most essential workers.I hope one of the legacies of this time will be a real recognition of the vital skills of many low paid workers, by valuing their work, both with status and proper pay.Letrsquos build statues to essential workers, instead of politicians and generals, and express gratitude for their contribution.And commit to being part of the change afterwards that will make this happen.Such were my thoughts as I assembled the ldquobug ndash my makesht haphazard invention of our lockdown time. I hope I will complete it by the deadline.In my area of East Lothian there is a community Facebook page where we can share our stories from this historic period.The ldquobug will be part of my contribution.We will all have our dferent lockdown legacies and stories to remember and record for posterity.

Railways were new and fast. A railway, they believed, could have brought prosperity to desperately poor crofters and cotters, opened up the Isle of Lewis to new trade, and helped extinguish troublesome land raids and civil disobedience which had become an all too familiar element of island le.Branching off the Dingwall-to-Skye line slightly east of Garve station, the proposed track would have powered steam trains upland, following the road past the Black Water river, through the Glascarnoch glen and rising to ft towards Braemore Lodge and the estate owned by Fowler, already celebrated as one of Britainrsquos most acclaimed engineers.If the scenery didnrsquot take the breath away from railway passengers, surely the prospect of a steep descent towards the head of Loch Broom would have.Or, the engineersrsquo preferred option, a tunnel carved through the hillside which would bring them, blinking, into glorious sight of the mouth of the River Broom sprawling before them.:Scotlandrsquos  best train journeysOnce in Ullapool, rail travellers would simply have stepped from their carriages at a terminus built at the junction of the townrsquos Shore Street and Quay Street, mere steps away from the ferry to the Isle of Lewis, and potentially one of the most magnicent settings imaginable for a railway station.However, as a forthcoming book written by Andrew Drummond, the best-laid plans of even one of the nationrsquos most celebrated engineers was set to go horribly wrong.And a combination of competition, lack of funds, ided communities and a frustrating lack of support from Westminster would eventually see plans stop, start, run out of steam and then hit the buffers for good.ldquoIt was all a bit of guddle, says Drummond, whose book, A Quite Impossible Proposal: How Not To Build A Railway, will be published this year.ldquoThere were a lot of shenanigans between government, promoters, the Highland Railway Company and other people sticking their oar in.ldquoThere was the extraordinary attitude of civil servants in London, who were very dismissive of the whole thing.ldquoIn fact, the title of the book ndash A Quite Impossible Proposal ndash was one of the comments made by one of the chaps in London.The Ullapool-to-Garve railway proposal was the first of what would eventually become half a dozen railway schemes touted for the area during a boom time in Victorian engineering which unlocked areas of Britain which previously would have taken hours of discomfort by carriages and carts to reach.While the prospect of a train to Ullapool might have tourists today regretting decisions of the past, its vision was not built around their needs, but in herring, crofting and poverty.ldquoThe scheme for the Garve-to-Ullapool railway goes back at least  years before it was given Royal Assent in August , he says.ldquoThe crofters and fishermen of Lewis and Skye had been in revolt. Crofters were invading land, taking it back for themselves and the government was sending troops in to sort it out.ldquoIn the early s, the government had become a bit anxious and the Napier Commission was tasked with looking into the social and economic problems around crofting and fishing.Centred on Stornoway, the fishing industryrsquos biggest problem was getting freshly-caught herring to markets in London, Liverpool and Manchester.The idea of switching from steamers to steam trains captured the imagination of Sir John Fowler. Yorkshire-born, he was one of those Victorian masterminds who appeared capable of just about anything.As chief engineer of the politan Railway in London, he created the worldrsquos first underground railway and laid the foundations for routes which today form most of the London Undergroundrsquos Circle Line. In , he was paid handsomely: the equivalent of almost pound million in todayrsquos money, leading to comments that ldquono engineer in the world was so highly paid.The money helped him to buy the sprawling ,-acres Braemore and Inverbroom estate near Ullapool, where, as well as the suspension bridge across Corrieshalloch Gorge, he put his engineering skills to work building Braemore House on a mountainside ft above sea level, from blue-coloured stone retrieved from a nearby quarry.Surelyanyone could oversee the construction of  miles of railway track from Garve to Ullapool it had to be him ldquoThe line from Garve to Ullapool would have had three sections. The first, Garve to Braemore, would have been very straightforward, adds Drummond.ldquoBut at Braemore, therersquos this steep descent to sea level before the final stretch to Ullapool, again fairly straightforward.ldquoThe tricky part was going down the hill.ldquoThere were all manner of exciting ideas involving both the north and south sides of the valley, but both were steep.ldquoThe southside would have used tunnels and viaducts. It would have been a bit like a helter skelter, butI have confidence in anything it would be confidence in Victorian engineers to do anything they wanted.While some huffed and puffed over the challenges of creating the line, others questioned the suitability of Ullapool as a harbour for the ships arriving to transport countless tonnes of herring.ldquoOne inquirysaid Ullapool was beset by rocks and reefs so ships could not possibly get in there, which clearly isnrsquot the case.ldquoBut the really dficult thing wasnrsquot so much the engineering, it was getting the money together and the government did not want to help.Despite ious commissions and committees to probe ways to improve the fortunes of poverty-stricken island and Highland communities, few positive suggestions were taken up and even fewer received funding.If they wanted to push ahead, the proposers of the Ullapool rail link faced funding the pound, project themselves ndash around poundm in todayrsquos money ndash or finding an established railway business willing to take it on.ldquoThe Highland Railway Company virtually had a monopoly in the north and west of Inverness, and they were not keen on competition, adds Drummond.ldquoThey wanted to extend their line from Dingwall to Stromeferry, on to Kyle of Lochalsh. They didnrsquot want any other lines going to the west coast.Yet common sense and geography should have made the Ullapool route the more attractive. ldquoStornoway to Ullapool is  miles at most, but Stornoway to Kyle of Lochalsh is closer to  miles, says Drummond.If financial support was proving challenging, so too was getting everyone on board the Ullapool express.Some simply preferred the Kyle of Lochalsh option, others argued that shting herring stocks made it dficult to predict the best locations for a rail link.ldquoLewis was practically riven down the middle, adds Drummond.Meanwhile, angry letters were exchanged in newspapers from both sides arguing for and against.ldquoThe Act of Parliament of  had a clause thatwork wasnrsquot undertaken within three years, it would be null and void, says Drummond.While the Ullapool backers fumed, the Highland Railway Company pressed ahead with its Kyle of Lochalsh extension. The -mile section of railway took three years to build and opened in  ndash due to the challenging landscape, it did receive government support.ldquoThat was the galling thing. Someone  got some money but the engineering dficulties were just as bad, explains Drummond.Determined not to be beaten, the proposers of the Garve-to-Ullapool railway carried on. There were further attempts to achieve their dream in , ,  and . Of course, none were successful, leaving the question: what might have been ldquoThe railway would have brought not just fishing trade through Ullapool but all the stuff that hangs off that, says Drummond. ldquoThere was the potential for people travelling to and from work, the provision of education, and medical facilities might have been so much better.ldquoAnd, of course, opening up the railway would open up tourism earlier.Dr Iain Robertson of the Centre for History at the University of the Highlands and Islands, agrees the railway could have brought a long-lasting positive impact.ldquoIt would have been a real tourist asset, he says.ldquoJust as therersquos the Glenfinnan Viaduct that has become a huge attraction, the line towards the head of Loch Broom would have been really spectacular.ldquoYou can certainly imagine a steam train rumbling through the glens on its way to Ullapool.Parallels between opposition and debate over the Ullapool line might well be drawn with todayrsquos controversial HS high-speed link between London and the north, he adds.ldquoThe Garve-to-Ullapool line was very, very isive ndash itrsquos a theme that runs through big railway developments wherever you find them. In this case you have a strong crofting culture, the area is allied to the Free Church, and there may be opposition to any attempt to modernise and change.ldquoHerring shoals can come and go without any warning. And basing your economics on an unpredictable species like herring would have been risky.Drummond, meanwhile, believes Ullapool, with its scattering of whitewashed buildings at the end of a long, twisting road, could today easily have been reaping the benefits of a rail link and still retained its charm.Andother railway proposals to open up sections of Lewis and Skye had also materialised, road congestion from too many tourists would certainly not have posed the same issues as they do today.ldquoThe rail extension to Kyle of Lochalsh didnrsquot cause Mallaig to suffer, adds Drummond.ldquoYou can only wonder at what dference a railway to Ullapool might have made.A Quite Impossible Proposal: How Not To Build A Railway by Andrew Drummond will be published in September by Birlinn.What might have been: the lines that were never builtA spate of railway proposals emerged at around the same time which would have transformed the northwest corner of Scotland.Others would have created rail links between communities now booming thanks to the North Coast  road route.One suggested a rail link between Achnasheen in Ross-shire and Aultbea on the shores of Loch Ewe while another proposed a connection on the Far North Line between Lairg in Sutherland with Laxford.A further plan was lodged for a link between Culrain and Lochinver.Meanwhile, the Hebridean Light Railway Company had plans for Skye and Lewis, with routes that would have transformed island le and tourism.It suggested a line in Skye would have connected the port of Isleornsay with ferries at Mallaig, and another at the port of Uig on the northwest to link with ferries to Stornoway.Another line was proposed between Stornoway and Carloway on Lewis, with branch lines at Breasclete and Dunvegan.None, however, would be built.The only one proposed was an extension of the West Highland Line from Banavie near Fort William to Mallaig. This was recently voted the greatest rail journey in the world and includes the iconic Glenfinnan Viaduct which featured in the Harry Potter movies."},{"url":null,"title":"jura-red-wine-cask-finish-review","story":"% ABVRRP pound for a one-litre bottleTHE Isle of Jura ndash a remote, almost desolate place, sat between the mainland and that whisky Shangri-La, Islay.The population is tiny ndash barely  ndash and therersquos only one road of any note.George Orwell lived there, and completed Nineteen Eighty-Four there.

As I shovel, I am kept company by the old male pheasant that flits between our garden and those on either side, leaving gleaming feathers in the shrubbery, and shrieking like a klaxon, lest any of us ignore him. He has a limp, which might be the result of a run-in with the fox that snatched his partner. Certainly, he seems to enjoy company, as he struts among bluebells and tulips, before ducking under the chicken wire into the field, to view the newly arrived and still timid flock of sheep.The tools Irsquom using would have been familiar to the first settlers: a spade, fork, hand fork and trowel. Therersquos nothing mechanical in our shed. This is not for idealistic reasons but because, as absolute beginners, we are more neanderthal than digital. Only when we have some idea of what wersquore doing will it be safe to let high-powered tools loose around the place.Thanks to lockdown, parts of the back garden have been gone over more minutely than the dig at Pompeii. Every quarter of an hour I tip out another bucket of stones on to the cairn behind the woodshed. What began as a pimple is now half way to Ben Nevis. Some of the stones can be classied as boulders, which is where Alan comes in.I never thought of myself as having anything in common with Robert Burns, but discovering the ratio of stone to soil on your patch makes you realise what he and his brother had to contend with on Mossgiel farm, which was famously rocky and unyielding. As Irsquove worked over the earth, square foot at a time, the ground level has been gradually dropping, so that soon wersquoll have a sunken garden.Digging is good for letting the mind roam, but it leaves little energy for anything . While you can see how Burns might compose poetry during his rural drudgery, it is obvious why Seamus Heaney did not follow his family on to the farm. Among his most famous poems, and one of my favourites, is Digging, where he recalls watching his late father in the potato drills ndash ldquoBy God, the old man could handle a spade. The loss he still felt is palpable. Yet while he chose not to till the earth, like his brothers, he would instead use his pen as a spade, digging up ideas and his countryrsquos past.One of our neighbours spent years clearing their garden of rocks and detritus, more of which would surface whenever it rained. Among the tell-tale trophies they unearthed was a childrsquos school slate. I remember the weekend when I was a young girl when my father, digging, came upon a curved brick, and then another, eventually revealing a neat circle above the village spring, that had been filled in long ago. ldquoWell, well, well, he said. I still hope for such a find, but perhaps wersquove not been delving deep enough. All that has come to light so far has been fragments of china and pottery.The other evening, though, something interesting did turn up. I thought it was just a small animal bone but, after tossing it aside, retrieved it for a second look. Brushing off the earth, I found a hollowed-out flattish tube, with a pinhole opening at one end, stamped with neat letters. It was the stem of a clay pipe, the sort Silas Marner would have clamped between his teeth. Later, I found out it was from the Victorian pipe-making firm of William Christie, which operated in the Calton in Glasgow, from . A few years ago, the remains of the factory were excavated, including the kiln in which this pipe was very likely fired. Given that Christiersquos produced around , pipes a week, many of us probably have one under our feet.Irsquove always been fascinated by the things produced by metal detectorists or those with inquisitive dogs. Last week, I told Alan about the discovery of a ,-year-old Parthian warrior in Iran, whose teeth were in such good condition that a dentist who examined the skeleton said they were like implants. Alan was unimpressed, saying the real story was that theyrsquod been able to get hold of a dentist who, these days, are as rare as hensrsquo teeth.The clipping, mowing and shearing in Hoolet seems set to continue. While we all grow thatch, no weed or wild grass is allowed to rear its head. Only the village green has been letting the side down, turning into a meadow where the tip of squirrelsrsquo tails give away their position. Last weekend, a socially distanced posse resembling the Magnicent Seven set to work after a couple of hours of mowing, strimming, grass-gathering and edging, the green now looks fit for a game of bowls.Usually this is the councilrsquos job, a man with a sit-on mower and face mask whirling around the trees asdoing a cycling proficiency test. This year, however, an email sent to the council, asking when we could expect a mower, was met with a swt and polite reply.

Some % said they had been kept up to date with the latest news and developments.It comes as the Princes Trust called on government, businesses and charities to come together to prevent a youth jobs crisis and to ensure a generation doesnrsquot lose hope.Their research conducted during lockdown found over a quarterof  to -year olds in Scotland say their future career prospects have already been damaged and  per cent say it will be harder than ever to get a job.Last week, Richard Lochhead, the minister for further education, higher education and science in a message circulated to university and college students last week that there would be \"fair assessment\" principal.\"I recognise this will be an uncertain and dficult time for you all and I understand there has been a lot of concern about your exams and outstanding course work,\" he said.\"I have had the opportunity in recent weeks to discuss with Colleges Scotland, Universities Scotland and the National Union of Studentshow qualications will be assessed in a fair way, based on internal assessments and graded units where possible. Across both sectors it is clear that the approach is underpinned by three important principles: fairness to all learners, safe and secure assessment whilst ensuring current public health advice is followed, and maintaining the integrity and credibility of our qualications. We must ensure that these standards are maintained over time, in the interests of learners.\"For university students, each university has adapted its approach to assessment in light of the pandemic, and has sought to reassure students that a principle of fairness will be applied across the board.\"NUS Scotland president Liam McCabe said: \"Students are facing unprecedented disruption to their studies as a result of the lockdown, with our research showing that seven in ten students are concerned about the effect of Covid- on their final qualication.\"We welcome the statement from the Minister for Further Education, Higher Education and Science committing to fair assessment and expect all institutions to ensure students are treated fairly. NUS Scotland believes institutions should adopt a no-detriment approach to assessment, so no student is academically disadvantaged as a result of this pandemic.\"The newly released NUS Scotland survey of over  students between March  and April  covering a range of responses to the coronavirus crisis found that seven in ten students wanted further information or guidance from governments about how their course or degree will be graded or awarded and two in three said they needed more clarity over how this years work will be assessed.Some % were extremely or very concerned over the impact of coronavirus on their exams while a further % were concerned.Two in three either disagreed, strongly disagreed or were neutral about whether their institution was managing the crisis well.Nearly  signed a petition over the past month calling for the University of the West of Scotland to implement a a no-detriment policy for end of year exams due the Covid- outbreak.It said: \"This means that any work submitted towards their final grade will only improve it and not bring down degree classications due to circumstances that are out-with our control.\"During this time it is unreasonable for the university to expect students to carry on as normal and risk the current situation impact four years or hard work. We want to work with the university to ensure that exam are implemented fairly and that no student is disadvantaged.\"UWS has since put out a statement saying that it \"seeks to ensure no detriment\" due to the pandemic whilst \"maintaining the integrity of their higher education journey\".Some students have continued to questioned whether this is no-detriment, saying they are losing out.The university was asked whether their policy ensures that all students affected will automatically have their degree grade frozen, meaning they can only improve on it - but did not directly respond, preferring to direct a prepared statement.Terri Henderson, a fourth year Honours events management student at UWS raised concerns about the university policy with the institutions management saying she felt there had been no progression on implementing the policy from the university other than an email saying that the university was aware that students were anxious and that the they were working on a fair approach.She was concerned that the university were using the \"no-detriment\" in its statement - but in reality did not have a policy that any new work submitted could only raise the degree classication and would not bring it down.\"I am angry about it. I have sent multiple emails and getting no thing back.\"They say no-detriment but it is not no-detriment, as is not standardised with the rest of the educational institutions.\"I was at my grandmothers funeral today , horrible, and I was still being expected to submit work that is going to go to my degree last week, while dealing with all this.\"Glasgow universities managed to bring out their no detriment policies between March  and April  - ours was not released till April .\"Some students are not passing through no fault of their own. Grades absolutely are being affected.\"The NUS Scotland analysis revealed that three in four students had a vocation element to their course, and of those, three quarters believed the Covid- outbreak would have a negative impact on that element of their studies.And of those who received learning support from their institution, just over half feel they have received adequate support to enable them to continue their work to the best of their ability throughout the Covid- pandemic.The analysis also revealed financial concerns during the pandemic.Four in five students were concerned about their ability to manage financially during the Covid- outbreak while one in four were \"very\" or \"extremely\" concerned. Three in four were concerned to some extent about their ability to pay their bills.Two in five have cut back on food spending to make ends meet.Three in five felt that the UK government had adequately considered the dficulties students faces as a result of the crisis while almost half agreed the Scottish Government were acting in their best interests.A Universities Scotland said spokesman said: ldquoIn recent weeks principals have been in close touch with NUS Scotland and their own student associations to understand studentsrsquo worries about the pandemicrsquos impact on end of year assessment.\"Wersquore in agreement that a principle of fairness for students should underpin all decisions universities take when adapting academic regulations around assessment because of coronavirus.\"Universities will each set their own policy on assessment, as was the case before the pandemic, and they are also mindful of the need for academic thresholds and the integrity of the qualications they offer, but students should be reassured that fairness will apply across the board. The best advice is for students to check the policy at their institution.A UWS spokesman said: ldquoWe are committed to ensuring a fair and reasonable approach to assessment, progression and degree classication for all students, and take a compassionate approach to the current circumstances caused by the Covid- pandemic. Our priority remains to support students and seek to ensure no detriment due to the pandemic whilst maintaining the integrity of their higher education journey.Meanwhile in response to the the Princes Trust and YouGov report, Young People in Lockdown Kate Still, director of The Princersquos Trust in Scotland said: ldquoThis paints a truly stark picture of how the coronavirus crisis is impacting young people. An alarming proportion of young people are feeling increased levels of anxiety, and fears are building about their future.ldquoWe cannot allow this crisis to cripple the aspirations and prospects of our nationrsquos young people. The Princersquos Trust is here to help young people through this challenging time, and government, employers and charities need to work together to stop the economic effects of this pandemic from spiralling out of control.Tony Wilson, institute director at the Institute for Employment Studies added: ldquoThese figures should be a wake-up call for all of us. Therersquos clear evidence that being unemployed when yoursquore young can lead to lasting damage to mental health, income and employment prospects, and itrsquos very likely that youth unemployment is already higher than it was in the depths of the last recession. Added to this, up to half a million young people will be leaving education this summer into the toughest jobs market in our letimes.

Allowing women to access the contraceptive pill through this service would provide a great relief for many, while at the same time relieving pressure on frontline GP services.ldquoThere is particular concern that many women are more vulnerable to domestic abuse, including coercive control, as the lockdown period continues and access to contraception must be part of the support made available for those who need it, when they need it.Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie Rennie said the Scottish Government needed to restart non-urgent healthcare treatment put on hold by the pandemic.He said First Minister should ldquoprioritise those suffering most at home, in isolation or trapped in hospital as restrictions were eased.He said: ldquoWe need to be cautious but, as the First Minister acknowledged, we canrsquot remain locked in our own homes until a vaccine or cure arrives as that may be a very long time yet.ldquoFor many the health consequences of the lockdown are becoming more acute every day.ldquoI am being contacted by constituents who are concerned for their health.

The Committee emphasises the importance of documenting and recording relevant information.

Keir Starmer has made much of his working class roots. The son of a nurse and a toolmaker, he rose through the grammar school system to take a first at Leeds University then become a human rights lawyer before being appointed director of public prosecutions in England.The Sunday paper in question slipped in that Sir Keir was making pound an hour in his lawyering days, which seems somewhat a bargain for a Doughty Street silk.His mother, we learn, was no longer able to go outside to care for the donkeys towards the end of her le but enjoyed watching them from the window of her home, which overlooked the field.The story also says that Sir Keir has a \"half share\" in his late parents semi-detached house, which is on the market for pound,. Presumably this means that hes inherited the property from his parents, making another unusual step for a right wing paper to be critical of inheritance.Unless he was throwing bunga bunga parties with the donkeys, this isnt much of a scoop. Its surely preferable that he filled a field with donkeys than a cabinet with asses.The land, were told, would be worth pound million, were it not green belt land, which cant currently be redeveloped, and were Sir Keir looking to sell, which he says he is not.I suppose the idea is that the Labour leader is a hypocrite for calling himself a socialist while owning assets worth several million. And yes, there are plenty who would say that it matters not a jot that the land is used as a donkey sanctuary.You are, of course, in an eliteyou have the spare cash to buy a large plot of land to satisfy the whimsy of an ailing parent. But it matters more, I think, to voters what the elite choose to do with their money than the fact that have it.If we look at Sir Keirs opposite number, we have Boris Johnson referring to his second income of pound, as a newspaper columnist as \"chickenfeed\". Jeremy Hunt bought seven properties and entirely forgot about them.This attempt to discredit Sir Keir by suggesting hes too rich to be trusted comes as his approval ratings rise above those of Mr Johnsons for the first time.As the pandemic wrought its awful effects on the UK, there was a general sense that politics as usual should be set aside and a sense of unity displayed as the government set out how it would deal with the health and economic effects of Covid-.At the beginning of the pandemic there wasnt an awful lot for the opposition to do as the measures being suggested were largely of the left anyway.Mr Johnsons approval ratings were highest when he was away from the role and there was a general consensus that it would be inappropriate to criticise the Prime Minister in his sick bed. Now hes ed to the day job and seems wholly unprepared for Sir Keirs forensic questioning at PMQs, perhaps having grown used to far less pointed interrogation from the Labour leaders predecessor.As furious concerns are being raised about the governments handling of the pandemic, of deaths in care homes, lack of adequate PPE for front line staff, and the effects of systemic inequality, as a small example, all eyes now turn to the opposition.Keir Starmer is currently giving the impression of a sensible man with a robust grasp of what his role is and certainly the reports of his performance so far are positive.At the same time, the measures put in place to deal with the social effects of the pandemic are being rolled back. The Mayor of Manchester has raised concerns the provisions for housing rough sleepers are to be ended. There is a war being raged against teachers.As I wrote several weeks ago in this column, there had been a pledge by Priti Patel to end the surcharge paid by overseas doctors - that has been dropped.There are suggestions that we might, as a society, emerge from this crisis with a positive shake up of the old ways and a greener, fairer, more equal new order put in its place. To achieve this will take radical thinking and hard pressure from the left.The political ceasefire is ending and this brief smear attempt on Sir Keir is a sign of politics ing to business as usual. Business as usual is one thing, but the Labour leader must force policy away from the usual and towards something more progressive.

Scottish Government said there could be consequences for landlords.The Covid- committee is currently scrutinising the second major piece of emergency legislation related to the pandemic, the CoronavirusScotland Bill.Glasgow Labour MSP Pauline McNeill had tabled an amendment to create a dedicated fund to support tenants unable to meet their rent because of the crisis, which was supported by the Greens, and Liberal Democrats.Green MSP Andy Wightman, whose party proposed a similar fund, said the welfare system was ldquouseless for private sector tenants, as it did not meet the full rent costs.SNPhousing minister Kevin Stewart said housing support costs were the responsible of the UK Government, and tenants were being encouraged to apply for Universal Credit.He said the rent freeze plan did not take into accounts the financial issues faced by either tenants or landlords, or possible negative consequences.He recommended rejecting all the Labour and Green amendments on the issue.The SNP have four MSPs onthe nine-member committee and the Tories two, while Labour, the Greens and LibDems have one MSP each.A Green amendment to make the contraceptive pill free at pharmacies instead of only with a GP prescription was also defeated.Constitution Secretary Michael Russell said it was not needed as the Scottish Government was already looking at making contraceptives available

And it was willing to sacrice a degree of scrutiny to stymie the Governments programme.\"He said it would be \"unreasonable\" for pupils to start ing to schools in England - which could happen from June  in a phased manner - while MPs stayed away from Parliament.Mr Rees-Mogg dismissed reports that the Tories were keen for a physical Parliament toin order to bolster Boris Johnson when he takes on Sir Keir Starmer, following dficult sessions of Prime Ministers Questions against the new Labour leader.It was a \"completely trivial\" point and claimed that Sir Keirs \"Perry Mason approach to parliamentary scrutiny\" did not work.\"It may convince a jury in a TV series but it didnt convince the British public,\" he said.This afternoon, Mr Rees-Mogg is due to take part in a meeting of the House of Commons Commission chaired by the speaker.Prospect, the union which represents staff in the Houses of Parliament, said a risk assessment had not been carried out for theof all MPs and warned that Commons votes could take an hour to resolve because of social distancing rules limiting the numbers allowed in the lobbies.Garry Graham, the unionrsquos Deputy General Secretary, said: \"Staff have made Herculean efforts to enable Parliament to work remotely, keeping MPs and staff safe and ensuring our democracy is unimpaired.\"It beggars belief that the Government would throw all of this away by forcing hundreds of MPs and staff toto Westminster, putting them at risk and causing vast delays that will hamstring Parliaments ability toeffectively.\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"May ,  at : pmOrkney Islands Councilhas added its voice to the on-going debate over HIAL#s air traffic controlcentralisation plans, calling for a halt to progress until a full Islands Impact Assessment is completed.

HIAL#s modernisation plans would see air traffic control operations at a five airports, including Kirkwall Airport, centralised to a control centre in Inverness, using remote tower technology.Speaking last week, councillor Graham Sinclair, chairman of OIC#s Development and Infrastructure Committee, said:“We need to fully understand the impact on our community before any decision is made to create a remote air traffic control centre in Inverness.”“So it is disappointing that the government and HIAL have disregarded a call by this council, and others, for them to undertake an Islands Impact Assessment before by moving ahead with their plans.“We asked for this earlier in the year and expected the assessment to be completed before HIAL began to undertake a procurement process.”Councillor Sinclair added: “An immense amount of work was undertaken before the passing of the IslandsAct to ensure that Islands Impact Assessments would be carried out to give communities like ours a say when major changes such as this are proposed.“This appears to have been ignored on this occasion, which is why we are asking for the process to be paused until an assessment is undertaken.”HIAL#s position is that impact assessment is being carried out. Spokesman said: “An island impact assessment is currently underway and is being undertaken by an independent consultant. This will include consultation with local authorities and community groups. It is anticipated that the process will be completed and a draft report produced by June .“While every endeavour will be made to maintain this timescale [for the IIA], we acknowledge that the current restrictions and physical distancing requirements may require this timeline to be extended.”“Procuring remote tower technology is part of the next phase of our ATMS Programme. This technology will help deliver sustainable aviation connectivity and deliver a flexible, resilient air traffic service that will be highly adaptable as we ensure our airports are fit for the future.“The procurement process for such tenders is a y process We anticipate that the process to procure the remote tower technology solution will be completed by December  January .“We have reviewed our capital programme to allow us to implement key projects, and have other projects shelf-ready for when we are able toto some semblance of normality. We are also prioritising projects that will deliver local economic benefit within our communities.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He stated his belief that Orkney could one of the first places to say “we’re free of the virus.”Since then, Professor Pennington has been called to give evidence to the Scottish Government’s health and sport committee, stating his case for an isles specic plan to ministers on April .Now, he has followed up with a letter to the committee, backing up his proposals by alleging that Orkney has had no one treated in hospital for COVID- since April  — a claim which has neither been confirmed or denied by NHS Orkney.“I am on record as proposing that residents of Orkney and the Western Isles could be freed earlier from social distancing and lockdown than mainland communities,” Professor Pennington told ministers in a letter dated May .“They have had few COVID- cases , they have excellent public health systems, and they control travel from the mainland very signicantly, thus reducing the risk of virus importation.“Orkney has its own testing facility that provides a turn round time of less than two hours. For exit from local controls, a prerequisite would be community testing on a signicant scale, and the establishment of a system of contact tracing. They could also serve as places to evaluate any smart phone apps.”Unfortunately, The Orcadian has been unable to very Professor Pennington’s claim regarding coronavirus admissions in Orkney, due to a lack of available data.Asked to confirm whether there had been any coronavirus admissions at The Balfour since April , NHS Orkney referred The Orcadian to the Scottish Government daily coronavirus hospital figures, which are broken down by health board. According to the government,the number of patients admitted is under five, it is logged as an asterisk in order to protect confidentiality.The last time that there were five or more patients at The Balfour suspected of having coronavirus was April , and the daily figure since then has been recorded as an asterisk .Asked to confirm how many of those patients who have tested positive for the virus in Orkney have made a recovery, an NHS Orkney spokeswoman told The Orcadian on Monday, that it could not disclose this information due to patient confidentiality.However, NHS Orkney has since confirmed that five of the seven people who have tested positive in Orkney at the time of publication have made a recovery. Sadly, two people have died with the virus.Responding to Professor Pennington’s comments, the NHSO spokeswoman added: “NHS Orkney is grateful for continuing to see low levels of COVID- related activity within the hospital. All COVID- data is monitored nationally via the Scottish Government.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now, why does not Nicola change the dictate for Shetland  We would love to sunbath also, between the snow showers!!!!!😂😂😂😂How fortunate that the Scottish, Welsh and Irish leaders are maintaining their more sensible , balanced and wary approaches .Enlighten us Haydn, why is the infection rate lowerin England than in Wales and Scotland  I for one am not the least confused by the messages, just what is confusing you She niver agrees wIth what the rest off the UK IS DOINGBruce, you make it look asNicola, is acting like a Tory##..The Tory policy being##..me, me, me and melolSince you appear to not know, there has been confusion in Britain today about the actual meaning of BoJo’s statement yesterdayand , as I write, he is trying to explain himself away on TV. THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .On that basis I think we need Nicola Sturgeon down here in England as well!Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful. In all probability Ian will not strike gold but how thankful we would behe did !!Fake news  Trump tried to buy Moussa and replace the old stone buildingswith a shiny new tower and Miss Sturgeon will use the proceeds to building a border wall.The deal came unstuck when China claimed Shetland as part of its North Sea and Atlantic territorial waters. It is understood that Miss Sturgeon has been learning Madrin while Scotlandis locked upOwen Jones has denied that he supports Identity politics, woke culture and he is not a social justice warrior.CNNhires Greta Thunberg to appear on a  as an expert on Covid .Best not to bother with why UK has biggest obesity problem in Europe. Such inquiry requires social science, some sociological imagination and a grain of empathy.Much easier to blame those poor plebs who haven#t got a grip.No need to invest on ending intergenerational deprivation and increasing opportunity too.Playgrounds for schools in poorer parts of our cities Why bother.Simples Peter, integrate #Care# for young and old into the NHS. That would include a voucher towards joining a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Those who chose not to use it, be it on their heads, it is their own health and wellbeing which will suffer. Covid  is ruthless with the obese and unfit,blame and empathy are not part le and death struggle of potentially fatal illness.It is mildly reassuring that Ian Tinkler has #no faith in politicians# presumably including BoJo the Clown. This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .So in summary, the gospel according to Ian Tinkler is that BoJo the clown hasn#t put his size  feet in it at all as the death rate is higher in Scotland than in England.Ian, I think your calculations are the wrong way round and show what you might call a #survival ratio# rather than a death ratio. There#s also a decimal place error but for the purposes of comparison that doesn#t really matter.If you work it out in deaths per million of population you can see that Scotland has a lower death rate.England:  from      per mPlease do not put words in my mouth Robbie. What is happening in Scotland is down to The SG and Nicola, as theFM and former Health Secretary. Trying to make political capital out of people dying is morally reprehensible, obnoxious and malign. Bo-Jo and Nicola have equal responsibility for any mistakes, they both shared and followed the best science they could. For once they were in harmony and agreement. The NHS was not overwhelmed, lives were saved, be thankful for that. Fortunately, the injection of disinfectant, we will leave to a real clown who is now mainlining hydroxychloroquine!!! Perhaps Darwinism will step in soon! God save America.The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place. However the critical site for immunity is probably conserved..."},{"url":null,"title":"calls to save shetland tourism industry with 12 month covid 19 support package ","story":"Shetland politicians and business leaders are ramping up pressure on governments to provide better support for the struggling tourism industry during the Covid- crisis – and beyond.MSP Beatrice Wishart has added her voice to the growing chorus of calls pushing for the UK and Scottish governments to help the hospitality businesses survive.Ms Wishart#s calls for a -month support plan for the industry follow comments made by isles MP Alistair Carmichael in Westminster earlier this week.At a meeting in Holyrood, Ms Wishart said tourism businesses might survive  just three months without support.She asked tourism secretary Fergus Ewing about working with the UK government to consider a -month support package to tide the tourism and hospitality sector over into next season.Ms Wishart was told the problems had been recognised problems but a -month fund had not yet been considered.After the meeting she said: “In Shetland the tourism season is shorter compared to other areas of the UK. It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"general manager at streamline ","story":"We have an exciting opportunity for a self-motivated and results-driven General Manager to join our Operations team at our Lerwick Depot.

This figure released by the Department of Health does not include most deaths outside of hospitals.Monday saw the initial stages of the lockdown being lted as garden and recycling centres were allowed to reopen. Weddings where one partner or a close family relative has only a short time to live were also permitted to go ahead.While family members from dferent households are not yet allowed to meet indoors, Mrs Foster gave her commitment this will remain under review.Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill said Monday had marked two months since the first person here died after contracting the virus. She added that while we are making good progress, we certainly aren#t out of the woods yet.Announcing the new easing of lockdown, Mrs Foster appealed for people to behave sensibly, and strongly condemned reports of large parties inside a Belfast apartment block at the weekend.She said: Over this last few weeks, in what has been a very testing time for our people, inidually as well as wider society, people of all faiths have turned to prayer in their homes and have used ious digital s to stream religious services.The decision to open religious venues for prayer has been deemed sufficiently low risk in terms of Covid-, but we do urge those who are availing of this service to exercise common sense.We will of course keep under review when will be the right time to permit religious services in places of worship where the buildings are big enough to accommodate social distancing, but we ask you all to be patient and we will let you know once the scientic and medical advice indicates it#s safe to do so.Outdoor activities such as golf and angling have also been given the green light to recommence, while groups of up to six people from dferent households can meet outdoors with social-distancing in place, including in people#s gardens.Mrs Foster explained that it is not the time just yet to meet other family members indoors.The scientic and medical advice has led us to conclude that there can be outdoor gatherings of up to six people from outside the same household provided that social distancing is properly maintained, she said.We are not at the time just yet to allow people to meet other family members from other households indoors.They have been hard-won freedoms and it is vital that when you exercise those freedoms you do it in a way that does not put anyone #s safety at risk Arlene FosterWe understand that#s going to disappoint some of you but we would ask you to remain patient and trust that this Executive, informed by the most up to date scientic and medical advice, is in the best position to guide you when it#s safe to do so.It is a matter we will constantly review and I give you that commitment.The First Minister urged those who suffer any symptoms of Covid- - now including the loss of taste or smell - to self-isolate for two weeks.They have been hard-won freedoms and it is vital that when you exercise those freedoms you do it in a way that does not put anyone #s safety at risk, she said.Mrs O#Neill said people needed to remain alert to stem the spread of coronavirus.She added: Last week when we launched the Executive strategy on the pathway to recovery, we acknowledged how we do not underestimate for one second the impacts the severe restrictions have on everyone right across our society.But we also acknowledged that public compliance and support has held firm and there#s no doubt that people have and continue to show great patience at this dficult time.Our top priority remains to save lives by combating the spread of the virus through the targeting interventions and the measures and by everyone working together collectively, including hand washing, body hygiene and social distancing.Going forward, our whole society will be alert to targeting the risks to reduce the spread of the virus and further outbreaks.The Health Minister indicated that an announcement was imminent in respect of the , people here who are shielding.Referring to guidance to those deemed more vulnerable to the virus, Mr Swann said that the advice will be updated ahead of the end of the initial -week shielding period.I fully understand that all those shielding would like some clarity that the situation will not continue indefinitely, he said. I want to make absolutely clear that shielding will last no longer than is deemed clinically necessary. This work is being taken forward on a NHS-wide basis, led by the UK#s four chief medical officers.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We welcome the cautious approach adopted by the Executive, which continues to prioritise the protection of health and wellbeing, with particular emphasis on those who are most vulnerable.We appreciate the recognition in this recovery plan of the importance of the local church, and public worship, in the lives of many people. There is a strong desire to increase the level of pastoral contact where that can be done safely.In particular, we are keen to respond to the appeals from those who find great comfort in visiting their church for private prayer, from couples who are anxious that they can proceed with their marriage ceremony and from parents who wish to have their child baptised.We are conscious that the Christian call to be good neighbours is a call to civic responsibility in the protection of public health. Partnership across all sectors of society, in solidarity with the most vulnerable, will be critical to minimising the threat of Covid-.In our churches we are currently undertaking risk assessments and putting in place response plans that reflect the unique circumstances of each local context and will be sustainable in the long-term.A letter of welcome signed by Rt Rev Dr William Henry, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland Most Rev Eamon Martin, Catholic Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of all Ireland Most Rev John McDowell, Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of all Ireland Rev Sam McGuffin, President of the Methodist Church in Ireland, and Very Rev Dr Ivan Patterson, President of the Irish Council of Churches, was delivered to the Executive yesterday afternoon.One of the signs of hope to emerge has been the way communities have pulled together in support of their most vulnerable members, the Church leaders said. That same spirit needs to shape a vision for recovery that leaves no one behind.Catholic Bishop of Down and Connor Noel Treanor said the reopening of churches for private prayers may y from place to place.This will be a tremendous consolation to all people of faith, particularly those who are grieving, he commented.Each church will open only when it is safe to do so and this may y from place to place. The support and patience of parishioners while these measures are put in place is greatly appreciated.Organised gatherings for prayer or devotions are not permitted at this stage, and the public celebration of Mass and the other sacraments remain suspended.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I was that anxious I called the police yesterday just to warn them in case it would have been chaos.But the message we#ve been putting out is: #Take it easy, we#re here for a long time#. And it has worked.Keen gardener David Irwinfrom Belfast was taking no chances as he arrived wearing gloves and a face mask.I would normally do a lot in the garden. I#m delighted to be out. And, of course, from the garden centre point of view I think they had been struggling as well, so it#s a win-win for everybody.I tend to put gloves on when I come out, usually some sort of facial covering... particularlyit#s going to be potentially busy.I work at a health centre myself so I#m quite used to keeping my distance. We thoughtit was very busy when we arrived we#d come some other time, but it#s not too bad and the way they#ve got it organised is pretty good.Couple Ann-Marieand David Scottfrom Dunmurry were out to buy new flowerpots for the front of their house. We#ve been in the garden all day, every day, said Mr Scott.It#s so nice to get out of the house for a while. We knew it would be busy but people are doing a good job with social distancing and it feels safe. People seem to be looking after each other.Mother and daughter Sarah Sheldonand Paula Winchesterfrom Belfast said gardening during lockdown had helped to reduce stress.It makes such a dference to your le to come to a garden centre, Ms Sheldon added. At Coleraine Garden Centre owner Alan Hall has introduced a number of measures to keep customers safe, including social distancing, controlled admissions and a one-way system.Mr Hall said the Executive#s decision to allow access to garden centres in Step One of its easing of the lockdown restrictions had saved him a signicant sum of money.He said: Lting the restrictions could not have come at a better time, because had it gone on until Step Three or Four, it would have been too late in the season and I could have lost tens of thousands worth of stock. We have plenty of plants ready for sale but bedding plants might be the problem because although we grow some, most come from our suppliers and they are struggling.Among those who were delighted to be browsing the hundreds of bedding plants, shrubs, bushes and trees was Karen McCloskey from Dungiven. It is great to see the garden centres open because it gives you hope that things willto normal again, she said.I love the garden and I have a big interest , but I am actually here looking for plants for my sister#s garden because she doesn#t know what to buy.I#m going to get some bedding plants, something to put a bit of colour into the garden, so I am looking for pansies, viola, petunias and some ivy.William and Karen Thompson from Portrush were mainly looking for trees for land they purchased recently.Karen said: We have an acre site we want to use to create a woodland but we#re buying plants that will do well in shade as well. We want this woodland filled with deciduous trees and the plan is it will be our legacy long after we have gone.Keen gardener Krissi Rochelle from Ballymoney had her car boot packed with a colourful selection of azaleas, rhododendrons, lupins and grasses and was itching to get home to start planting.I have waited patiently on this day and couldn#t wait to get here, she explained. We moved from England a year ago, opened a BB but obviously we haven#t had any guests so we have used the time creating a garden because there wasn#t one there before.I am delighted that I was able to get everything I was looking for. I#ll be out in the garden for the coming days getting everything in place.In Templepatrick Richard Fry, managing director of Colemans Garden Centre, said he will be luckythe business breaks even this year. To be honest, I think  we have to write off. There#ll be no profitability as such for this year. If we break even we#ll be doing well. We are limiting the number of people through the door to just two per household. We have people on the front door, we have people on the back door, we have a one-way system in place, we#re asking people to sanitise their hands, he added.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

While not wholly unsurprising, the immediacy and scale of the increase in claimants is shocking and does raise serious concerns around the fundamental strength of the labour market and how well the economy can bounce back, especially as job retention and business support schemes are scaled back. A weaker labour market reduces demand in the economy and reduces wider economic confidence.

Then one evening came a statement that just stopped me in my tracks. “Daddy, when this is all over, can we go to that Kitchen place in Magherafelt for a chocolate milkshake,” Erin asked. Her this is the coronavirus and she is talking about Shorty McNallyscafe, a hub of chat. Erin always get a milkshake and I get the half and half with chicken curry that always hits the spot. Erin follows up: “Daddy...when will this all be over ” “I dont know pet,” comes my answer. And I dont. I feel tiny and helpless. At this stage, the penny drops. What must be going on in their wee heads  The schoolwork is irrelevant. They will all catch-up sometime. A cuddle and some reassurance that you are there for them is more important. Every Thursday night, a round of applause is dedicated to those working in the NHS and on front line. But me, my thoughts are also dedicated to the children out there. They have also been thrust into a whole world of uncertainty. God love them. One thing is certain though...Shortys next serving of milkshake and curry will never taste better.

As revealed by the Derry News earlier this month, the proposed bridge would span an intake of water near the Fort George site, expanding the Quay Trail into Bay Road park. The planning application was received by Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Planning Service on March  and is in the early stages of consideration. The proposed bridge will provide a link from the city centre to Muff in County Donegal. It is part of the wider North West Greenway Network project which aims to develop .km of cross-border greenway, including: Derry-Buncrana, Derry-Muff, and Lford-Strabane. googletag.cmd.push  Funding for the project has been provided through the EU’s INTERREG VA programme, managed by the Special EU Programmes Body . Match-funding has been provided by the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland and the Department for Transport, Tourism and Sport in Ireland. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Cllr Michaela Boyle, welcomed the submission of the planning application. She said: “I am delighted this key infrastructure project, which will complement the emerging City Deal riverfront regeneration plans, has reached this important milestone. Subject to planning approval, it will play a signicant role in connecting people through our infrastructure, facilitating more people to get outdoors and choose sustainable travel options, whilst benefitting peoples’ health and wellbeing.” googletag.cmd.push Paying tribute to everyone involved for advancing project development during this emergency period, Mayor Boyle continued: “Now, more than ever, there is a real need for investment in projects which encourage a more active, healthy lestyle. Once completed, the proposed new bridge will further enhance the City and District’s growing greenway network.” Gina McIntyre, Chief Executive of SEUPB said: “This bridge is an integral section of the North West Greenway Network’s route , which will link Derry to Muff. It will encourage more people to choose an eco-friendly form of travel, one of the core objectives of the EU’s INTERREG VA Programme, which has been designed to support more sustainable forms of transport, on both sides of the border.” She continued: ”It is also important, as we emerge from COVID- restrictions in the coming weeks and months, that we rebuild our society and the economy in a more environmentally-conscious way. This greenway will help support a more socially distanced recovery process, an approach that will pay real and tangible idends for us all in the future.” Further details on the project can be found at www.nwgreenway.

It will allow the first student intake of  in September , she explained, this is a hugely important investment decision for the North West and it adds to the Executives recent announcement on the Derry and Strabane City Deal and Inclusive Future Fund. It will prove to be instrumental in the regeneration of the region and will help to support our health service who we much rely on at this point and into the future. Speaking after todays Executive announcement where it agreed to establish medical school in Derry and the first student intake of  students in September, MLA for Foyle Karen Mullan said:Todays announcement by the Executive that it plans to establish the graduate medical school at Magee is a major boost for Ulster University and for Derry. googletag.cmd.push The benefits of this investment to the economic regeneration of Derry and to the North West cannot be overstated. I warmly welcome the decision which adds quite signicantly to the City Deals and Inclusive Future Fund commitment announced in recent weeks too. “There is widespread support for the medical school and the expansion of Magee. There is a united voice in the city at political and community levels and todays announcement represents a huge step forward towards the goal of delivering the medical school at Magee in the fastest time possible. Sinn Feacutein is committed to working with Ulster University, local business leaders and all other parties to see the project delivered without any delay. googletag.cmd.push While welcoming the Executive recommitting itself to a medical school as part of the expansion of Magee, SDLP Leader and Foyle MP Colum Eastwood called for further detail and guarantees on a September  intake. Mr Eastwood said that what’s needed now is more than warm words but a detailed plan and the resource needed to lt the project off the ground. Colum Eastwood MP said: “During the negotiations to restore power sharing, I made it a personal priority to secure not just a political commitment to the expansion of Magee but resource for developing the medical school. That was critical to SDLP support for the Executive. I welcome the statement from the First Ministers recommitting to university expansion in Derry today. “What people here need is more than warm words or restated promises. We need a guarantee from the Executive and from Ulster University that the first students will enrol starting in September  and we need to see a plan for university expansion beyond that. The medical school is the first step, not the end product. “I will work constructively with all parties to deliver on the potential of our university. Providing young people with the opportunity to study, work and make a le for themselves here is a priority for me. Today’s news must be something genuinely new, rehashing previous commitments or announcements will not be enough. Meanwhile, Foyle DUP MLA Gary Middleton said all parties have worked hard to secure the medical school. Mr Middleton said: “Enhanced commitment from the Executive for the graduate medical school is very welcome. We have been working with all parties in Londonderry to move this issue forward and make it a reality. During the Confidence and Supply Agreement, Gregory Campbell was able to bring the then Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond to the City to show him the potential. Indeed, with support across the British Isles, this key project has been able to be moved in the right direction. It is a symbol of what can be done when people work together. I hope in  we will be able to see the first students enrolled. It will be good for the North West but also for the Health Service.” The British Government backed a medical school in Derry in the New Decade, New Approach document. Former Secretary of State for NI, Julian Smith, who helped broker the deal also welcomed the news saying: Great news for Derry - such great community commitment to this project - well done to all involved in the campaign. A new decade and a new approach to ALL parts of Northern Ireland being delivered.

So the decision to open religious venues for prayer has been deemed sufficiently low risk in terms of COVID-. googletag.cmd.push But we do urge those who are availing of this service to exercise common sense. Expanding those relaxations to include religious services will be kept under review. Drive in religious services will be permitted provided people remain in their cars, the First Minister said, and the proper social distancing advice is followed. Deputy First Minister Michelle ONeill said you can meet in groups of up to six people outdoors, take part in outdoor activities such as golf and fishing and attend drive in performances such as music and theatre. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

For many couples, Slaughtneil was more than just an exercise in adolescent revelry. It became the starting point for the rest of their romantic lives. The County Derry Post caught up with four couples for whom Slaughtneil will always be a special place. Sarah and Eamonn Darragh  “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really.”  Kilrea man Eamonn Darragh his we, Bellaghy woman Sarah have an age-old Slaughtneil ritual to thank for fate bringing them together back in . googletag.cmd.push In this case, fate had a name. “Whenever I was at primary school, I was friendly with a fella called Shay Quinn,” said Sarah. “I played with him on the boys’ football team. He was the year above me and when I got to St Pat’s the year after, him and Eamonn were friends. “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really. I saw him on nights out at Slaughtneil and in school, and that was how things started.” The disco holds special signicance for Sarah and Eamonn, whose relationship grew as the hills of south Derry reverberated to the incoherent sounds of Mark McCabe. googletag.cmd.push “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil,” she said. “You’d have been checking the Mid Ulster Observer every week to checkit was going to be a late night, orit was a foam party. “Then you had to be good to your parents all week and put the feelers out on a Wednesday or Thursday to seeyou could go. “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil. Eamonn got the bus up from Kilrea and I would get it from Bellaghy on a Friday night, and we continued our relationship from there. “If we both weren’t there, we wouldn’t have met each other, we wouldn’t have been married and having a babyI hadn’t met him through Shay at the disco.” Enda and Laura Heron  “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me!”  For many involved with the GAA, the word ‘lap’ doesn’t conjure up many positive thoughts, butyou ask anyone who crossed the door of Slaughtneil disco, it’s a dferent story. Laura Heron was embarking on a lap of the hall when she bumped into the man who would later become her husband, but they were lucky to be there at all. “We met around the Millennium, when we thought the world was going to end,” she said. “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me! “We had a wee kiss that night, but we met a year later, when we were  or so, going to the Elk and the sparks flew from then on.” Even the soundtrack to the encounter belied its good fortune, as the pair met to the unmistakable sound of ‘Toca’s Miracle’ by ‘Fragma’. Memories of going to the disco are still fresh in her mind. “You were always excited to go, you couldn’t wait until Friday night came,” she said. “We always got DCs Coaches from Bellaghy. That was part of the fun too, heading up on the bus for that opportunity to have fun with your friends at the weekend, after school was over. “When you’re that age, going to Slaughtneil when you’re in fourth year or whatever, you think you’re an adult, that you know everything. You don’t realise that you were still a child. “We got married in  and were going out for about  years or so. We went to Australia for a year and came home and settled down from that point, but it all began in Slaughtneil hall.” Jenna Mulhern and David Donnelly  “If he was driving about, we’d always meet at Slaughtneil and we started going steady when we were .”  When Dungiven woman Jenna Mulhern met her husband-to-be David, from Ballinascreen, his time at Slaughtneil disco had been brought to a premature end. “He was actually known in Slaughtneil as ‘Davy Bash’, because he was always in rows,” said Jenna. “He couldn’t come in because he was barred from the place for fighting – that’s why he had to drive about outside. “We got talking, and then the following week, I met him again and we had our first curt.” Jenna remembers her uncle leaving her and her friends over to the disco and having to suffer their excited, and quite vocal anticipation. “My uncle used to leave us over and God love him, he had to listen to the biggest pile of rubbish in that car,” she recalled. “Once we landed it was brilliant, meeting up with everybody and then sneaking out halfway through the night to meet Davy. “Young ones now will never experience anything like it. We couldn’t wait to get dressed up on a Friday night and have a wee blue WKD on the way over. “I know a lot who would have went to Slaughtneil and are still with the same people. I’d say a lot of people have met their first loves there.” Kieran and Paula Tully  “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes!”  There are dozens of women who can look back at Slaughtneil as the place where they met and their future husbands, but a much lesser number who were proposed to there. Paula Tully’s husband Kieran, overcome by the intoxicating mix of perfume and freshly cut turf, popped the question after the couple left the hall for some air back in . “That particular night we came out to be on our own on the bus. I could nearly point out where it was sitting,” said Paula. “We weren’t saying the Rosary now, but we weren’t doing anything bad either! That’s when Kieran asked me to marry him.” “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes. We went steady until just after I was . When you think about it now, it’s crazy how young we were.” With Kieran from Ballerin and Paula from Glenullin, their story has a Romeo and Juliet feel, with love prospering amid the pitched battles going on around them. “I remember one of my friends fell out with me for a month when I started going with Kieran, because he was from Ballerin and I was from the Glen! “At that time, you had the gang of boys from the Glen that fought with the gang of boys from Ballerin. She thought I was being a complete traitor.” The couple continued the Slaughtneil theme throughout their relationship, with DJ Terry McIl, who played on the very first night of the disco, performing at their wedding. “Our weans think it’s hilarious, that it’s crazy,” laughed Paula. “We had brilliant memories, I don’t regret a second of it. We’ll be  years married this August. If I was to do it all again, I would not change a thing.” See also: SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: Spinning the soundtrack to a timless era SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: The goose that laid the golden egg.

Those days seem positively idyllic now, but alas, like the car journeys of her childhood, we’re not nearly there yet. The Covid story fills our daily lives, with a relentless stream of media coverage of illness and death, with graphs distorted so as to frighten and confuse, with front page pictures of the victims. Everywhere is the constant reiteration of the now disproven narrative that the lock up is saving lives. Our politicians vie with one another to virtue signal their intent to prolong the misery and impoverishment of our people, and of future generations. googletag.cmd.push Our elderly are told they are being kept alive, but denied all of the simple pleasures which make le worth living-family, friends, society and their religious practices. Meanwhile, the entire healthy population is under house arrest, policed by the state, but more worryingly by their neighbours in a social media shamefest. Those who “follow the science” know that this foul disease is behaving as many such seasonal viral illnesses have done for millions of years. They travel through communities, and wreak havoc on the elderly and infirm. In Ireland, the median age of death is  years. % of those dying have other, often multiple medical problems, like cancer heart disease and strokes. googletag.cmd.push In most of the community, viral illnesses cause illness and misery to many, but most have a mild illness, recover completely and are conferred with immunity to further infection. Each death is a personal loss for those left behind, but death is a necessary and inevitable part of the human condition. Many older people do not fear it. The science also suggests that this virus was in Europe much earlier than previously thought-possibly in December and January, that the peak of deaths was on th April, which given an incubation period of - days, meant the lockup came too late to influence outcomes. The evidence for this timeline is growing daily, but doesn’t seem to have reached the politicians who are deciding the fate and future of our very civilization.  The dire predictions of tens, even hundreds of thousands of deaths in the UK alone were based on computer models which have been heavily criticized by independent statisticians and mathematicians. The original aim of protecting the NHS, and flattening the curve has been achieved. But now we see the narrative changing, with dread warnings of second waves and the new normal, indeed noto an open society until there is a vaccine. The rules around social distancing, plucked from the ether, without any evidence base are internalized by the population. The media, which is essentially an arm of government, eagerly reinforces the narrative. We should realise that the search for a vaccine for HIV AIDS is now entering its fourth decade. Also safety trials for any vaccine historically take years, and rightly so, given the exposure of entire populations to potential harm. It is clear, as I pointed out in a previous article for this paper about a month ago, that countries who have imposed lockdowns have outcomes comparable to those who took more moderate steps to protect their people. Also, since around half of the fatalities occur in the care home sector, the total failure to protect these facilities with whatever resources were available has cost many lives. It is also clear that the lockup policy is causing at least half of the excess mortality we are seeing, and that this proportion is likely to increase signicantly as people are being denied treatment and diagnostics in the other areas. Heart disease, strokes, cancer and mental health problems haven’t gone away, but their recognition and treatment have. I’ve been working in the NHS throughout this period. On my one sht in the GP Covid assessment centre, I counted fteen staff, including three doctors and many highly skilled nurses, who in a four-hour sht saw three patients, none of whom has Covid. Hospitals are half empty, highly skilled staff idle. There are no elective surgical lists, nor routine outpatient appointments, so people wait in pain for surgery or in anxiety and stress for tests to find outthey have serious illnesses such as cancer. Meantime in the out-of-hours GP service, we see people in mental health crises, deal with people isolated and displaced, those suffering from a relapse of addictions under control for years, and an elderly population terried and reluctant to seek help, because they have been repeatedly told that their NHS is in danger of being overwhelmed, and because they dread separation from loved ones. The distress of those families with children with behavioural or learning dficulties, or additional physical needs is truly heartbreaking. Discussion of the economic consequences of all of this are beyond my remit, but experts say there is not a linear, but exponential effect on the crash which is certainly coming as a result of the almost total cessation of economic activity. In other words, a four-month lockup isn’t twice as bad as a two month one, but many, many times worse. Here in the developed world we are unlikely to starve, although there will be widespread austerity the likes of which we have not seen in generations. But in the global south, where millions live on subsistence wages, the abrupt loss of economic activity and markets for produce will cause catastrophic starvation and cost the lives of millions. Disease is a constant challenge to societies and governments. But the unprecedented response to this one takes us to uncharted and very dangerous waters. There is no evidence that the political decision makers have done any intelligent cost benefit analysis, looking at the big picture of the physical, mental, social and economic outcomes for those whose lives they are entrusted to improve. They are either inept beyond imagining, or willfully colluding in the destruction of society, especially for future generations.

To get ahead of them, you need to be quick off the mark.This weekend will see theof their soccer leagues behind closed doors, marking a conclusion to the sporting lock-down due to the worldwide coronavirus pandemic.With nine games to go, a win for Borussia Dortmund on Saturday would see them cut the margin at the top to a single point by the time leaders Bayern Munich kick off in Berlin on Sunday afternoon.The decision comes after the government gave the green light to games going ahead in mid-May and approximately , tests were carried out on the players, coaches and support staff from all  clubs in the top two leagues at the end of April.The German league website reported a second wave of testing, around the , mark, has flagged up two positive cases which will be monitored.The countrys leader Chancellor Angela Merkel is highly-qualied and holds a doctorate for her thesis on quantum chemistry. She is happy the country has achieved the goal of slowing down the spread of the virus.She handed the responsibility to the organisers of the league and they have put a special sports medicine and match operations task force in place to managed the move back to competitive sport.Tier two club Dynamo Dresden has since put their squad and management team in isoaltion for two weeks after two players tested positive for coronavirus. The rest of the leagues will go ahead.If only we had locked down as quickly in this part of the world. Thank God for local communities and for the GAA, who acted swty to lead people once Leo Varadkar signalled the need to act in early May.The Taoiseach was naiumlve during his appearance on the Late, Late Show to hint at the chance for the All-Ireland championships to be played this year.It is dficult to see how, but the GAA leadership has since issued the statement confirming that there will be no inter-county action until October and club activities wont begin before mid-July,they even do.It leaves uncertainty surrounding the chance of playing games behind closed doors, which is not ruled out, but anyto action – club or county – is subject to public health guidance. googletag.cmd.push SAFETY FIRST When I think back to club month in April last year, there is nothing I would like better than ato action. Laveys clash with Swatragh ending in a draw, Foreglen and Claudy going down to the last seconds and Banaghers clash with Dungiven decided by a point. It would make you jealous thinking about it.Everybody knows how tight the calendar is and that there will only be room for county or club,there is a . But not both.With all players essentially club players and the chosen few on county , it is only fair the GAA cater for everyone and scrap the county scene. It may seem like the nuclear option and an extreme one, but the hierarchy would get huge respect for making such a dficult decision. This reinforces how well clubs rallied around those in need. It was the GAA at its very best.I would feel for Derry hurlers though, who were in a terric situation to eventually get out of Division B. So maybe the GAA could finish out the few games involving the relegation and promotion, so that it is an even keel when  comes around the corner.Deep down and with a realistic hat on, I cant see much being played. The safety of a nation is just far too important. We are not Germany. They got off to a better start, with stronger leadership coming from the top.I just hope the GAA dont force teams to play behind closed doors. It is not an option. There is some dference between Bayern Munichs Robert Lewandowski and say... Derrys Karl McKaigue.Big Lewandowski, now that all the players are tested, can be kept in exile from his family. Professionals can stay in hotels and there is money there to fund that.McKaigue is a physiotherapist and potentially working on the front line. How can he possibly stay in isolation. Are the GPA going to be able to pay himhe stays at home  I wouldnt think so and Derry will not be able to pay him to stay in separate accommodation between games.As regards testing. A GAA player could be tested on a Monday to seehe is able to train and pick up the virus after that. His test could come back clear and he could infect the rest of the  and the opposition come the following Sunday.It just isnt feasible. If it is not safe for supporters to attend games, then players are the same.Watching the Bundesliga this weekend should be a reminder to decision makers of how a country can benefit from acting early and in a calculated manner.Us sporting addicts, we will just have to keep watching it on television. When the time comes to , it needs to be the right time...not just a rushed job. We deserve as much. googletag.cmd.push RELATED - Irish rugby tour postponed. More...

The -plus-style exams are due to ahead in November and December, two weeks later than planned. However, given the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, there have been calls for the organisations that run the tests to call them off. In his role as Apostolic Administrator for the Diocese of Dromore, Archbishop Eamon Martin has written a letter making the same appeal to Catholic schools in that diocesan area. The Bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown, has sent a similar letter to grammar schools in the city in his role as a trustee of Catholic schools in his diocese. googletag.cmd.push In a letter to school principals and governors, Archbishop Martin, a former President of St Columbs College in Derry, said he was aware that anxiety was building. He said parents and teachers had shared their disquiet and uncertainty that was already upsetting some children. I know that teachers have been providing helpful study packs and online resources to assist with home schooling. Parents are doing their best to respond, while juggling work and home commitments, and in some cases overseeing learning for several children at once. Some pupils are responding well others are struggling, without ready access to technology or the one-to-one assistance of their teachers. googletag.cmd.push A school principal observed to me that he anticipates educational disadvantage will be exacerbated given this years special circumstances. There was a likelihood of children ing to school in phases in September, he added, and pupils may require additional emotional support. With this in mind, and in the best interests of our children and schools, I appeal to the whole educational community to support a suspension of the use of academic selection for entrance to post-primary schools in , he added. I urge the boards of governors to publish admissions criteria which do not rely on the use of transfer tests carried out under such uncertain and challenging circumstances. Archbishop Martin added: In making this appeal for a suspension of the use of academic selection in the coming year, I have no desire to simply re-open the arguments for, and against, the transfer tests. I make this call from my heart on behalf of the current Primary Six children, their families and all our school communities, he concluded. In his letter, Bishop Donal McKeown said that socially disadvantaged pupils would be seriously disadvantaged in the transfer tests as they would have been out of school for almost six months. Therefore, in the interest of fairness to pupils and in the interest of maintaining a mix of pupils in the school community, I would ask your board of governors to consider how you could respond to this, he wrote. This may well be a situation where criteria other than transfer test grades should be included for at least a substantial proportion of the  entry cohort.

The -plus-style exams are due to ahead in November and December, two weeks later than planned. However, given the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, there have been calls for the organisations that run the tests to call them off. In his role as Apostolic Administrator for the Diocese of Dromore, Archbishop Eamon Martin has written a letter making the same appeal to Catholic schools in that diocesan area. The Bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown, has sent a similar letter to grammar schools in the city in his role as a trustee of Catholic schools in his diocese. googletag.cmd.push In a letter to school principals and governors, Archbishop Martin, a former President of St Columbs College in Derry, said he was aware that anxiety was building. He said parents and teachers had shared their disquiet and uncertainty that was already upsetting some children. I know that teachers have been providing helpful study packs and online resources to assist with home schooling. Parents are doing their best to respond, while juggling work and home commitments, and in some cases overseeing learning for several children at once. Some pupils are responding well others are struggling, without ready access to technology or the one-to-one assistance of their teachers. googletag.cmd.push A school principal observed to me that he anticipates educational disadvantage will be exacerbated given this years special circumstances. There was a likelihood of children ing to school in phases in September, he added, and pupils may require additional emotional support. With this in mind, and in the best interests of our children and schools, I appeal to the whole educational community to support a suspension of the use of academic selection for entrance to post-primary schools in , he added. I urge the boards of governors to publish admissions criteria which do not rely on the use of transfer tests carried out under such uncertain and challenging circumstances. Archbishop Martin added: In making this appeal for a suspension of the use of academic selection in the coming year, I have no desire to simply re-open the arguments for, and against, the transfer tests. I make this call from my heart on behalf of the current Primary Six children, their families and all our school communities, he concluded. In his letter, Bishop Donal McKeown said that socially disadvantaged pupils would be seriously disadvantaged in the transfer tests as they would have been out of school for almost six months. Therefore, in the interest of fairness to pupils and in the interest of maintaining a mix of pupils in the school community, I would ask your board of governors to consider how you could respond to this, he wrote. This may well be a situation where criteria other than transfer test grades should be included for at least a substantial proportion of the  entry cohort.

Robert Fullerton, who is , bought the pound ‘Treasure Bingo’ Scratchcard at his local Vivoxtra store whilst shopping for some essential grocery items on May . Little did Robert know that later the same evening he would discover he’d won an amount , times greater than the price of the scratchcard! The incredible news comes as an amazing boost for Robert and his we Susanas both had been recently furloughed from the company they work for as a result of the COVID- pandemic. googletag.cmd.push Robert works as a spray painter and Susan as a machine operator for a leading local kitchen supplier and, like many across the country, have been furloughed for the past five weeks as part of the Government’s job retention scheme. Robert explained how his le-changing win came about. “I was out doing an essential grocery shop and had a scratchcard in my pocket with a pound win on it. So while I was paying for the groceries, I exchanged it for another similar National Lottery Scratchcard, and bought an extra one for good measure. “I brought the two scratchcards home and played them that night. I didn’t win anything on the first scratchcard and gave it to Susan to check, while I was scratching the second card,” he continued. googletag.cmd.push “Half-way through, it was already showing that I’d won pound, and I started physically shaking. I was thinking to myself, ‘that’s not right’ and had to get up and go outside for some fresh air. “I showed the scratchcard to Susan and took a photo that I sent to my mum and sister – both of whom agreed that I wasn’t seeing things and that, as far as they could see, I’d won three hundred grand! “After a restless night, with little or no sleep, I called The National Lottery the following morning. They asked for some details and then, I’ll never forget, the lady on the phone said… ‘Congratulations, you have won pound,’! “My reply was ‘you what ’ My heart felt like it was going to burst out of my chest. In fact, I still can’t believe it. It’s like a dream come true, especially in these uncertain times when we’re stuck at home and don’t really know how our jobs will be affected by this coronavirus pandemic.” Despite his big win, Robert hopes to get back to work as soon as possible, saying that he loves his job and the ‘banter’ with his workmates. Robert bought the winning National Lottery Treasure Bingo Scratchcard from the Vivoxtra store on Magherafelt Road in Castledawson.

Sean McLaughlin, the owner of Georges Bar in Bishop Street, had organised a night of live music to celebrate the le of Shenda McKenna on her first anniversary on April . Due to the coronavirus the gig was cancelled, but undeterredthe the singers moved online where they played on Facebook Live streaming service. Music lover Shenda was just  when she passed away. We wanted to mark the anniversary of our beautul friend Shenda, said Mr McLaughlin. We would have loved for nothing more than celebrating her le in the bar, however, the musicians agreed to go online and the event was able to go ahead and raised pound,. googletag.cmd.push Georges Bar is well known for its live music and craic and the regulars regard each otheras family. We call it the Georges family, said Mr McLaughlin, who has owned the bar for seven years. We have a long tradition of charity fundraisingand we would raise a lot of money for the Playtrail, so this seemed like the perfect way to remember Shenda. She was in here every weekend and she loved music. Last week, Georges Bar held another fundraiser in aidof the late Pat ODonnell, known affectionately as Wee Pat, who passed away last Christmas Day aged . Pat was a stalwart of Georges and was part of the furniture here for a number of years, said Mr McLaughlin. googletag.cmd.push Sadly, we lost Pat on Christmas Day , and that void has never, and will never, be filled. Pat had travelled the world and worked looking after garment factories in the likes of Madagascar and Mauritius. His stories were legendary and he lived a really full and interesting le. He was like a piece of the furniture in here and he was in almost every night when he lived in Mountjoy Street and later Abbey House. He was the oldest person in the bar and he had a real love of music. He used to always ask Sean McCafferty to play The Lakesof Pontchartrain for him but we never knew why and then when Sean played it on Thursday a cousin of Pats messaged from Canada to say he lived just a few blocks from Lake Pontchartrain, so now we know! The night in aid of Wee Pat took place on Thursday, May , and raised a further pound for the Foyle Food Bank, bringing the total raised to pound,. Its been really nice to raise this moneyeven though the bar cant open and Im sure its badly needed at this time, added Mr McLaughlin.

With thousands more claimants now trying to access welfare support – many for the first time – the pressure on local advice services has never been higher. Applications have sky rocketed, as employers struggle to source support for employees as well as secure the long-term future of their business, and families seek aid as they face the sudden stark reality of le without a regular income. googletag.cmd.push The community and voluntary sector in Derry has mobilised to provide a network of support, and one vital component in that resilience effort are the local advice service organisations who are providing round the clock guidance and information for those in most dficulty. They have seen a surge in demand for information on support mechanisms such as the Job Retention Scheme, Self-employment Income Support, Statutory Sick Pay, Universal Credit and mortgage advice. Jacqueline Gallagher is manager of the newly branded Advice North West – formerly Citizens Advice Bureau. Used to dealing face to face with their customers, they have been adjusting to the challenge of working remotely assisting people by email and phone and the limitations that brings. googletag.cmd.push Weve been so busy since we entered lockdown, it is a time of great uncertainty for many in our communities with a large volume of iniduals and families worried about their security of income, housing and employment, she explains. We have dealt with a large influx of people who have had to access the benefit system for the first time. “This can be a time-consuming process at any time but with the inability to provide face to face advice services we have had to be inventive in our approach to surmount the current social constraints and limitations. Its very tough for people who have never before had to navigate the benefit system and are now having to do so in such unexpected and upsetting circumstances. “They are afraid of not being able to pay back debts, losing their homes, not being able to feed their families – its an unbelievably anxious time. “The dficulty is that everyones situation is dferent, so each person needs a specially tailored approach. Our team dedicates themselves to ensuring the wellbeing of those who access our services. Jude McKinney is the Welfare Rights Manager of the Resource Centre Derry where the team has also been adjusting to new ways of working introduced to fast track services that are under increasing pressure. It really has been a challenge for our team, he admits. We definitely saw a major spike in demand for services at the start as we had a lot of new issues to deal with. We received advance funding from Council and we have been allocated additional money through the Community Fund which helped us to meet this initial demand for services. We anticipated having to cover a lot of additional hours to allow for the extra filling out of forms. “When we first entered lockdown we saw a huge surge in claims for things like employment benefit, self-employment support and the self-isolation job retention scheme. “Then when the furloughing scheme was announced – something which no one was familiar with – it was another challenge helping both employers and employees understand how the scheme works to benefit them. We can no longer facilitate face to face appointments which is in itself challenging and we anticipated it would mean a lot of extra out of hours work for our staff. But thankfully there have been some fantastic measures introduced by the Department for Communities in terms of easement. They stepped in to introduce a number of easement mechanisms including a six-month extension of payments for existing claims, which has meant we havent had to process a huge volume of renewal forms like for example Work Capability Assessments. “We can also now sign on a claimants behalf so they no longer have to come in to the centre to sign forms, which has been a big help. While this has given us a bit more breathing space we now anticipate there will be a spike in form filling come September and October. So there are definitely more pressures waiting down the line. Its hard to imagine how we will ever resume normal ways of working. I think this will all lead to a review of how we deliver advice services which will see it transformed in the long-term and I think we have a long way to go before we thingsto any kind of normality. Dove House is located in the heart of the Bogside in Derry, an area already suffering from high levels of deprivation. Welfare Advice Coordinator Donna Burke and the team of eight advisors based there have been inundated by calls from new claimants, but are buoyed up by the strength of the community resilience efforts in the area. I can see how it can be so frustrating for anyone trying to access benefits when there is so much uncertainty and change at the moment, weve had to adapt as best we can, she admits. The biggest concern is quite simply ensuring that people have enough money to live on. Its as basic as that. “With so many new claimants, they have to get registered which can be a complicated process in itself, but then we have to explain to them that they will have to wait until that support comes through which leaves people extremely anxious. “There can be no room for error. Thats upsetting for our advisors as well. Im so proud of our team – they are going above and beyond the call of duty every day – no one is turned away evenit means calling people back over and over again to make sure we can get them the help they need.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Finally delivering the Medical School would be a lasting legacy to the efforts of our frontline healthcare staff during this crisis. “I am very pleased that we will finally have a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee. It is testament to the combined efforts of those across business, education, healthcare and politics, who have worked together on this campaign. As part of the wider City Deal for Derry City and Strabane, the Medical School will drive real economic and social change across the North West and help address years of underfunding and underinvestment in the region.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The number of parcels being delivered is % more than this time last year, with the districtrsquos other foodbanks reporting an increased demand.In a newsletter issued last week, Mrs Lennon revealed that an application to the Martin Lewis Coronavirus Emergency Fund was successful and that the support the charity will receive will make a ldquosignicant dference to its work in the immediate future.She also said that many of the volunteers have begun to see food and its supply in a dferent way.ldquoThe panic buying, shortages and less opportunities to shop has had an impact on people who have never faced this situation before, continued Mrs Lennon.ldquoPersonally, I hope I understand a little more about the worry that feeding those we love can bringle becomes dficult. I have been so pleased that the foodbank has been able to continue operating in these dficult circumstances, even though it is operating dferently.Mrs Lennon said she is especially grateful to everyone who has helped her with decision making and practical help since the pandemic began.ldquoIt has been humbling and amazing to see God continuing to bless the work and to be able to help those in our community who need the support, she continued.Donations of food can be left at the Asda and SuperValu stores in Downpatrick during their opening hours andanyone would like to make a financial donation they can do so by email.There is also a weekly donation point for people in Saintfield at the townrsquos First Presbyterian Church between pm and pm. Donations can be made on Tuesdays between pm and pm.Partner organisations can still refer people to the foodbank for support either by telephone on   or by emailing fountainfoodbank@gmail, while iniduals who feel they need help can also contact the foodbank directly, providing some basic information. They can also order a food parcel.Mrs Lennon said that due to the very dficult circumstances at present, the foodbank is keen to help as many people as possible, urging them not to be anxious about asking for help.Orders need to be placed by pm on Tuesdays, with parcels delivered on Wednesday afternoons and left outside clientsrsquo homes.Across the district, many groups and iniduals are donating food and money to the foodbank to allow the volunteers to help those in need. They include BM Bargains in Ballynahinch, Crossgar Harriers, Omagh Stockcar Club, Downpatrick FC, Saintfieldrsquos Hollymount Hall and churches in the Saintfield area.Mrs Lennon said: ldquoWe are overwhelmed by the generosity shown by so many at this dficult time. Despite food being dficult to purchase, people are still making donations and many generous financial donations have been made.The foodbank volunteers hope that shoppers will continue to think about the charity when they are shopping and leave items at the dedicated collection points in local stores to help them continue to meet increasing demand.The Fountain Foodbank contact details are  , email fountainfoodbank@gmail or visit www.downpatrickpresbyterianchurch.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin man Chris makes vital PPE equipment  ","story":"AN Aughlisnafin man has taken his new lesaving charity venture to a higher level.Chris Campbell, is putting his passion for technology to good use by making PPE for care workers on the frontline of the coronavirus pandemic.Chris, who began making PPE from his home a little over a month ago, has been inundated with requests, so much so that he and his small team of volunteers have moved their operation to St Maryrsquos Community Hall in Newcastle.The premises were kindly offered to him by Rob Manley, founder of Newcastle Community Cinema, which has had to close due to the lockdown.By using D printers Chrisrsquos venture, PPE NHS Supplies NI, has so far supplied almost , high-quality sets of face shields and ear protectors to hospitals and nursing homes mdash and thatrsquos just the beginning.Chrishas been helped by generous cash donations by members of the public.He said: ldquoAt the beginning I received an anonymous donation of pound, which overwhelmed me and since then the donations have been pouring in. I am so humbled by the kindness of strangers.ldquoI set up a GoFundMe page that allows charity workers like myself to make instant withdrawals which means I can now purchase materials faster and produce the PPE without much delay.The more D printers that Chris can purchase the more lesaving equipment he can produce. However, costs are rising.ldquoThis week a D printer jumped to pound on eBay. The same printer last year cost pound. You could say they have all but tripled in price, he explained.Chris was diagnosed with ADHD when he was eight years old and has been greatly supported by the ADHD Hub in Newcastle.He says that once Covid- and the need for PPE ends, all funds from his venture will be donated to the Hub which is based in Savoy Lane.Chris says the condition is like a double-edged sword. While his le has been greatly impacted by ADHD, it can help him become a high achiever.ldquoSometimes people with the condition possess an exceptional ability to entertain, but there is always another side to it, he said.ldquoWe suffer from poor concentration levels in many areas and we have limited social skills. We miss out on the social subtleties that most other people take for granted and we are notoriously impulsive, which means school is a very hard environment for most of us.ldquoWhile we donrsquot make friends easily, wersquore exceptionally good at thinking outside the box. Nonetheless, it isnrsquot easy having thousands of thoughts running through your mind every moment, he said.Chris, who is happy to be producing high-end lesaving PPE, had this message for readers: ldquoIf you or a friend or family member are working for the NHS or any nursing home without the proper PPE please get in touch with me to arrange delivery or collection of the face shields and ear protectors.Alternatively you can help Chris fund his project by using the following link https:www.gofundme f d-printed-nhs-ppe-supplies-ni..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Club.jpg","title":"Ballynahich Youth salutes its young heroes  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Youthrsquos annual award winners have been announced.

I launched it at the school where I teach and it went down really well, everyone loved it.ldquoBut, sadly with many children loosing members of their family through Covid- the sales of the book have seen a resurgence.The Wizard and I tells the story of a young boy who visited a wizard at the bottom of his garden every time he needed advice.Ciaran added: ldquoThe wizard was always able to answer any questions the boy had, but one day the wizard wasnrsquot there. He then had to start answering questions for himself.ldquoThe boy in the story is myself as I go to visit my grandfather. The girl in the story is my daughter.

I was like a sponge and would soak up his answers to my many questions.ldquoSome years later I got married and had a family and didnrsquot have as much time to visit my grandfather until one day he wasnrsquot there any more.Ciaran says the book, which was designed to bring about a conversation about the topic of dying, can benefit adults too.ldquoMy daughter also illustrated the book.

The homes are being built at a sprawling site which borders four main roads.The redevelopment of the former hospital site includes a range of housing types including apartments, two and three storey homes and bungalows.It is also understood that the former hospital and canteen building behind it, which are both listed buildings, have been incorporated into the development plan as apartment blocks.The main entrance into the former hospital complex, off Pound Lane, will remain, while itrsquos understood that a new entrance is also proposed on the Ardglass Road side of the old Downe site.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran is pleased that contractors are back on site and hopes they are observing social distancing guidelines.He said the redevelopment will go some way towards reducing the number of people on the waiting list for social homes in Downpatrick.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThere are many families on the waiting list for social housing who are classed in the urgent need category which effectively means they are a priority for housing providers.ldquoPeople are watching construction work progress at the former hospital site and perhaps it may be possible for families to move into their new homes before the end of the year.Now that construction work has recommenced comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey confirmed that she is to introduce legislation designed to help protect the supply of new and existing social and affordable homes.She described housing as ldquoone of her priorities and said she has great ambitions to deliver more targeted to areas in the most need.ldquoTo do this, we must ensure we have the means to deliver, the minister continued, explaining that many of the changes required to existing legislation are technical in nature.Ms Hargey said the most signicant change will be an end to the compulsory need for registered housing associations to operate a house sales scheme.The minister said there will always be many challenges on the ability to deliver new social homes such as land availability, infrastructure issues and the availability of public finance, but outlined her commitment to doing all she can to deliver for those in need.Ms Hargey continued: ldquoI am committed to working with my Executivecolleagues to deliver more housing and welcome the priority afforded in the lsquoNew Decade, New Approachrsquo document which sets out how the Executivewill enhance investment and agree a new target for social and affordable home starts.ldquoFollowing the current coronavirus crisis, economic and social recovery will be vitally important for everyone. Whilst there are challenges ahead, a technicality should not stand in our way of delivery. This legislation will help to maximise the possible investment in a key public asset.Ms Hargey added: ldquoWithout a reversal of the classication decision the number of new social homes built each year would be reduced signicantly.

The organisation may also ask the Treasury to underwrite unpaid rates.Mr McCallan added: ldquoRecovery in many cases would be severely haltedthe very facilities and support to get the economy back again are severely restricted or donrsquot exist.Confirmation that Newry, Mourne and Down Council is using the furlough scheme comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey said her officials have been working with local authorities to understand the extent to which they can manage the Covid- situation by making use of the job retention scheme. She insisted that her priorities were ensuring that the rights of workers were respected and protecting jobs.The minister added: ldquoThis is a very dficult time for everybody. Our  councils provide very important s and services, continuing to do so during this emergency and looking ahead councils need to be ready to play their part in the economic recovery.A spokesman for Newry, Mourne and Down Council confirmed that the organisation will avail of the coronavirus job retention scheme.He explained that it will apply to employees who work in services where there is loss of income due to the Covid- pandemic and who cannot be redeployed to do other work.The spokesman added: ldquoThis falls in line with guidance from the Department for Communities.

This gaming  is an ever developing technology that makes training a lot more bearable and safer during those cold dark winter nights.With Zwt providing social rides, workouts, structured programmes and competitive racing, it has something for every cyclist mdash and, recently, runners too mdash all from the comfort of your home.So obviously when socialdistancing and lockdown struck, the footfall on Zwt rocketed. I suddenly noticed Shimna Wheelers numbers were increasing, from three or four of us to over a dozen.All were using it for dferent reasons. Alex McMath, Ronan Kelly, Jimmy McVeigh and myself were trying to maintain fitness and, with the aid of other apps, to socialise while riding and basically enabling a virtual club ride during lockdown. To fit in with family le these normally occur early morning or late evening.Along with Kieran Connolly, Brian McLornan and Andrew Porter, we are involved in racing leagues organised by Newry Wheelers and Cycling Ireland. The Cycling Ireland league races are broadcast live on Saturday mornings on YouTube.On the racing side, there has been plenty of banter between club members regarding weight and power. The races are seriously competitive, as they usually run in conjunction with other nationsrsquo leagues, and are pretty punishing on the body.Each of us knows our limits but with some choice words of encouragement via headphones during races, these limits can be surpassed. Jimmy is usually on the receiving end of the stick but generally backs it up in the races. Brian is beginning to settle into this new style of racing and improving with every outing.On our latest outing in the Newry League, only Kieran, Brian and myself made the start line and after a measured effort off the start we all ended up in the same group on the road, which was perfect.With the course being flat it was of utmost importance to stay in the draft of the group to preserve energy. Irsquom first to admit that both Kieran and Brian are much stronger riders than myself but with more experience on Zwt I was able to hang onto the group for longer than I expected.The three of us worked hard within the group, but with only six kilometres left we had slipped off the back of our group. I knew I was nearly done and with one last big effort Kieran and myself managed to close the gap to the group and Kieran and Brian were back in business.I was toast and reduced to riding to the finish alone, while the other lads were still firmly in the mix. They both had learnt their lesson and rode the last six kilometres well up in the group, covering every move.By the time the final sprint came Brian had recovered and shot out of the group to take the honours.Kieran rolled in a few places behind him, having succeeded in putting in a great sht during the whole race. I finished a couple of minutes down, but happy that I was able to help for a change. The next round will hopefully see a bigger Shimna turnout.Danny Carville, Barry Fettes, John Irwin and Marty McIlmail are involved in structured programmes and have found the daily training process very helpful during lockdown.One member, Brian Spence, is even using Zwt to recover from a skiing injury, while Lavelle Grant and Johnny Ward have just joined the ranks.Many other local clubs mdash such as Dromara, Newry, Killinchy, Ards and North Down mdash are experiencing similar interest due to the uncertainty of real cycling events this year.There is a lot of interaction between them and good communication, to the point that I believe it has made the whole Irish cycling community stronger and closer than it has been for a long time, helped mainly by the Zwt Community Team Irelandproviding a national sense of belonging in these dficult times.With riders from every county and of every ability itrsquos a credit to the likes of Alan Campbell, from Dromara, who has become heavily involved with the development of ZCTIrl, that this community is increasing daily.Of course Zwt is a global  and each country has its own community, but I believe that the Irish one is as strong as any in the world.Zwt is also being put to other good uses, with hundreds of people using the  to raise money for frontline services across the globe in this time of need.A few North Down members and myself helped raise more than pound, for the Ulster Hospital by riding the hardest course available on Zwt in around six hours. Painful, but well worth the effort.With the current situation worldwide, the cycling community is enjoying having some sort of sporting normality mdashyou call riding events with some of your heroes normality.The professional teams have followed suit and can be found riding around the same virtual world as us amateurs, training, racing and doing guest rides with their followers.There are not too many sports that can say that..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Dundrum.jpg","title":"Dundrum chef cooks his way to final of Great British Menu  ","story":"DUNDRUM chef Alex Greene has booked his place through to the coveted  Great British Menu banquet.The  year-old stunned the judges on Monday nightrsquos finals competition with a potato-based dish starter dish inspired by Belfast-born CS Lewisrsquo The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe childrenrsquosrsquo book.Alex celebrated once more by picking up host, Susan Calman, and swinging her round ndash much to the comediennersquos delight.He first started off his culinary career as a  year-old washing dishes in the Buckrsquos Head restaurant in his home village.Having once worked in Claridgersquos in London and also run his own restaurant, Top Nosh, in Annalong, Alex ed to Deanes EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, where he had worked previously, and helped it retain its Michelin star for the fth year.His dish of onion jelly, pickled onions, five dferent types of potato, a four-cheese custard, and truffle, served in a wardrobe, was described by the judges as ldquoa sophisticated, sexy, sensual masterpiece.

They also claimed the existing plant in Killyleagh is operating well below capacity and can easely accommodate with sewage from Crossgar.But local councillors Sam Osborne and Albert Colmer have been highly critical of the DoErsquos attitude towards people in the Crossgar and Killyleagh areas and say that in a supposed era of open Government and accountability, the Departmentrsquos attitude is nothing short of ldquodeplorable and diabolical.ARDGLASS ndash A former primary school could be developed as a new community facility in Ardglass, it has emerged this week.Education chiefs say they are prepared to hand over the former Ardglass Primary School at the Downpatrick Road to the local Development Association after years of neglect.The school, which closed its doors over  years ago, was to have been developed as a new library facility, and while education chiefs claim this plan is not dead yet, they are prepared to allow the former school to be redeveloped by the local group.In addition, East Down Institute officials are understood to be interested in providing outreach classes in Ardglass and local councillor Dermot Curran says he is ldquodelighted there is now movement on the future of the old building.He has unveiled plans to hold an urgent meeting between the South Eastern Education and Library Board, the Ardglass Development Association, Down Council and the East Down Institute, to discuss a way forward.CLOUGH ndash An elderly woman was the victim of a terrying ordeal last week when masked men tied her up at her Clough home for four hours.The two intruders broke into the pensionerrsquos home at around .am on Sunday morning, tying her feet and hands before demanding money and then ransacking her house.The lady eventually managed to free herself at around am and sought help from a neighbour who reported the incident to police.

Only four of the nine entries went to post with Newcastle ride Tom Newsam setting off in the lead on his own Miss Lennihan, followed by Colin McBratney on Belle Lady, owned and trained at Strangford by Joe Magee.Belle Lady came down and victory went to Midnight Auburn, owned and ridden by Downpatrickrsquos Gerry Lavery, whose son, Declan, is one of todayrsquos top local amateur riders. Miss Lennihan took second as Paddy Fitzsimons had to pull up on Heatherrsquos Braes.The winner was trained by Gerryrsquos brother, Brian, who works for Jeremy Maxwell at Ballee.

This horse took part in the fourth race, the Andi Grand Prix qualier and, with Rathfriland jockey Leo Gracey in the saddle, made all at the running to come home four s clear of Glen Keys, ridden by Paul Larkan, and Bentra Road, ridden by Tom Howley. Frankie Fitzsimons was fourth on Davy Blackrsquos Anns Penny.The winner, making his debut, ran in the colours of Rathfrilandrsquos Sam McKee, better known as Uel, who told me not all that long ago, that they arrived at the track that day in a makesht horse box and parked beside some of the lorries from top stables.The East DownshireOpen Farmers Race went to Grange Valleyrsquo, owned and trained by former good amateur Ballymenarsquos Samy Patton and ridden by Robert Steele, who rode all his runners.

There are plans for sustainable transport projects including a park and ride scheme to bring visitors into the centre of the resort with the scheme similar to the one which operates during the resortrsquos international Festival of Flight.Cllr Clarke says the Gateway project encourages people to walk and cycle more and believes that the multi-million pound scheme can provide a signicant boost for the wider district economy.He said while people are rightly preoccupied with coronavirus at the moment, work is continuing to look at the future of tourism development across the region.He added: ldquoNewcastle can play its part and we all hope that the Gateway project will not only put the resort on the map, but wider South Down area. The scheme has the potential to create new hotel and retail development, creating jobs and boosting the economy.ldquoThe project is people-driven and providing facilities for them.

Itrsquos just so unique and dferent to Northern Ireland.ldquoWe have got the Mournes on our doorstep mdash thatrsquos what really got me into enjoying the outdoors. Growing up here, snow is always a novelty, which only comes every now and again. When it does, you try and make the most of it.

If you are somewhere cold, there is always something you can do about it mdash put on an extra layer mdash but in the heat I just struggle.A former pupil of Newcastle Primary School and Down High School in Downpatrick, Kit had been to the South Pole three times before he applied for the job at Port Lockroy.

This houses the islandrsquos only shop, post office and museum.Kit explained: ldquoItrsquos quite a simplistic lestyle.

We had no means of getting off the island and had to do all our cooking, cleaning, etc. Therersquos quite a lot of work and maintenance to do and yoursquore always busy so you didnrsquot really have a lot of downtime. We got one day off in every .The high point for Kit was the stunning environment and being surrounded by all kinds of wildle.ldquoThere was loads of wildle, several penguin species such as the Gentoo, Chinstrap and Aediles, he said.ldquoYou can really see the penguins transition throughout the season. At the start they are gathering stones and building nests, by the end of the season, their new chicks are learning to swim. There are all sorts of flying birds like skuas, gulls, Southern Giant petrels, and cormorants. Sometimes you would see all kinds of fish, jelly fish, and ious types of seals and whales.ldquoYou could be washing the dishes and see a humpback whales outside.

Very soon the club appointed a manager, Clarence Robinson, and within a matter of weeks club had signed a host of players and started training.With Clarence and Sean Lavery looking after the playing side of things, John and his committee started planning off the field. The clubrsquos first presentations dinner was held in May , in the Central Park, with Northern Ireland legend Derek Dougan the guest of honour. Some of the clubs older members still talk about that night.Another first was the clubrsquos annual Christmas party for children, with John acting as Santa, and such was its popularity that committee members frequently had to rush down to the shops for more selection boxes.The club was now starting to establish itself more off the pitch than on it and the big name guests continued to arrive at the clubrsquos annual awards nights. Manchester United legend Tommy Docherty came in , Denis Law in , Liverpool legend Tommy Smith and Everton and Forest star Duncan Mackenzie in , and so it went on with John in his absolute element with Josie at his side.As the playing side of things began to improve there was nobody prouder than John when, in May , the club beat Ballycam Celtic in a play-off to win the Mourne Observer Cup and gain promotion to the Newcastle leaguersquos Premier Division.The merry-go-round of legends continued with Billy Bremner in  and the biggest name of all, Jack Charlton, arriving in  with John, proud as punch, appearing in the Belfast .In  the club had a fantastic season reaching the final of the Co Antrim Junior Shield only to lose - after conceding a golden goal. John, along with everyone , was gutted, but anyone who had been in Quinnrsquos that night would never have believed the Bears had lost.The following year the club lted the Rathmourne Cup with the second team winning the Purdy Cup and players and supporters lting the roof off the Donard Hotel in the company of Liverpoolrsquos Ian St John. What a night that was with John filling the Rathmourne Cup several times and rumours that Pete Law was required to repair the cup after a raucous night have never been confirmed or denied.Christmas  saw the Bears lting the Bobby Dalzell cup and another crazy awards night took place in the company of Emlyn Hughes.While football played a huge part in Johnrsquos le, he was very much a family man. Josie was a constant by his side at every club dinner and to everyone that knew them they were like a double act mdash terric company and great craic.John suffered a loss when his beloved Josie died, but his love of his grandchildren helped him through that dficult period. He was immensely proud of his daughter, Joanne, and loved nothing better than bringing his grandson, Callum, down to Friday night football.It was fitting that the club was able to hold its th anniversary dinner last year in the Slieve Donard Hotel where John previously worked as bar manager. John took his seat with son-in-law Mark alongside Liverpool legend Bruce Grobbelaar and it was like the good old days with John once more in his element welcoming guests and posing for pictures.It most have taken a huge effort on his part to attend but he would certainly not have missed it for anythingThe Tollymore United club, committee, players, coaches and supporters would like to offer their sincere condolences to Johnrsquos daughter Joanne, son-in-law Mark, grandchildren Callum, Clara, Alana and Harry, his sister Anne, nieces and nephews. John will be sorely missed. May he rest in peace..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11343290.jpg","title":"line up of calves win over judges at calf fair","story":"Breed judges from throughout the UK and Ireland were unanimous in their praise for the Pedigree Calf Fair and Beef NI Expo, held at the Balmoral Showgrounds in Belfast on SaturdaySpeaking after the one-day show, which featured three show rings and  native and continental beef breeds, event organiser and Chairman, David Connolly said: ldquoItrsquos been another fantastic event, and we certainly exceeded our strap-line lsquoBigger and Betterrsquo.ldquoThe  show has surpassed last yearrsquos inaugural event, attracting hundreds of spectators and more than  trade exhibits.

Republicans ever since called for a harder lockdown than the rest of the UK, and criticised the UK government for its response to the crisis. They called for businesses like Ulster Carpets, which rightly tried to keep going during the lockdown, to close.Yet for all their demand for a fierce lockdown, they were hesitant about giving extra powers to the PSNI. Ms O’Neill then criticised the health minister, Robin Swann.Sinn Fein was slow to allow cemeteries to re-open, until it came under pressure from its own community, then was slow to support church re-opening, until likewise.
