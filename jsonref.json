The Sea For Yourself campaign wants them to take pride of place on your plateFish and chips with a side order of mushy peas has been a Friday night tradition for generations. A Jewish immigrant, Joseph Malin, opened the first recorded fish and chip shop in London in 1860 and dedicated takeaways have been serving customers ever since.Yet despite this heritage, if you choose battered cod, plaice or haddock to soak up your vinegar, it’s unlikely to have been fished from UK waters: the majority of the cod and haddock we buy is imported from the Barents Sea or around Norway or Iceland.According to the Sea For Yourself campaign, which is largely funded by Defra and aims to inspire the UK to eat seafood caught in UK waters, close to half of adults would buy more seafood if they knew it was caught locally. The good news is that if you’re keen to eat more seafood that’s been caught closer to home, there’s a wealth of alternatives to choose from.We know fish is good for us and the catches found in our waters, from mussels, oysters and crab, to oil-rich mackerel and flaky lemon sole, are a great source of protein, vitamins and minerals. The NHS recommends that we should all enjoy at least two portions of fish a week, one of which should be an oil-rich variety.“Most of us are familiar with nutrition advice that encourages us to eat a wide variety of fruit and vegetables for optimal health, and it’s the same when it comes to seafood,” says Juliette Kellow, consultant nutritionist at Seafish, a non-departmental public body set up to support the UK seafood industry and funded mainly by a levy on all first-hand purchases of seafood products in the UK, including imported seafood. “Many varieties of fish provide a range of B vitamins, which help fight fatigue for those of us always on the go.“Incorporating fish such as herring, coley or hake, and shellfish like crab and mussels into your diet is smart, as they provide a great source of protein and allow you to make the most of all the health benefits seafood offers.” When you’re trying to get more variety into your diet, it makes sense to try something new.Trying a wide variety of fish dishes instead of sticking to well-worn favourites supports UK fishermen, helps stocks stay sustainable and keeps your mealtimes creative – because of course, the real beauty of seafood is its endless versatility.Four in 10 of us claim we’d be more likely to cook seafood at home if we felt more confident using it in the kitchen, and whipping up a Friday night fish supper – whether you’re angling for a pile of battered monkfish bites, a plate of simply dressed devilled herrings or a steaming bowl of moules marinière – is a lot easier than you might think.If a fish and chip supper is non-negotiable on a Friday night, beer-battered dover sole is a delicious alternative to cod, while shellfish is a great choice if you’re bored with chicken and looking for an alternative source of low-fat protein.In warmer weather, go for fresh hake with seasonal asparagus and Jersey Royals, or a poached hake salade niçoise. For something a bit different, crab thermidor is surprisingly quick to make, while fish tacos made with coley goujons make the ideal bite for sharing in front of the TV. Fresh oysters on ice or spiced coconut mussels are perfect for impressing. When the weather cools down, there’s a wealth of winter warmers to choose, from roast hake with curried stew to smoked mackerel risotto.Plenty of seafood dishes are surprisingly quick to pull together. Monkfish and coconut curry takes about 15 minutes to prepare, while an Asian-spiced crab and noodle salad with black sesame seed dressing can be on the table in 10 minutes flat. Children love fish too, which is always a bonus when faced with picky eaters – coley goujons instead of fish fingers, or mackerel fishcakes made with mash are easy weekday crowd-pleasers.We all have a favourite fish, and when you’re seafood savvy it’s not hard to find an often-overlooked alternative to your usual choice – from soft, flaky flounder to firm, boldly flavoured sprats or rainbow trout.With so much choice, you may struggle to decide what to cook, but to make things a bit easier, Seafish has created a website so you can arrange for the best of UK seafood to be delivered to your door.

Some have the luxury of a furloughed parent overseeing a schedule of home learning. But many parents are forced to leave their children to ‘self study’ while they work upstairs. Some children can run out into luxurious gardens some have no garden at all Photographer Matt Davis has portrayed children in uniform at home in Leeds to highlight the varying experiences of school kids on lockdown in one city.\u0026nbspAs a father of two young children I wanted to document what’s happening while children are in lockdown. I think it’s easy to fall into the trap of believing kids across the UK are having the same experience. I wanted to show the uniqueness of each child and their situation.Despite the challenges and restrictions, each of the children I photographed was having a positive experience and making the most of time at home before schools reopen fully.Jessica, eight, misses her ing training.

For this project she returned to her grandmother’s small flat in St Petersburg to explore themes of memory, isolation and female identity across three generations of her familyThe images in this series address questions of claustrophobic spaces. They convey a sense of being locked down, however they were taken last year before the emergence of Covid-19. They were snapped inside my grandmother’s small flat in St Petersburg, which for many years she has hardly left. As long as I can remember my grandmother’s world has conveyed a sense of being locked down. She leaves the flat once a week to get groceries and a TV guide from the shop directly below her apartment. In the winter she doesn’t leave the flat for three months because it’s too cold and windy outside, or too slippery.To keep entertained, Babushka cooks, washes dishes, mends clothes and watches TV. Under Russia’s coroanvirus lockdown measures she isn’t allowed to travel more than 200 metres from her apartment. This is something she has hardly done in the past 10 years, so her life is relatively unchanged.With the intention of exploring my Russian connections, I made two trips to the country in September and December 2019. In this small apartment I made portraits of my grandmother (Babushka), my mother (Svetlana) and myself, in various configurations. I also documented the daily routines and minutiae of my grandmother’s life – the furnishings, her food and pickles, her decor and the ubiquitous television screen that is her main connection to the outside world.The reality I’m depicting here for my grandmother has not changed much she has always lived in this way. Since my grandfather died 10 years ago, her life has become increasingly isolated. My grandmother took care of me for the first four years of my life so, for me, the apartment is like a time capsule. When I visit I am treated like I’m still a child and it doesn’t feel like much changes, though at times I have not returned for years. The routine and familiarity of life in this apartment can be both bleak and comforting and I set myself the challenge of building a visual narrative with photographs taken only within its confines. I saw this work was as the beginning of a long-term process of engagement with my family history and I hadn’t anticipated that a depiction of this claustrophobic isolation would be so pertinent to what’s happening today.My grandmother was born at the start of the second world war, which brought starvation and many other privations. She experienced temporary blindness as a child and has permanent partial deafness as a result of the war. My mother grew up in communist Russia, when travel outside of the Soviet Union was not possible. As a young woman she lived through perestroika and also experienced immense hardship there was no food on the shelves and basic items were rationed. During this time there was also a lot of fear surrounding the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.My grandmother sewing in her bedroom, one of the common places you may find her in her flat at midday.The traumas of state violence, war and gender violence weigh heavily on my family. My great grandfather, a victim of Stalin’s purges, was executed in the 1930s. I was born in Russia, but came to Britain at the age of four, after my mother fled my abusive and violent father.With this project I wanted to engage with my family history and investigate my grandmother’s life and the relationships between her, my mother and me. I felt that through exploring this one small confined space I could find something typically Russian but universally human. I am particularly interested in the idea of post-memory, and in understanding the ways family trauma may be passed down through the generations. I am also interested in how we create and project on to our own pasts.My intention is to place female narratives, so often neglected, at the centre of this project. I hope this depiction of the lives of three ordinary women will represent something universal about the bonds of love and history that connect generations of women around the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a63efc3f94fc3ec458a9f3693582d9aa97cf1026/184_1614_2629_1578/master/2629.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d938c8182c2995f6c702c9e6a4ffb0b0","title":"lubaina himid you say the magic words black lives matter buy an exclusive print","story":" Print Shop is offering readers the chance to buy an exclusive print, created for the paper by Turner prize-winning artist Lubaina Himid as the cover of a special issue on racism in the UK, that ran in the G2 section.

It took two years, the process was tortuous, the chairman and chief executive have changed, but the consumer goods giant has accepted reality. If it wants to abandon its clunky Anglo-Dutch corporate structure, legal incorporation as a single entity can only happen in the UK. It’s the only way to win a thumbs-up from shareholders.The Rotterdam proposal in 2018 would have failed if it had got to the vote because a large UK crew of shareholders hated the idea of a prized investment being thrown out of the FTSE 100 index. Those funds with UK-only mandates would not have been able to own the stock, and Unilever’s attempt to bully the index-compilers to bend the rules got nowhere, which was always the way to bet. Once Rotterdam became impossible, it had to be London.That basic arithmetic was ignored in 2018 by former boss Paul Polman, a fine chief executive but perversely blinkered on the domicile question. Was he consumed by personal loathing of Brexit? In love with the stricter Dutch takeover culture after Unilever’s brush with Kraft Heinz’s unlovely financial engineers? Or too close to Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister and former Unilever manager? None of it matters if you can’t carry the shareholders with you.Alan Jope, Polman’s successor, has done well to crack on. The dual-headed corporate structure dating back 90 years caused headaches when selling the spreads business in 2017, so it had to go. If Jope is signalling more deal-making ahead, investors are game. The best defence against future Kraft Heinzes, and the strongest guarantee of Unilever’s style of responsible capitalism, is a high share price. That’s what the company now has, roughly speaking. Unilever is jostling with Shell and AstraZeneca for the status of biggest beast in the FTSE 100.In the meantime, the UK business secretary, Alok Sharma, is pushing his luck in claiming “a vote of confidence” in the UK. No jobs rested on the domicile decision and most of Unilever’s growth will continue to come from emerging markets. The legal holding structure was really a technical issue that Unilever should never have made messy. The UK, as the bigger capital market, was always the more natural home.Here comes Chris O’Shea, new chief executive of Centrica, bursting with fresh ideas to reverse the disappointments and idend cuts of Iain Conn’s reign. Actually, no, the new boss’s first big move at the owner of British Gas is yet another round of job cuts.In fact, the 5,000 reduction seems to be a re-heat of Conn’s own plans, just accelerated by 12 months. There is, to be fair, one point of difference – a pledge to flatten bureaucracy once and for all by getting rid of half the senior management team. We’ll await results but the broader ambition to create a “a more customer-focused business model” sounds exactly what Centrica has been saying for years.Back in 2015, the company had 38,000 employees. Now it has 27,000, with the cuts to come. In the same period, the share price has fallen from 270p to 40p and exit from the FTSE 100 index looms.The challenges are well-known – the energy cap, volatile oil and gas prices, nimble independent suppliers. But it’s hard to think of another major company that has squandered the privilege of market leadership quite like Centrica has done.There’s something new for Lloyds Banking Group to file under “legacy conduct issues”: a thumping fine of £64m from the Financial Conduct Authority, plus £300m to compensate customers who weren’t treated fairly when in arrears on mortgage payments.The mystery is how a problem identified in 2011 could have taken until 2015 to resolve. The short answer seems to be inadequate training of staff and bad processes. But four years to fix? The largest bank fine for five years sounds entirely deserved."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf12c5a9ee71fe425fef844dee6e078fc3cede5f/0_74_5705_3427/master/5705.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b806331d8de3bf26e7ba2ccc419f824","title":"the guardian view on the cabinet a paucity of talent","story":"Government in Britain relies on a critical mass of serious secretaries of state. The current crop is worryingly lightweight The supreme executive body in British politics is the cabinet, chaired by the prime minister. That is the constitutional theory, but in the public imagination the system is seen as rather more presidential.Over time, prime ministers have become increasingly dominant. Harold Wilson and Margaret Thatcher had their “kitchen cabinets.” Tony Blair was criticised for operating an informal “sofa government”. In the period of coalition government after 2010, David Cameron stitched up deals in a four-man “quad”. But under Boris Johnson, the aggregation of power in Downing Street is unprecedented. It resembles a campaign more than an administration.That is not surprising given the prominence inside No 10 of figures from the Vote Leave referendum team, headed by Dominic Cummings. That faction is obsessed with information warfare and is disrespectful of Whitehall, seeing departmental structures as relics of a dysfunctional system. Cabinet ministers appear often to be mere spokespeople, subservient to Downing Street advisers who write their scripts.It takes a certain calibre of politician to resist that process. When Rishi Sunak was appointed chancellor, few expected him to stand out from Mr Johnson’s shadow. He is young, relatively inexperienced and the job came with the condition that Treasury advisers answer to No 10. But Mr Sunak has been a steady and articulate manager of the economic response to the pandemic. The hardest part – navigating a recession – is yet to come, but he invites more confidence than most of his colleagues.Another relatively independent figure is Matt Hancock, who has demonstrated some organisational grip on his department. There is plenty to criticise about the health secretary’s handling of the pandemic – equipment shortages, misused statistics, neglect of care homes – but it is hard to imagine anyone else in the cabinet doing a better job. Dominic Raab is a weak foreign secretary whose unfitness for a top job was widely displayed as he garbled inanely through a stint as stand-in, when the prime minister was ill with Covid-19. Priti Patel has brought authoritarian paranoia and bullying incompetence to a Home Office that was over-endowed with those traits already.Other departments are no more blessed. Gavin Williamson has been uninspiring in a crucial role. The education secretary has had months to devise a strategy for reopening schools but has not progressed beyond picking needless fights with unions. Even those who resent Michael Gove for the work he did as education secretary in the coalition years recognise an effective operator who directed his department towards policy implementation. Now Mr Gove brings a veteran’s heft to the cabinet office, averting an even worse shambles at the heart of government.The daily coronavirus briefing press conferences have been a showcase of absent talent. The public cannot have been impressed with the performances of Robert Jenrick, Alok Sharma and Grant Shapps. These figures have been shrunk by the size of the crisis.It is easy to be beguiled by nostalgia. There was no golden age of all-heavyweight cabinets. Some roles are by their nature reserved for less showy politicians, just as some jobs have been doled out as bribes to troublemaking rivals with no talent except for making mischief. But the chaff used to be leavened with intelligence and capability. The balance has shifted under Mr Johnson. Advancement under his reign has been dependent on a stupefying degree of loyalty to the personality cult of “Boris” and the doctrine of an ultra-hard Brexit. Independent thought and moderating pragmatism are mostly banished to the back benches.That dynamic leaves no mystery as to why the government’s handling of the coronavirus crisis is marked by indecision, inconsistency and lethal incompetence. An administration that values propaganda over governance and ideological purity over honesty is uniquely ill-suited to a public health emergency. The prime minister is the most prominent face of that failure, but his weakness is further exposed by the flimsy cabinet. Behind the coronavirus crisis is a crisis of government, made all the more serious by a conspicuous shortage of ministers who have shown that they deserve to be taken seriously."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/318e19a93956553747db53b74267bbe3d6ee56d7/0_140_5250_3150/master/5250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f4d7824d7d1a705e868a117a0362884","title":"i dont feel i can say no parents torn on sending children back to school","story":"The U-turn on a full reopening in England has fuelled the debate on the rights and wrongs of a return After the government’s U-turn over the full reopening of schools before September in England, parents remain ided about whether to send their children back.  spoke to some parents about their decision.My son is supposed to be sitting his A-levels next year. I’ve got a friend whose son is at private school, and our children don’t get nearly the same experience. There are subject areas where we haven’t really heard anything from the teachers, and work is being submitted with no feedback. My son is worried about it, he tells me there are some subjects where he just Googles the answer. I’m worried about the impact on his education, but we are at high-risk for coronavirus – our family is AsianPakistani, and my partner is shielding. We’ve decided my son is going back to school for one day a week, which is what the school have offered. Obviously there is a worry, but he wants to go, and I don’t feel I can say no to that.\u0026nbspSarah (not her real name), 50, LondonMy 14-year-old child is a Send student (special educational needs and disabilities) and she’s really happy at home. I know this isn’t the case for everyone, but lots of children are really flourishing, particularly Send pupils who are in mainstream schools.My daughter attends a special school that is fantastic for autism. They have far fewer children but their needs are very different. Those children can be impulsive, they may need physical contact, and not be able to socially distance. Everywhere else has social distancing measures, but you just can’t do that at school. Children will naturally gravitate together and I know as a teacher myself that after months off the first thing they want to do is hug you.\u0026nbspI’m certainly not in a rush for my child to go back. While schools have been brilliant, I feel dismayed that this government is willing to play Russian roulette with our children and school staff. It feels like children are pawns in this game. Susan Wright, 45, north-west England\u0026nbspThere’s been very little direct contact with the school. There’s no sense that our daughter’s work is being marked, and she’s not getting any feedback, so it’s becoming really difficult to stay motivated. We try our best, but with our jobs we can’t dedicate the time to her education that we’d like.At first it was a novelty, like a summer holiday, but now we can see there’s a withdrawal. She’s our only child, so there isn’t even that sibling contact, and that’s really difficult. She’s in touch with her close mates, but she’s missing out on the wider, social importance of being with other children on a day-to-day basis.\u0026nbspWe can see the damage that not going to school is having far more clearly than the perceived damage of the virus. Gary Jones, 43, BirminghamMy daughter is in year 1, and is too young to operate her iPad alone, for things like Microsoft Teams classes. I have an extremely busy work schedule, and it was totally impossible for me to do work and home-guided learning. The isolation and lack of interaction with other children was also extremely important to me. She’s five years old and an only child, so she needs and wanted to be in a school setting with her friends. As soon as the opportunity to resend her was available, I grabbed it with both hands. After about a week she told me she didn’t want to go to school because it wasn’t the same. She didn’t have her usual class teacher, she wasn’t in the same group as before, or in the same physical space, and didn’t have access to the same facilities. Some of her closer friends were in the other bubble. But a day later, when I picked her up, she was bouncing and skipping again. Teaching is a profession, and it’s not possible to imitate that. I found it absolutely gruelling, start to finish. For so many of us, the choice is just not there. Yvonne Ndege, 41, LondonI have one daughter who is adopted, and foster three girls. They’re studying for A-levels and GCSEs, and one is transitioning to high school, but no one is telling me what to do. We had to ask school for laptops because the ones we had at home weren’t set up for home learning, but they only gave us one, so all four kids have to share.I’m really worried about the educational impact. Two of them have educational care plans, but that’s all been put on hold because they’re working remotely.\u0026nbspBecause they’re fostered, we were told the girls had to go to school throughout lockdown, but when they went in, they were told that if they had internet access at home, it was safer for them there. The government say they want the older girls to have some face-to-face teaching before the end of term, but we haven’t been told anything.As for my daughter, I’m not going to send her back. She came to me when she was young, but I don’t have her medical history for the years before she was with me. Kids need structure, so we’ve been doing our own curriculums as well as school work. They’re cooking, sewing, and getting to know themselves. We’ve been doing a lot of black history because the girls are from Africa, and building emotional intelligence during this time instead. Esi, 52, LondonMy husband and I are key workers, so we had a place at school, but we were worried about sending them back. When I started a new job in late March, I really needed total headspace, and my colleagues encouraged me to take up a place. There were very few children in, my two kids, who are seven and nine, doubled the figures, and the headteacher told me about the provisions they had put in place to keep them safe, so I decided to send them in. When I picked them up on their first day, they were beaming, and told me it was way better than ‘mummy school’. I didn’t realise they needed to go back to school as much as they obviously did.Now other year groups have come back, they’re split into pods, sorted roughly by age, and my kids seem to be loving it. They have adjusted easily to new routines like a “soap train” for handwashing, and loved the sense of ownership of having their own dedicated desk and earphones.A lot of my mum friends say they’ve been discouraged from sending kids in to keep them safe, but I’m encouraging them to do it.

Now it’s finally over. I am very happy for the person who found it.”An eccentric New Mexico millionaire named Forrest Fenn said he hid the bronze chest in the Rockies in 2010. The only clues to the prize’s whereabouts were located in a cryptic 24-line poem written by Fenn and added to the last pages of his autobiography, The Thrill of the Chase.“Begin it where warm waters halt  And take it in the canyon down,  Not far, but too far to walk.  Put in below the home of Brown,” reads the second stanza of Fenn’s poem that would send treasure hunters to scour five western states.\u0026nbspOn 7 June, Fenn, a former air force fighter pilot turned art and antiquities dealer, told the Santa Fe New Mexican newspaper that a man from the eastern US had recently located his treasure, which has variously been valued anywhere from $1m to $2m. According to Fenn’s website, it was found “under a canopy of stars in the lush, forested vegetation of the Rocky Mountains and had not moved from the spot where I hid it more than 10 years ago”.Neither the name of the finder nor the location of the treasure has been disclosed. “I do not know the person who found it, but the poem in my book led him to the precise spot,” Fenn wrote on his website.\u0026nbspThe discovery marks the end of a modern-day treasure hunt unlike any in history.“This has been a horrible ending to something that has been so extremely important in my life for eight years,” said Cynthia Meachum, who is part of a vibrant “chase” community of Fenn treasure seekers. “It has affected me a lot more than I thought it ever would.”According to Fenn, the idea that came to inspire so many was conceived in 1988 after he was diagnosed with cancer.\u0026nbspThe prospect of death made him think to leave part of his fortune, and even his own bones,\u0026nbspin a treasure chest somewhere in the mountains. When Fenn recovered, the idea persisted, and he meticulously curated the contents of the chest for years.\u0026nbspFenn described a “necklace that’s about 2,000 years old, and it has fetishes made out of quartz crystal and cast gold jaguar claws, and it’s absolutely wonderful”, in a 2018 interview with the . “There are two ancient Chinese jade carvings of human faces.\u0026nbspYou just want to cry when you see them.”Fenn hoped the treasure would be an adventure that could get people “off the couch” and into the outdoors. “He provided us all with great adventure,” said Dent, who searched twice a week for years in northern New Mexico.Yet in the course of looking for Fenn’s chest, as many as five people have died, and Fenn has been criticized for endangering lives, enabling an unhealthy obsession, and even lying about the treasure’s existence.“I would implore him that he stop this nonsense,” the New Mexico state police chief, Pete Kassetas, said after a treasure hunter’s body was retrieved from the Rio Grande River in 2017, days after he had gone missing. He told ABC: “I want people to have fun, and I want people to be adventurous, but the reality is when you have $2m or so, as it’s rumored to be, at stake, people make poor decisions.”There are the stories of people quitting their jobs and emptying their bank accounts to join the chase. Fenn himself has received death threats and been the victim of break-in attempts at his house.\u0026nbspOthers have claimed the whole thing is an outright hoax.\u0026nbsp“I believe there never was any hidden treasure,” said Linda Bilyeu, the ex-wife of Randy Bilyeu, who died searching for the treasure. “Fenn is a corrupt man who seeks attention any which way he could achieve.”The controversy has continued even after its purported discovery. The absence of photos or information on the location of the chest has led some to question whether it was found at all – though Fenn has promised to elaborate in the coming days.“Give us something, so we know if we were close,” said Meachum, who made 200 trips and invested thousands of hours. “ I have no closure at this point.”“A third think it’s a hoax,” said Dent. “A third think it was never found.\u0026nbspAnd then there are the rest of us that think this is great.\u0026nbspSomeone found it. Now let’s move on with our lives.”Even so, she felt enriched by the quest, if not the actual treasure.The victor “did something tens of thousands of people have failed to do.\u0026nbspIf I could say anything to the finder, I would tell him congratulations.\u0026nbspWe wish you all the happiness in the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b994e7f2b5be6a239425e8a6131ab8aacb64c66/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e96c68ba10af96dfeda361373761646c","title":"swim good 10 of the best ethical swimwear pieces","story":"Two-pieces and one-pieces chosen by  styling editor Melanie Wilkinson for their sustainable credentials"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c7dfe015004491eec18969c09612d4028f798d2/0_144_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1509c93b5c2481f6bc3047fc45789915","title":"artemis fowl review judi dench kenneth branagh eoin colfer novels","story":"Kennth Branagh directs this family-fantasy-by-numbers adapted from Eoin Colfer’s bestselling teen novelsAfter the film version of Cats, the world agreed that Judi Dench could never,\u0026nbspshould never do anything as bizarre as her performance as Old Deuteronomy, the bafflingly attired matriarch of the Jellicle cat tribe, wearing a fur coat in addition to her normal fur. But now Dench might actually have topped her feline folly, in this family fantasy adventure, adapted by Conor McPherson and Hamish McColl from Eoin Colfer’s bestselling novels about the teen Irish hero in touch with magical forces and directed by Kenneth Branagh. She plays someone called Commander Root, who is the security chief of the fairy peoples who live deep underground. (It was a man in the book, but no male actor could be gruffer than Dench is here.)\u0026nbspDench is styling a very notable military-style outfit in emerald green, which makes her look like some forgotten intergalactic villain from Star Wars. Root has a growly, twangy, slightly Cornish voice yet it was only when she appeared in full uniform, including a sinister peaked cap, and said “top o’ the morning,” that I said out loud: “Judi Dench is supposed to be\u0026nbspIrish!”The last time I heard that phrase used to denote Irishness, however ironically, was when Colin Farrell played Bullseye, the Irish supervillain in the little-loved Marvel movie Daredevil (2003) and Farrell turns out to be in this as well, phoning in his performance for the fantastically dull role of Artemis Fowl Sr, the wealthy and reclusive connoisseur of Irish myth and legend who understands what most do not – that the fairies and little folk are real. When Fowl Sr is kidnapped by a fairy gone rogue, it is his troubled but brilliant 12-year-old son Artemis Fowl Jr (Ferdia Shaw) who has to save him, and deal with this evil abductor’s ransom demand for the fairy-folk’s most precious artefact: the Aculos, the key that governs the fairies’ control of their own domain and their entrance to the human world. But this Aculos is missing. How on earth is young Artemis supposed to get it? Fortunately, his destiny is to coincide with that of an audacious young fairy under Root’s command: Holly Short (Lara McDonnell) and also a roguish and somewhat Hagridian “giant dwarf” called Mulch Diggums (Josh Gad). Nonso Anozie plays Artemis’s bodyguard and martial-arts trainer, Butler. Together, Artemis and Butler wear some men-in-black-type suits and ties.Dench has one or two moderately funny lines (“Get the fffff … four-leaf clover out of here,” she stutters at one stage) and there is an amusing setpiece when the fairies impose a kind of mass-hypnotic time-freeze situation on an Italian wedding where a giant, grisly troll is about to run amok, so that Holly can neutralise the horrible beast without any of the humans there remembering afterwards what has happened. (Again, a bit of a men-in-black idea.) Images and characters bounce around like shapes on a screensaver and only McDonnell and Gad’s performances have any fizz. This is a YA-franchise by numbers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1b32d24370e54238a217fb028c0d0e54e786156/48_0_1499_900/master/1499.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4941c1161b7fe397680dd6f1b652b4c","title":"gulabo sitabo review amitabh bachchan ayushmann khurrana shoojit sircar drama","story":"Amitabh Bachchan and Ayushmann Khurrana star in Shoojit Sircar’s puzzling tale of class and property management The first big Indian release of 2020 to ert towards streaming is an offbeam, strangely mismanaged parable about property management that renders its stars all but unrecognisable. The established Amitabh Bachchan is buried beneath old-age latex and thick-lensed glasses emergent pin-up Ayushmann Khurrana is weighed down by a (presumably prosthetic) middle-aged spread. However director Shoojit Sircar’s gaze keeps drifting beyond them, to a location you couldn’t make-under: a mildewing Lucknow mansion house, lorded over by Bachchan’s shuffling miser Mirza, ever looking for ways to kick Khurrana’s collected waifs-and-strays to the kerb. The curious, altogether tentative drama that ensues may be as close as any film-maker has come to signing off on a Hindi redo of TV’s Rising Damp.Alas, it’s also one of those cases where forced idiosyncrasy tries the patience from an early stage. With 2015’s sharp, breezy Piku and 2018’s delicate but involving October, Sircar had nudged Indian commercial cinema in a rewarding, naturalistic direction but this just feels like a strain. A laboured first half scopes out the characters’ dingy surrounds without threatening to go anywhere, and feet are apparently being dragged because Sircar and generally reliable screenwriter Juhi Chaturvedi aren’t themselves sure which direction to move in. Brakes are soon applied to the mounting narrative of landlord-tenant class war – “Parasite!”, yells Mirza, reminding us of a more decisive film on a similar subject – in favour of a softer landing as both antagonists fall prey to creeping gentrification.While the supporting cast successfully suggest a bustling, mutually sustaining community, the stars come to seem like liabilities, which wasn’t the case with Sircar’s previous films. Bachchan works hard at his swaddled meanie character, but make-up and props are doing most of the work, work that ultimately serves to distance actor from audience. A tired-seeming Khurrana, meanwhile, presents as blandly anonymous, reducing a final push for pathos to a limp shrug. Everyone appears at the mercy of shaky narrative foundations even a cursory survey would suggest that whatever happened on this story’s journey to the screen, vital elements just didn’t take. You watch puzzled as – like the ageing pile at the story’s centre – the film flakes, moulders and crumbles before you.• Gulabo Sitabo is available on Amazon Prime from 12 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79c23b3dbf276654464cf7447cdbe8cafc584c2e/0_402_4498_2699/master/4498.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35e3f00ea51861c693579503ac00d4a5","title":"premier league project restart the key questions answered","story":"The clubs have agreed upon a set of regulations before next week’s resumption of top-flight games behind closed doorsThe 20 clubs unanimously approved the matchday protocols on player health and safety on Thursday, meaning the final phase of Project Restart has been passed and next week’s fixtures are free to go ahead.Each player, coach and member of essential staff – such as medical personnel – will fill out a screening questionnaire and undergo a temperature check when they arrive at the stadium. They will also present a “clinical passport”. That will take the form of a barcode, probably on their phone but possibly on paper, that is scanned to ascertain their Covid-19 status. If they have tested negative for Covid-19 in the previous five days, they will be allowed to enter. Around 300 people will be inside a stadium at each game all will have their temperatures checked but only those who require entry to the “red zone” – the pitch, dressing rooms, tunnel and technical areas – will need to show their Covid-19 status.They will enter a pared-back environment, with the priority being that two-metre physical distancing and good hygiene are enforceable. Work is under way to reconfigure venues where necessary. Changing rooms will be used where possible but it is likely that, particularly in smaller grounds, bigger rooms such as hospitality suites may have to be adapted. Teams are not allowed to enter the pitch side-by-side and may come on via different entrances.Handshaking will be banned, with spitting and the clearing of nostrils also prohibited. Players will use their own drinks bottles during water breaks, allowed midway through each half, and will be required to use hand sanitiser when they enter and leave the pitch. Technical areas will be increased in size to reflect the increased number of substitutes and the distance required between them. Post-match showers will be allowed at a physical distance. Medical staff will wear PPE – although not full emergency PPE – when treating players on the pitch or in the changing room.Not officially. The league expects players to be accustomed to the behavioural changes. If players forget them and, for example, shake hands or spit, they will be reminded after the game. There is nothing in the laws of the game to accommodate a specific sanction.Players may wear masks through choice but they are not compulsory. They will not be required to wear them on the bench or when arriving at games, as has occurred in the Bundesliga.Yes. Broadcast media duties may be conducted outdoors, around the perimeter of the pitch and at a safe distance, after the game. Press conferences may be held via Zoom for the 25 written media likely in attendance.Many clubs will use two coaches and their providers have taken steps to reconfigure them, such as placing seats back to back. Coach drivers are included in the Covid-19 testing programme. The league is encouraging teams to fly on longer-haul trips. Some clubs are chartering larger planes than normal to accommodate physical distancing. The league has been impressed by some of the imaginative solutions clubs have used to ensure they can safely get from A to B.The Premier League is asking them to avoid this but accepts that government guidelines allow an exemption for athletes to use hotels and that for some clubs – such as Norwich – there are distance issues that necessitate overnight stays.This situation is not anticipated but they would be sent home and told to self-isolate. The match may still go ahead but it would depend on the situation.

Parkrun sadly remains in hibernation but everything else has bloomed. In my local park there are the joggers, cyclists, speed walkers, guys doing chin-ups on the goalposts, iniduals stretching on mats, small groups doing workouts and the yoga enthusiasts with their sun salutations. Meanwhile, next door, the neighbours are impressively in the back yard every morning, hamstrings at the ready for Joe Wicks.Before the coronavirus, the gym industry was booming. Ten million people – one in seven of the entire population – had a gym membership and as a country we were spending a record £5bn on keeping fit.Almost all of that spending has come to a shuddering halt, with Britain’s 7,000 gyms and leisure centres still firmly shut. Will enough of us ever go back, now that new habits have been formed (the expansion in cycling is remarkable) and we have learned how to keep fit without paying costly monthly fees?People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, according to new guidance from the World Health Organization, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask.The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used.The WHO says masks should be made of three layers – with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and – more importantly – because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.Reopening day for leisure facilities is scheduled for 4 July, with gyms in stage three of the government’s Covid-19 recovery roadmap. But if they do reopen on that date, they will look very, very different. In Switzerland, when gyms reopened in May after a two-month lockdown, members were told to arrive and leave in their gym clothes to avoid changing rooms, group exercise classes were banned as they simply couldn’t feasibly meet two-metre distancing requirements in studios, while lots of fitness machines were marked out of bounds. Users are expected to thoroughly wipe down every machine after use, with an army of cleaners thoroughly disinfecting the kit every hour.The keenest users of gyms – urban 20- to 40-year-olds – have been among the worst hit by coronavirus job losses, which will only magnify when the furlough scheme ends. Monthly direct debits to the gym will be the first thing to be scrubbed.What’s more, many gyms are now in the wrong place. If office workers do not return in any number until after the summer, with a possible permanent increase in working from home, city centre gyms will start to look somewhat redundant.The gym chain owner and former Dragons’ Den star Duncan Bannatyne believes people prefer the more structured exercise routines that gyms offer.“We recently asked our members if they would be confident to return to their local health club in June or July if the correct safety measures are in place and more than two-thirds agreed they would,” he said as he joined a campaign launched this week to back the safe reopening of gyms.We can also be certain that the allure of outdoor activity will lessen into autumn. Who is really going to work out in the park on a cold, dark and miserable evening in November?But, ahem, what about the delicate matter of sweat? Can’t say I fancy a cloud of no-pain, no-gain sweat wafting into me as I venture through a gym in an era of coronavirus.The industry knows it’s the question on the lips of many a club user. In a myth-busting Q\u0026ampA guide sent to the clubs by ukactive this week, the very first question is: “Can you pass Covid-19 from sweat?” And their answer? “No, there is no current evidence that the virus can be spread by perspiration (sweat).” It cites the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, although it admits there is “limited data available on sweatperspiration”.In truth, the industry is putting a brave face on calamitous times. It knows that thousands of gyms and leisure operators could be forced out of business by crippling rent payments, which come back into effect at the end of this month.That’s an issue for returning gym goers, too. Who is going to pay upfront for another 12-month gym membership to a club teetering on bankruptcy?Unless the industry follows the Ryanair playbook and offers huge cut-price offers to get us back, or receives a government leg-up (it is pushing hard for a cycle-to-work-style tax rebate on gym membership), then it faces grim times indeed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26278156c75784985bae2cb1ff1232b3c2c922a7/0_2_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56a32bfda860658e5af8bb470fb8e92d","title":"relative ran up 1000 phone credit but cant get a refund","story":"Vodafone isn’t able to override its computer system and get her the money backA relative in her eighties has managed to accrue a credit of nearly £1,000 on her Vodafone pay-as-you-go mobile. She believed she had to top up her credit regularly using a top-up card, partly due to texts from Vodafone warning her that she’d lose her free minutes and rewards unless she did.Vodafone says it is willing to refund her but is unable to do so unless she uses a debit card to top up the account further, so her bank details are with the account. However, this is not possible as the system does not allow debit card payments if the credit balance is more than £700.Several hours on the telephone have established that there is apparently nobody, in one of the biggest companies in the world, able to override a computer system in order to manually link a customer’s bank details with a mobile phone account and process a refund. She only uses the phone rarely, so reducing the balance by £300 is likely to take many more years than her remaining life.GW, CumbriaIt is dismaying that Vodafone continued to text incentives to top up the account when the credit was already eye-watering. And it’s concerning that there is no upper credit limit to prevent such errors, especially since there is no obligation on telecoms firms to refund unused credit if a customer switches provider.Vodafone finally found a way round the problem when contacted by the Observer. It turned out the PAYG account was linked to the details of a grandson who had helped her set it up in store years previously.“We’d like to say sorry for the experience, and we have arranged to refund her the full amount,” it says. “We acknowledge that customers shouldn’t be able to run up such credit levels on our pay-as-you-go services.

I’m lucky enough to be in the position I’m in and I’ve heard people often dismiss the idea of racism existing in Britain by saying, ‘If the country’s so racist how have you become a success?!’ And I reject that with this: I am not the UK’s shining example of what supposedly happens when a black person works hard. There are millions of us. We are not far and few. We have to fight against the odds of a racist system stacked against us and designed for us to fail from before we are even born. Black people have been playing on an uneven field for far too long and this pledge is a continuation in the fight to finally try and even it.The donation, described as the “beginning of a lifetime commitment” from him and his company #Merky, comes amid a huge backlash against the killing of George Floyd, and a renewed fight against racism in the US, UK and elsewhere. He urged others to join him in pledging to causes that support black people.Stormzy was reportedly seen at the Black Lives Matter protests in London’s Parliament Square last weekend, and has frequently been outspoken on race and British politics.In December 2019, he said in an interview with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that “Britain has a racism problem it doesn’t like to admit”, and that Boris Johnson “encourages hate among others”.He said British people “feel encouraged. It’s like Trump … Before people had to hide their racism … Now these people have the confidence to come out in public to say everything.”In 2016, following the police killings of Alton Sterling, Philando Castile and other black Americans in the US, he said: “All I can do is urge everyone to do more, that’s what I’m going to do. Protest, march, donate, speak out, call out bullshit, build within your community, help those in need etc. Whatever it is that needs to be done.”That year, he also launched #MerkyBooks, an imprint within Penguin Random House to publish writing “from underrepresented communities”.\u0026nbspMalorie Blackman, Derek Owusu and Stormzy himself are among the writers on the roster.Numerous other cultural figures have donated to causes in the wake of the Floyd killing, and amid global Black Lives Matter protests. Korean group BTS, who are the world’s biggest boy band, donated $1m to Black Lives Matter, with the donation later matched by fans via a crowdfunding initiative.Canadian R\u0026ampB singer the Weeknd, who spent 14 weeks in the UK Top 3 earlier this year with his single Blinding Lights, donated $500,000 across three organisations: Black Lives Matter, Know Your Rights Camp and National Bail Out. He added: “To my fellow respected industry partners and execs—no one profits off of black music more than the labels and streaming services. I urge you to go big and public with yours this week. It would mean the world to me and the community if you can join us.”Lady Gaga announced a range of social justice initiatives that she was donating to, while stars including Harry Styles and Drake have donated to bail funds for protesters.Stormzy was scheduled to be on a world tour throughout 2020, playing 55 dates across five continents​, but these shows have steadily been postponed due to coronavirus.​ He is currently at No 7 in the UK charts with the track I Dunno alongside rappers Tion Wayne and Dutchavelli."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dee5ff44aab9bcc760c6836c97e3473272330421/0_304_3884_2331/master/3884.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39627f9c57ee620cad24b28545e30f9b","title":"classical music opera livestream at home coronavirus","story":"With concert halls and opera houses closed, organisations and musicians across the world are livestreaming concerts and opening up their digital archivesPlease note: this page is updated regularly.

I have seen this letter, and I abhor this isive identity politics that’s being levelled at Priti Patel. I’m incredibly proud to be part of the most erse government in history.”Former chancellor Sajid Javid called the letter “utterly misguided and irresponsible”.“Imagine listening to an ethnic-minority woman’s history of suffering racist abuse - and then deciding that you’d rather condemn the victim than her abusers,” he tweeted.The letter was coordinated by the shadow community cohesion minister, Naz Shah, and was also signed by other senior Labour MPs including Tulip Siddiq, Kate Osamor, Chi Onwurah, Seema Malhotra, Dawn Butler and Rosena Allin-Khan.In a Commons debate on Monday, the Labour MP Florence Eshalomi suggested the government did not understand the anger felt by people and the desire to tackle structural racism.Patel told the Commons she was “really, really saddened” by Eshalomi’s criticism and added: “It must have been a very different home secretary who as a child was frequently called a Paki in the playground, a very different home secretary who was racially abused in the streets or even advised to drop her surname and use her husband’s in order to advance her career.In the letter, the Labour MPs tell Patel that “being a person of colour does not automatically make you an authority on all forms of racism” and that experiences should not be used to “silence” others.They write: “In conclusion, we ask you to reflect on your words and to consider the impact it had towards black communities in the UK trying to highlight their voices against racism.\u0026nbsp“Rest assured that Asian and ethnic minority colleagues on this side of the house will not use their experiences to silence our black colleagues, but will use our shared experiences to stand behind them and support their voices to lead us on standing up against the distinct form of racism black communities in the UK and across the globe face.”Patel said on Monday that “thugs and criminals” would be brought to justice for pockets of violence at the largely peaceful anti-racism demonstrations in London at the weekend."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f175d583cc5f1d439dfaf4e4420bd8a60232ff8/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36bf20954ab1ae039fbd53758dbc8c9d","title":"novelty of being on tv wears off for matt hancock as he defends app","story":"It was clear Hancock’s news on track and trace would not be good, or else Boris would have given itYou could tell the news wasn’t going to be that great when we got the cast list. If the new track and trace system had been an overwhelming success, there would have been every chance that Boris Johnson would have rolled out of bed to take the credit. Instead, we got Matt Hancock, everybody’s favourite punchbag, still wearing his favourite pink tie that has so far brought him nothing but bad luck.It’s hard not to feel just a little sorry for Matt. His vaulting ambition that led him to ignore all his gut instincts about having nothing to do with a Boris Johnson government has brought him nothing but hubris. He knew Boris was a wrong ‘un from the off. He even said as much during his short-lived campaign to be Tory party leader last summer. But when faced with a choice of acting on principle or grasping whatever cabinet post was going begging, Mattbeth chose the latter.His eyes are now dead, his shoulders slumped. The enjoyment of being on TV at the Downing Street press conference – The lights! The greasepaint! – has long since worn off. Because he knows he only ever gets the crap gigs. The ones that no one else wants to do. And even Westminster’s very own Mr Tigger, a man who could once achieve orgasm just by polishing his enamel NHS badge, can’t even muster a veneer of enthusiasm. The briefing is just a chore to be rushed through while giving away as little information as possible.Matt began with the usual white noise. Although the number of cases was actually up from a day earlier, the figures continued to fall. Er, hello? It was clear that neither Matt nor the person who had written this crap had bothered to make sure if it made any sense. He had a plan and it was working. It would just have been nice to know that the government had been hell-bent on killing more than 50,000 people – and counting – right from the start of the pandemic.“The system will be world class,” he added hopefully. This sounded like more of an aspiration for some time in the future and certainly a significant downgrade on “world beating”. Nor was there any attempt to explain why it was taking so long to implement the system. Most other countries had seen test, track and trace as an essential weapon in fighting coronavirus back in February we had only really got round to thinking about it seriously a month or so ago.Matt ended with a final plea. He understood people’s anger about Black Lives Matter but could people please stick to the rules and keep to small, socially distanced groups of six. Not for the first time during this public health crisis, satire had to take a back seat. Because the person the health secretary was about to hand over to was Dido Harding, the new chief executive of track and trace, who in a previous job on the board of the jockey club had let the Cheltenham festival go ahead when many other health experts were suggesting it should be cancelled.So it’s going to take Typhoid Dido quite a while until the number of people she’s prevented from getting the coronavirus outweighs the number she’s helped to infect. Which might help to explain why at least one third of the people who had been tracked down refused to give any details of their contacts. But on the plus side, they had manage to pick up about 32,000 contacts which meant that the 25,000 track and tracers had managed to make just over one successful call each over the past week. Making Britain Great Again.Come the questions, Door Matt got noticeably tetchier as journalist after journalist expressed their disappointment in the new system. Wouldn’t it have been better to wait until track and trace was working properly before easing lockdown measures? “No,” said Hancock. Because when it was world class it would be world class. There was no arguing with that.Nor could he give any further updates on his world beating app which only a month ago he had insisted would give the UK the edge in beating coronavirus. Matt just pretended he had never said the app was going to be any great shakes and that it would be ready when it was ready. As in never.Typhoid Dido did briefly try to come to the rescue. She was sure things would improve and that the track and tracers would soon be able to get hold of at least two people a week once they had learned to stop sending contacts texts at 3am. Teething problems and all that.She also said she had had one call from someone who had been delighted to be contacted as that had got him out of a barbecue. That must have been from someone on the Isle of Wight who had been due to go for drinks at the deputy editor of the Spectator’s house, where the guest list had included Tory MP, Bob Seely, Brexit chairman Richard Tice and journalist Isabel Oakeshott. Being told you had to self-isolate for 14 days would be a small price to pay to avoid that particular nightmare."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa428b80d9273029c093eeba4624b561530fad96/346_355_1157_695/master/1157.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebf3266cc484cb7e434cacfa964b7579","title":"support bubbles what is new policy in england and how does it work","story":"Ministers have announced a targeted relaxation of lockdown rules to alleviate lonelinessThe government has said it wants to alleviate the loneliness and isolation of people most affected by social restrictions. It emphasises that this is a “targeted intervention” directed at those who have been cut off from family and friends during lockdown. So what does the new law mean?What’s happening?In England, from 13 June, if you live by yourself or are a single parent with dependent children – in other words, if there is only one adult in your home – you can expand your household to include one other household of any size. These are being called support bubbles.So can grandparents now visit their grandchildren and have them to stay in their own homes?Yes and no. One grandparent who lives on their own can form a bubble with one of their grown-up children. But families with two lone grandparents need to choose which grandparent they link up with.Can my partner stay the night with me?Yes, as long as one of you lives alone and you’re in an exclusive bubble.What about parents who have separated but who have children under 18?You’re already allowed to operate as though you’re in a bubble. You can form a bubble with another household, as long as it contains only a single adult.I live alone but I’m shielding. Can I form a bubble?\u0026nbspAfraid not. But the government will be setting out further advice next week targeting this group.Can I be in a bubble if I’m clinically vulnerable or have a higher risk of catching coronavirus?If you are at a higher risk of exposure (for example, if someone in your house is a healthcare worker), you should take particular care when deciding whether to form a bubble and with whom.What can I do in a bubble?You can behave as though you live under the same roof with the other people in your bubble: you’re one big family. You can also share things such as sport or garden equipment.Are bubbles safe?The risk of infection rises with the number of people in a bubble and the number of interactions you have with people you do not live with. Good hygiene remains important even for those in the same bubble: keep washing your hands and sneezing into a tissue.How can I get to those in my bubble?There is no limit on how far you can travel but the government recommends that you form a bubble with someone who lives locally, so that you can continue to avoid using public transport and can cycle or walk if possible.I’ve chosen my bubble. Is there anything I can’t do?You can’t change your mind. You can’t swap bubbles or expand them to include more than one household.What happens if someone in my support bubble develops coronavirus symptoms or we come into contact with someone else who does?You all have to stay at home. If you or a member of your bubble is contacted as part of the test and trace programme, the inidual contacted must stay at home. If the inidual becomes symptomatic, everyone in the bubble must then isolate.\u0026nbspI’ve just returned to the UK from abroad. Can I form a bubble or immediately rejoin my previous bubble?No. You need to self-isolate in one place for 14 days first.\u0026nbspI’m not eligible to form a bubble. Can I still see my friends and family?This is a targeted intervention for those who really need it. The safest thing is for us all to continue limiting our contact with others by staying at home. You can continue meeting outdoors in a group of up to six people including those you do not live with, as long as you keep at least 2 metres apart.What happens if I break the new rules?The relevant authorities, including the police, have the powers to enforce them through fines and dispersing gatherings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b143716c88576fcd713bd51766c974077eecb103/3175_2203_10517_6315/master/10517.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6b8027eb6c91700715ac43e9bc4be44","title":"how to use music to boost your running whether over a mile or a marathon","story":"From music’s effects on fatigue to its motivational properties, the right soundtrack is a powerful tool for improving your ability to run wellEveryone knows there’s a link between music and running. Barely a gym lets a cross-training machine go unaccompanied by hi-NRG dance tunes. There’s a great choice of running playlists on Spotify, some with millions of likes from users who’ve found that the right music can push them farther and faster. Bruce Springsteen has even written a whole album about being born to run. But if you want to use music to help improve your running, it’s important to get to grips with the science, and how it applies to your running style.Given that most runners tend to follow a pace of 150 to 180 steps per minute, you need music that corresponds to that. One option is to pick music that has about 150-180bpm, so that you can match your steps to the beat. “Foo Fighters’ The Pretender, which has about 170bpm, is really, really popular with runners,” says Hallett.However, 150-180bpm is very fast in terms of tempo, so there’s relatively little recorded at those speeds – with the exception of more high-energy rock’n’roll, thrash metal or speed garage. So another option is to aim for music that matches your stride cycle – ie two steps rather than one. This lets you pick music that’s much slower. Something that’s particularly good? Hip-hop.One of the most pleasant ways to run is to do so in what’s known as a “flow state”. It’s a highly enjoyable feeling of being completely immersed in what you’re doing to the point where it’s as though you’re on autopilot, but which is in itself highly enjoyable. It’s also been shown to enhance running endurance.Karageorghis did a study where he ran people to exhaustion during a beep test and found that those who listened to music more easily entered flow state. But in order to enter flow state, it’s important to have the right listening experience. The more continuous the listening experience, the easier it is to enter flow state. So if you’re planning to go on a reasonably lengthy run, it’s best to avoid music with ads, and to ensure you’re not listening in a way that might be interrupted by poor signal. Using Spotify Premium, with ad-free music and offline listening, is one way to keep the flow state flowing, if you will. “Having interrupted music can be a little distracting and disconcerting – it’s not as beneficial as having continuous music,” says Karageorghis. “That’s why I often encourage people to create end-to-end playlists that contour their workout.”One of the most important ways that music can help take your running to the next level is by making you feel less tired when you exercise. When you’re listening to a soundtrack, you’re giving your brain something to process other than your physical activity. The music distracts it from focusing on the effect exercise is having on your body, so the parts of the brain that speak to each other to communicate fatigue are less able to do so – meaning you feel less exhausted than you otherwise would.“It’s as though the music takes up some of your brain’s bandwidth that would normally be used for communication with the working muscles and the organs,” says Karageorghis. “It limits the degree to which fatigue-related signals can enter conscious awareness.”One thing that is unaffected by how fast you’re running is music’s ability to make you feel like you’re enjoying yourself. Even at higher intensities, studies have found that music can make people enjoy exercise more than they otherwise would.Karageorghis has also found that not only does music enhance how pleasurable your run is, but it enhances your memory of your run. It makes you remember your runs more positively, associates them more with being positive experiences and increases your probability of running more frequently. As to the right type of music to ensure that your brain responds positively to running? That depends entirely on you.“It’s often to do with the personal associations that the music has for you,” says Hallett. “I had a participant who listened to music from their university days because it took them back to a time when they had less responsibility. Going on a run felt like a bit of escapism for them. Others were motivated by music that reminded them of people they knew. It depends what has meaning to you.”Spotify Premium gives you music without the interruptions.

But less than two years later, an expert committee poured icy water on the authenticity of the discoveries. As well as pointing out that some of the pieces bore traces of modern glue, they found references to non-existent gods – and to the 17th-century French philosopher René Descartes.Further suspicions emerged when it was noted that the crucifixion scene bore the abbreviation RIP, which would have called into question Christ’s resurrection and inity.Equally suspicious was the fact that the first letter of the name of the Roman god Jupiter had been spelled not with an I but with a J, a letter than does not exist in the Latin alphabet.“They’re either a joke or a fraud,” Martín Almagro, a professor in prehistory from Madrid, said at the time, adding: “How has something like this been taken seriously for so long?”\u0026nbspOn Wednesday a court in Vitoria found Gil and his collaborator Rubén Cerdán guilty of fraud and keeping false records.It ruled that the finds had been manipulated “with contemporary incisions that were intended to suggest they contained inscriptions or markings of the same age as the objects themselves, and that they possessed a historical and cultural value of which they were devoid”.Gil was sentenced to a total of two years and three months, while Cerdán was handed a 15-month sentence. Both were ordered to pay a fine of €12,500 to the provincial authorities in Álava, which helped fund the excavations.The men are unlikely to serve time in prison as neither received a custodial sentence of more than two years for any inidual offence. Under Spanish law, prison sentences of less than two years are usually suspended if the defendant has no prior convictions.Another defendant, Óscar Escribano, a geologist, pleaded guilty but maintained that the whole thing was “nothing more than a joke”. He received a one-year sentence and a fine.The Basque police officer who led the investigation told the court that the case was “one of the greatest falsifications or manipulations relating to archaeological materials from the Roman world”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcecc45e86391532859778eb02182a1eb8f51eac/149_165_3293_1975/master/3293.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c538d145f9a9b28b77dcaa42e8d2cf6c","title":"english rugby has no plans to bring in the rooney rule for recruitment","story":"The Rugby Football Union has no plans to introduce the Rooney Rule to its existing recruitment policy despite calls from senior England players for more opportunities for black and ethnic minority coaches.Both the Football Association and the England \u0026amp Wales Cricket Board have a commitment to the Rooney Rule – which guarantees that at least one BAME applicant will be interviewed for future jobs – but the RFU does not intend to follow suit.Premiership Rugby has adopted a similar stance, leaving the choice up to the clubs, but Paul Hull is the only black director of rugby or head coach in the history of England’s top flight, having been in charge of Bristol between 2009 and 2011.Collin Osborne enjoyed success with Harlequins during his 20 years with the club, acting as skills coach when they won the Premiership in 2012, but he left the role two years ago. At present the New Zealand-born Samoan Pat Lam is the director of rugby at Bristol but it is believed Joe Shaw, the Saracens skills and attack coach, is the only homegrown BAME senior coach currently employed in the Premiership.In a wide-ranging interview this week, the England prop Ellis Genge detailed how he has been subjected to racist abuse while on international duty and highlighted the need for more ersity at elite coaching level. His England teammate Maro Itoje has also spoken on the subject in the past.“The issue in rugby is it has been a white man’s game for a number of years,” Genge said. “There’s not really many black coaches or ethnic coaches, especially here in England. I would love to see black coaches thriving in this game. Me and Maro have spoken about it before.”The RFU privately believes that its focus should be on increasing ersity at grassroots level, pointing to its Project Rugby and All Schools programmes. Hull, however, believes the Rooney Rule has its merits. “I think it’s positive,” he said. “It’s not saying that you are automatically going to get the job, but you are given the opportunity to interview. Even if the person doesn’t get the job, as we all know, it’s not just about having the credentials, it’s about honing your interview skills, knowing what that environment is like and understanding that process.”While more than a third of last year’s World Cup squad came from BAME backgrounds – and the head coach, Eddie Jones, has Japanese heritage – there is a dearth of homegrown black and minority ethnic coaches employed by the RFU, with James Bailey leaving his role as England women’s sevens coach last year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b6ff8cadaa164259bb40539e0383e4b237ddfa3/0_202_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1eaa3573e59d4da26f0e59418f2bd846","title":"michael schumacher stem cell surgery reports are premature motor sport","story":"Reports that Michael Schumacher is to undergo stem cell surgery within days are inaccurate, it is understood.

Lee said he purchased a subscription to the platform in an effort to get access, but his account remained blocked.“I demanded an answer from Zoom but so far they haven’t given me an answer,” Lee told the . “It’s very unusual that a consumer can’t reopen their account. So the only explanation is that it’s politically motivated.”Unlike several other western platforms, Zoom is not blocked in China, which is partly why China-focused activists have hosted events on it.“I was warned about using Zoom before, because it can be accessed in China, but that’s why they chose it. We want people to be able to see it in China,” said Lee. He said he had been able to told two other events on the conferencing app earlier in May.Zhou Fengsuo, a former protest leader at Tiananmen demonstrations, said his account was shut down in early June after he hosted an online memorial on 31 May for the anniversary of the 4 June 1989 military crackdown on pro-democracy protests in the square in central Beijing.“A significant proportion of attendees were from China. Our conference provided many the opportunity to connect with activists abroad for the first time,” said Zhou’s group Humanitarian China, adding that 250 people joined the event through Zoom while 4,000 watched it live through social media.The organisation said that after it was locked out of the account on 7 June, repeated attempts to log in failed and queries to Zoom went unanswered. Zhou’s account has now been reinstated.“It seems possible Zoom acted on pressure from the CCP to shut down our account. If so, Zoom is complicit in erasing the memories of the Tiananmen massacre in collaboration with an authoritarian government,” the group said.Wang Dan, a former student protest leader at Tiananmen, said a Zoom event he held on 3 June to commemorate the anniversary was shut down twice.Zoom said in a statement that it “must comply with laws in the countries where we operate”. It said: “We regret that a few recent meetings with participants both inside and outside of China were negatively impacted\u0026nbspand important conversations were disrupted.” Zoom added that it was not in the company’s power “to change the laws of governments opposed to free speech”. It said it was “committed to modifying its processes to further protect its users from those who wish to stifle their communications”.Wang and Lee’s events were hosted outside of mainland China, and Zhou is based in the US.Zoom, which has surged in popularity during the Covid-19 pandemic, has come under scrutiny owing to security concerns. Chen Yunfei, an activist based in Sichuan who participated in the 1989 protests as a student, spoke at the online Tiananmen memorial hosted by Zhou’s group. Chen was detained later that day and released on 5 June.PEN America denounced Zoom for bowing to the Chinese government. The group’s CEO, Suzanne Nossel,\u0026nbspsaid in a statement: “Zoom portends to be the platform of choice for companies, school systems and a wide range of organisations that need a virtual way to communicate, especially amid global lockdown. But it can’t serve that role and act as the long arm of the Chinese government. You don’t get to have it both ways.”Frances Eve, a deputy director of research at Chinese Human Rights Defenders, said: “Zoom must stop enabling government suppression of free expression rights.” She said the company must “clarify its internal processes that allowed the Chinese government to quickly have it censor activists”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ed93343eceb39068a4ff051743a66cafbecfa66/0_414_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acd25415be1dafc8d83dd30846ed8c0d","title":"dreams of italy readers travel tips","story":"A friendly football bar, the ‘real’ sword in the stone, plus walks, festivals and fantastic food ... you responded in droves to our request for Italian highlights For an unforgettable day away from the bustle of Rome, walk part of the Via Appia Antica, among the oldest paved roads in the world. For a demanding but amazing hike, walk 11 miles from the historic Quo Vadis church (on the 118 bus route) to Castel Gandolfo, overlooking a volcanic lake and home to the Pope’s summer retreat.

Take the train back to Rome. Enjoy!JackArriving in Rome on the afternoon of a Coppa Italia Rome derby, we tried to find a bar showing the evening’s game in the Pigneto neighbourhood, where we were staying. We stumbled upon a craft beer pub (the Alvarado Street) covered in football scarves from around the world. All the seats had names taped on them, reserved for friends and regulars – but a couple of drinks and phone calls by the barman later and we had our own bean bags in among it all. Great beers and a great crowd – next time I’ll be bringing my Cardiff City scarf to add to their collection!AnyaLucignano, in eastern Tuscany near Arezzo, gets my vote. It’s small but perfectly formed, possessing all the essentials of an Italian hill town: imposing gates, watchtowers and ramparts. There’s a Medici-era fortress nearby a church rebuilt by Renaissance architectwriter Giorgio Vasari plus outstanding olive oil extolled by the likes of Strabo and Pliny the Elder. The time to go is during the Maggiolata spring festival, held the last two weekends of May, with flower-bedecked floats and a large tent where folks sit at communal tables to enjoy grilled Chianina steaks, pasta, wine and entertainment every evening. TheoZip. Tent open: the Dolomites. We’d woken to those jagged spires for almost a week. This morning’s vista was across the green valley to the shark fin of the Sassolungo. Circling it was the aim for the day. An espresso on the piazza in Canazei was for fuel. Then we headed for the Col Rodella gondola. It’s a gateway to another world nearly 2,000 metres up, where rolling meadows crash into spires of rock, cows moo, and ramblers scuttle like ants across the trails. Thirteen hours of walking took us over the col and into the vast Alpe di Siusi, the largest alpine plateau in Europe. Tired legs were later rewarded with a wine (or 10) at the bustling Bar Oma, back in Canazei’s quaint centre.Joseph FrancisFour readers recommended this place this week! EdIn rural Marche, not far from the Adriatic coast, Casal dei Fichi (flats from €870 a week) is a glorious place. So beautiful and relaxing that we seldom travel far from its peaceful grounds, inviting pool and stunning views. We might make a quick trip or two to the local market and vineyard to ensure we are well stocked for our stay, and an occasional lunch in one of the huge choice of local restaurants. That said, for the more active there is a wide range of activitiestrips that can be enjoyed, and hosts Ian and Bob are on hand to advise and assist. We can’t wait for these lockdown days to end so that we can escape to this little piece of heaven. DiThe Abbey of San Galgano (adults €4) is a glorious ruin, but the real reason you are there is to enter the small round Rotonda chapel in the grounds, in which you will see the “real” Sword in the Stone, plunged into solid rock by the knight Galgano, attempting to deny the angels. The sword sits in a perspex dome, protection against thieves. The mummified arms of one would-be thief remain there as a warning. Then ponder the similarities to the Arthurian legends. Coincidence? Gord PaynterFresh out of uni I visited Reggio di Calabria, city of my forebears, over Ferragosto and had a transformative experience. In this beautiful city, free of tour buses and souvenir shops, I observed a way of life both foreign and completely sensible. Seemingly everyone spent their days taking it slow: extended families gathering at the beach, strolling about town, having long outdoor meals, rambling along the stunning yet understated promenade (pictured). Something clicked: it dawned on me that people live this way and I could too. Years later I briefly lived in Italy and hope to move back with my family.Nick PostorinoAs a kid I spent many family holidays in Camogli, near Genoa. The topography of steep mountains rising from the coast forced the locals to build upwards, creating a labyrinth of alleys and stairways. Of course the food was good, great gelato and pasta, and the famous pesto genovese. But what stands out is the focaccia. Recco, just north of Camogli, is the home of a most delicious cheesy version that has spread – like the molten cheese inside it – over the whole area. Popping into a focacceria to get a pile of freshly baked focaccia slices and sharing them was the highlight of the day.Simon HoerHead north from Trento and you reach a curious mix of Italian and German language and culture around Siusi allo Sciliar. Visit San Valentino’s church, then take the cable car to the Seiser Alm, one of Europe’s highest mountain plateaux, with 240km of tracks and trails great for running, walking or biking. It’s perfect in spring or autumn: try staying in one of the family-run farms that offer local knowledge, homegrown produce and a friendly welcome. Public transport is excellent, and if you need a hand on the hills and with the altitude, e-bike hire means you can manage without a car.Tony WadeAt the centre of the Valchiavenna, north of Lake Como, lies the old town of Chiavenna, on the right bank of the river Mera. From the railway station we walked the short distance to the magnificent nature park and wildlife refuge that is the Parco delle Marmitte dei Giganti. Taking its main path overlooking the river, we continued on our way in seclusion towards Prosto, with its ancient bridge and church. Crossing the bridge, the path leads to the beautiful Acquafraggia waterfalls, whose soothing roar was completely mesmerising. We stayed at the brilliant Villa Très Jolie (doubles from €95 B\u0026ampB).Robert ConnollyUp the road from San Gimignano is the equally picturesque medieval town of Volterra, but without the crowds of shuffling tourists – except for one weekend in August, when the town dresses up in its medieval finery and goes back in time. There are food stalls aplenty, musicians at every turn and pageantry to fill the eye. It is the best of Italy inasmuch as it is noisy and seemingly chaotic but enormous fun. It’s a great day out for a family or even a solo traveller. Modern currency is not accepted you have to change your euros into the historical equivalent and you then buy your street food with this. Confusingly, you then use euros if you stop for a drink or a coffee in a bar.Nick StringerWe were fortunate enough to discover a boating lake in a romantic corner of the Villa Borghese, a park in Rome. It was a haven from the long, hot queues of Rome’s tourist sites. We hired a boat. The joy of rowing around the small lake with the person I love is a pleasure I will never forget. The sound of a harp from a nearby musician beckoned us towards the Temple of Asclepius on a small island in the middle of the lake. The statues and fountains looked so alluring. We got so close that at one point we feared one of the fountains would draw us in and engulf our boat with water. We had to row a hasty retreat in laughter just before our time was called.RogerTrattoria Trapani on Piazza Giulio Cesare in Palermo reminded me of someone’s pantry. A young man and his father greeted us with smiles as large as mine and my mother’s hunger. To the left was the grandparents’ territory, the kitchen. We were given complimentary panelle (chickpea fritters), a local tradition. When we finished, the father came over and said, “I get you something from my farm.” He returned moments later with a complimentary plate of juicy blood orange slices. When paying I complimented the son’s English. He replied, “The Beatles. The best teachers, right?” Our no-frills Sicilian dream included plates of swordfish and spaghetti vongole for less than €7 a plate.Marth SnellingOne Saturday in June, we attended the annual Archidado Joust in Cortona. Attired in colourful medieval costumes, teams from Cortona, Arezzo and Subbiano perform elaborate flag-tossing routines, with cute displays by children, all accompanied by drummers and trumpeters. The celebration starts with a crossbow tournament, followed by a procession of worthies, drummers, trumpeters, and the teams into Cortona town square. For the next few hours, we witnessed a colourful and atmospheric pageant as each team performed with skill and precision. John HellinikakisWhile exploring the spectacular south coast of Sardinia, we detoured by ferry to the island of San Pietro, tempted by the annual Girotonno tuna fishing and cooking festival, held at the end of every May. The ferry docks in Carloforte, the picturesque main town. We soaked up the atmosphere, sampled tuna cooked a myriad of ways, watched tuna-themed cookery demonstrations, danced into the small hours at concerts in the main square, wandered its colourful streets and vowed to return.Marian O’Mahony"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bf4155502f8e6512c654b263791d9965950c966/0_4_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc064fbb93c4d1cdcbdc8090fa02997b","title":"life after lockdown in bordeaux les bassins de lumieres","story":"The world’s largest digital arts centre opened this week in a former submarine base, its cavernous chambers and dazzling visual effects providing exactly what visitors need after nearly three months in confinement Delayed for seven weeks by France’s coronavirus lockdown, Les Bassins de Lumières, the world’s largest digital arts centre, opened on 10 June in a wartime submarine base in Bordeaux’s docklands.Strict hygiene and social distancing measures mean visitors can only buy tickets online, are temperature-checked at the entrance, and must use masks and hand sanitiser. However, since the building has more than 3,000m2 of floor space (equivalent to 12 tennis courts), “everyone has at least five square metres of inidual space”, says director Augustin de Cointet. “The rules are there, but discreet, as we want everyone to enjoy the full experience.”The exhibition is a spectacular, sensorially overwhelming light-and-sound display of the works of Gustav Klimt projected on to every surface of the base’s four 110-metre-long, 12-metre-high chambers. Imperial Vienna’s neoclassical interiors turn into Klimt’s golden images of The Kiss, Judith and the Head of Holofernes and his portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer. The exhibition’s first visitors, who’ve become accustomed to staring at their living room walls for France’s 11-week confinement, seem overwhelmed, open-mouthed behind their masks as they wander along the giant chambers’ walkways and bridges. Klimt’s whiplash golden coils fade to his landscapes of forests, lakes and orchards, transforming, in turn, into Egon Schiele’s buckled forms and back to Klimt’s female figures and vibrant patchworks, all to a soundtrack of Wagner, Beethoven, Mahler and Philip Glass.The Klimt projections have already appeared at Culturespaces’ two other digital venues in France, the Atelier des Lumières in Paris and the Carrières de Lumières in Les Baux-de-Provence, but were redesigned for Bordeaux. “Les Bassins has a totally different atmosphere,” says de Cointet. “For one thing it’s gigantic: it is five times larger than the Atelier and three times the size of the Carrières, but what really makes Les Bassins unique is the reflections in the water.”\u0026nbspAfter the Klimt, which lasts around 40 minutes, the second programme is devoted to artist and musician Paul Klee, whose abstract blocks of colour have been reworked to fit in with the geometrical structure of the Bassins. Klee’s frizzy goldfish interweaves with puppets and a gallery of cubist portraits while his underwater creatures appear to e into the deep pools as Mozart’s The Magic Flute plays through the chambers’ 80 hidden speakers.\u0026nbspThe exhibition is what anyone caged up for almost three months needs: vast spaces, loud music, dazzling visual effects and crowds unravelling along the cavernous gangways. Beside the huge chambers is Le Cube, a 220m2 box showing digitalised projections of contemporary art (currently showing is Ocean Data, by Turkish collective Ouchhh) and a circular cell, the seven-metre-high La Citerne, which allows visitors to lie down and experience the immersive exhibitions from a different viewpoint.Being there is emotional and dreamlike you think you recognise something from Klimt or Klee, but it’s suddenly a thousand times the size, repeated infinitely and re-appearing on the opposite wall. Despite the coronavirus, de Cointet is hoping for around 400,000 visitors a year. Entry is in half-hour slots with many already sold out for June. He expects visitors to spend about an hour and a half watching the projections in the Bassins, but they can stay for as long as they want.Construction of the German-built submarine base, the U-Boot-Bunker, began in 1941 to house 15 submarines in Nazi-occupied Bordeaux. It withstood allied bombardment until the city was liberated in August 1944 and, over the decades, has been used as a metallurgy plant, occasional festival venue and film set. Culturespaces took two years to create Les Bassins de Lumières, installing 90 video-projectors and 100km of optical fibres, but the entire 41,000m2 site is being redeveloped as a vast gallery, workshop and arts complex.\u0026nbspFive minutes’ walk away is a second titanic overground bunker, built as a depot to store four billion litres of fuel to supply the submarine base. Its six-metre-thick concrete walls now house 650 barrels of whisky for Bordeaux’s Moon Harbour distillery.

Both found early success as youth boxers on the South Side of Chicago – Butler demonstrated enough promise at age 12 to merit a profile in the Chicago Tribune, in which he proclaimed his intent to box in the London Olympics, to front a Wheaties box, to haul in winnings. Sims’s determination to box in the 2012 Olympics caught the attention of German film-maker André Hörmann, who made a documentary short on him and his coach – his father, Kenneth Sims Sr – in 2009, with the intent to make a feature film on the two boxing prodigies.\u0026nbspBut plans change. Sims failed to qualify for the London Games, a crushing defeat Hörmann captured on camera, while Butler fell into a burglary ring conducted by a then mentor he was arrested for residential burglary of Chicago-area homes in 2012, at age 18, and spent four years in prison. And Hörmann’s film, Ringside, for which he and cinematographer Tom Bergmann moved to Chicago for 18 months in 2013, morphed into a nine-year odyssey of two ergent fighters in and out of the ring. The 93-minute film, which will air on Showtime, is a time-lapse portrait of two steely father-son bonds, two paths of redemption and revision, two families for whom boxing has served as both community and anchor.\u0026nbsp“Boxing is the chain that holds everything together, but it’s not the center of the story,” Hörmann told the , and Ringside primarily focuses on the push and pull of father and son, of community and sport, outside of the ring. The film interweaves Sims and Butler’s two separate tracks, a sort of Hoop Dreams – the 1994 documentary, filmed over five years, about two black high schoolers from the South Side who dream of professional basketball – for millennial boxers.Ringside opens with a cinematic shot from the original documentary short: Sims, introverted and focused, strolling along a patchwork storefront in Chicago’s South Side, a majority-black area in one of America’s most segregated cities plagued by violence, racial discrimination and disinvestment. Then 18, Sims was deep in preparation for Olympic qualification, pouring hours into the gym with his father, a bounty of encouragement who cut his teeth as a street fighter. Reserved and circumspect, Sims Jr keeps distractions at a minimum Hörmann’s camera toggles between drills in the ring and the Sims family home, a one-bedroom apartment bedecked in boxing ribbons and trophies.Butler, who grew up in the projects, began boxing at age seven as an alternative to fighting in school. “I loved it so much and I was so good at it, so I just stuck to it,” Butler, now 25 and living on the South Side, told the . At the outset of Ringside, Hörmann catches up with him a world away from the exuberant local news appearance of his childhood – in 2013, he talks to his father and mentor, Destyne Butler Sr, on the phone, and shows off his muscles to his mother on video conference from prison.\u0026nbspOver the course of the film – which is to say, the better part of a decade – both boxers face crushing disappointment: Sims misses the Olympics, struggles with the devastating toll of gun violence in his neighborhood, and wades into the world of professional boxing under the name “Bossman”. Butler, with the help of a lawyer and his father, attends a grueling prison boot camp with the expectation of a four-to-six-month release, yet is inexplicably expelled from the program just 10 days from completion. He’s sent back to jail for the rest of a four-year sentence, which only hardened his resolve to return to boxing. “Imagine you were planning on doing four to six months, and now you have to do four years of your life,” he said. “You know how many people would just come up and say, ‘man, my life is over with, now it is what it is.’ I said no, I’m still going to do what I’ve gotta do.” Hörmann’s camera finds Butler again at 22, as he emerges from prison on an empty road in southern Illinois to new clothes, his father and brothers, and an immediate, unsteady return to the ring.The footage of Butler’s journey – a promising talent trapped in legal limbo, berated by mostly white officers in boot camp and arbitrarily dismissed from the program – feel especially resonant now, as protests against anti-black racism, police brutality and America’s double-standard incarceration system flourish across the United States. “Police brutality and police being unfair – this is the type of stuff I’ve been going through even before I was locked up, but especially when I got locked up,” said Butler. “This is what’s been going on. This is going on with my story. So I understand everything that people are talking about with the police.”As a German film-maker who had only read about the South Side of Chicago before traveling to the area for the documentary short in 2008, Hörmann said he, too, found the American way of incarceration and de facto segregation confounding. “I’ve never seen any place as segregated as Chicago,” he said. “When I learned about Destyne and Kenny and their dads teaching their sons how to explain to the police every move they make,” – how to be extra careful around police, how to defuse an encounter with law enforcement made potentially lethal by their skin color – “that kind of mindset struck me.”A long nine years in the making but a brisk hour and a half to watch, Ringside offers plenty of classic boxing underdog moments, but no tidy answers. The film is ultimately a two-character peek into a decade of dedication, the community around the ring in a neighborhood full of risk, the possibility of redemption through sport. “I didn’t want to do a portrait of the South Side or a political statement in the first place,” said Hörmann. “I wanted to do it like through the eyes of my protagonists, that point of view. I’m not the right guy to tell anybody about the South Side, though it has to be done.”But Ringside does, according to Butler, point to the untapped and underfunded talent of the South Side. “We have a lot of talent. We just don’t have as many opportunities as everybody else,” he said. “Music, boxing, football, basketball, clothing designers, I mean the list goes on.”Nine years in, the two boxers are no longer eager amateurs, but still pursuing their dreams – Sims, now 26, has a professional record of 14-2-1 and fought at Madison Square Garden. Butler regained his boxing shape, won the Chicago Golden Glove in 2018 and currently has an undefeated 9-0 pro record. And in 2020, he channels the same ambition evinced in his early boxing days 13 years ago. “I’m trying to do a lot of things – I’m trying to be on billboards, I’m trying to be the biggest athlete out there, I’m trying to model, I’m trying to do a lot of stuff,” he said. “I’m just trying to be a star.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9389da9d4c95aefd3eb6b377d8360e26b10e7c7a/125_0_4375_2625/master/4375.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23e1a0c068d6ef55ce3e9f46be411a04","title":"has time in lockdown made you want to approach life differently","story":"If this experience has given you a chance to take stock and make some resolutions for the future, we want to hear from youLiving in lockdown has put everyone under strain, but it may also have given some of us time to take stock and work out what we really want from life.

Over the last 24 hours 357 people have died from the virus, bringing the official toll to 8,102.The World Health Organization (WHO) said the situation globally was deteriorating, at a time when Europe appears to be over the worst of the pandemic. More than 100,000 new cases worldwide were reported each day for most of the last two weeks, WHO’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said.So far Africa has mostly avoided the kind of rampant outbreak seen in Europe and the US. Matshidiso Moeti, the UN health agency’s Africa regional director, said there were 207,617 cases across 54 countries and 5,642 deaths. Hotspots include South Africa, Algeria and Cameroon.It is India which appears poised for a calamitous jump in infections, especially in the financial capital Mumbai and the state of Maharashtra. After two months of lockdown the government of the prime minister, Narendra Modi, is now relaxing measures.Restaurants, shopping malls and places of worship in much of India are reopening and travel is gradually restarting. The easing of restrictions is driven by economic factors. Millions of migrant labourers thrown out of work by quarantine measures are unable to feed their families.In New Delhi, the situation is particularly dire. The city government this week predicted the caseload would increase 20 times to more than half a million by the end of July. The healthcare system seems woefully ill-prepared and unequal to the multiplying problem.“We don’t know when this is going to peak,” Dr Deven Juneja told AFP during a pause in his rounds at Delhi’s Max private hospital. “All of us are hoping for the best, but we are mentally and physically prepared for the worst.”Juneja said the surge had started to be felt over the past few days, with an increase in the number of people looking for a bed. “That has definitely increased the load on us. We want to get our patients well as soon as possible and try to create more beds for our patients,” he said.Vinita Thakur, a nurse in a Covid-19 ward, said wearing protective suits for long hours in the hot Indian summer required “physical and mental courage”. “After putting on the PPE we can’t drink water, can’t eat, can’t even go to the washroom,” Thakur said. “But we have to do it. We are on the frontline.”Meanwhile, in Germany, the number of active Covid-19 cases has gone up to 5,460 – the\u0026nbspfirst rise in total cases in two months. On Thursday, health authorities announced 555 new infections. Some 8,755 people have died of the virus in Germany so far, with a day-on-day rise of 26.The uptick received relatively little attention as several of Germany’s 16\u0026nbspLänder, or federal states, took further steps towards relaxing physical distancing restrictions. In the eastern state of Thuringia, distancing measures will be scrapped altogether from Saturday, though the wearing of masks in shops and on public transport remains mandatory.Elsewhere in Europe, Finland said it would reopen its borders to tourists from neighbouring Baltic and Nordic countries, excluding Sweden, from 15 June. Denmark and Norway have made a similar move and have kept Sweden out of their new travel arrangements because of its rate of infection.Finnish borders are due to open to tourists from Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania from 15 June. Tourists from other EU countries may be able to visit after 14 July.In other developments:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27be312de7cb89b3e9dcebca1ca18ddeb8c2ec1b/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6d354827d12db0ddc404624982abdb7","title":"in 12 weeks we can turn the tide now we can ask was pm right","story":"Coronavirus deaths and infections are dropping, but experts fear lockdown is being eased too soonby  Robert Booth,  Heather Stewart and  Richard PartingtonOn 19 March, just a few days before he self-isolated with Covid-19, a sunken-eyed Boris Johnson\u0026nbsptold the daily Downing Street briefing that in 12 weeks “we can turn the tide”. “I am absolutely confident that we can send coronavirus packing,” he said.\u0026nbspOn Thursday those 12 weeks are up – and they have seen the country go through turmoil.The lockdown is being loosened, but fears of a second wave are rife.So has the tide really turned?On Wednesday, Downing Street was upbeat. But interviews with experts, and analysis of the government’s own data, paint a grim picture of what the UK has endured – and a lack of confidence about what the next 12 weeks may hold.First glance at the now-familiar government graphs suggest the curves tracking new infections and deaths are showing significant improvements, at least when viewed from the devastating peak of the outbreak around Easter, when new infections hit 3,918 on 5 April and deaths peaked at 943 a day on 11 April, taking rolling averages.\u0026nbspCloser inspection reveals a less comforting picture. When Johnson spoke 12 weeks ago there were 913 new cases of coronavirus recorded each day on average. At the latest count there were 1,543.Twelve weeks ago the seven-day rolling average for daily deaths was just 21 this week it remains 10 times higher. As the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, reminded Johnson in parliament on Wednesday, the UK’s excess deaths during the pandemic have passed 63,000 – higher than in Italy, Spain and France. As Greece (with a death toll of 183) welcomes holidaymakers, Britons still cannot stay overnight with extended family in most cases.Scientists are also concerned that as lockdown lifts, the test, trace and isolate system for quelling future outbreaks is not robust enough. The care sector, where at least 15,000 have died from Covid-19 so far, warns that the government’s tactics to protect the most vulnerable in a second wave remain largely unchanged.It is the sheer numbers of infections and deaths at the peak that have shocked many. Two days before Johnson made his prediction, the UK government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said less than 20,000 deaths would be “a good outcome”.That milestone was passed more than six weeks ago. According to Sir David King, a former chief scientific adviser and now chairman of an independent version of the government’s Sage advisory group, that could have been the total death toll.King has calculated that if Johnson had ordered the lockdown on the day he promised to “turn the tide”, rather than four days later, transmission would have been slashed and fatalities halved. Prof Neil Ferguson, the Imperial College epidemiologist and former government adviser, also said on Wednesday that the death toll could have been halved if lockdown had come a week earlier.We have not “sent coronavirus packing”, King says, because the R factor – the rate of reproduction – is still not low enough. His group is worried we are risking a second wave by lifting lockdown restrictions now.“There has been a series of really dreadful mistakes by this government that has led to a vast number of people dying and they need not have died,” he said.His calculation about an earlier lockdown was supported by Prof Roland Kao, chair of epidemiology and data science at the University of Edinburgh. He found that if Scotland had gone into lockdown two weeks earlier, its death toll could have been cut to a fifth of the country’s 4,000 deaths now linked to the disease.\u0026nbsp“Cutting the virus off earlier has a huge benefit,” said Kao, who warned the tail of the epidemic is likely to be unpredictable and long.Some modellers predict more grief to come even in this first wave. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Washington DC, for example, believes the UK could suffer another 3,500 Covid deaths by 4 August.Critics say the tide has not turned in other ways too. The government’s test, trace and isolate system remains “not even close” to being able to keep up with new infections, said King. Care homes complain about a continued lack of testing to control outbreaks which can spread through asymptomatic staff and residents.“We need much clearer protocols on planning for a second wave and they need to make their plans public,” said Martin Green, chief executive of the industry group Care England. “We need either weekly or fortnightly testing.”Care minister Helen Whately said on Tuesday she is expecting scientific advice soon on the appropriate frequency of repeat testing. Some care managers now want ministers to use hospitals to quarantine infected residents in future outbreaks, as happened in Hong Kong where no one has died from Covid-19 in a care home.“In any assessment of turning the tide you have to include preparedness and clarity of action against Covid,” said Dan Hayes, chief executive of the Order of St John Care Trust, which runs 82 care homes and accommodation centres where 242 residents died from Covid-19. “We still don’t have certainty about care residents being able to access hospital treatment on the same basis as everyone else. There is still a viewpoint that people in care homes will not benefit from treatment.”The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, said the government’s “Protect the NHS” mantra had obscured other important aims.“The prime minister had all this rhetoric about turning tides, and taking things on the chin,” he said. “Twelve weeks later, we have one of the highest excess death rates in the world. And yes, the NHS has coped: but it’s coped on the back of discharging its patients into care homes cancelling operations delaying treatments for cancer – which probably means we’ll have waiting lists at 10m by Christmas.”Downing Street, by contrast, takes a very different view of its performance – and the outlook for the future.Referring to Covid-19 as “an invisible mugger”, Johnson claimed in the House of Commons on Wednesday that it had been an “astonishing achievement” to “drive down the curve”.Asked about whether the country had “turned the tide”, his spokesperson added: “Thanks to the very hard work of the British public we have now passed through the peak and you are seeing the key indicators like the new hospital admissions, new infections and the number of deaths falling. But at the same time we know we have much, much more to do in order to both beat this virus and put the country fully on the road to recovery.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed1c3c08bc27b6eb2ea3c16f41196d2bb09f4578/0_97_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd048dacb806c54dcb4473070fd5a126","title":"paul mccartney italy ticket refund policy singer government gigs","story":"Singer says government decree preventing refunds for cancelled gigs is ‘insult to fans’Sir Paul McCartney has strongly criticised the Italian government over an “outrageous” decree preventing concertgoers from getting refunds on gigs that were cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic.The former Beatle had been due to perform in Naples on Tuesday and in Lucca on Saturday as part of his Freshen Up tour.He wrote on Facebook that when his shows across Europe were cancelled on 7 May, it was in the belief that fans would receive a refund. While this was the case in the other countries the singer had been scheduled to visit, a decree passed by the Italian government offered only vouchers for scrapped music events.“It is outrageous that those who have paid for their tickets are not getting their money back,” McCartney wrote. “Without the fans there would be no live entertainment. We strongly disagree with what the Italian government are doing … the organiser of our shows must do the right thing here.“We are all extremely disappointed the shows could not take place and this is a real insult to the fans.”The decree was passed under the recommendation of Assomusica, an Italian live music promoter, with vouchers valid for 18 months.D’Alessandro \u0026amp Galli, the agency that promoted McCartney’s concerts in Italy, said the singer had been aware of the voucher plan before the gigs were cancelled.“We fully understand the artist’s bitterness as he cared for these two concerts that would have marked his return to Italy, as well as the displeasure of fans for receiving a voucher instead of a full refund,” the company said.“The formula was established by the Italian government to deal with an unprecedented crisis that risked giving a fatal blow to the live music industry and the approximately 400,000 workers who risk not being able to work for a year.”Dario Franceschini, the culture minister, said the intention was for vouchers to be used for gigs held by the same artist. If no future dates were set, then people would be entitled to a refund.“I’m sure parliament will be able to intervene to remove any interpretative doubt on the rule,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e07c400767bd06ecf3a1c5cd6d727d42354f52e8/0_152_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=956d4d9ab9e6898ff555eeaa6a48d2ff","title":"turkey convicts us consular official over links to 2016 coup","story":"Metin Topuz was accused of links to cleric Fethullah Gülen, blamed for 2016 coupA Turkish court has convicted a local US consulate employee in Istanbul of aiding an armed terrorist organisation and sentenced him to eight years and nine months in prison, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported.Metin Topuz, a translator and assistant for the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), has been in jail since 2017, accused of links to US-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gülen. The Turkish government blames Gülen for the 2016 coup attempt and considers his network to be a terrorist organisation.Topuz’s arrest and subsequent prosecution caused tensions between Ankara and Washington.The accusations were based on his contacts with police officers believed to be members of Gülen’s vast network of followers. Topuz has maintained his innocence throughout the trial and is expected to appeal against the verdict.The US embassy in Ankara expressed disappointment at the court’s decision.“We have seen no credible evidence to support his conviction and hope it will swiftly be overturned,” the embassy said on its official Twitter account.In his concluding words in his own defence before the verdict, Topuz told the court that he had been in contact with Turkish police, paramilitary police and customs officials as part of his job with the DEA and had no way of knowing that these officials were involved in criminal acts.“As part of my duty with the DEA, under the instructions and observation of my superiors, I had thousands of contacts with 309 law enforcement officials to prevent crime,” the state-run Anadolu Agency quoted Topuz as saying.He added that he had committed no crime and had had no relations with Gülen’s network.The US embassy said: “For nearly three decades, Mr Topuz performed outstanding work appreciated and lauded by officials and citizens of both countries. Under our direction, he promoted law enforcement cooperation between Turkey and the US, contributing to the safety of people in both nations.”Gülen, who has been in self-imposed exile in the US since 1999, denies involvement in the coup attempt, in which about 250 people were killed and another 2,000 injured."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"The effects of climate change could damage, and possibly even destroy, our collective heritageAgriculture Minister accuses Green party leader of doing a \u0026lsquodisservice\u0026rsquo to rural communities"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteria"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Juan Carlos UlateReutersMedics at a Dublin maternity hospital have confirmed the first documented case of a baby born in Ireland with a congenital Zika virus infection.In 2016, the World Health Organisation declared a public health emergency due to concerns of severe postnatal neurological complications following babies born with the congenital Zika virus.The Zika virus disease is caused by a virus transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes. Most people with Zika virus infection do not develop symptoms.Now, in the June edition of the Irish Medical Journal (IMJ), medics at the National Maternity Hospital at Holles Street in Dublin confirm that a baby of a Brazilian mother has been born in Ireland with a congenital Zika virus infection.The health impact of contracting the virus disease varies greatly from asymptomatic infection to disabling neurological impairment and death.The medics state at 14 months the baby born in Ireland had developed epilepsy, quadriplegic cerebral palsy, visual impairment and showed severe global developmental delay.The authors of the journal paper state the baby girl “requires multidisciplinary healthcare team care”.The paper revealed the baby’s mother was in her native Brazil during the first trimester of pregnancy where she suffered from fever and myalgia.The Zika virus was detected in the mother’s blood at 11 weeks into her pregnancy but was no longer detected at 31 weeks gestation.At birth, the baby was diagnosed with severe microcephaly, where the head is smaller than normal, but the examination was otherwise normal.A urine test the day after birth was negative for the Zika virus but the placenta tested positive for the virus.The paper states though the infant was negative for Zika, she had many of the clinical features consistent with congenital Zika and maternal Zika during pregnancy.The medics say the case highlights the deficiencies in the current laboratory criteria here for congenital Zika virus “and the need for expert consultation whilst investigating possible cases”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4275858.1591883212!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"q a on face masks what is the latest advice","story":"Population-wide facemask use could push COVID-19 transmission down to controllable levels for national epidemics and could prevent further waves of the pandemic disease when combined with lockdowns, according to a new UK study.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA cloth mask of at least three layers is best for the general public, the WHO advises. Above, protective face masks at a clothing stall in Norwich, in the UK. Photograph: Chris RatcliffeBloombergGo into any supermarketshop, or take any form of public transport in Ireland, and it is clear few people are wearing face masks. It is hard to resist the conclusion that either they are utterly confused by changing public health messaging, or they don’t see the merit of wearing a mask. Those in the latter camp may believe this Covid-19 pandemic is dealt with as Irish deaths and cases are close to zero – and wish to get back to normal as quickly as possible. Or they are not prepared to put up with what they perceive as the hassle of wearing a mask with all the protocols about how to put it on and take it off correctly, not forgetting re-use procedure. There is social stigma too around wearing them.While the world for the most part agreed on the best way to deal with the Covid-19, ie lockdown, physical distancing and repeated handwashing, the same cannot be said about face masks. There is huge variation between countries in some they are mandatory in public places, in others they are worn routinely whenever there is risk of an epidemic. Differing advice from health authorities doesn’t help.A lot comes down to interpreting research, evaluating risk and factoring human behaviour. So scientists don’t reach an absolute position and governments wrestle with what to tell their citizens who are demanding clarity.What on balance is best advice?Advice on whether to wear a mask has changed in line with emerging research about Covid-19. Evidence backing the wearing of masks in public, where there is community transmission, has strengthened – especially in confined spaces. They do not need to be worn in the open air or while driving a car.When it comes to those over 60, whose immune system is weakening coinciding with ageing, and those with underlying conditions, the case is clear-cut. Moreover, this age group should wear medical-grade masks that, fortunately, are now more readily available, though not cheap.What is the latest advice from the World Health Organisation?In the past week, WHO has come out more strongly in favour of masks, with a variation of types recommended depending on circumstances. Its updated guidance says the public should wear masks where physical distancing is not possible. It is firmly in favour of medical masks for the over-60s and those with pre-existing conditions. A cloth mask of at least three layers is best for the general public. Initially, the WHO was almost anti-mask, insisting many people won’t wear masks properly, thereby risking infection. Masks give people a false sense of security and encourage risky behaviour, it contended. Compounding matters was the obvious shortage of masks for healthcare workers as cases rose rapidly. WHO accepts growing indications that the more people use masks, the lower the transmission, notably from those who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic. Previously it recommended masks for people who are symptomatic, to prevent spread to others.What research is persuasive in favour of face masks?At the onset, scientific evidence on the effectiveness of face masks in slowing transmission of respiratory diseases was limited. There was no data on Covid-19 since it was a previously unknown disease.However, there is a growing body of evidence favouring face masks and cloth coverings. This week a UK study found population-wide face mask use could push Covid-19 transmission down to controllable levels, and prevent further waves of the virus when combined with minor lockdowns. A US study found that if 80 per cent of a closed population were to don a mask, infection rates would statistically drop to approximately one-twelfth the number of infections – compared to “a live-virus population” in which no one wore masks.Where does Ireland stand in light of revised WHO guidance?NPHET’s expert advisory group is to review the latest WHO recommendations, but evaluation of current advice suggests Ireland is very much aligned with that viewpoint – though there may be a difference of emphasis.The bottom line, however, is mask use is nowhere near the level warranted. There has been a failure of national advice to hit the target – understandable at a time of exponential rise in cases less acceptable when easing lockdown.Given such low usage in Ireland, the time has come to heed the strong recommendation of WHO special envoy Dr David Nabarro, who told the Oireachtas special committee on Covid-19 there needed to be a push from saying people “should” wear them to people “must” wear them.This, he advised, was for the benefit of service providers, including drivers, attendants and security guards – it was a reasonable requirement that commuters wear coverings for the sake of people who look after them.There is much catching up to do to ensure more specialist masks are available for those who are vulnerable to Covid-19 and those who cannot afford a mask or to make a cloth version. Supplying free masks to every household could make up lost ground.What is the prudent way to proceed?There is no going back to normal soon. Risk of contamination of surfaces and infection is ever present. Good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, while maintaining physical distancing where possible is still the winning formula. But “wear a mask” in the correct way has rightly been added to that mix.

Photograph: Darragh KaneFota Wildlife Park is hoping its latest arrivals will help boost its visitor numbers over the summer months as it announced the birth of three new cheetah cubs during the Covid-19 lockdown.Fota Wildlife Park director Sean McKeown on Thursday confirmed the birth of three Northern cheetah cubs to mother, Gráinne and father, Sam at the east Cork visitor attraction on St Patrick’s Day.“We are delighted to today announce the births of these cheetah cubs – the three cubs, all male, were born on St Patrick’s Day so they are exactly 12 weeks old – sadly a fourth cub did not survive after living for only four days.”Mr McKeown said that Gráinne was born in Fota on May 29th, 2017 and father, Sam was born on December 26th, 2015 at Wadi al Safa Wildlife Centre in Dubai, UAE and transferred to Fota in June 2017. “Gráinne is fourth-generation captive-born, and this is her first litter, and this is Sam’s third litter of cubs and the cubs are the first fifth generation of Northern cheetah born in a zoological institution,” he said.Mr McKeown said the cubs were still unnamed and Fota was calling on the public to suggest the names at www.fotawildlife.ieblog and be in with a chance to win one of three year-long annual passes.He explained that the birth of the cubs brings to over 230 the number of cheetahs born at Fota Wildlife Park since its breeding programme began in 1985 as part of an international effort to protect the species.Cheetahs are listed globally as “vulnerable” by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species and there are only 7,100 remaining in the wild, he said.However, the Northern cheetah subspecies, which is native to north east Africa and found mainly in South Sudan and Ethiopia, is considered “endangered” as there are fewer than 800 left in the wild, he added. “Fota Wildlife Park co-ordinates the European Breeding and management programmes for the Northern cheetah and there are currently 129 Northern cheetahs in 23 zoological institutions throughout Europe and the Middle East.”Mr McKeown explained that the cheetah’s slender bodies, long legs and a flexible spine help it achieve speeds in excess of 100kph in pursuit of its prey, with its tail acting as a finely-tuned balancing aid. But, he pointed out, the cheetah is not only the fastest land animal in the world today, it has been in existence for between 3.5 and four million years – making it the oldest of Earth’s big cat living species. “The cheetah had one of the most extensive distributions of any living carnivore, ranging throughout Africa and Asia and it is estimated that in 1900 there were more than 100,000 cheetahs throughout Africa and Asia.“But by 1975 this number had decreased to less than 20,000 and today there are less than 7,000 wild cheetah that are now mainly confined to Southern Africa with small numbers in east and north Africa and just 30 cheetahs in Iran. ”Mr McKeown explained that in addition to cheetahs, Fota operates breeding programmes for a number of other globally endangered species including the Indian rhino, the Asian lion and the Sumatran tiger.Mr McKeown said that Fota had enjoyed a very positive public and visitor feedback since it re-opened its gates on May 20th after an eight-week closure due to the Covid-19 restrictions.However, Fota lost over €1.2 million in income during the Covid-19 closure and faced a monthly bill of over €30,000 in feeding costs alone for the hundreds of animals living in the park, he said.“Gate receipts, entry tickets and membership sales provide the vast portion of our income which allows us to continue our conservation work and education programmes on the need to conserve our global bioersity.“Of course, public health, safety and adhering to the Covid-19 prevention advice is paramount here, so it is great to hear the positive feedback since we re-opened with a pre-booking online system to comply with social distancing.”Fota Wildlife Park is open daily from 9am to last entry at 4.30pm.

We’re hoping to work for longer hours to fit in a similar number of people, but just over a longer period of time, so that at any one time there are less people in the salon,” Ms Eccles said.“They’ll send you an email 24 hours before your appointment or they’ll call you and ask you questions like have you experienced any symptoms of Covid-19, have you come into contact with anyone who has a positive case of Covid. Just to really give both our clients and our staff that little bit of reassurance.”Clients will also have to wait outside until the time of their appointment, and a staff member will then come to the door and take them in for their appointment.They will then be required to wash and sanitise their hands before putting on a mask and single-use gown.“Some people will use maybe a disposable one, but we’re going to use our normal ones and then once that client wears it, we’ll take it off and put it in a 60 degree wash,” Ms Eccles added.The Federation has also urged its members to ensure that time schedules are kept to, in order to prevent any overlap of clients or delays.“We will be very strict when it comes to anybody who shows up late for an appointment. We simply wouldn’t be able to accommodate them because it will impact then that appointments for the rest of the day,” Ms Eccles said.The Federation said that demand for hair services has been “extremely high” with many people being unable to get their hair cut since the coronavirus restrictions came into place in mid-March.Ms Eccles said she had “dozens of messages” when news broke that the reopening of the sector is likely to be brought forward.“First of all, we’re going to go back to those people who missed appointments in the first few weeks of closure and they will be the first people that we will offer to get booked in,” she said.“From there then we have a waiting list and we’ll start working through the people just so we can keep control of the appointments and the numbers so everything will be very organised.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4276566.1591876894!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach says ireland may be almost fully open by mid july","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach  Leo Varadkar said some restrictions would have to continue including a ban on mass gatherings.

He stressed that the Government’s plan was suppression not mitigation.Mr Varadkar said it indicates that easing of restrictions could continue and the Government is now conducting extensive work with NPHET (National Public Health Emergency Team) about speeding up phase three and four and “have the country almost fully open by the middle of July rather than the middle of August”.But he said some restrictions would have to continue including a ban on mass gatherings.“It all depends on us continuing to keep the virus under control,” but he added that “the last couple of days have been encouraging” notwithstanding the deaths in that time.Referring to childcare services he said they could re-open from June 29th. The Taoiseach acknowledged that the vast majority of crèches closed for July and August but “we would anticipate that those that usually open for summer months will re-open”.Mr Varadkar also echoed the comments of Minister for Education Joe McHugh on Wednesday appealing to schools, teachers and special needs assistants to participate in the summer programme for children with special needs in July.Making the appeal, Mr Varadkar said “we can’t do it without them”.Opening his weekly debate and question and answer session in the Dáil Mr Varadkar also said that the Health Safety Authority had

post-Brexit transition period. Photograph: Andrew TestaNew York TimesBritain wants to accelerate the pace of its negotiations with the European Union by changing the format of the talks, a cabinet office minister told MPs on Tuesday. Paymaster general Penny Mordaunt said any agreement must be in place before the end of the year so that businesses would have time to adapt to its terms.“There is no point in our arriving at an agreement at the 11th hour: we have to arrive at an agreement to enable it to be implemented and ratified, but also in order for our citizens and businesses to prepare. That is what is dictating the timetable, and that is why we must have renewed focus. We are talking to the EU about having a change of format – about how we can increase the pace of negotiations, get the focus where we need it to be, and get a deal done for both our sakes,” she said.‘Achingly pragmatic’Ms Mordaunt said the government would soon publish plans for preparing Britain’s border operations for changes after the end of the post-Brexit transition period. But she declined to give details and said officials were planning for all outcomes, including the possibility that no deal would be agreed.“It would be prudent and wise for us to prepare for every scenario, just as we have always done. We did so last year and then did not need to implement those preparations. I am confident that we cannot only come to an agreement but do so in a timeframe that gives people the time that they need to prepare and to understand. We are very aware of the other things that are going on in the world that form the backdrop to that. Our approach is going to be achingly pragmatic,” she said.Transition periodFormer Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith said that businesses in the North had told him they were moving jobs to the Republic because of the implications of the Northern Ireland protocol. The SDLP’s Claire Hanna drew the minister’s attention to last week’s vote in the Northern Ireland Assembly calling for an extension to the transition period.“The government insisted that the Northern Ireland Assembly should have the final say on the protocol. The Assembly finally gave a say on Brexit when it voted last week to request an extension to the transition period to allow businesses, which are currently in the fight of their lives due to Covid, to adapt and to have the certainty that the minister refers to. If the Northern Ireland Assembly’s consent is so vital, should the government not listen to what it says?” she said.Ms Mordaunt said that, although the Assembly would determine whether the terms of the protocol remain in force in a few years’ time, the government would not extend the transition.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

Rather, it is an attempt to meet the strictures of social distancing in a country struggling to cope with coronavirus.The authorities have given the go-ahead for cameras to roll again as India\u0027s lockdown is eased, and Bollywood executives have no doubt that film production will return to pre-virus levels within months.However, producers must follow an exhaustive list of rules, including a reduction in the number of crew members, social distancing on set and remote castings. Regular temperature checks will be taken on set by an on-site healthcare professional, with an ambulance made available at all times.But in one of the biggest – and for audiences most visible – changes, scenes involving close human contact will be cut, for the short term at least: bad news for fans of the legendary Bollywood group dance montage.Kissing – long a controversial subject in Bollywood films – will also be banned for the foreseeable future. Some have suggested using flower imagery, in a throwback to early Bollywood films, to demonstrate when a couple become intimate.For dance scenes, the new measures are expected to mean no big group montages because this would break social distancing rules. Instead, there is likely to be just the lead actor and actress, dancing separately and in turn without the usual 20 to 30 backing dancers.Even before the new guidance was announced, actor-producer Sanjay Suri said: Cinematic intimacy will take time to return. I can\u0027t imagine us sweating and close dancing in a film immediately. We surely will have to reinvent a working style and be cautious.In whatever form it does return, the reopening of India’s £2.4 billion industry, which usually produces more than 1,500 Hindi-language films every year – double the output of Hollywood – will come as a welcome relief to this movie-mad nation.Entertainment and films run through the lifeblood of our nation. The cultural connection between the industry and the psyche of our nation is extremely deep, and it has been that way for generations, explained Vikram Malhotra, the CEO of Abundantia Entertainment, a major Bollywood production house.These film stars see regular worship by their fans, much like they would worship goddesses, and there can be an elaborate ritual of prayers and celebrations that take place before the launching of a new show.Indeed, pre-lockdown, an incredible 15 million Indians visited the cinema daily – over one per cent of the entire population.When Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister, placed India under lockdown on March 25, production sets and cinemas shut as Indians were only permitted to leave their homes to purchase essential groceries and medicines.Bollywood has lost in excess of £100 million in box office sales alone.More than 500,000 daily wage labourers working in the industry – stitching exuberant outfits, designing dramatic set backdrops or working as runners for demanding stars – also lost their jobs.Despite pledges by production houses and film stars to cover wages, many labourers have been without any income for over two months.On Monday, when the government announced that private businesses were allowed to operate again, the government for the state of Maharashtra published a 16-page document detailing the rules that production houses would have to follow in order to reopen.Mr Malhotra welcomed the lengthy advice, arguing that it is necessary to protect the health of workers in a manner meaning their livelihoods could also be maintained.He aims to resume filming in July, once he can ensure that the new guidelines can be followed.Where shoots have started, the entire set is being sanitised on a regular basis, we are shooting with an optimum crew and the crew is using face shields, gloves, and other necessary safety equipment, said Punit Misra, the CEO of domestic broadcast business at Zee Entertainment Enterprises, another major Bollywood production house. Vidya Balan, an actress who was working on the blockbuster Sherni when filming was postponed, also welcomed the new regulations.This is probably going to be the new normal for a while, and besides doing the best we can to help each other out during these trying times, I\u0027m looking forward to embracing it and getting back to work and doing what I love, she said.Although cinemas will remain shut for now, the Multiplex Association of India has proposed a safe plan to reopen them from June 30.This will include the wearing of masks in the cinema, the use of e-tickets and seats between families being left empty.Even in lockdown, Bollywood has been plunged into controversy, with superstars like Priyanka Chopra and Disha Patani prompting an unusual public backlash after they spoke out against the killing of George Floyd by police in the United States.Indians responded on social media by questioning why the actresses had not condemned Islamophobic attacks their own country.Priyanka Chopra wants to end racism in the US, but is just fine with the blatant Islamophobic attacks in India, wrote one user.Whilst others were also quick to point out that both Ms. Chopra and Ms. Patani advertise skin fairness creams, these criticisms are unlikely to impact Indians\u0027 long-term love of cinema, and Mr Malhotra said it won\u0027t be long before cinemas are packed again.There is no doubt demand will return to 100 percent levels in a country like India, which is entertainment crazy, he said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"poole oxford seeing first stirrings silent majority","story":"Three cheers for the residents of Poole for protecting Baden-Powell’s statue by the harbour.

And we get William Gladstone’s name removed from a university building because of the sins of his father, for goodness sake.No doubt the extreme end of those protesting this week are thrilled by this. Just look what we can achieve when we intimidate people, they must think. Is there no end to what we can do when we bypass the ballot box and shout loudly enough?No wonder, then, that what started with a disgusting killing thousands of miles away in Minneapolis has led with lightning speed, via Colston, Gladstone and Milligan, to Little Britain and Ant and Dec. That’s the deranged logic of judging history by 21st century wonky wokeness. If Ant and Dec are fair game, then so is just about everyone living and breathing before about 2012. You might not know it from watching the BBC, but only 13 per cent of people, according to YouGov, approve of Colston’s statue being destroyed by crowd violence. Most are aghast at these self-appointed statue-topplers. By all means let’s have a sensible, democratic debate about statues, portraits, books and much more. If some need to be removed, then we can decide to do so calmly and democratically. But random mob demolition? He who shouts loudest gets his way? Think again.And let’s just ask ourselves what would happen if this all continues. Why, anyone with a grievance and a few loudmouthed mates would be free to take exactly the same route. If one group of protesters can destroy something they find offensive, the next group – perhaps with a genuinely racist agenda – will do exactly the same. That’s anarchy for you.And yet, our Conservative government is silent, seemingly choosing the path of least resistance. Fair enough, it wants to beat Stammer to the centre ground. But it can\u0027t afford to sit out this culture war. Its hard-fought 80-seat majority was built by attracting voters who agree with the people of Poole, are horrified by the vandalism of Churchill and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Oriel College’s desire for reasoned debate not knee-jerk capitulation.But if the government continues to dither, the silent majority must act for them. No doubt powerful forces will still put pressure on Poole and Oxford. Those battles aren’t yet won. But what matters is not the inidual skirmishes in what is now an all-out culture war, but the willingness of ordinary, decent people to stand up for common sense, democracy and debate.More from

statues of profiteers targeted in an ethical overhaul in order to help Britain face its history.Monuments to Edward Colston and Robert Milligan have already been taken down through force and decree amid widespread anti-racism protests, while tributes to other slavers and perceived profiteers have been earmarked for removal.The International Slavery Museum in Liverpool has offered to house the statues of those figures expunged from public spaces in an “ethical” reassessment of the UK\u0027s monuments.Curators are in contact with local authorities to discuss the future of potentially dozens of statues linked to the slave trade, with a view to exhibiting the fallen sculptures and educating the public on the people they depict.Street signs bearing the names of complicit figures could also be displayed in the museum as further action is taken to honour moral values over historical success in public spaces.Labour councils have launched a review of monuments, and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has announced a commission to help ersify the capital’s array of statues. A website to “Topple the Racists” has also been set up by campaigners earmarking public honours, including those for  former Prime Ministers William Gladstone and Sir Robert Peel, which are perceived to be problematic Curator Jean-Francois Manicom believes the International Slavery Museum would be the perfect place to display any pieces removed amid the widespread reevaluation of monuments. “In all of Europe there is no museum quite like this one for confronting slavery, and nothing is taboo,” he told The Daily .“We are the perfect place to face the past, to shine a light on the history of slavery, which has had such a big impact on Britain. “We are used to education, and controversial subjects are what we deal with every day.”Mr Manicom is in contact with Liverpool City Council regarding the legacy of slavery seen in landmarks and place names, including Penny Lane, named for slave trader James Penny.The curator would welcome contested street signs and other artefacts being housed in the museum as a means to educate visitors on British history, alongside statues expunged from public spaces which he believes are being morally reevaluated.He said:  “What was right 200 years ago is not necessarily right now.  The public now wants something different to the public at the time.   “People now demand ethical values in the public space, not values of wealth, of success, of business.  That’s a big change.”The offer from the Liverpool museum comes as heritage group Historic England pledged to advise local authorities on dealing with controversial monuments now under ethical scrutiny.Dozens with links to slavery or other ills have been earmarked by activists, including the long-contested statue of Cecil Rhodes at Oriel College in Oxford. Mayor Khan has highlighted the predominantly Victorian makeup of London’s statues, and the Victorian Society has told The Daily  that reassessing these monuments is “overdue”.However the Peel Society has defended the former Prime Minister Sir Robert, branding calls for his statues to fall “muddle-headedness”.More from NewsMore from The Back to

one wrote to members describing the Government u-turn as a “victory”.The head of the University and College Union (UCU) praised the “impressive public campaigning” of teaching unions and said they could “achieve similar victories” just two days after the Government abandoned plans to reopen all primary schools before September. The language has led to accusations that unions are more concerned about scoring political points than looking after the best interest of children. Tom Hunt, the Conservative MP for Ipswich who sits on the Education Select Committee, said that no matter what you opinion on the science “the fact that most children will not return until September should sadden us all”.“This is not something to congratulate or give yourself a pat on the back for and it should not be celebrated like this,” he said. “This is not a win for anybody, this is a dire situation for children, particularly those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds.”The Government has been criticised for scrapping the target for schools to return amid warnings that the risk to children from Covid-19 is low compared to the long-term damage of missing six months of education. But in an update to members, seen by the , Jo Grady, UCU general secretary, has been accused of celebrating the news. She wrote: “We\u0027ve seen other education unions succeed recently in their impressive public campaigning to prevent full reopening of primary schools. We can achieve similar victories for our sector when we act collectively.”David Paton, Professor of Industrial Economics at Nottingham University Business School and a member of the UCU, said that he “can understand” safety concerns but was very disappointed to get an email from my own union actually celebrating that schools continue to be closed to most pupils”He said: “Schools are in a difficult position given current Government social distancing guidance, but no-one should be happy about children continuing to miss out on education.”Mr Hunt warned that in some unions there does seem an overriding desire to score political points. Winning the political game seems to be the priority not what is in the best interest of children.”He said that the letter from the UCU “raises the question of whether we will ever be in a position to work together constructively”.The UCU said that their position remains that “schools and colleges should not reopen until it is safe to do so”.A spokesman said: “We are pleased the government has now listened to the evidence and abandoned its unrealistic plan to reopen all schools before the summer. The safety of staff, pupils and their loved ones must remain the top priority.”The NEU added that the union “like everyone else wants to see a return to some sort of normality, and that includes the wider re opening of schools” and that “far from political point-scoring” they are trying to ensure the safety of their staff, the children and the community.The row comes as the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health issues guidance for doctors stating that the majority of children with conditions such as asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, and kidney disease do not need to continue to shield and could go back to school. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/25/11/adobe-project-aero-augmented-reality.jpg","title":"adobe photoshop camera iphone android download phone","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.There are over 80 filters available, including \u0027pop art,\u0027 \u0027dreamscape,\u0027 and \u0027sparkle\u0027Adobe has launched a free camera app for iPhone and Android users called Photoshop camera.Some of these filters are “pop art,” “dreamscape,” “sparkle”, and more.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn total, there are over 80 custom filters available in the app.It can also add real-time Photoshop effects such as auto-tuning to adjust brightness and contrast, and portrait controls.Quick fixes like portrait relighting and distortion removal mean you can post images that look like you spent way more time on them than you did” Adobe says.While the app can take photos and use Adobe’s Sensei AI to adjust them, it cannot record video.The app was announced in November at the company’s Adobe Max conference, and has been in public preview since.The aim of the app was to “bring the magic of Photoshop directly to your camera’s viewfinder,” according to Adobe CTO Abhay Parasnis, speaking to The Verge.Adobe executive says augmented reality could be \u0027bigger than the web\u0027The company does not “see ourselves in competition with social apps or OS camera apps” but will try for partnerships to get its filters inside other apps or built-in to native camera applications.It will also be updated with influencer content at launch, Adobe has partnered with musician Billie Eilish for a custom filter.“You can imagine a world ... where there will be special purposed lenses directly monetized” around events or spaces, Parasnis said.Long term, the company hopes to introduce more people into its ecosystem through smaller apps.That is “working well,” Parasnis said, “and Photoshop Camera is the next one in that journey for us.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

LaCount was able to finish her set, eventually earning a standing ovation from the crowd as well as judges Howie Mandel, Sofia Vergara, and Simon Cowell.Viewers on Twitter expressed their strong disagreement with Klum’s decision to buzz LaCount, with some viewing it as an instance of “bullying” and “body-shaming”.“Heidi Klum body-shaming that girl. That’s exactly what that was!” one person wrote.“.@heidiklum #AGT What you did to that dancer that you said no to was a form of bullying!! Most of the acts on the show are not ‘million dollar acts’! She needed to be validated by all of you for her courage and work.” someone else tweeted.After LaCount’s performance, Vergara and Cowell both gave the dancer positive feedback and a “yes” enabling her to progress to the show’s next stage.

Headquarters in both countries will not be affected but the company’s legal base will switch to London.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBusiness Secretary Alok Sharma tweeted that the decision was a “clear vote of confidence in the UK”.Unilever was forced into an embarrassing U-turn in 2018 after announcing plans to move its headquarters from London to Rotterdam and ditch its listing on the London Stock Exchange. Nestle and Unilever ‘linked to Indonesian forest fires’Some shareholders objected to the proposals which were later ditched, with former chief executive, Paul Polman, and previous chair, Marijn Dekkers, both quitting soon after.After the new legal entity is established in the UK, Unilever plans to keep its main stock market listing in London with secondary listings in Amsterdam and New York. The company revealed it had not consulted Dutch shareholders about the plan, meaning there is a possibility they could block it, as British shareholders did in 2018.Its unusual dual structure emerged in 1930 after British soap manufacturer Lever Brothers merged with Dutch firm Margarine Unie to create Unilever.Establishing the new setup will simplify the business, with board members meeting in London rather than alternating between two headquarters in different countries.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This could be due to the delay between people experiencing symptoms and people being tested for Covid-19.Google has previously attempted to predict such trends through its nowcast function, which launched in 2008. A paper published in the scientific journal Nature at the time explained how people\u0027s search patterns could estimate flu prevalence two weeks before it was registered by official bodies like the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).As the world\u0027s most popular online search engine, the data from people\u0027s digital footprints offered potentially life-saving insights and it was the poster child of so-called \u0027Big Data\u0027. But by 2015 it was shut down after it failed to foresee a massive flu outbreak in 2013.UK now has more daily Covid-19 deaths than the rest of Europe combinedIt was described by some publications as an epic failure and a note on its landing page now states: Google Flu Trends and Google Dengue Trends are no longer publishing current estimates of Flu and Dengue fever based on search patterns...  It is still early days for nowcasting and similar tools for understanding the spread of diseases like flu and dengue – we\u0027re excited to see what comes next.A blog post explaining the decision said that Google would work directly with academic institutions to make sense of the search data. More than 265 peer-reviewed papers have since drawn on aggregated data taken from Google searches, used to track epidemics like Ebola in 2014, Zika in 2016 and West Nile fever over several years in Italy.

Also please wash the mask (with the electronics removed) between uses,” he wrote in the Medium post.The LED housing can be cleaned using ultraviolet light.Glaiel said that he had been working the concept of the mask for a month, and thought about making the LEDs react differently for high-pitched sounds compared to low-pitched sounds.He got the feature working, but said that it “didn’t look good”.“I’m not planning on selling them so you’ll have to make your own,” he added.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In 2003, he sued producer Steve Bing, accusing him of bringing back Hollywood blacklisting by firing him from a film for his anti-war views. During his wedding to Madonna in 1985, he reportedly fired a gun at press helicopters. He also once told a journalist he hoped his critics would die screaming of rectal cancer. When Penn accepted the best actor award for Milk at the 2009 Academy Awards, he alluded to his difficult reputation, saying: “I did not expect this… and I want it to be very clear that I do know how hard I make it to appreciate me, often.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn a new interview with SiriusXM DJ Howard Stern, he said: “There’ve been several times I’ve worked with directors who I felt might have found a different job description, and perhaps weren’t the storytellers that their initial meetings with each of us actors might have indicated.“Actors are kind of canaries in the coalmine emotionally, and you have to go to whatever place is necessary inside yourself.

Eight batches of Starlink satellites have been launched so far, with plans for them to eventually form a 12,000-strong constellation.Elon Musk says Mars-bound Starship spacecraft is now \u0027top priority\u0027In 2019, astrophysicist Dave Clements described the Starlink project as a tragedy for astronomy, claiming that the so-called megaconstellations of satellites would cause interference for both radio and optical telescopes.In response, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said he was taking key steps to reduce their brightness, which are now being realised on the latest launch.SpaceX worked with the American Astronomical Society (AAS) to test different methods to address the issue. These included painting reflective surfaces black and using sun shades to block sunlight.The latest approach involves twisting the satellites during periods of their orbit when they are most reflective, so that only the knife-edge thin sides of the solar panels are visible.SpaceX told The Independent that it also worked with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NROA) and the Green Bank Observatory (GBO) to minimise the impact of the satellites.Despite these measures, there will still be times that the satellites are visible to the unaided eye and will continue to be noticeable at certain times in the first week following their launch.We\u0027ve taken an experimental and iterative approach to reducing the brightness of the Starlink satellites. Orbital brightness is an extremely difficult problem to tackle analytically, the firm said in a statement.Created with Sketch.The most incredible space images of Earth Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Explore ESA astronaut Tim Peake\u0027s stunning photos of Earth, taken from the International Space Station during his six month mission (captions by Tom Peake)Every day spent living in space is a great day, but today was particularly special.

In the documentary, a number of people accuse her of being responsible for his death.Accusations aired in the series include one that Baskin fed her husband’s body to the big cats at her sanctuary, a claim she brands “ludicrous”.Baskin has never been charged with anything related to Don’s disappearance.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort.

Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

Please consider a contribution or subscription.The Black Lives Matter protests and the accompanying debate has led to “soul searching” among senior officers on whether enough was being done to address the issues, according to defence officials.In a letter to members of the army, royal navy and the RAF, General Sir Nick Carter said recent events “have brought the issues of racism and discrimination sharply into focus. We owe it to our black, Asian and minority ethnic servicemen and women, who will be feeling concerned at the moment, to try to look at this from their perspective, to listen and to continue to make change happen”.The chief of defence staff said that although the armed forces is a “rich mix of faiths, colour, gender and creeds reflected in British society”, it must be ensured that people are judged on their abilities and “not for what they look like or where they come from”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe military must also, he said, drive through changes for the better when necessary rather than just follow guidelines.Black, Asian and ethnic minority (Bame) personnel make up just over 8 per cent of the total armed forces – with a target to increase that proportion to 10 per cent this year. Ethnic minorities accounted for around 14 per cent of the UK population, according to the last census in 2011. Belgium’s protesters target the bloodstained legacy of King Leopold IIFor the past four years the armed forces ombudsman annual report has repeatedly highlighted that ethnic minority personnel are significantly more likely to report bullying, harassment and discrimination than their white counterparts.It was reported this year that just over 17 per cent of racially aggravated crimes investigated by military police over the past five years resulted in guilty verdicts at court martial. Out of 35 investigations launched over the past five years, only six people have been found guilty.Emma Norton, head of legal casework at the civil rights group Liberty, said: “These stark figures suggest large numbers of Bame service personnel are suffering in silence and feel unable or unsupported to report allegations of racism and pursue complaints.”An MoD spokesperson had said in response to the reports: “Racism has no place in the military and anyone found to be behaving in such a way can expect to be disciplined, discharged or dismissed.We are committed to stamping it out and have a range of measures to ensure that this issue is tackled.”Defence officials point out that the UK military has won a number of awards over the years for being among the best employers for racially erse personnel in the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.The Home Office has been pressing ahead with deportation flights despite warnings from the UN that they risk spreading coronavirus.The Independent has learned that a charter flight is set to depart the UK for Lithuania on Friday despite calls by the UN Network on Migration for all governments to suspend forced returns during the pandemic. The group warned the practice posed a risk to both deportees and the countries receiving them.Twenty-four removals from the UK took place between 20 March and 3 April alone, returning iniduals from Bulgaria, Romania, Hong Kong, Poland and the USA. The Home Office has declined to reveal the total number of deportations that have taken place during the lockdown.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe flight to Lithuania is due to depart with just one inidual on board, prompting concern that the Home Office is acting against public health and at a cost of thousands of pounds in taxpayers’ money. A previous freedom of information request revealed almost £12,000 per person was spent on charter flights last year.Home Office progress to protect vulnerable detainees ‘too slow’Man with coronavirus placed in immigration removal centreHundreds held for deportation despite travel banThe number of people in the UK’s immigration detention estate has fallen considerably since the lockdown started in March, but about 254 people are still being held. To place someone in detention, the Home Office must have a realistic prospect of removal within a reasonable timescale.In a statement published last month, the UN Network on Migration said: “Forced returns can intensify serious public health risks for everyone – migrants, public officials, health workers, social workers and both host and origin communities. Forced returns place additional strain on countries of return.”It warned that deportees may be at risk of experiencing “extreme financial hardship” and potentially human trafficking on return to their country of origin, due to already high levels of unemployment as a result of the pandemic.They may also face additional risks such as lack of access to adequate health care and poor water and sanitation systems, the UN said, adding that many health systems were already stretched and lacking capacity to protect returnees and their communities, including through testing upon arrival and quarantine and self-isolation measures.Bella Sankey, director of Detention Action, which has legally challenged the Home Office’s continued detention and deportation of migrants during the pandemic, said: “Despite guidance from the UN and the government’s own public health advice against all but essential travel, the Home Office is desperately seeking to operate a forced removals policy throughout this pandemic regardless of the clear dangers.“Tomorrow Priti Patel has chartered a private plane to remove just one person to Lithuania, sacrificing common sense, public health and thousands of pounds of taxpayers’ money. The humane and responsible response is to suspend all removals and release people safely from detention until this emergency has passed.”The Home Office has been contacted for comment.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But organisers stepped up after the lockdown began and started providing 5,000 meals a week to families in Poplar struggling to afford or access food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDizzee volunteered as part of his work with Kitchen Social – the Mayor’s Fund for London programme providing food for children across the capital during the school holidays. “I was given an amazing opportunity to visit and help out Kitchen Social at Bygrove Primary School in Poplar, who are providing free food, books and school equipment to kids in the local area where I grew up,” he said.“Thank you to all the amazing people I met and thanks to the Mayor’s Fund for London for connecting the dots.”How to support our campaignBygrove Primary School is also receiving vital supplies from The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project.The food surplus charity, which delivers to hundreds of food banks and community projects across London, began helping the school at the start of the crisis by dropping off one or two trays of fresh produce and staple items each week.The charity has since increased the supply from one or two trays of food each week to 40 trays to help organisers cope with the huge demand.Mark Causton, manager of the school’s initiative, said: “The Felix Project have been an immense help – I can’t praise them enough. We know we’ll need to carry on this work right through the summer, so we rely on all the fresh food they’re supplying.”Mr Causton added: “We’ve seen a lot of parents furloughed or losing work over the past couple of months. In the case of some families struggling to afford to buy shopping, this is one of their only sources of getting food for their children.“It was really great to have Dizzee Rascal here helping out. He got stuck in, and got on so well with all the volunteers and all the families. It was just nice to see a smile on a lot of people’s faces.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible. May, who has driven Felix vans delivering food to vulnerable Londoners throughout lockdown, said: “At least in this stay-at-home pub quiz version, it will be easy to cheat.” 7.30-9pm. Tickets £10: thefelixproject.orggreatestquizOur appeal was also boosted by the silent auction, in partnership with Quintessentially Foundation, which closed this week with 135 bids placed for 36 lots and raising almost £40,000.The most highly prized lots were two tickets to a Liverpool FC game, four tickets to the Euro 2021 semi-finals, a video-chat with Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, a private guitar lesson with singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and a helicopter lesson.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Everyone is very grateful,’ says a volunteer who also uses service when his own illness means he is unable to pitch inFormer music manager John McIntyre was unsure how he would cope when lockdown began.“I was very scared,” said the 75-year-old who has a respiratory condition and lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in Dalston. “If I caught Covid, I wouldn’t be able to get enough oxygen to the heart. I just had to follow the advice and be safe.” Mr McIntyre, who used to manage the jazz reggae band The Beatroots, has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema.He has relied for his daily meal from local charity Made In Hackney which is supplied by our Help the Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project. Mr McIntyre is one of more than two million people who are classified as “extremely vulnerable” because they have compromised immune systems. For the last 10 weeks, many of them have struggled to get access to food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince March, volunteers from the River House Trust charity have been dropping off Felix produce to people living with HIV. One such volunteer is former actor Stephen Hart who was diagnosed in 2006. When he is too ill to leave the house, he also uses the food delivery service.Despite being high-risk and a life-long diabetic, Mr Hart has been helping to get food to those more vulnerable than him. He has been unable to work since his health deteriorated two years ago, but Mr Hart, who lives alone in south London, said he wanted to help others.How to support our campaign“When I feel well enough, I pick up boxes from River House and drop them off for people who need them,” he said. “I do it when I can but some days are bad days.”Mr Hart said his condition means sometimes he can’t get out of bed. He occasionally receives a Felix box for himself so he knows he has food when he is too sick to move. “It is reassuring to have food in the house,” he said. “Felix has been a lifeline.”Although the British HIV Association said there “remains no evidence” that people with HIV are at greater risk of Covid-19 infection, those with a low CD4 count – the white blood cells affected by HIV – have been advised to shield.Mr Hart said members of the HIV community have been “nervous” since the outbreak. “There isn’t much specific advice so the community has been trying to look after each other.”A 62-year-old living with HIV for 37 years, who asked not to be named, described how his parcels have helped him. He said: “I pick up the boxes as I don’t have energy to go shopping. They’ve been great.”Mr Hart said it was extremely moving to see the response to his deliveries: “It is amazing. Everyone is very grateful.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

They urged her to reflect on your words and to consider the impact it had towards black communities in the UK trying to highlight their voices against racism.We all have our personal stories, of the racism that we have faced, whether it has been being defined by the colour of our skin of the faith we choose to believe in, the MPs wrote.Our shared experiences allow us to feel the pain that communities feel, when they face racism, they all us to show solidarity towards a common cause they do not allow us to define, silence, or impede on the feeling that other minority groups may face.Ms Patel reacted angrily to the letter, posting it on social media and tweeting: Sad to have just received this letter. I will not be silenced by Labour MPs who continue to dismiss the contributions of those who don\u0027t conform to their view of how ethnic minorities should behave.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The US protests were initially called after the killing of George Floyd, a Minneapolis black man, by a city police officer. The movement has however spread worldwide and become an outlet for discontent at institutional and systemic racism.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Headquarters in both countries will not be affected but the company’s legal base will switch to London.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBusiness Secretary Alok Sharma tweeted that the decision was a “clear vote of confidence in the UK”.Unilever was forced into an embarrassing U-turn in 2018 after announcing plans to move its headquarters from London to Rotterdam and ditch its listing on the London Stock Exchange. Nestle and Unilever ‘linked to Indonesian forest fires’Some shareholders objected to the proposals which were later ditched, with former chief executive, Paul Polman, and previous chair, Marijn Dekkers, both quitting soon after.After the new legal entity is established in the UK, Unilever plans to keep its main stock market listing in London with secondary listings in Amsterdam and New York. The company revealed it had not consulted Dutch shareholders about the plan, meaning there is a possibility they could block it, as British shareholders did in 2018.Its unusual dual structure emerged in 1930 after British soap manufacturer Lever Brothers merged with Dutch firm Margarine Unie to create Unilever.Establishing the new setup will simplify the business, with board members meeting in London rather than alternating between two headquarters in different countries.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Almost 210,000 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in New York City alone since the US pandemic began, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhilst one million Americans contracted the virus within the initial three months of the pandemic, the past one million cases were contracted within six weeks, according to the data.  The US also continues to have more confirmed Covid-19 cases and deaths – which have passed 112,000 – than any other nation.The National Center for Disaster Preparedness (NCDP), issued a warning this week that the US case count was “multiples more” than the confirmed two million.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?US authorities have otherwise claimed that high testing levels were contributing to the confirmed case count, in comparison to other states and international data.Whilst new coronavirus cases have declined in some parts of the US, including New York, there are now 20 states with rising infection rates as states ease some restrictions. California, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, and Arizona are among 20 states with more cases on average in the past week, according to New York Times analysis.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.China has removed pangolin parts from its list of traditional medicines, state-backed media reported, in a move campaigners say is a vital step in helping to protect the endangered animal.Pangolins – the world’s most trafficked mammal  – are highly sought after in China and Vietnam for their meat which is considered a delicacy, while their scales are used in traditional medicine and folk remedies.Similar in size to domestic cats and the only mammal covered in scales, all eight pangolin species are protected under international laws but there remains a growing illegal trade of the animals. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis week health authorities omitted pangolin scales from China’s latest Pharmacopoeia, an approved list of traditional drugs and remedies due to “wild resources exhaustion”, according to a report in the Health Times.WildAid CEO Peter Knights said the move was “the greatest single action that could have been taken to save pangolins from extinction.”“The increased protection coupled with the swift and comprehensive closure of live wildlife markets and removal of many wild species from the list of what can be consumed as food in China were already very positive steps to saving the pangolin worldwide and reducing the possibility of them ever being a vector for disease.“And now this announcement, effectively the closure of legal sales of pangolin scales, shutting the last major loophole in pangolin protection efforts,” he added.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) welcomed China’s decision, but urged action to stop the sale of pangolins on the black market. “PETA gives a nod to China for taking an important step to combat the demand for pangolin scales,” director Elisa Allen told The Independent.“However, as long as it remains desirable and profitable for endangered animals’ body parts to be sold for medicine, wildlife will continue to be killed on the black market.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some scientists believe they may incubate the Covid-19 virus that is thought to have emerged in Wuhan last year and has since swept the globe.Scientists find virus similar to Covid-19 in pangolinsFollowing the outbreak of coronavirus at the end of last year, China banned the consumption of all wild animals in a bid to prevent further outbreaks but many wet markets have since reopened.Earlier this year, The Independent renewed its call for the banning of trade in wild animals to help protect endangered species and avoid future pandemics.“These actions of China will have a real impact, these are steps that were critical, that needed to be taken if real conservation was going to happen for these animals,” said David Olson, director of Conservation at WWF Hong Kong.“Most of the demand for pangolin is coming from traditional Chinese medicine and consumption. That’s what is driving this large scale illegal trade.”With additional reporting by Louise Boyle Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

What previously took a number of researchers a long time can now be accomplished by one drone operator in minutes.”The paper’s lead author Dr Andrew Dunstan, of the Queensland Department of Environment and Science, said: “Previous population survey methods involved painting a white stripe down the green turtle’s carapace when they were nesting on the beach, then getting on a small boat and counting painted and non-painted turtles.“Our eyes are attracted much more to a turtle with a bright white stripe than an unpainted turtle, but the pain washed off after a few days and the counting accuracy suffered.“Trying to accurately count thousands of painted and unpainted turtles from a small boat in rough weather was difficult. Using a drone is easier, safer, much more accurate and the data is permanently stored,” he added.Managing director of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, Anna Marsden, congratulated the researchers and described the images produced by the drone as “extraordinary”.“Raine Island is the world’s largest green turtle nesting site and that’s why we’re working with our Raine Island Recovery Project partners to protect and restore the island’s critical habitat,” she said.“We’re taking action to improve and rebuild the island’s nesting beaches and building fences to prevent turtle deaths, all working to strengthen the island’s resilience and ensure the survival of our northern green turtles and many other species.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s not a time for knee-jerk reactions.#The expert added he does not believe the lack of a body fits the profile of a kidnapping by a stranger.“In my experience, when strangers kill children, orstrangers kill anyone for that matter, they do one thing very quickly and they do it almost automatically – they dump the body of their victim so they’re not caught with it,# he revealed.“That’s just the way it works.#A top detective once hired by the McCanns to hunt for missing Madeleine believes she may still be alive.Former cop Dave Edgar also warned people not to #jump to conclusions about the guilt of the new suspect” currently in custody.His claims contradict those of German prosecutors who say there is enough proof to convince them Madeleine was killed after being abducted.However, the retired detective said there is still no “hard evidence” the youngster has actually been killed.And he said at the moment, there is a #huge way# to go from Christian B being named as a suspect to him being prosecuted.“Secondly, this case is still without a body.

A delaying-the-inevitable tactic which meant, by the time Phil and Dennis’s tickets for the April  game between West Ham and Burnley arrived in mid May, the fixture was as dead as Dennis.A lucky escapeyou ask me.The day of reckoning, when it runs out of episodes, fast approaches, of course. For the duration of the outbreak, though, it’s been a biological miracle.Regulars have packed The Vic, mobbed the Bridge Street market and just stood around gawping and muttering, in their usual community-serving way, when Keegan’s sandwich van was trashed by the local drug dealers.The presence of a global pandemic hasn’t stopped EastEnders lecturing us about other medical issues, obviously.Since the boat party accident, in February, it’s been particularly concerned about Ben Mitchell’s deafness, which cut no ice with me for a couple of good reasons.Firstly, Ben Mitchell is a dreadful, immoral, six-headed little turd who it’s impossible to like, let alone love.Secondly, they’d forgotten he was partially deaf for most of the previous decade.There’s not an international crisis or continuity glitch in the universe that can stand in the way of EastEnders’ moral grandstanding, though, so they decided viewers should “see and hear” last week’s heist episode, with Barry Grant off Brookside, through the eyes and ears of Ben.A particularly gormless enterprise, this one, which went off like Norman Collier and Jimi Hendrix on the same bill at The Half Moon in Putney, and was all feedback and missing words.To ram home the message for the hard of thinking, the action was also accompanied by word cloud subtitles that appeared to have been written by Tarzan.“Keep mind on job.”“Cut power.”“Ben, this mistake.”“Daughter without father.”Compared with other EastEnders episodes, I enjoyed it a lot. I usually do when the show tries something a bit dferent and thought you could actually write the entire history of the show in half a dozen lines of this new Tarzan-speak.“Den hate Angie.” “Peter change head.” “Phil. Him shot.” “You not mother.” “Me am mother.” “Peter change head again.” “Get out pub.” It’d be timely as well. After  years and four months of almost constant shouting and stall-minding, EastEnders goes off air next week.Tantalisingly, The Sun’s very own Andy Halls reported, on Friday, that when it s the show will have dropped its old storylines. A dream scenario which allowed me to fantasise about EastEnders .. A happier, funnier show that’s only on twice a week, where the BBC doesn’t endlessly bask in its own right-on virtue and the majority of characters actually sound like Londoners, instead of stage-schooleditorials.But that’s not going to happen, is it So I’m just going to enjoy the silence. Tarzan like.TIPPING Point, Ben Shephard: “Which city in the Midlands shares its name with a meeting between two sporting rivals ”Bill: “Birmingham.”Celebrity Mastermind, John Humphrys: “In an th century poem, what season of the year did Keats describe as ‘a season of mists and mellow fruitfulness’ ”Monty Panesar: “Oliver Twist.”Ben Shephard: “The Anglo-Dutch wars were fought primarily between England and which modern-day country ”Amy: “Denmark.”.THE Last Leg, Desiree Burch on the George Floyd fallout: “Follow black artists and thinkers on social media, people who have good resources, information, opinions and insights. Right now I have two shows you could watch — Desiree’s Coming Early and Tar Baby.”Or you could watch Too Hot To Handle, where Netflix films young people having sex while artist thinker Desiree offers her “insights and opinions”.But she’s clearly too modest to mention her role on that one.THIS week’s winner is Tory MP Andrew Bridgen and Harry Enfield’s Tim Nice But Dim. Sent in by RJ.FIRST job for the Beeb’s new Director General, Tim Davie  Find out how Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer ended up on primetime, Saturday night, BBC. Seriously, how  It’s a late-night ITV show, with no one to bleep out the swearing, but with BBC levels of over-manning.The star, obviously, was Peter Crouch, who’s actually funnier than  per cent of TV comedians and more likable than all of them, but not yet ready to front his own show. So they added Maya Jama, who looked sensational in her Status Quo Blue For You-era denims, the compulsory Horne Section and Chris Ramsey, who was hiding behind a fence at the start. And should’ve stayed there. All deserve our sympathy. SOS was meant to be a Euro  spin-off and when the tournament vanished so did the show’s point. Camera angles also seem to have gone to hell, but that’s maybe an act of socially distanced mercy given what’s happening front and centre.Saturday’s content included: A teabag- flipping contest between Mo Farah and Ellie Simmonds, parachuting with Jermaine Jenas, which was straight off the Alan Partridge script and foul-mouthed football “bantz” from Rio Ferdinand, who said his career was ended by Peter Crouch, so may have been playing keepy-uppy to the Match Of The Day theme tune as some sort of twisted payback.The really alarming thing, though, is the series lasts eight weeks.Save Our Summer  At this rate, there’ll be a dark cloud hanging over autumn as well.For the record, it was the BBC News.SPRINGWATCH’s Steve Backshall wearing a “No planet B” T-shirt like he’s a -year-old student, rather than a -year-old BBC presenter who won’t shut up about his three kids. Bafta giving nominations to The Greatest Dancer and The Ranganation but not a Best Drama nod to Line Of Duty.This Morning’s Phillip Schofield losing his very short temper with John Torode over yoghurt dressing. Anyone who says “chowing down” instead of eating. And the clearly smitten GMB host Susanna Reid making an involuntary groping gesturewith her left hand, just after she says the name Keir Starmer. Easy tiger.PETER Crouch: “It wasn’t all about improving, it was also about getting better.”Ian Wright: “The one thing about Gerrard was his professionalism and the fact he was so versatile.”Paul Merson: “It was definitely half an open goal.”                                 SKY Documentaries’ McMillion, the best show on TV.Ralph’s wedding on The A Word. ITV’s th birthday tribute to the great Bradley Walsh.The GMB spat between Piers Morgan and Donald Trump’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, which had everything except the obvious reprimand: “Rudy. Stop your messin’ around.”And Channel ’s Murder In The Outback, where disgraced Australian lawyer Andrew Fraser proves, beyond much forensic doubt, Bradley Murdoch did indeed kill Peter Falconio.The only slight glitch being, he’s trying to prove the exact opposite.Watch it, Channel , tonight and tomorrow, pm. The self-delusion becomes hypnotic. A Gillian Burke on Springwatch B Connell Waldron on Normal People C Comedian Tom Allen on nearly everything MOST surprising thing about Britain’s Best Parent  Anita Rani isn’t the most annoying person on this Channel  show.In fact, she’s not even close to a medal position thanks to the other five – two couples and a single mum – who must champion their own style of parenting, whether  it’s “pushy” or “vegan” or mollycoddling or just sort of lying around in bed all day treating their offspring as the hired help.Like the rest of us, Channel  silently understands, of course, listening to strangers talk about their small children is no more engaging or enlightening than listening to a ­scientologist talk about L. Ron Hubbard, so they’ve included a few eccentrics to liven  up the process.On the one hand there’s martial arts enthusiast Robin, who explains: “Our parenting style is influenced by eastern philosophy. Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism,” ventriloquism, egotism, Roxette’s fourth album Tourism.On the other there’s gender fluid feminist nut Joana, who is attempting to bring up five-year-old son Willow as “a free spirit”, by banning the word “boy”, refusing to buy him “militaristic toys” and plastering her house in idiotic Socialist Worker propaganda.Hopefully, little Willow will be a stalwart of his local golf club and TA unit  in about  years’ time.But that’s no real saving grace for the show, nor a reason to watch any part of Britain’s Best Parent, apart from the final vote where, every week, the studio audience has to choose between those “free spirits” who let the kids rule the roost and those couples, like David and Nicky, who run their house more like an SAS boot camp.And every week, I’m happy to report, they vote for the boot camp.All hope for Britain may not be lost.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In her case, it’s not pretty.Where to start  How about son number two who, thanks to his friendship with billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein is now embroiled in an ugly, cross-Atlantic ding dong with an American legal system that kowtows to no one.Clearly, Andrew hoped his royal status might ensure discretion. But the US Department of Justice has other ideas and has now publicly accused him of lying when he says he has offered to co-operate with their inquiries into Epstein’s questionable activities.It’s uncertain whether The Queen and Prince Philip have Netflix in their lockdown lair at Windsor Castle, butthey have watched the documentary Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich — in which their reportedly favourite son is mentioned many times — they will have spat out their popcorn.Aside from the well- documented claim by Virginia Roberts that she was trafficked to London at the age of  to have sex with Prince Andrew , one of the most damning accusations is the alleged sighting of him at Epstein’s private island where airport staff now say that the billionaire, who allegedly killed himself last year, frequently arrived with “underage girls”.Ordinary people staying schtum at the time for fear of losing their jobs is one thing but the silence of the many powerful men who enjoyed Epstein’s hospitality is quite another.Prince Andrew is undoubtedly one of them and, at the very least, he owes it to Epstein’s survivors to sit down with the US Department of Justice and reveal what he does, or doesn’t, know.And asthat’s not enough to give his mother sleepless nights, he and his ex-we Sarah Ferguson are also being sued for a £.million unpaid debt on a Swiss ski chalet.Meanwhile, son number oneis happy enough in his second marriage, but reportedly harbouring a deep sadness that one of his sons has chosen to leg it to the US, along with the baby grandson he can no longer hug.On top of that, he faces forking out millions to help Harry and Meghan pay for personal protection because not only have they chosen to settle down in paparazzi central, but in a country where the gun culture means any nutter can wander into a store and arm up as easily as buying a microwave.Son number threehas just announced that his children won’t use royal titles and will work for a living.But one wonders whether, given the pressure to streamline the monarchy, they jumped before they were pushed.Daughter Anne is a reliable stalwart, but grandson Peter recently announced his marriage to we Autumn is over, and as for grandsons William and Harry, it’s fair to say that the reported fall-out of those two young brothers who walked so stoically behind their mother’s coffin must be causing The Queen great sadness.So, with all that going on with her nearest and dearest, how will she feel when lockdown finally lts and she’s expected to put on a brave face to the world again Will she think, “I’ve had enough” and, as was rumoured prior to the pandemic, abdicate on her th birthday next year Doubtful, given that she pledged she would be of service “my whole le” and that, traditionally, British monarchs occupy the throne until death.But, given her family ructions, who could blame hershe did decide to call it a day If he had bodyguards with him on his ious visits to Epstein, then perhaps they could enlighten the US authorities on Andrew’s movements at the time Andhe didn’t, then why the hell does he need them now Asthe new, -day quarantine rule wasn’t daft enough, it’s emerged that police have been told to take “no immediate action”a passenger gives a  address on arrival in the UK.Right. So the only travellers affected by this ludicrous policy will be the law-abiding and public figures who risk being spotted on holiday then named and shamedthey don’t self-isolate upon .Everyone  can just give their details as Mickey Mouse of Taking The Mickey Street, and go about their le with impunity.Meanwhile, the airline industry is teetering on the verge of bankruptcy because it sends out the message that Britain is closed.Well. Done. Everyone.Prince Albert of Monaco has a problem – his subjects are getting too old.According to the BBC documentary Inside Monaco, it’s the most elderly country on Earth.So the principality has launched an “influencer” award aimed at attracting a younger “YouTube” generation who,the footage of their garish supercars is anything to go by, have money but zero taste.The awards are the brainchild of the prince’s friend . . .  . . .  Princess Camilla of Bourbon Two Sicilies, Duchess of Castro If Little Britain ever doesto our screens, she’s a shoo-in.Dancing On Ice is reportedly considering filming the show with two-metre social-distancing measures in place.If the rumours of their big fallout are true, last series contestant Caprice and her dance partner Hamish Gaman would have had no trouble with implementing it.Pixar’s animated movie Coco has been voted the most tear-jerking film of all time, with Marley  Me in second place and Schindler’s List in third.It was the result of a Twitter survey by US film critic Kevin Lee, who asked followers to tell him “the hardest you’ve ever cried in a movie TV show”.I haven’t seen Coco, but my weepiest, cinematic experience didn’t make the top ten.It’s Mask – starring Cher and Eric Stolz – a film that rendered me so inconsolable that the man in front of me askedI could “shut the hell up”.And Goodbye Mr Chips wasn’t far behind either – but at least I was home on the sofa for that one.Other than Leonardo DiCaprio browsing for a new girlfriend, who actually shops at underwear store Victoria’s Secret any more Not many Brits, it seems – its  UK stores have just gone in to administration.Back in the day, VS underwear was tasteful and good quality, but somewhere along the way it lost sight of its core customer.The owners clearly forgot that, while men lusted after the scantily-clad “Angels” such as Alessandra Ambrosio at its catwalk shows , it’s primarily women who buy lingerie.And the majority want “tastefully boudoir” not “garishly bordello”.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Millions of key workers across the supply chain have continued to work throughout this pandemic and are hidden heroes, keeping Britain fed.He added that manufacturers are fully engaged with a wide range of government-led initiatives designed to tackle the huge public health challenge of obesity.  FDF members’ voluntary work is already delivering substantial changes. Compared to four years ago, FDF member products contribute  per cent less calories,  per cent fewer sugars, and  per cent less salt to the average shopping basket.He said the government needs to invest money in specic measures to support people and areas that are most affected by obesity.We believe a whole lestyle approach will be most effective, focusing on how we achieve a balanced diet and keep active, and not on any single nutrient.” To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Wearing a mask helps to reduce pollen coming into your mouth and nose, which is great.“Adding a pair of wrap around spectacles will keep it out of your eyes.”The pollen forecast ies depending on what part of the country you are in and today the south of the county will be hit by high pollen levels.This week experts warned that pollen would flourish over the next few days.This is while the midlands and north west will have mild pollen and the north and Scotland will have low levels.Dr Glenis added that some areas of the country do have it worse than others.“The south gets the pollen first because the climate is warmer and then the pollen gradually moves northwards so that the far north of Scotland is probably about three weeks behind having its main pollen count.She also said that when the pollen count is high it could trigger first time outbreaks.“There may be people who have not previously been sensitive enough to notice hay fever who will get it this year.”. Use vaselineDabbing a little bit of petroleum jelly around the edges of your nose works as a barrier to trap pollen before you breathe it in.A standard tin of Vaseline will do the trick – just smear a small amount around the edge of your nostrils.. Try some nasal sprayIf you’re struggling with a blocked, itchy or runny nose, a steroid nasal spray might provide you with some extra relief.They work by reducing the inflammation inside the nose.It’s best to try and use them for a week or two before you think your symptoms will start as they can take a few days to work, according to NHS advice.. Shower morePollen can stick around for a while on your skin even after youve gone back indoors.If you have been out in the sun all day then its important to make sure you shower afterwards, this will wash away any of the pollen still attached to your skin and hair.. Cut down on boozeBeer, wine and other spirits all contain histamine - the chemical that sets off allergy symptoms in the body.Sick of fighting against runny eyes  The Met Office recommends sticking to the soft stuff where possible to avoid adding any unnecessary allergy pressure.. Take your meds at the right timeIt may seem obvious for anyone that an antihistamine will help, but its actually knowing when to take them that could make the dference.As well as wearing a mask to help stop symptoms, she added that people who follow a plant-based diet may not experience severe symptoms.Diet is fascinating because diet alters the bacteria living in your gut, and they in turn could alter the way your body reacts immunologically.A diet that is rich in short chain fatty acids promotes good bacteria, and the sorts of things that help that are plant-based foods - fruits, vegetables, and also yogurt and fish.This year the country has seen a clear strain of hay fever related symptoms and Google searches have revealed that more and more people are looking for ways to treat them.Earlier this month money revealed that searches related to hay fever relief wipes had increased by over , per cent during a seven day period at the end of May.Between May  and June , searches for the “best hay fever relief” were up by  per cent.This is while searches for “how to stop hay fever” were up by  per cent.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We will maintain that extra capacity until such time as there is more certainty, the spokesman added.Yesterday, Government scientists revealed their fears of a deadly second wave in the winter which could throw a spanner in the works to kids education and the wider recovery,Sir Patrick said last night that scientists were looking carefully at how lockdown was managed should this happen again in the winter.Professor Whitty said: We have to accept that we could find ourselves in one of three situations.One is where we have a situation wherestarts to escape control.The aim is that wevery slowly to prevent that from happening but thats the risk.The second situation isand we all think there is a a reasonable chance that in the winter this virus will have some advantages it doesnt have the rest of the year.Its something that transmits more easily indoors.Therefore, things that are working well in summer and autumn may cease to be working as well in winter.The nature of new epidemics is very often they come in waves, circling around the world andwe get hit by another wave.At that point we need to understand better what is the optimal mix of things we can do.One of the Governments key tests for lting lockdown is ensuring the NHS will be able to cope - but as the nights start to draw in and more people fall ill with regular winter viruses, the health service could start to falter again.Today No said again that the threat level for the virus had not reduced down from four to three as was predicted.Some moves to ease the lockdown have been made - such as reopening schools for some pupils and plans to open shops next week - but that is because Boris Johnson has ensured the five tests have been met. To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So how can you use their toilet facilities safely and what are the rulesyou get caught short when youre out and about We spoke to some experts to find out how you can make the most of the Governments new relaxed rules and keep safe...For years we have been told its only polite to put the toilet seat down when we have finished our business.James Milnes, managing director at Zoonos, said leaving the seat up is more hygiene friendly.Leave the lid of the loo seat up to reduce the number of people needing to touch it to lt the seat up and down. To be courteous to other guests, clean the loo seat with an antibacterial wipe after use.Washing your hands for  seconds, socially distancing, not trying each others drinks, are all things we should be doing to protect ourselves from the virus.But some people may be more liberal than others when it comes to hygiene and what they think is acceptable.If you are having people over to your house Dr Lisa Ackerley, the Hygiene Doctor, suggests making it clear to guests what you expect from them before they arrive.She told The Sun: With less than half of the population practising surface hygiene within their homes according to new research from Unilever, we all need to remember the importance of targeted hygiene in and out of our homes. With this in mind, when visiting the toilets at our friends’ houses, take care to follow hygiene advice.For those who are hosting guests, it’s not a bad idea to have a chat before your guests come about how you are going to manage visits to the toilet during their visit.Of course, youll never be using the toilet at the same time as someone , but its important that on your way there you keep two metres apart from others.Its also vital not to congregate in dferent rooms in the house and make sure the route is clear for the other person to pass.Dr Marybeth Sexton, an infectious diseases expert at Emory University School of Medicine, said letting someone  use your bathroom is safer than you might think - as long as you take some precautions.If someone goes into the house to use the restroom, let them go in alone.Dr Lisa said you should also wait until the coast is clear before trying to get to the bathroom, making sure there is a clear pathway for you.Just because you look after your personal hygiene, it doesnt mean that others do the same.If youre at someone s house then make sure you take your own hand sanitiser just to be on the safe side.Once youve washed your hands make sure you dry them properly.Dr Lisa said: “Just before entering the bathroom, use hand sanitiserso that your hands are clean when you touch door handles and the flush. Once inside the bathroom and the door is closed, wash your hands for  seconds using soap and water before going to the loo. And then wash them again after going to the loo.If youre hosting its important to remind your guests to wash their hands.Dr Sexton told the LA Times: When they’re done, it’s critically important that they wash their hands really well.Its also important to make sure all the guests are not using the same hand towel and perhaps you could provide paper towels or kitchen towels for them to dry their hands with.Moist or wet hands can breed germs so make sure you dry them properly before leaving the bathroom.Dr Lisa said that you should also clean surfaces once you have used them so the next person after you can go to the loo safely.If your host has provided disinfectant, then use it on any surfaces you may have touched. Once you are done, go straight back outside, don’t be tempted to linger.Once outside use a hand sanitiser again, particularlyyou have touched anything . ”When it comes to the host, she said: It is very important that you regularly disinfect frequently touched surfaces in the bathroom – such as bathroom taps, loo roll holder and toilet handles or flush button - before your guests arrive. Then disinfect again, before and after someone has used it, using products that are known to kill SARS-CoV- such as Domestos Thick Bleachand C Antibacterial Spray that have recently been tested in a lab to confirm this.”With most facilities closed and people free to exercise to their hearts content, at some point someone is going to need to go the loo.Local councils have closed public toilets and some parks such as Clissold Park in Stoke Newington, London, have signs all around warning the park is not a toilet, go homeyou need to go.If you pee outside you could risk being prosecuted for public indecency.If you have friends in the local area then you could text or call and ask to use their toilet. Make sure on days out you take wipes and hand sanitiser with you just in case.Data from charity Water Aid has revealed that more than one in six women who are menstruating worry about where they can go to the toilet when they are on their period with the majority of facilities being closed.Its clear that this is a problem many people are dealing with and sales of the Sheewee, a device that lets women urinate without exposing themselves,has seen an increase of sales of up to  per cent during the lockdown.Health researcher Valentina Milanova said there are also a whole host of other issues for women.Assuming that people with periods can spend unlimited time outside, without access to public toilets, is unrealistic. If someone is on their period or unexpectedly starts their period while outdoors, then complications will arise as they are unable to use or change sanitary products. This could result in health issues for the user, as sanitary products such as tampons require regular changes or washes. For women on their period who dont have access to a toilet experts said it may be time to time a menstrual cup that doesnt need to be changed for  hours.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Speaking to news.au, Professor Robyn Young of Flinders University said: “His autism meant he was at risk because he wasn’t responding by name and he was upset by helicopters flying overhead.But at the same time there were a number of things that were protecting him.“Much of them relate to hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity – basically they have a high pain threshold.“We’re not surethey don’t feel it or don’t respond to it but I’ve seen kids that have walked around with broken bones.”She added that William probably didnt feel the cold as much as another child would have.

He was eventually found by volunteer Ben Gibbs almost  hours after last being seen.I was wandering through the bush, and it was quite thick so I was breaking my way through it, said Gibbs.

Professor Spector, of King’s College London, said there was the possibility that a rash might be the only symptom displayed by children who had contracted Covid-.He told the \" rel\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\"Evening Standard: “It’s looking like it is predictive of having a positive [coronavirus] test and GPs are unaware of it, so they are sending people away, or NHS  is not recognising it as a possible symptom.“It’s usually in combination [with other symptoms] but it can come on at dferent times — sometimes after the other symptoms. It can come two weeks after the other symptoms, or two weeks before - it’s just being missed because the public is unaware of it and doctors are unaware of it.Prof Spector pointed out that rashes had been highlighted in early cases of Covid- from China and Europe, but there had not been any published studies so far. In particular, he highlighted that the rash shown in coronavirus patients looks like an allergic rash or a chilblains rash.And Prof Spector emphasised that it is unusual and is often seen in people who dont normally get rashes. He cautioned people to be vigilant, adding: It can just last for a day and disappear...other people get it for a long time.”Developed by researchers at Kings College London and company ZOE, the COVID Symptom Tracker has been helping to predict the scale of the coronavirus outbreak in the UK.Anyone - including healthy people, those who think they might have Covid- and those who have been diagnosed with the virus - can download the app and fill out some forms which describe their health and ask about possible coronavirus symptoms.It has been used by almost four million people in the UK.Prof Spectors symptom tracker app was the first to highlight the loss of taste and smell as Covid- symptoms - and these were eventually added to the official NHS list last month.And he believes his team have also detected the new symptom of skin rashes several weeks before Public Health England do anything about it.

A poll of , adults identied the most welcome scenes in le with experiences enjoyed by the coast, an open beach and the sunrise and sunset, topping the list. Home comforts are also popular with a third loving nothing more than the sight of fresh bedding while  per cent like to look at a clean house. The study, commissioned by Scope Eyecare, also found the UK is a nation of animal lovers, with birds flying around in the morning and a dog happily wagging its tail featuring in the top . Seeing a loved one or friend for the first time in a while also made the list, with  per cent saying this makes them feel happy,  per cent sentimental and  per cent excited. A sixth even said a fully stocked supermarket shelf is a apossight for sore eyesapos - which may have not made the cut prior to the current pandemic. Eye care expert and oculoplastic surgeon, Dr Sabrina Shah-Desai said: Itaposs clear from the research how important sight is in terms of lting peopleaposs spirits. Eyesight and healthy eyes are often taken for granted, and thataposs even despite the prevalence of sore and dry eyes - something which affects half the population.  While aposlockdown eyesapos are a definite result of increased screen time, less natural light and even stress, there are lots of things we can do to ease discomfort and minimise potential longer-term damage. If youaposve been spending long periods of time in front of a screen, check in with how your eyes are feeling by taking the new £EyePromise health test.  The research also found the positive feeling from experiencing a sight for sore eyes lasts almost five hours. As the worldaposs lockdown restrictions ease, the study asked what participants would most like to see and found more than a third of adults have a bucket list of places they want to visit. More than  per cent want to get out and about in UK cities while  per cent would rather go abroad - with the likes of Australia, New Zealand and Japan popular choices. And  per cent of over s said theyaposd like to promise themselves they will see more of their children and grandchildren while a third hope to reunite with old friends they have lost touch with. A further two fths of adults vow to visit more beaches in le and  per cent would like to see more nature. It was found people experience an average of five sights for sore eyes during a typical week, but this has decreased by  per cent during lockdown. But more than half admitted they took nice sights for granted pre-lockdown, with  per cent actively looking for a positive image each day during isolation. More than half of adults even agreed an uplting, unexpected sight has been known to improve their day. However, more than a tenth are apossick of the sight ofapos their computer monitor while  per cent are fed up of looking at the same four walls. Other things people have grown tired of seeing include politicianscertain celebritiesand other peopleaposs selfies . And with people spending more time at home than ever, piles of washing up, a dusty house and an overflowing laundry basket are also unwanted sights. The study also found that the lockdown has resulted in  per cent looking at screens for longer than usual which may explain why a quarter have experienced an increase in tired eyes. A third of respondents notice dry eyes when using a computer, while a sixth do so when scrolling on their phone. Half of those polled, via OnePoll, even claim to experience uncomfortable eyes every day. Dr Shah-Desai added: When concentrating on digital screens our blink rate decreases from eight clinks per minute to just one or two, leading to eye strain and dry eyes.

It says many children with conditions such as cerebral palsy and scoliosis should no longer be shielded. It adds that the benefits of school in terms of access to therapies and developmental support outweigh the risk of infection. It said: Children and young people who are cared for just in primary care are very unlikely to need to continue to shield.Do you have a coronavirus story to tell  Email webnew@mirrorThe RCPCH has created two lists, with those on List A being advised to continue to shield. These include children with immunodeficiency and immunosuppression, such as those who have had transplants, children having cancer treatment for acute leukaemia and Non-Hodgkinaposs Lymphoma. Children with signicant impairment in their ability to cough and to clear their airways are also on the list.  On the other hand patients on List B can discuss with their doctors whether it is safe for them to stop shielding, and, for example,to school when these reopen. This includes children with some cardiac conditions, those with sickle cell disease and children who were born premature with oxygen requirements. Those with kidney disease, cystic fibrosis or more serious asthma are also included on the B list.  Dr Liz Whittaker, co-author of the guidance for the RCPCH, said: There is a group of children who are very clinically vulnerable, and they should continue to shield. There is a second group who are currently shielding but may not need to do so. Itaposs important for parents and carers to have a conversation with their specialist to determine the best course of action. These conversations will be informed by knowledge of the severity of the disease, intensity of the treatment, and, for some, their home situation. We need to get the balance right between clinical risks and the social impact of shielding.  We know this has been a tough period for lots of children, young people, and their loved ones. This guidance is to help doctors have evidence-based discussions with parents and carers. Figures out last month show that one in  people in England is currently on the Covid- extremely vulnerable shielding list.Data from NHS Digital shows that % of the population in England, or ,, people, have been veried by GPs and hospitals as suffering from conditions that mean they should be closely protected from exposure to coronavirus."},{"url":null,"title":"girl 2 left needing rabies","story":"NewsGirl, , left needing rabies jabs after bat flew through window and scratched her faceMum Charlene Corcoran, , from Leavesden, Hertfordshire, said her daughter Amelie was attacked at around am - and the little girl has had to have rabies jabs as a resultShareCommentsByHarrison Moore:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsAmelie was left needing rabies jabs after she was scratched by a bat \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Mary Rose Young has been putting her own touches on the beautul country home in Lydney, Gloucestershire, by hand since , when she purchased the property for just £,. After  years in the house, she put it up for sale in  and estate agents told her that she could expect it to fetch at least £, from prospective buyers. But her hopes of selling up to open a boutique hotel nearby were dashed when only one person could be persuaded to view the house, with Mary Rose saying they aposleft pretty quicklyapos. Despite the decor leaving Mary Rose and her husband Phil Butcher stuck in the home, the -year-old potter has refused to paint over her leaposs work and says she still loves her home, which she also uses as a workspace and gallery. She said: I made this house around my own le and I wasnapost thinking about it being sellable. Weaposre living like two children in a dollaposs house and in retrospect why would anybody  want to buy it  Itaposs like a playhouse for adults. I just thought it might go to a mad collector of my work who might want to buy it, but no one was interested.  Only one person came and looked at it in the year it was on the market and they werenapost here long. I think they had just come out of curiosity to see the decoration and were never interested. The estate agents despaired. I could have painted over all my work, but I didnapost want to. I love my house and the house really works for me. Iaposm a colourful person and I even have pink hair. I like it more and more as I get older.  Since the failure to sell left her dreams of running her own hotel in tatters, Mary has doubled down and put even more effort into putting her mark on the property, turning the courtyard into a bright pink painting studio last year. When she originally bought the house, which is comprised of two knocked-through cottages, she painted the entire home white in a bid to bring more light in, but when that failed she began drawing patterns inspired by her colourful pottery on the walls.  She said after doing one wall orange with red dots it helped distract from the fact thereaposs aposhardly any natural lightapos and it went from there. She added: It became a really fun project for me on the side of my pottery business and I was so galvanised by it I ended up neglecting my pottery at times. Mary Rose has also incorporated her pottery pieces into the homeaposs features, with a pottery chandelier in the sitting room and handmade pottery tiles in the bathroom.

The grisly discovery was made on the grounds of Christ Church, near the site of an old graveyard in North Shields.A forensic tent covers the site where the bones were found, while a police car has been keeping guard over night, Chronicle Live reports.Forensic experts are trying to establish the age of the bones which was found just yards from several centuries-old graves. As such, an official at the Anglican church told ChronicleLive that they do not expect the remains to be the result of anything sinister. The graveyard was closed in  so there have been no burials since then, and Albion Road was widened in about , said the female, who declined to be named. Instead, she suggested they may have been remains - buried before the road was widened - that had been missed off during the work a century ago. A spokesman for Northumbria Police said: “Shortly after .am on Wednesday we received a report that suspected human bones had been found during gas work repairs on Albion Road, North Shields. “Officers are now working with forensic experts to determine the age of the bones and the circumstances behind their discovery.  A cordon remains in place and enquiries are ongoing.” The news comes after a creepy wall made from human bones and skulls was discovered under a cathedral in Ghent. Researchers from Ruben Willaert BVBA made the eerie findings while exploring St Bavo’s Cathedral in February.The wall was found to mainly consist of thigh and shin bones from adults, which the researchers believe date back to the late th century.

She was arrested after officers recognised descriptions of her as having “fat cheeks” and resembling the TV funnyman. A court heard MacDonald stole from one woman as she pretended to deliver Easter eggs. And prosecutor Gavin Howie said another victim, Mary Wilson, , had £ stolen from her hand after she visited a cashpoint on a shopping trip. He said: “She was approached by a person who she thought was a man but was actually this defendant who said ‘be careful there lots of wrong people about here after money and drugs.’ How prophetic she was. “Shewalked to a nearby farm foods shop and asked them to call police and described the defendant as looking a bit like Johnny Vegas.” At Manchester Crown Court Mrs Wilson, a widow, said: “I am cautious and think of myself as streetwise despite my age. I believe the defendant targeted me and assumed I would not protest as an elderly woman. “I am a strong person and am one of  children and I want to tell the defendant just how wrong what they did was.”  Mr Howie added: “These were quite deliberate and targeted attacks on elderly, disabled and vulnerable people and they caused emotional distress and a loss of confidence for the victims. “In all these incidents she attacked elderly people where she hovered around them before she struck.” MacDonald, from Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester, admitted five counts of theft between February and April , plundering almost £, from five women, and was jailed for a year. She had previous  offences dating back to , including robbery and theft.  In mitigation her lawyer Jane Dagnall said: “These were despicable offences and she has an appalling record and she paints a pathetic persona today. She is an animated character who was previously given a chance by a court, tried hard but failed and her demons got the better of her.’’ Sentencing her, Judge Alan Conrad QC told MacDonald: “You stole from elderly and vulnerable people whose confidence you set to gain and then distract them in order to steal from them.

The famous red-jacketed Beefeaters, who have guarded treasures including the priceless crown jewels since the th century, are among those who also risk losing their homes, as many live within the grounds of the Tower.Do you have a coronavirus story to share  Email webnews@mirrorOfficially called Yeoman Warders, all are ex-servicemen and women who have achieved the Long Service and Good Conduct medals. The redundancy plan comes as the heritage charity which runs the palaces says having to close its historic doors during lockdown means it is running up a £million shortfall. Staff at Historic Royal Palaces including the Banqueting House in Whitehall – where King Charles I was executed – Kew Palace in London, and Hillsborough Castle in Northern Ireland, are also affected. Meanwhile, HRP plans to “reopen some of the beautul outdoor spaces in our care”.  “We are absolutely shocked by this bombshell,” a member of staff at the Tower of London says. “It’s a bolt from the blue. No one thought it would come to this. We know visitor numbers are way down, and it will take a while to recover – but we are responsible for some of the most iconic buildings in the country. Are they really going to let us go to the wall ” Pandemics have historically fallen unequally on populations, and Covid- is no dferent. But this is not just true of who is dying of Covid- – where clearly race, class and low-pay have played a defining role, and ‘white collar quarantine’ is still protecting those in middle-class jobs. It’s also true of who will lose the most economically. While lower-paid workers have had to keep working and exposing themselves to the virus, we are now starting to see deep job losses from household names such as carmaker Bentley, British Gas and British Airways, and especially in retail and hospitality.  Last week the Prime Minister said: “I am afraid tragically there will be many, many job losses. That is just inevitable.” But he also said the Government would be “activist and interventionist” in helping people in the next phase of the crisis. So far, the Government has refused to step in and help HRP staff. Mark Serwotka of PCS union, which represents many of the Historic Royal Palaces’ workers, says: “The decision to slash wages and cut jobs in HRP is a disgrace. “Our members help guard the crown jewels and keep historic royal monuments and premises clean and safe. They should not be paying for the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. The Government should immediately intervene to secure jobs, pay and pensions of staff going forward.”  HRP chief executive John Barnes says the decision to cut the “dedicated team” has been heartbreaking. “The closure of our six sites for three months has dealt a devastating blow to our finances, which we expect to continue for the rest of the financial year and to be compounded by the slow recovery of international tourism,” he says. “We have taken every possible measure to secure our financial position, but we need to do more to survive in the long term. We simply have no choice but to reduce our payroll costs. “We are heartbroken that it has come to this.” "},{"url":null,"title":"madeleine mccann suspects british ex","story":"NewsMadeleine McCann suspects British ex-girlfriend claims: I found beast waiting for me under bedWORLD EXCLUSIVE: The woman from Berkshire, who dated Christian Brueckner when she worked as a barmaid in the Algarve, has told of her relationship with the charming and softly-spoken German who she said turned into a possessive, violent cheat and a stalkerShareByMartin FrickerDan Warburton:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video madeleine-mccann-suspect-christian-b-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news madeleine-mccann-suspects-british-ex-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The disturbing incident took place hours after he brutally attacked her in a jealous rage after she innocently hugged another man, she told the Mirror. She claims he repeatedly slammed her head against a wall in the ladies toilets of the Algarve bar where she worked - leaving her a bloodied mess. When the woman ed home she had a “horrible feeling” someone was inside and found Brueckner under her bed. The -year-old believes the German was lying in wait to attack hershe brought another man back to her studio flat. But instead Brueckner, then aged in his late s, chillingly stared at her and said “goodbye” before fleeing.  She said he then embarked on a stalking campaign against the petite barmaid, leaving her too afraid to walk home alone. Portuguese police were twice called out to deal with Brueckner after she complained of the attack and stalking - but he was never charged. The  break-in has eery similarities with Madeleine’s disappearance two years later in nearby Praia da Luz, where he was living. Gerry McCann previously said he believed her abductor was hiding behind a door when he went to check on her. Investigators believe the person who took Madeleine broke into their holiday apartment through a window. The woman, who is still too scared of Brueckner to reveal her identity, today reveals her account of her relationship with the Madeleine suspect.  She tells the Mirror how the German: • Seduced her when they worked together waiting tables in an Algarve restaurant. • Flew into jealous rages when other men paid her attention or even spoke to her. • Branded her a “lazy Brit” when she refused his demands to clean his house. • Chillingly broke into her flat through an open window and hid under the bed after a bust-up. • Now believes her ex, who is in a German prison, could be responsible for Madeleine’s abduction. She said: “Until now I’ve refused to believe someone I was involved with could commit such a horrible and disgusting thing like hurting a child. “But I’m not sure anymore. I’m starting to wonderhe did do it. Andhe did, he needs to be really punished for it.  “It’s chilling to think my ex is suspected of abducting Madeleine McCann. I can’t cope with it.” The woman, from Berkshire, moved to the Algarve town of Lagos in late  after spending several years in the Netherlands. She landed a job in the Taberna de Lagos restaurant - now called Sal e Companhia - alongside Brueckner, a waiter who was two years her junior. “At first I didn’t actually like him that much,” she recalled in a softly-spoken southern accent. “Not for any reason, I just didn’t like him. “I was , he was a couple of years younger than me. Everyone called him Chris. “He liked me, I knew he liked me in ‘that’ way but I wasn’t interested. We slowly became friends in the spring of . “Chris could be very, very charming, very funny and very smooth in the way he talked. “He always dressed nicely, holding the door open for women, that kind of thing. “I was alone here in Portugal, no family around and a bit lonely and I was getting all this attention from this guy. “We got together romantically and at first it was great. The relationship was very nice.” The woman stayed over regularly at Brueckner’s rented farmhouse on the outskirts of Praia da Luz, less than a mile from the Ocean Club.  “I was living in a little flat by myself on the same road as the restaurant where we worked,” she said. “He was living in Luz in the house that has been on the news all week. He was living on his own. “He wasn’t sleazy in the beginning, he was very charming, even chivalrous. “He drove the nice car - the black Jaguar - and was very gentlemanly and spoke properly. “Our sex le was normal. He wasn’t into anything weird with me. “We used to go out to eat a lot. He wasn’t a veggie. He liked to eat Indian food. “He also liked German food. I remember in his house once he made strange German food that I didn’t like at all. “He liked taking me to the beach. He didn’t like the town beach in Lagos. It would always be the West coast beaches, the isolated ones. “He liked those because he didn’t like lots of crowds, that’s what he said. He didn’t like all the tourists in the summer. “At first he seemed very easy-going, very relaxed, but gradually after summer things changed. “During the summer it was good, but during the winter it started to get not so good.” Her first inkling that things were not right came when she bumped into a male friend in Lagos in late .  “We were chatting and suddenly he stopped talking to me, like he was spooked or suddenly remembered something,” she said. “Someone later told me Christian had previously threatened the guy because he’d seen us speaking before. “We also started to argue in the late autumn, early winter. “It would be small things. He would get angry about really small things and I would get upset. “I remember he lost it once because I didn’t clean his house. I said ‘I’ve got my own house to clean, I don’t live here.’ “He was like, ‘You should clean my house, you’re a woman’. “He said he had two Portuguese girlfriends before me and they both cleaned his house even though they never lived there. “I remember saying, ‘but I’m not Portuguese’, and he replied saying ‘English women are all lazy’. “He said he had seen an English girl for a little while and she was lazy like me. “He called her Carol, I think it was only for a few weeks, she was on holiday and they had a fling. “He started to get possessive but it wasn’t to my face, it was behind my back.  “He also began going back and forwards to Germany over that time. He’d stay one week in Germany, then back to Portugal. “I remember feeling suspicious, like something strange was going on, so I looked at his phone. “I found messages in German from someone called ‘B’ saying ‘Ich liebe dich’ - I love you. “It was a German number, and obviously he had been going back and forth to Germany, so I put two and two together. “I confronted him about those and he went crazy, completely crazy. We had a huge fight.” Worse was to come weeks later when Brueckner flew into his jealous rage at theBar - now called Little Breakfast - in the early hours of New Year’s Day. “I started New Year’s Eve working in Taberna de Lagos and then after midnight I worked at another bar,” she recalled. “Chris was at the bar and was drunk. “Some really nice guys I’d made friends with came in from the bar next door to say happy New Year and gave me a hug. “Chris just suddenly came round the bar in a crazy rage and dragged me out in front of everybody. “He grabbed me by the neck, pulled me into the girls toilets and was ramming my head against the wall. “There were people pulling him off me, I think it took four big guys to get him off me.  “They called the police and some officers came. I was on the floor and couldn’t move because I was in shock. “I didn’t talk to the police because I was scared of what he would doit meant he got arrested. “The police soon left after I said I didn’t want to deal with them. “I stayed there the rest of the night recovering and eventually two friends, a guy and his girlfriend, walked me back to my flat. “I went through the security gate and up two flights of stairs, into my flat and closed the door. “Something was really strange inside there. It’s hard to explain, something just felt strange. “I went into the bathroom and the toilet seat was up. I always put the toilet seat down, it’s what I do, so it was another clue. “I was sure someone was either in there or had been in there. “I started looking in the cupboards and then thought I’d check under the bed. “I peeked under and got the shock of my le. He was hiding under there, lying on his back, staring at me. “Can you imagine how that felt  I just froze. I didn’t know what he was going to do to me. “He got out from under the bed, acted like everything was normal, said goodbye to me, walked out and closed the door behind him. “I was there all alone, just shaking and shaking. “I think he was there waiting to see whether I brought anyone home with me. “To this day I still wonder what would have happenedI had brought someone back that night.  “I think, from the previous behaviour, he would have really, really hurt that person and me too.” Despite the vicious beating and break-in, she enraged her friends by rekindling their relationship weeks later. “A lot of people were very, very angry that I went back to him after what had happened on New Year’s Eve,” she admitted. “He begged for my forgiveness, saying he lost control because he was drunk and would not drink again. “He wasn’t a big drinker when we were together, so stupidly I believed him and we got back together with him. “But it was never the same.” The final straw came in mid- when she found women’s underwear in a bag belonging to Brueckner. “I found a pair of knickers that weren’t mine and I got really, really upset about that,” she said. “I confronted him about it at his place and again he went totally crazy. “He drove me back to Lagos. I got out of his car and that was it as far as I was concerned.” But Brueckner had other ideas and began stalking his ex and staking out the restaurant where she worked. “We had to call the police because he kept trying to get in,” she said. “He was stalking me constantly. “One day I was carrying a big tray of drinks and because I wouldn’t talk to him he knocked them out of my hand and they went everywhere. “The police were called and he was banned from coming inside.  “So he would wait outside and follow me. Sometimes it would be begging me to go back with him. “But other times it would be him threatening me or saying I’m going to find out where your parents are and do something to them. “People had to walk me home each night. There was someone each night. Eventually it stopped but it went on for a long while.” She told how Brueckner had a string of ‘relationships’ with older women that led her to believe he could be a gigolo. “There was one lady he used to take out to dinner sometimes, she was a bit older, and he said it was just for company,” she said. “There was another lady, she was much older and I think there may have been something going on between them. “He used to walk her dog and clean her apartment - at least that’s what he told me - and she gave him money for that. “She lived in the centre of town. He took me to her house a couple of times, to see her dog. “He used to go to people’s houses a lot, saying he was going to visit this person and that person. “But the more I think about it the more I wonder what  he was doing. “At the end of the day I never found out who the other underwear belonged to, or who ‘B’ was. “A friend of mine said to me she wonderedhe was some sort of gigolo, doing things for money with older women. “Looking back on it maybe I was very, very naive at that time. I was a lot younger, a lot more impressionable.” The woman moved on with her le but was stunned to get a visit from Portuguese police officers last year. They quizzed her about a rape Brueckner carried out on an American pensioner in Praia da Luz in , shortly after they split. But they never mentioned the Madeleine McCann investigation - even though British and German police already suspected his involvement. “I remember the Madeleine case. I remember being here in Portugal when it happened,” she said. “At first I thought they would find her, but they didn’t and then it became bigger and bigger. “The Portuguese police have spoken to me three times in the past year, but never once did they say it was about Madeleine. “They said it was about him, they were investigating him because they had found out he had raped an old lady in Luz in . “They wanted to know all about him. But I had no idea it was to do with Madeleine also. “They asked me what the relationship was like, what the sex le was like, how he treated me, how he treated women.

One mother, Rachel Edwards, from Shrewsbury, in Shropshire, said a rush of pride washed over her as her four-year-old daughter Georgia twirled around in her wedding dress. Rachel, , went through her wedding photo album with her little girl and boy, Thomas, six, during lockdown when Georgia wanted to play dress up. The mother, who works as a group business development manager, said Georgia was only two when she got married so cannot remember her parentsapos big day. Rachel said: Georgia said when she gets married she wanted a princess dress and could she try mine on. It was all her idea! She was so excited to try it on and just kept spinning around. When I saw her I was amazed at how beautul she looked and felt very proud of her. We called her Dad in to see and he just couldnapost stop smiling. Georgia said she felt like she was a princess and Thomas, her brother, wanted to know why him and his dad had not kept their suits from the day to try on again too - they were hired. Rachel and her husband tied the knot in September  on a working farm and particularly loved her wedding dress because it was a shorter style and fit perfectly with the theme of the wedding - but admitted the dress hasn’t been out of it’s box since then. The parents said the sentimental moment left them extremely emotional as their four-year-old daughter revealed she wants to wear it on her wedding day. Rachel described it as a fun family thing to do during lockdown as they have been at home for  weeks. Elsewhere Crystal Pritchard, , from Buckley, said she dressed her eldest daughter in her wedding dress after celebrating her three-year wedding anniversary.  The mother, who works as a domiciliary office manager, said her daughters, Faye, nine, and Jessica, four, were asking about their parentsapos wedding as their anniversary approached. The parent said her two girls kept askingshe still had her wedding dress andshe would try it on for them. She said: I put it on but quickly took it off as I could hardly breathe! Faye being a girly girl was quick to askshe could try it on, how could I say no  She thought I would say no, so was super excited when I said she could put it on and said she felt like a princess, which was exactly how I felt when I tried it on for the first time. Seeing her in my dress looking like a true princess simply filled me with love and happiness. I was proud that something so simple made her feel so special. Crystal said this is the first time the dress has come out of the cupboard since her wedding day on th June .She said her daughter Faye was so happy to be trying on her mother’s wedding dress - she pranced around in it for hours and wanted to wear it to bed. Crystal added: Her smile said it all. We sent photos to the family and they all said how lovely she looked and said we should frame one of the photos. It felt very sentimental and I remember thinking when I got the dress for my wedding I hope both my dad and husband like it and hoped my dad felt proud walking me down the aisle as I certainly felt proud having him on my arm.  Then it made me think about when my daughters get married and I hope they have a lovely day like I did and find someone as special as my husband is. She said the girls have been keeping busy during lockdown and doing lots of activities with their dad including den building, Lego and baking. Meanwhile Tammy Hoare, , from Guildford was left with a tear in her eye when she dressed four-year-old daughter Dakota in her wedding dress.  The full-time mother, who is also mum to two-year-old Harrison, said Dakota has always asked her to see her wedding dress. Tammy said her daughter loves dressing up and would always point at her wedding photos hanging on the wall and ask about the dress. The parent said: My gorgeous girl absolutely loves dressing up. Since she could talk she would always point out how pretty she thought I looked in my wedding dress and she never stopped asking to see my dress and try it on.So lockdown dress fitting day came! I saw other mummys’ sharing it on Facebook so I just thought why not but I was not prepared for the emotional rollercoaster. Tammy said Dakota waited nervously and excitedly at the end of the bed whilst she got her dress down from its storage box where it had been kept for the last five years. She said her daughter’s eyes lit up and she lted her dress out of the box and she instantly felt emotional as memories of her wedding day flashed in front of her. The mother added: Dakota gasped and said how beautul the dress was and then clapped her hands. I already had a tear in my eye as Dakota was still in my belly when we got married. The moment Dakota got dressed up in my huge dress and I saw it hanging off her - it suddenly dawned on me that in many years to come , she will be walking down the isle herself.  Tammy said her mind was racing and she had to stop herself from getting over emotional in fear of spoiling the fun moment. She described her daughter as looking ‘magical’ and took lots of photos to cherish the sentimental moment. The mother said she asked her daughtershe would like to get married one day and was surprised when her daughter looked frightened and told her she didnapost want to get married as she didn’t want to leave her. Tammy said: After her response, we had lots of big hugs! My family thought it was very sweet of me letting her try on my dress , but my husband James seemed very baffled.

Sarah Churchill had a rapid heartbeat and shortness of breath at the end of February - when just  people had tested positive for coronavirus. But instead of getting a fever or persistent cough, incredibly painful rashes flared up on her hands and feet. At first doctors thought she might have blood cancer or even HIV and were left stumped when medical tests showed no ailments. Terried Sarah thought she was going to die and was scared she would leave her nine-year-old son Noah alone. Eventually, more than three months later, the -year-old was told she had contracted Covid- in late February. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE. Now Sarah wants to warn other Brits - who have suffered rashes - that they might have unknowingly got the deadly virus as well. It was pretty scary being told I might have HIV or blood cancer, she said. I really thought I would die. Itaposs been an emotional rollercoaster. The silver lining is that I havenapost got a le-threatening condition like blood cancer or hepatitis. But I still donapost know what damage has been done to my body. People could be Covid- positive, with no other symptoms, and have no idea. They could be spreading the virus, without knowing they have it. Sarah first felt ill at the end of February - weeks before Britain went into lockdown, and only around a dozen Covid- cases had been confirmed.  She says she got night sweats, a racing heartbeat and severe shortness of breath. Her GP put it down to the flu and she didnapost think anything  of it. However a week later, horrible red marks flared up on her hands, feet and nose. Her doctor was left gazumped and said he thought she was immunosuppressed. He thought Sarah might even have blood cancer or even suffer HIV. I just thought I was going to die, shocked Sarah said. It was so unusual I just thought thataposs it, my luck is up, Iaposm going to die of blood cancer.  My father died of cancer, and it brought all of the emotion back now. The mum-of-one had numerous blood tests, but the doctor was left astonished when the results came back normal. This was on March , and as time went on Sarahaposs rashes got more painful. Often she was unable to stand on the balls of her feet, or open drinks bottles. I looked like I had the plague, she said. Itaposs an incredibly painful condition, itaposs not pleasant at all.  Not even resting my hands or feet helped, it just got worse over time. She had more blood tests and consultations and eventually at the start of June a dermatology specialist told Sarah she had had Covid-. He said the lesions were consistent with symptoms experienced by some people who had the killer virus, and her bloodwork was the same. At least my symptoms finally made sense, Sarah said.  Up until then I just had questions. Now Sarah wants to warn others with similar rashes that they may have Covid-. It never crossed my mind I might have got coronavirus, she said. Itaposs fascinating and horrible how many dferent symptoms there are.

Andrew Morton, who has written several books about the family, said he doesnapost believe the monarch will be able to resume her official duties amid lockdown. He claims Covid has practically put Charles on the throne, and says the virus has done more damage to the monarchy than Oliver Cromwell. The Queen and Prince Philip have been social distancing at Windsor Castle since the government restrictions were put in place. At  and , they are both in the vulnerable category and have been carrying out their royal duties via video call and on the phone.  Speaking to the , Morton says that while he believes the Queen would love to get out and start meeting people again, he doesnapost believe it will be possible.He said: “The brutal truth is that her reign is effectively over. Covid- has done more damage to the monarchy than Oliver Cromwell. “Corona has practically put Charles on the throne. “It’s terribly sad but I can’t see how the Queen can resume her job. The Covid- virus isn’t going away soon and will be with us for monthsnot years.  If she gets the bug it could be fatal and would put Prince Philip at risk as well. The Queen has been continuing her duties remotely, and today carried out her first official video call. She joined Princess Anne to speak to some of Britainaposs selfless carers, listening to stories of their daily lives and struggles.The Queen and Anne worked with the Carers Trust to set up the chat, focusing on the extra work theyaposve been doing since the coronavirus Covid- pandemic.Her Majesty told them: Iaposm very impressed by what you have achieved already.  Right now in the UK  million people are caring unpaid for a frail, ill or disabled family member or friend. The Queen and The Princess Royal heard from Alex, Amna, Mary and Nadia, who are all the primary carers for family members, about the dferent roles that carers have to play, and the challenge of juggling their own physical and mental health with that of their loved ones. Nadia Taylor, , from London, cares full time for her mother, father, husband and daughter – who all live together, with her other child.  She said: The call was about  minutes and the Queen was on for about  minutes of that. She asked us all questions. We talked about how we are all coping in the current climate with Covid-. I explained to her how much more isolated carers are at the moment. Many don’t have laptops or tablets and feel very cut off.

But when can you expect your hair or beauty salon to start welcoming clients again, and just how dferent will appointments be in the future  Helen Swiggs, the owner and stylist at XL Hairdressing in St Austell, Cornwall, has revealed what patrons can expect from hairdressing in the future. Helen, , has been working at her salon for almost  years and has seen a fair amount of change in the industry, reports CornwallLive. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE. When can you expect to get back in the salon  There is no clear guidance at the moment for hairdressers from the Government and the National Hair and Beauty Federationon when salons can begin reopening to the public, but it is hoped that it will be sometime in July. Hilary Hall, NHBF chief executive said: We are asking the government to urgently complete the development of the guidelines and release them as soon as possible so business owners know exactly what is required of them to reopen and operate safely.”  How your arrival will be dferent Clients need to be on time for appointments so that the salon can plan the day and keep the minimum amount of people in the salon at any given time. What we have got on order is a screen to go at the reception desk, hand sanitiser will be here at all times, Helen says.And Iaposve got lots of stickers and signs to say to people to use hand sanitiser and we will have strips on the floor for people to show that somebody can enter the salon - but one at a time. She added that itaposs likely there will be a one-way system throughout the salon. Expect your stylist to wear protective gear and to be asked to wear it yourself It is still unclear how social distancing can work for salons and barbershops and what PPE will be required but Helen Swiggs has started preparations and will personally be asking that both parties wear a mask. Her salon will be providing themclients cannot bring their own. We will be socially distancing as much as we can in our profession, which is really dficult, she said. We will have masks for clients and stylists, disposable gowns, capes and gloves.  There will be fewer appointments available We are going to be busy. All salons in St Austell and country wide are going to be busy, she said. But we do have to spread people out and we wonapost be able to fit as many people in as normal and fit one client around another one. Ordinarily there would be three stylists working at a time in XL Hairdressing but moving forward there will only be two and only one stylist per client at any given time. That gives us a really good safe distance away from each other, she said. We will be staggering appointments and having a gap in between clients so that we have time to clean and sanitise everything. She says another problem they are expecting to encounter will be that clients are not going to be having their usual trim. When they first open she is expecting there to be a catch-up process meaning ordinary appointments are likely to be longer than usual.  Say goodbye to your cuppa and magazines One of the staples of your hairdressing appointment is probably the constant supply of hot drinks and reading material. But in the interests of health and hygiene, this will be temporarily unavailable. All of the magazines, books and childrenaposs toys usually available in Helenaposs salon have already been taken away. They will also not be offering tea, coffee or soft drinks to clients so they are encouraged to bring their own and take it away again with them. Salons will also be unlikely to take your coat or jacket from you so that is something to bare in mind.  How the social aspect will change Helen says that ordinarily groups of people - friends and family - could come in to be with a client during their appointment - something that understandably no one will be able to do now. She says another concern is how exactly masks will affect interaction between the stylist and client. Going back to work is going to be lovely, she says. I think we are all excited about going back to work and also seeing clients again that we havenapost seen for ages. It is going to be dferent, we are going to have to stagger lunch breaks and coffee breaks for the staff and we are going to be wearing masks which can be dficult.

The monument situated in Poole Quay had been scheduled for to be put into storage due to concerns about Baden-Powellaposs sympathy towards Adolf Hitler.Officials in Poole, Dorset, had opted to move the monument amid concerns it could be targeted by protesters, but the removal has now been postponed.A large crowd of locals gathered to protect the statue as they argued that it should stay where it stands. Council leader Vikki Slade tweeted the decision to remove it was taken following a threat, adding: Itaposs literally less than m from the sea so is at huge risk. The news comes after anti-racism activists aligned with the Black Lives Matter movement called for statues of slave traders, colonialists and fascist sympathisers to be taken down. On Sunday, protesters in Bristol pulled down a statue of th Century slave trader Edward Colston and threw it into the harbour.  It was feared that the Baden-Powell statue would be next in line, prompting efforts by the local council to protect it from damage. Cllr Mark Howell, deputy leader of Bournemouth, Christchurch  Poole Council, described the statue as much-loved and said it had been at risk of damage or destruction.  We know that local people feel proud of Lord Baden-Powellaposs and the Scout movementaposs links with Poole, and that some people feel that we would be giving in to the protesters by temporarily removing the statue, Cllr Howell said. However, we feel it is responsible to protect it for future generations to enjoy and respect. We will not be removing the statue today as the foundations are deeper than originally envisaged and we need further discussions with contractors on the best way to remove it safely.  Although we cannot say when any temporary removal may take place, we will be providing -hour security until it is either removed or the threat diminishes. In a poll in , Baden-Powell was voted the th most influential person in the United Kingdom in the th century. But critics say he held racist views and was sympathetic attitude towards national socialism.  In  he wrote in his diary: “Lay up all day. Read Mein Kampf. “A wonderful book, with good ideas on education, health, propaganda, organisation etc.” His statue, has been in place for about  years, currently looks across the harbour to Brownsea Island where he started the scout movement in .

The stench of vomit, sweat and faeces worked its way into the very planks of the ship. Olaudah Equiano, trafficked from Africa to the West Indies, described the so-called ‘Middle Passage’ across the Atlantic Ocean: ‘The shrieks of the women, and the groans of the dying, rendered the whole a scene of horror almost inconceivable.’ On their arrival in Barbados, ‘the buyers rush at once into the yard and make choice of that parcel they like best.’ Between  and , British ships transported . million slaves to work on sugar plantations and cotton fields. Over % of the enslaved Africans regularly died during the journey. Some captains even threw slaves overboard, and tried to claim insurance on the lost ‘cargo.’ So, few will shed any tears for the memory of Edward Colston, whose statue was pulled down in Bristol as the Black Lives Matter campaign focused on the historic symbols of British racism. There seemed a poetic justice to Colston being dumped in the docks where his slave ships once set sail. Personally, I would rather the memorial had entered a museum much earlier, under the democratic leadership of the local council.  But now comes the question, who’s next  And what real change for today’s Black communities will this destruction of symbols of slavery lead to  Students are demanding the removal of William Gladstone’s name from an university building because of the Victorian Prime Minister’s family involvement in slavery. Statues of the famous Conservative leader Robert Peel, Scouts founder Robert Baden Powell, even Nelson’s Column have also been targeted. The danger of removing every street name and monument which highlight our bloody past is that future generations may become ignorant of our brutal heritage.  The truth is slavery is deeply embedded in the history of modern Britain, and we need to understand more not less of that violent and racist legacy. Take Liverpool, Britain’s leading slave port in the s which saw , ships sail out of the Mersey to trade African slaves and thenladen with cotton, sugar, and rum. The yield from human trafficking transformed Merseyside into a booming metropolis and the ‘West African business,’ as it was called, was commemorated in streets names and monuments from Jamaica Street to Rope Walk, the Nelson Monument to the Town Hall – with its carved busts of Africans and Elephants.  In the countryside, profits from West Indian plantations built some of the most beautul stately homes and rolling estates of England. Harewood House – the Yorkshire seat of the Lascelles family – owes its magnicence to the , acres of sugar cane fields held across Barbados, Jamaica, and Tobago, as well as a particularly inhumane fleet of slaving vessels anchored off the Guinea coast at Anomabu. More than that, the wealth that came from sugar and slavery gave Britain the funds for the Industrial Revolution. Our pioneering history of industrialisation – in coal cotton and shipbuilding – was heavily indebted to the riches that flowed from the enslavement and sale of Africans. The beauty and elegance of Edinburgh, London, Glasgow and Bath were secured by slave investments.  We need to acknowledge that history. At the Victoria  Albert Museum , we have traced the origins of some of our collections to slave money - and highlighted this terrible contrast between beautul, precious objects and the bloody funds behind them. As museums, we have to be clearer about these uncomfortable truths in our galleries and ensure more Black voices, artefacts and perspectives are heard. From the International Slavery Museum in Liverpool to recent sculptures by Kara Walker in Tate Modern , there is a determination to do so. And, of course, our schools need more time to teach this complex past.  Slavery and Empire are present in the curriculum, but there is simply not enough space given to history in the timetable – and so the story of colonialism and slavery, and its legacies today, is lost. So, I hope we can add to this history, rather than subtract from it. With new plaques on old statues contemporary memorials to those lost to slavery and more space for Black figures in our public squares and streets.

His British ex girlfriend says the German paedophile was driving the battered Volkswagen estate around the time the three-year-old vanished. Detectives investigating Brueckner’s potential involvement released images of two vehicles linked to him – a black Jaguar and a two-tone camper van.But now his ex has sensationally revealed he owned a third car, details of which have never been made public. The woman, from Berkshire, said he began driving the estate in mid-, two years before Madeleine disappeared. He also owned the black Jaguar at this time but had not yet bought the camper van featured in police photographs.His ex has been interviewed about the vehicles Brueckner was driving, but is unsureshe mentioned the VW estate to cops. Police in Germany have not disclosedMadeleine’s DNA has been discovered in Brueckner’s camper van or Jaguar.  But with German prosecutors saying they do not currently have enough evidence to charge him, the suggestion is they have not found any. The undiscovered VW estate, therefore,traced, could potentially hold the clues to finally crack the case. His ex, a British mum aged , who we have agreed not to name, has given detectives crucial leads about their main suspect. They include details of his associates in the Algarve and Germany, the layout of his home in Praia da Luz, and remote beaches that he took her to. We revealed yesterday how she dated the German for nearly a year during  and , when they both worked in the same bar in Lagos in the Algarve. She told how he broke into her flat through a window and hid under her bed, hours after he brutally attacked her in a jealous rage when she innocently hugged another man.  Brueckner allegedly repeatedly slammed her head against a wall in the toilets of the bar where she worked. The woman now believes that Brueckner, who is in prison in Germany, could be responsible for the abduction of Madeleine in Praia da Luz in .She revealed details of the third vehicle owned by Brueckner in an exclusive interview with the Daily Mirror. She said: “Towards the end of our relationship he had another car as well as the Jaguar.  “I haven’t seen that mentioned anywhere. It was a Volkswagen. I don’t remember the model. It was a dirty, yellowy, mustardy kind of colour. “It was an old one and was long. I heard he still had it around the time Madeleine disappeared, along with the Jaguar.I think I told the Portuguese police all about the cars, but I can’t be sure about the estate.  “When I spoke to the Portuguese police I tried to help as much as I could, but Portuguese isn’t my first language. “I’d be happy to talk to British police about it – maybe it could help their case and solve what happened to Madeleine  “Chris loved his cars, especially his Jaguar. It was his pride and joy. It was very clean and he drove it carefully.” Portuguese detectives have quizzed the woman about Brueckner’s farmhouse on the outskirts of Praia da Luz. She spent many nights with him in the run-down property, less than a mile from the Ocean Club resort in Praia da Luz, where Madeleine vanished from while on holiday with her family in May .  She said: “I never lived with him but I often stayed over though. His house was okay, it was old but he kept it tidy and clean. It had one bedroom. I’ve seen the photos and instantly recognised the big tree trunk in the middle of the room.”The woman also told police how she and her pals suspected Brueckner of burgling homes and businesses in the area. She said: “He was always bringing expensive things back to the house. Computers, cameras, things like that. I didn’t ask where he got them from. I remember my friend and I wonderingthey were stolen.  “We said we think he might be involved in some illegal business because he seems to have money but we don’t know where it comes from.Maybe selling stolen property, nothing too big. He also used to collect golf balls because his property was near the golf course and then sell them to the players.”The woman is still living in fear that Brueckner will be released and come after her.She said: “He came to Portugal with a German girl. He said they grew up in a children’s home together. She left him for someone . He said to me once thathe ever found her he would kill her. “It made me think,he said that about her, what would he do to meI left him ’ "},{"url":null,"title":"mum says putting others first","story":"NewsMum says putting others first is exhausting as she lays bare parenting strugglesJessica Hood, from Melbourne, Australia, says in the Instagram post her le consists of \"putting everyone  first\" as she raises her four childrenShareCommentsByBradley JollyDigital journalist:,  JUN NewsJessica Hood, , who lives in Melbourne, told how she has lost herself in the process of raising four children \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

It will be a massive plus that we have something to work to.“Every manager will probably tell you the same – we need a date for when we are going to go back.“But as I said, I am cautious because there is an awful lot going on at the moment, from where you can take your kids to when you can go and meet other people.“Everything is changing and I don’t think football will be any dferent.”Reconstruction plans have now been run up the flagpole and ripped back down again more than once.Consensus, as is so often the case in Scottish football, has proved impossible to reach.Meanwhile clubs like Dundee, whose business model means they sit uncomfortably in the Championship, have been left in limbo.It has affected everyone at the club – and their manager is growing tired of the uncertainty.However, McPake is conscious of the wider issues in today’s world, and his annoyance is tempered by realism.He said: “There is frustration but for me that can’t be put on anyone.“There is a frustration in every industry about where we find ourselves.“We have never been in a situation like this before and what that brings is a real level of uncertainty.“We are looking for answers every day. I would be very reluctant to blame that on a single person or organisation as you can see it right across the world at the minute. But yes, it is frustrating.“If you are looking at it purely from a footballing point of view it is really dficult for the players, for the backroom staff and for the fans.“But again there is a bigger picture here in terms of a health crisis.“We have to be guided by the government and the governing bodies in football but it has not been easy.“Everybody is in the same boat really and there are no real answers to what is happening and when we can get back to what is perceived as normal.“It is dficult – there is no other way of putting it.”For as long as the Championship remains without a definitive restart date, many elements of Dundee’s normal business operations will remain on hold. On the football side, that means recruitment and day-to-day work with players.They are crucial to any club’s success.But McPake insists he – and everybody  at Dens Park who is not furloughed – is doing everything he can to ensure as seamless ato action as possible.“I speak to Johna couple of times a week or maybe more but nothing has really changed,” he said. “We are where we are and there is no definitive date to when we can start back. It is not like a normal summer or break in the season like a winter one or international break.“There is always a structure to football and when you are back. The players, staff, everybody knows that but at the moment that has completely gone.“It is everyone’s longest lay-off – we are now getting to the stage where the players have been off the same amount of timethey had a serious injury so that brings its problems physically and mentally.“It is just about trying to get everything right so that when we do get the green light to start back we are in as good a position as possible.”EXCLUSIVE: Ex-Dundee striker Peter MacDonald confirms he’s hanging up his boots and says best day of his career came as a Dark Blues player\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-fc-peter-macdonald-retirement-st-johnstone-rangers embed # secretWJcMNsFIpT\" data-secret\"WJcMNsFIpT\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

support of plans to transform union street","story":"Businesses in Aberdeen city centre have showed their support for work being carried out to pedestrianise Union Street.Space on the street is being reallocated, with bus and cycle lanes being reassigned for use as temporary pavements.It will help pedestrians visit shops, bar and restaurants while adhering to physical distancing guidance once lockdown restrictions lessen.Business leaders showing their support for the temporary pedestrianisation measures includes Allan Henderson, director of The McGinty’s Group.He said: “We fully appreciate that these are signicant changes being made to the city centre and the project has progressed very quickly in exceptional circumstances.#It is imperative that hospitality businesses can reopen soon to take advantage of the better weather in the summer months and I feel that the red tape surrounding permissions need to be as simple as possible to allow this.“With physical distancing measures likely to be in place for a while, licensed premises should be allowed to use outdoor areas to help them recover from the pandemic and bring footfall back in the area.“Aberdeen City Council should be applauded for their attempts to help city centre businesses and though everything will not be perfect immediately, it is crucial that businesses work together and give constructive feedback as the situation evolves.”Stuart McPhee, director at Siberia Bar  Hotel, said: “I take the view that the pedestrianisation of Union Street has transformative long-term benefits for the city centre.#Short term benefits of social distancing during the current pandemic and long-term benefits ranging from air quality improvements to beginning to have a more vibrant city centre.“For as long as I can remember people have talked Union Street down constantly and here is action that could make it something dferent, something bold and something new for the city.“Change is always daunting for people, but during lockdown for example we have all had to change and adapt to things like home working or zoom calls with family.#Some of these changes will have transformative benefits after lockdown such as improving work le balance and keeping in touch with people better in far flung parts of the world or family you don#t see very often.“Pedestrianising Union Street may be something that we think of in the first instance as an inconvenience because it changes our journey or we don#t understand it, these issues can be ironed out through consultation and cooperation but in the long run we see the improvement it brings.”Michal Dobrzansk, general manager of Hop and Anchor, said: #In my opinion, Aberdeen city centre would benefit from pedestrianisation.#In these dficult times, it would allow social distancing to be easier to achieve as well as residents and tourists alike might be more likely to explore the city centre including districts like the sometimes-forgotten Merchant Quarter.#Being able to offer outside space for businesses that weren#t able to do so thus far might be a game changer as well.#Craig Stevenson, manager, of the Bon Accord Centre, added: “Making sure our city centre is both safe and welcoming is key to bringing people back into the heart of the city.  Creating more space for pedestrians is not only critical from social distancing perspective – it will also help improve the overall experience.”Businesses in affected areas are being contacted and a guide for businesses on physical distancing is available to download at https:www.aberdeencity.gov.uk services coronavirus-covid- city-centre.The works on Union Street and nearby streets are being put in place before the next lockdown phases are relaxed so when people start ing to Union Street in larger numbers, the space to allow for physical distancing has already been created.Aberdeen City Council transport spokeswoman councillor Sandra Macdonald said: “We’re carrying out these works now so when the lockdown eases in the next phases, people going to the city centre shops, restaurants and bars and local residents will be able to physically distance straight away.“The measures we’ve put in including pedestrianisation of some streets are being carried out to help protect the health and wellbeing of residents and help the NHS as the country moves out of lockdown.“Similar measures are being carried out in other cities and towns as part of a concerted effort across Scotland to reduce transmission of COVID-.“People will be able to walk around and queue for shops and eateries safely around Aberdeen city centre away from traffic which in turn will help the social and economic recovery of the city.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

psychopharmacology and director of Centre for Innovative Therapeutics at Kings College London, told the PA news agency: ldquoItrsquos a trial for patients with COVID- disease to seegiving them an anti-inflammatory drug ndash a specic form of ibuprofen ndash will reduce the respiratory problems they have.He stressed that the trial was for hospitalised patients ndash not those who have mild or

benefits: we could reduce the amount of time that someone spends in hospital ndash they might recover quicker and go home, thatrsquos obviously a fantastic outcome we also might be reducing the degree of respiratory distress so that it can be managed in the hospital setting, without needing to go to ICU.

triumph over the obstacles posed by COVID-.But back in March, when the virus began to take hold in Britain, a sense of despondency hung over the group.ldquoWe were absolutely heartbroken, because virtually all of our work had been done by then, says Moffat.As it became clearer that a physical event would not be possible, Moffat and his colleagues realigned their ambitions and channelled their energies into simply making sure that the festival would survive.To Moffatrsquos relief, the idea of an online version found favour with sponsors and the Friends of the Festival.ldquoOnly three people

Ant and Dec is just something completely dferent, he says, admiringly, having known the TV personalities for many years.The pair have a book coming out this year, according to Moffat ndash so perhaps

and Macmerry.East Lothian Council is petitioning the Scottish Government to extend the National Development status given to the former Cockenzie Power Station site in its National Planning Frameworkdocument to a wider area in its planned revised framework which is under review.This could pave the way for the creation of the ClimatEvolution Zone which could transform the area over the next  years through innovative approaches to development.A public consultation on the vision has been launched by the council and breaks the plans down into dferent themes from environment to travel.It asks people to give their views on its approach to a wide range of issues including access and movement the water environment culture, heritage and leisure greenspace and bioersity strong communities and regeneration and enterprise.However, the vision has already come under fire from Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council which branded it ldquocomplex and unclear.The community council warned that the launch of a new vision for the area three years after the local authority produced its Cockenzie Masterplan document ndash which it has never adopted ndash would leave the public with no confidence in the planning system.East Lothian Council paid consultants to produce the Cockenzie Masterplan for the former Cockenzie Power Station site, which it owns, after a series of public consultations in  but the report remains an informal ldquovisionary document.Now the former power station site could be merged into the new ClimatEvolution Zone with no reference to the original masterplan.Bryan Hickman, community council chairman, said: ldquoThe community council are very concerned by the documents recently published by the council.\"We understood that the changes required for NPF related to the former power station site.\"The y report now extends to Tranent, Prestonpans, Cockenzie and Port Seton, Longniddry and Blindwells as well as the power station site.\"Whilst some of the objectives are to be welcomed, the overall content is complex and unclear and includes such a large area as to be unmanageable in its detail.ldquoThe existing communities have been consulted on the power station site and the result was a masterplan commissioned by the council but not adopted by them.\"We have submitted this masterplan to be included in NPF.\"A number of consultations have taken place in our area and they have come to nothing.\"The feeling is the residents have lost confidence in the system.Neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council also raised concerns about the consultation.Brian Weddell, chairman, questioned whether the proposed train station in the new plan would ever happen, saying: ldquoThere has been no meaningful consultation with local communities who all have concerns about the impact of this development on their communities.The new consultation is based around a study, drawn up in partnership with East Lothian Council, the Scottish Government, The Lothian Drainage Partnership, SEPA, Scottish Water and Scottish Natural Heritage.It considers how the council can take the opportunity of creating a new town at Blindwells and harness the latest technologies to reduce the arearsquos carbon footprint.Among the ideas up for discussion is using groundwater at Blindwells to create waterways and using natural geothermic energy to heat the outdoor water features.Douglas Proudfoot, project leader, said the idea behind the new water features was to avoid putting pipes underground to remove groundwater and utilise it instead as

ambitious strategy.He said: ldquoThe Cockenzie and Blindwells sites are adjacent to one another and it has always been inevitable that their development will be closely linked, so it makes sense to seek to extend National Development status to Blindwells.ldquoThe whole area offers unique potential to transform these former industrial sites into places where people can live and work in a sustainable way.Kenny MacAskill, East Lothian MP, also welcomed the project which will lsquointeractrsquo with neighbouring communities.He said: ldquoThe area is a far wider community and cannot be

Hotels require one space per room.I understand that the parking standards have only recently come into effect and all other licensed premises have the benefit of being historical licensed premises and therefore protected. However, I fully believe that a common sense approach should have been taken in this instance, particularly as I submitted a very detailed travel plan which included not only promoting nearby parking options, bus timetables and taxis but actually incentivised travel to and from The Catrsquos Pyjamas by bus, taxi or on foot. When coming up with the concept of The Catrsquos Pyjamas in late summer early autumn  the first thing I did, being a total novice to owning a bar, was to engage with the licensing department.The licensing standards officer advised me I could operate with occasional licences whilst working toward the full premises licence so after submitting the occasional licence applications I was surprised to be told by planning I needed to submit a change of use application for the occasional licences.Bewildered by the conflicting information but just wishing to do what was required, I immediately submitted the application and paid the associated fee.It is frustrating that I was erroneously informed that a change of use was required for occasional licences which stopped me operating and establishing precedent.It is also frustrating I find myself in this situation because I accepted the advice and guidance of East Lothian Council. I am not seeking to apportion all the blame on the council as I have made mistakes, the biggest of which is being naive enough to believe that those who should have and give you the correct information actually do have and give you the correct information. What we have created at The Catrsquos Pyjamas is truly special. Those who have enjoyed an evening with us will validate that.I have had such incredible support from people across Dunbar and beyond that it continues to blow my mind. There is a real desire for The Catrsquos Pyjamas to work and given the chance it could become something truly amazing which is beneficial not only to the town but the county.

They are a giant of nature, yet also incredibly intelligent. They feel emotion like we do, in fact possibly more so as the emotional part of their brain is even more developed than that of humans.The old saying that ldquoan elephant never forgets is rooted in this fact. An elephantrsquos emotional intelligence comes from its ability to remember and recall distant memory. Like humans, an elephantrsquos way of being is mostly learned in early le, rather than just based on instinct.They are therefore highly sensitive creatures, influenced and affected by what they experience just as we are.Irsquove heard dferent versions of this tale, and here I have peppered it very slightly with my own style:Once, a king in ancient India owned an elephant. This royal elephant was the joy not just of the king, but also his people.The trainer would ride the elephant every day along the streets. She was a magnicent sight, and children would run out to wave and watch the elephant go by. The trainer took a dferent route each day so people in dferent neighbourhoods all had a chance to enjoy the spectacle.The people felt a real love and affinity for the elephant. Despite her size and strength, she was gentle and affectionate with the people. She would pat children carefully on their heads with her trunk and took care in where she walked.The elephant made people feel safe. More than once she had saved a child from drowning in the nearby river, or from a predator from the jungle. She was a sacred animal to the people.But then people began to notice a change in the elephantrsquos behaviour. She became aggressive and unpredictable. Instead of being patient with the children she knocked them out of her way with her trunk. Instead of being careful where she walked, she deliberately trampled on peoplersquos gardens.The trainer tried his best to control the elephant, but she seemed like a dferent animal. He couldnrsquot understand why she was behaving so dferently.It just got worse, until one day the elephant suddenly set off on a charge and rampaged through the streets, trumpeting loudly as she charged at the terried people, almost killing some of them.The king was horried and ordered the elephant to be confined to her stables. With dficulty she was finally brought under control and locked in.ldquoWhat is going on  asked the king to the trainer.ldquoI have no idea your majesty he replied, ldquoitrsquos asshe is a dferent elephant.ldquoPerhaps the elephant is ill in some way  suggested one of the kingrsquos advisors. But the vet found nothing physically wrong.Then the trainer suggested asking an old man who lived in the jungle as ldquohe is known for his wisdom in understanding animals, perhaps he will know what the cause of this is.So the king sent a messenger and the old man came to the royal palace.ldquoCan you help  asked the king.The old man asked to be left alone with the elephant for a while.When he ed he looked at the king and said: ldquoWhatever is wrong is something that cannot be seen. I must spend some time with the elephant to understand what is troubling her.And so the old man decided to watch over the elephant that night. He smeared himself in mud to mask his scent and hid in a corner of the stable.It was late evening when he heard voices.A group of men had entered the stables from a small side door. They were a gang of murderers. They were using the royal elephant stable as a place to meet and plan their activities. And in so doing they recounted stories of their deeds.Their leader was a man with a cold and ruthless heart. He told stories about his le and deeds, of how hersquod murdered and tortured people he didnrsquot like. Members of his gang laughed and shared their tales too, likewise full of hatred and cruelty.The elephant slumbered as these tales were told, but they were unknowingly heard by her. When the elephant woke the following morning, the tales of hate and violence still swirled in her mind.The old man went to the king.ldquoYour majesty, there are two things you must do to cure the elephant.ldquoThe first is to remove the murderers who meet in the stables at night. The second is you must find the kindest people, who live their lives with love and understanding. Then ask them to meet at night in the stable as the elephant sleeps and tell each other stories from their lives tales of love and understanding. If you do this, then the elephant will be cured.The king looked bemused.ldquoI will most certainly remove the murderers, he said, ldquobut are you saying that stories will cure the elephant ldquoYes, your majesty, replied the old man, ldquobut the right stories. You see we are made from the stories we hear.He went on: ldquoIf we constantly hear tales of hatred and violence then those stories paint our vision of le with fear, loathing and cruelty.ldquoButwe mostly hear tales of love and understanding, then our mind is coloured with kindness for others, and for ourselves.ldquoWe are affected by the stories we hear, evenwe donrsquot realise we have been listening to them.ldquoYour elephant was unknowingly listening to tales of hatred and killing every night as she slept. So her mind was filled with hate and distrust her vision of the world changed and so did her behaviour.ldquoIf she hears good stories then she will eventually become her kind self again.The king nodded in understanding and agreed to act on this. Within a few weeks the elephantrsquos behaviour had changed for the better.ldquoYou are indeed wise in the ways of elephants, the king said to the old man.ldquoThe truth in this is not just for elephants, the old man replied.ldquoPeople are like your elephant the stories they hear will paint their world and affect how they live in it.The king nodded once again.ldquoMy job is done, said the old man, ldquoI will nowto the forest.ldquoBy the way, your elephant will have a calf, and her calf must hear good stories too.ldquoHow can I pay you for your wisdom  asked the king.The old man thought for a moment, then said: ldquoBe a king who tells good stories tales of kindness and understanding. And be a good listener to the stories told by your people.ldquoThen you will be a truly great leader and your kingdom will flourish and be a happier place.ldquoIf you do that, it will be my greatest reward."},{"url":null,"title":"tell-difference-symptoms-hay-fever-covid-19","story":"It comes as the weather gets warmer and summer approaches, with hay fever sufferers having to cope with more pollen

There are many people who believe that most of their services, support, and medication are delivered at no cost, magically appearing from the ether like manna from heaven.They are not costings are just pushed along vertically or horizontally. There are economic, social and environmental limits to everything, except in Scotland apparently.Surely such profligate spending in Scotland by the SNP needs more attention at the moment, not just to refute the SNPrsquos vision of a \"milk and honey\" independent Scotland but for taxpayers across the UK.David Bone, Girvan.MAY I answer the question put by Liz Galbraithregarding how an independent Scotland would pay for the current crisis An independent Scotland with its own National Bank would do exactly as all other independent countries have done and are doing ndash borrow from their own National Bank, a debt incurred which would never need repaid, as they own that bank. It is simply a strategy for printing money and increasing the supply within the economy, and that is exactly what Westminster is doing.As things stand, as part of the UK, Scotland is not allowed to borrow a single penny from anyone, nor is it allowed to overspend its budget. In fact, it is legally obliged not to spend all its budget, but must end every financial year with a surplus. It is therefore prevented by our membership of the UK from dealing with this crisis as all independent countries around the world are able to. The value of oil, or anything , is totally irrelevant.P Davidson, Falkirk.I NOTE the letter from Liz Galbraith in respect of dferences between New Zealand and Scotland and \"extreme financial challenges\". I quickly checked a few things and found that GDP per capita in both countries are broadly similar, that Scotland has slightly more people, New Zealand has more land. So how will New Zealand handle those challenges given that they are not any wealthier than Scotland I submit the dference in performance is a combination of constitutional dferences and powers with, perhaps, the luck to have an exceptional leader at the time of crisis. Of course, Scotland may also have had an exceptional leader in Nicola Sturgeon, but without the kind of constitutional powers that Jacinda Ardern has, we may never know.Iain Cope, Glasgow G.RUTH Marrand others are indulging in a fallacy in their assertions that \" Scotland was independent...\" with regard to the current Covid- pandemic. There is no comparison to be made between Scotland and New Zealand, not least because the latter is an archipelago so biologically remote from the rest of the world and anomalous that it had no terrestrial mammals at all until the Polynesians arrived in the th century.What is more, Scotland voted to stay in the UK in . The choice of two million Scots was the preference for the risks and responsibilities of being part of bigger and more erse country and economy over those of being part of a smaller and narrower one. If we want to play Ms Marrs parlour game and pretend that something  happened, we can also imagine the penury that Scotland would have faced following the greatest economic shock in its history, and wonder how on earth we would have managed with public services stripped of over pound billion every year.Such speculation is all very entertaining, and makes useful material for the attempts of nationalists to distract us from the failings of the SNP Scottish Government. But Scotland is not New Zealand. Nor Norway nor Denmark nor the Republic of Ireland. Nor in terms of responsibility for public health and the NHS and care homes, is it even England.In the real world, we can only judge Nicola Sturgeon and Jeane Freeman and co by the actions and decisions they have taken, and have failed to take, and above all by the Covid- infection rate and death toll in Scotland. No wonder that their supporters want us to be distracted by their pointless fantasies.Peter A Russell, Glasgow G.Read more: Kate Forbes: Expect deep cuts to public services without new powers from Westminster"},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Rosemary Goring  My post-lockdown dream is a scone in a local cafe  What  39 s yours ","story":"Our nearby garden centre, a well-run operation, insists on hand sanitation before you enter, and sends customers up, down and across the aisles by luminous arrows, asplaying snakes and ladders. If only it were that much fun. Unable to browse without creating a traffic jam, and surrounded by so many masks it could be a dental hygienistsrsquo convention, all pleasure has gone.Now, we are on the cusp of phase two lt-off, scheduled for June . Unless you are in the shielded category, this will allow two households to meet indoors, or socially distanced drinkers and diners to sup in beer gardens and at pavement tables. Home improvers who have been doodling plans for loft conversions can at last call in the Light Brigade.Around the time schools resume in August, itrsquos likely that there will be a widespreadto something approximating normality. In theory at least. The worry is that,the grim weekly supermarket trip offers any guide, the new normal might feel almost as disturbing as our current lockdown. The sight of medicalised faces, half hidden beneath WWII gas masks or snorkels the constant need to self-disinfect ndash a breeding ground surely for a generation of obsessive compulsives the notices and tannoyed reminders that you or others in the vicinity could be unwitting transmitters of a potentially fatal disease ndash none of this is conducive to a sense of relaxation or safety. And yet, unless there is a surge back to our old ways, the economy will slide even further into the abyss. Itrsquos hard not to feel a moral obligation to help businesses get back on their feet.Some weeks ago, I contemplated what I was most looking forward to doing when we emerged from purdah. Apart from meeting family and friends, top of the list was going for a coffee, closely followed by a day in the library. If to this could be added an early evening drink in the pub, possibly planning our next trip to Italy, I would ask nothing more. What a thrilling lestyle, you must be thinking. Yet Irsquom probably not alone, during these eerily frozen weeks, in realising how narrow and predictable the margins of my le are, and happily so.They say it takes six weeks to form a habit, so perhaps we will get used to the protocols protecting us when we enter the classroom, or train, or go shopping for clothes. It might become second nature to dine behind plastic screens on the bistro table, or to stay three steps away from our nearest and dearest, even in their own homes. And in one respect at least Irsquom looking forward to making my own mask. In winter I resemble a figure in a John Bellany painting, my nose ice cold and red raw. A fleecy face-covering could save on central heating.Even as the danger of infection diminishes, the sobering reality is that fear will persist for a considerable time. To expect to gather in a cafe as we used to, drawing up chairs to crowd around a table, is to day-dream. Almost nothing will be the same as in the good old days, or at least not at first. In the months ahead we will either have to accustom ourselves to new and uncomfortable regulations and rules, or stay housebound.Therersquos little doubt, though, that seeing the ties that bind us being slowly slackened is a huge psychological boost. As yoursquoll have guessed, Irsquom not Melrosersquos answer to Marco Polo. When Ryanairrsquos engines begin to roar, it wonrsquot be me yoursquoll see in the duty free. Yet the mere fact of being banned from travelling more than five miles from home is what has felt so constricting in recent times, even , like me, yoursquore usually quite happy staying within easy walking distance of your door.As we go through the gradual phases of our staggered release, like a barge inching through a lock, simply knowing that we can go wherever we like will come as a tremendous relief. Who careswe must be home by bedtime  Just glimpsing somewhere dferent will be excitement enough. It marks the restoration of a basic human liberty. And, as our leash ens, so spirits will lt. The invisible cordon sanitaire that has been restraining us in will vanish, and to a large degree our lives will feel like our own again.Yet while we yearn to get back to our old haunts, elements of the crisis have shown a better way, which hopefully will endure. The rise in walking and cycling signals a serious cultural sht. Along with the upturn in home deliveries, it might indicate the beginning of the end for the car. Even where I live, in the country, the air is cleaner, the roads emptier, the birds louder. The outpouring of care and concern shown across the nation for neighbours and those in need has strengthened peoplersquos connection to their community. More of us have been shopping or ordering locally, and discovering whatrsquos on our doorstep. Some have been baking their own bread, or cooking from scratch, and discovering the humdrum but satisfying joys of home le. Looking to the uncertain future, a few are on their way to becoming self-sufficient.As we gradually emerge into a freer existence, carrying hand sanitisers the way Clint Eastwood holstered a Colt , one thing seems certain. We wonrsquot take anything for granted again. The simplest of activities have already assumed a profound signicance. To call something ordinary or normal will soon be the highest terms of praise.

If there was a button marked ldquoreset, many millions of Americans might rush to press it. Erase the last four years, months, weeks, days, hours. Restore Americarsquos factory settings, because something has gone catastrophically awry.The duff sloganeering was not the worst offence the President committed on Twitter. By many a mile that title went to his musings on Martin Gugino, the -year-old who was shoved by police during a protest in Buffalo, New York, over the death of George Floyd.Mr Gugino fell, cracking his head, and as his blood poured on to the pavement the police walked on by. The incident was captured on video. Two policeman have been charged.The presidentrsquos take on this  Mr Gugino ldquocould be a hard left ldquoprovocateur who was carrying a scanner to block out police communications . ldquoI watched, said Mr Trump. ldquohe fell harder than he was pushed. Was aiming scanner. Could be a set up Mr Guginorsquos lawyer called this a ldquoa dark, dangerous and untrue accusation. If you wanted a response red hot with fury one could turn to Andrew Cuomo, the Governor of New York. He thought nothing the President might say on Twitter could surprise him any more. He was wrong. ldquoHow reckless, he said of the Gugino accusation. ldquoHow irresponsible. How mean. How crude. If there was ever a reprehensible, dumb comment hellip and this from the President of the US. Earlier, Mr Cuomo summed up the bewilderment of many when he asked simply, ldquoHow did we get to this place Good question, depressing answers. The appalling treatment of African-Americans did not start with Mr Trump. Nor was he responsible for a virus that has cruelly laid bare the failings of the country, not least in healthcare, and the inequalities that persist.: Letters - leave the statuesBut as the President that famous buck has to stop with him. It would be a test of even the greatest American leader at any time. One can only wonder what a Johnson, or an FDR, would do. That it falls to Mr Trump to act, and in an election year, lays the ground for troubled times to come.It has been a politically disastrous couple of weeks for the President. The events and images have been shocking. A man dying in the street at the hands of police. Peaceful protestors being tear-gassed and beaten so their commander-in-chief could walk from the White House and hold a bible aloft. A security fence erected in front of the White House, something that was not necessary during the worst civil unrest of the s. Threatening to use soldiers against lawful protesters, and being castigated by a former Defence Secretary for doing so. Tales of a president fleeing to a White House bunker. All of it dreadful, much of it used against America by its opponents.Even Mr Trump, a man who never met a setback he did not try to spin, has had trouble ignoring the plummeting poll ratings that have resulted. In a CNN poll published on Monday, % disapproved of his performance as president, with % approving. Those are the kind of numbers Jimmy Carter and fellow one term President George HW Bush racked up.Overall, the incumbent is  points behind his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden. In what should be further cause for alarm, Mr Trumprsquos support among white voters without degrees is falling, and his problem with women has grown worse. In  he was  points behind with women voters. A recent poll put him  points behind.As ever with the defensive Mr Trump, his instinct is to go on the attack. That could signal more sackings, more likely it will mean getting back on the rally circuit, the place he feels comfortable and wanted.His supporters argue the Black Lives Matter protests, which brought hundreds of thousands on to the streets, are a green light for the Trump rallies to restart. The president has suggested the first event could even be as soon as next week. This at a time when , Americans have died from Covid-, and when the White House infectious diseases adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, has warned the pandemic ldquoisnrsquot over yet.: The truth about Scotlands slaving pastJust when the US might benefit from devoting its considerable energies into tackling its policing and race relations crises, or even simply pausing for a period of reflection after a dreadful start to the year, the President will in effect be firing the starting gun in the race to the White House.Judging by their advertising, both sides will be using the recent protests to boost their arguments. Mr Trump knows it worked for Richard Nixon in , but he was not the incumbent. It is a tactic fraught with danger in as much as it risks fuelling further tension and ision, the last thing the country needs.We know from past experience the kind of candidate Mr Trump becomes when he fronts one of his rallies. Crowds chanting for Hillary Clinton to be locked up, the mocking of a disabled reporter, the harassment of the press his rallies in the run up to the  election set a sour tone for his presidency from the off. Who will be the scapegoats this time Mr Trump could do with some wise counsel at this point, but that looks in desperately short supply, not least from his own party. Too many Republican candidates are afraid to criticise Mr Trump lest his base turns against them. But as of now he has shown himself unwilling to listen to anyone .Whatever campaign slogan he settles on, Mr Trump will doubtless position himself as the man to save America. Who will save America from Mr Trump is the question his Republican colleagues should be asking themselves.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Hundreds were accused after the Horizon system showed cash shortfalls at their branches.Speaking in the House, Mr Carmichael said: “I hope that when he s to the department today he will tell his officials and tell also the Post Office senior management that this review just isn’t going to cut it.#This is a complex case and that is why it requires a judge-led inquiry, and that is what will happen eventually, so why not just cut to the quick and do it now ”Responding for the Government, Paul Scully MP said: “The point is the terms of reference within this review are the same as a judge-led inquiry.#I do not want an inquiry that lasts  years and that sub-postmasters are going to come back time and time again with no justice. This is something that I have been pushing on from the moment that I found out the detail about it, and that is why I am going to drive this through to make sure that the answers are heard and that independent chair gets to the bottom of this and gets some answers.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said: “The minister’s response was inadequate. Postmasters are vital parts of our communities, especially in the outer isles where they sit at the heart of island le. This scandal and the Post Office’s woeful reaction to it have undermined confidence in the treatment of our postmasters. The government must do more to repair that trust, starting with a proper judicial inquiry.“It bears repeating that local post offices have proven their essential role once again during the Covid- crisis. We have to ensure that future postmasters are not put off by this scandal.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

At the Sandwick Manse, he kept a daily record for  years, beginning in , and became a recognised expert on Scotland’s weather.After Clouston’s death, the station moved around Orkney but kept going right up until WWII. Magnus Spence ran it in Deerness for almost thirty years,  – . His son, Magnus Thorfinn Spence, was Chief Meteorologist for Bomber Command during WWII. With very neat symmetry, the story now moves to the other end of the world # to the South Orkney Islands. Base Orcadas is an Argentinian weather station but it was founded in  by the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition, led by William Spiers Bruce. His grandmother was Charity Isbister, whose father Caleb owned Ness Farm, Stromness. Spiers Bruce went to the Antarctic as a scientist on a whaling expedition in  and became fascinated by the polar regions. He went on expeditions to the Arctic and, when he couldn’t get there, he went to the top of Ben Nevis, which had snow cover for  days of the year. An Observatory had been built there in  by the Scottish Meteorological Society, to try to learn more about weather patterns. The first Superintendent was RTOmond, the son of Robert Omond from Kirkwall, who became President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Mary Traill, daughter of Professor Thomas Stewart Traill, . Omond was involved with the Observatory right from its planning stages. Ill health forced him down from the summit after seven years, but he remained in overall charge until the Observatory closed in . William Spiers Bruce had applied to join Scott’s expedition to the Antarctic. When, despite being one of the most experienced Polar scientists in the country, his application was rejected, he raised the funds for an expedition supported by the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. The Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of - is not as famous as those of Scott and Shackleton but it has been described as one of the most cost-effective and carefully planned scientic expeditions of the age. As well as establishing the weather station, the expedition brought back a large number of botanical, biological, zoological and geological samples. The house built for the men and their instruments was called Omond House. As well as giving Spiers Bruce a lot of practical and scientic advice, Omond had given a very sizeable donation to the expedition.The Ben Nevis Observatory only lasted eighteen years and only had three observers so it is strange that there is still more Orcadian involvement. According to his entry in the Australian Dictionary of Biography, Charles Anderson, from Moa in Stenness, was the Superintendent there after he graduated in . He quickly realised he wanted to be somewhere warmer and went to work at the Australian Museum in Sydney in , eventually becoming its director.The full version of this article can be found on page  of this week’s edition of The Orcadian. A biography Charles Anderson is available on the #People# page of www.aboutorkney.

These figures do not account for tests undertaken through the UK Government testing system.Mr McArthur who, alongside the local press, has repeatedly appealed for this information to be released, was pleased that figures had finally been made public.He said: “I welcome the decision by NHS Orkney to publish localised information and provide the public with greater clarity on the level of testing taking place in Orkney.“I have been pressing Ministers for weeks to agree to releasing testing data.  To date, despite warm words, the Scottish Government has refused to budge.“I therefore welcome NHS Orkney’s decision to follow the lead taken by NHS Shetland in making public this information.  As we move forward with ‘test and protect’, other types of information will also be needed to give people an understanding of the situation in their local area.“It is clear that transparency is key to building public confidence and the compliance we will need to see as we continue to emerge from lockdown. This move by NHS Orkney is a good step in the right direction.”NHS Orkney has sought to remind the community that testing is available for anyone over the age of five who has symptoms, and to keep up hygiene standards in order to prevent the spread of the virus.Mr O#Brien said: “It is down to the great work and commitment from all those who live and work in Orkney that we have kept positive results so low, but we must not get complacent.#As the lockdown is being relaxed and people begin moving around more freely, we will be exposed again.“To keep safe, our community must continue to stick to the hygiene and infection control guidelines.”These include:copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

because they ldquocelebrate slavery and racism.In a statement issued on Thursday afternoon, the council said the listing ldquoplaced the much-loved statue at risk of damage or even destruction.It added: ldquoWe know that local people feel proud of Lord Baden-Powellrsquos and the Scout movementrsquos links with Poole, and that some people feel that we would be giving in to the protesters by

Many protesters’ actions, in clear breach of social distancing rules, were dangerous.Yet nobody should shed tears when the bronze statue of a brutal th century Bristol slaver is hauled from his distinguished plinth in the city centre and thrown into the harbour.Our main concern should be how and why it was allowed to stay there for so long.As Edward Colston#s effigy toppled towards the watery grave to which he had consigned so many enslaved Africans, a protestor knelt on Colston#s neck.That was a graphic illustration of the incident which precipitated the storm: the throttling by a Minneapolis police officer of the US citizen George Floyd.George Floyd#s last words were #I can#t breathe#, which applied both literally and to his place in society.There is nothing sacrosanct about most secular statues. Before  statues of Adolf Hitler were commonplace in Europe.You would be hard pressed to find one now.The same applies to Josef Stalin in most of the former Soviet territories.Just outside New Delhi there is a lonely and extensive graveyard of hundreds of statues of former eminences of the British colonial Raj. Wild dogs roam among them.Closer to home, Glasgow#s and Edinburgh#s exploitation of slavery is being recognised by the alteration of Glasgow street names and a plaque in Edinburgh#s St Andrew#s Square by the -foot statue of Henry Dundas, which will detail his connections with the slave trade.It#s either that or throw him in the Forth.We were no innocents in this field. In , no fewer than  per cent of Jamaican slave plantations were owned by Scots.Research by University College London has revealed that when slavery in British territory was abolished in , the equivalent of £ billon in compensation was handed out to just over  Scottish proprietors.They were not all in Glasgow and Edinburgh.Donald Martin of Monkstadt in Skye cashed in on his ill-gotten gains. So did Alexander MacLean of North Uist.The Raasay proprietor George Rainy banked his share from human traffic, as did Donald MacLeod of Lewis and Alexander McBarnet of Attadale.There are no statues of those gentlemen to throw in the sea.But the next time somebody suggests a similar fate for the statue of the Duke of Sutherland on Ben Bhraggie # a fate to which we would have little objection # we should remember that black lives also matter.They did then and they do now.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HWRC__Portree_Re_Opening_15th_June_graphic-scaled.jpg","title":"portree recycling centre to re open on","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoineand receive confirmation before travelling to the site.The Portree site is open for essential waste disposal only, and householders are advised that journeys to a HWRC must only be undertakentheir waste cannot be stored at home safely.

While NIE Networks staff will still not be entering customers’ homes to obtain a meter read at this time, they will call at customers’ doors and ask them to read their meter while they wait. Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication.

Therefore the aim remains ato full-time classroom education as soon as medical guidance allows this.The department has now established a Restart Programme, with both the minister and the department set to consult with a wide range of stakeholders.

I am pleased to confirm that the reports on the new consignment are positive in this regard.” Minister Murphy:“Establishing a supply line with China, in the face of signicant international competition forPPE, is a signicant achievement for the Executive. This has been made possible by the collaborative efforts of the procurement teams in Health and Finance along with the Bureau in China. “At the same time as opening up a supply line with China, it is important to ramp up local supply ofPPE. Many companies have already repurposed their operations and this should be expanded to provide security of supply and create employment as we move towards economic recovery.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Rail campaign group ‘Into The West’ said it is ‘surprised and disappointed’ with the announcement that ‘yet another feasibility study’ is now required before the third and final phase of work to modernise the Derry-Coleraine railway line can progress. On June , Infrastructure Minister Nichola announced that she wants to get phase  of the project ‘back on track’. SDLP MLA for Foyle Mark H Durkan welcomed news of a ‘feasibility study’. However, Into the West believe another feasibility study to be unnecessary and have demanded answers from the Infrastructure minister. googletag.cmd.push The group said theof Stormont in January gave renewed hope that this ‘vital project’ for the north-west would be put back on track again. “The Phase  work will cost poundm – a relatively small sum in infrastructure terms - and expectations were raised that it would be included in this year’s DFI budget,” Into The West Co-Chair Steve Bradley said. “It therefore came as a shock and disappointment to rail campaigners when today’s budget announcement gave no indication of when the Phase  work would take place at all, and instead called for yet another feasibility study into it.” googletag.cmd.push Phase  work involves replacing the track between Downhill and Eglinton, and installing a new ‘passing loop’ for trains. According to Into the West, once complete it will shave up to  minutes off the existing journey time - and more importantly double capacity on the line. That would enable the introduction of a half-hourly service to Belfast, and the possibility of express trains to Belfast with journey times below mins. The passing loop also creates the opportunity to locate it strategically to enable a new station at City of Derry Airport or Ballykelly – either now or in the future. Into The West Co-Chair Steve Bradley commented: “Phase  is the key to improving rail in the north-west, reversing decades of east-west transport disparity here, and equipping our region to tackle congestion and climate change. “The Minister has spoken repeatedly about improving public transport, enabling greener choices and addressing Northern Ireland’s regional imbalance – all of which gave us hope that this essential work would finally be funded. To be told instead that the only thing happening is yet another feasibility study is unacceptable. “What has changed regarding the scope of this project to warrant another study  And why has the need for one never been mentioned before now  “The conclusion to draw from this is that there is a risk Phase  may never happen at all now. Which would leave Derry with a lower standard of rail service than every town and village east of the Bann receives on the same line.” ‘KICKING THE CAN’ Into The West is ‘grateful’ that Minister Mallon has mentioned Phase  in her budget and understands the tough choices she has to make with restricted resources. But they also fear this is ‘just another delaying tactic from DfI which declared its opposition’ to Phase  by cancelling the work when Stormont was suspended. “We had hoped a new Minister would appreciate the signicance of this project to the north-west and stand up to Civil Service negativity about it. In the absence of a credible explanation for why a new study is required, we must conclude that it is just kicking the can down the road. “It feels like the rail equivalent of seeking endless business cases for Magee expansion, without ever actually delivering on it”. Prior to this announcement Into The West had a meeting scheduled with the Minster for next week to discuss a range of rail issues facing the north-west. The organisation says it will use that opportunity to seek an explanation for the new feasibility study, and to continue to press the case for Phase  to happen as soon as possible. “The Derry-Belfast railway line is the busiest single track route in the UK and Ireland – carrying over three million passengers a year. It is unacceptable to leave such a popular route with le-expired track so degraded that it requires multiple speed restrictions and continual monitoring of its condition. “The entire North-west is united in support of the Phase  works. Derry and Strabane Council has policy demanding it, the cross-border North West Regional Development Group have endorsed it, and thousands of people have signed a petition calling for it. Because nothing can be improved for rail in the west until this work is completed. “We will therefore be demanding answers from the Minister as to why this long-delayed project now needs to jump through yet more hoops, and when it will finally take place. “It is not enough to simply talk about climate change, increasing public transport and addressing regional imbalance – you have to take the decisions that will actually deliver for it beyond Belfast,” Mr Bradley concluded.

When Dungiven woman Bridie Ward sent us a s image of men lined up by soldiers outside a bar on Belfastrsquos New Lodge Road, it begged further investigation. Liam Tunney caught up with her to find out its background.The sight of men spread-eagled on the wall of a bar while soldiers search a premise is one that evokes strong emotions in this country. The Starry Plough sat halfway down the New Lodge Road in north Belfast, but was owned and run for years by Dungiven man Jim O’Kane. Although a staunchly Republican area, Jim’s sister Bridie recalled a mixed crowd at the bar in its earlier days. “There was a mixed crowd away years ago, it was a bar where everyone would meet up. People from Tiger’s Bay would have come in there before the Troubles started,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “Before the Troubles, the sea men, or the dockers, would have been in the bar. They were away at sea for maybe six weeks at a time and they had all this money so they spent it in there. “At the beginning, he made a lot of money in the bar, because when he bought it, there were always darts matches in it.” By the time the Troubles began to poison the city, though, the bar was singled out on a few occasions by the British Army. ‘Times of Troubles’, by Andrew Saunders, describes how, on one of those occasions, the bar was raided following a period of rioting. googletag.cmd.push “On the night of  May one platoon went into the Starry Plough to make arrests,” it read. “They removed thirty people for questioning and felt sufficiently threatened by the crowd which had gathered outside that they fired rubber bullets.” The bar has been rebuilt and is now named The Lodge. The Starry Plough’s owner Jim was a Republican Labour councillor in the city and his position attracted unwanted attention that regularly escalated into a physical threat. He twice survived attempts on his le, attempts that tragically resulted in the deaths of two companions, including a doorman at the bar in the s. North Belfast historian, Joe Baker, recalled the aftermath of the bomb in an article he wrote for the North Belfast News. “I remember my mother running to it screaming after it was bombed by Loyalists,” it read. “She knew that my Dad had been in it but fortunately he had left some time before to head off to another bar.” Another attack, in , on Jim’s home in Cedar Avenue resulted in the death of Bridget Breen, a -year-old woman who was babysitting for the O’Kane family. “Jim lived up there most of his le and was married up there. They had a hard time during the Troubles, it was tough in the s up there,” she recalled. Jim OKane outside the Starry Plough in the aftermath of the bomb that killed a doorman. “During the Troubles, they planted a bomb in the entrance [of the bar] and it blew up. He survived, but the door man was killed. “He also lost two homes. He lived in a beautul house, but they burned him out. They threw a firebomb in and the four boys were very lucky to survive. “The boys were sleeping one night and there was a woman who used to babysit for him. Josie, his we, was going down that evening to help out in the bar. “The phone rang a couple of times and the first time before she went out, it rang and they said, in an English tongue, ‘Oh sorry, we got the wrong number’, so they must have been looking for my brother. “He would have come home at night to have his tea or dinner and went back to the bar. She was ready to go out again and the call came through again, but they put the phone down on her. “She went on to the bar and the babysitter came in. It was one of those old houses, a big red brick house, with a front room like a sitting room at the front and a big long hall. “They threw the duffle bag with the bomb in through the front room, breaking the window. “The babysitter panicked and ran out the front door. It was the big, huge, oak door that was on the front and it fell on her and killed her. “The boys survived because the house was so big that it was just the front that got demolished and they were sleeping away at the back.” Jim died in the s, but an off-licence bearing the family name remains in place on the New Lodge Road. The effects of the bomb attacks and threats on his le left a lasting impression on the Dungiven man. “He never really got over the babysitter or the doorman,” said Bridie. “After that, when he was going down to the bar, and especially coming home at night, he always made sure he checked his car, in case they planted something on it. It was a scary time.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The  on the bridge were vandalised in July  and have still to be replaced. The Department of Infrstructure , which is responsible for the maintenance of the bridge, said in October of last year that it had planned to have new  in place by the end of November. However, that work has not been carried out. Last years vandalism was the latest in a series of attacks on the glass  on the Peace Bridge, which opened in  and is used by hundreds of people each day. googletag.cmd.push The delay in repairing the damage caused by the latest attack was discussed yesterday at a meeting of Derry City and Strabane District Councils Environment and Regeneration Committee. During the meeting, Sinn Fein councillor Christopher Jackson said the council had recently received a letter from the Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon which stated that the repair work was to be carried out on the bridge. However, he said that the work had not yet been carried out and asked that another letter be sent to the Minister. He said that they should not let the Peace Bridge repairs slip off the agenda. googletag.cmd.push A council officer told the meeting that she would follow the issue up with the Divisional Roads Manager as it was their department who would be undertaking the bridge repairs. The officer said she was aware that they had appointed a contractor to carry out the work before the coronavirus crisis, and that it may have been the pandemic which had delayed the work being carried out. She said thatcouncillors agreed she would contact the Divisional Roads Manager to find out what the situation was. The officer added thatthere was any issue or delay, then the council could then write to the Minister about the bridge repairs.

A student at St Patrick’s College, Maghera, Luca’s story ‘Business Crocodile’ was selected as a finalist in the - category of the BBC’s ‘Two Minute Tales’ competition. Luca’s father, Michael, said his son was taking the achievement in his stride. “He doesn’t like the limelight, but he’s quietly delighted in himself,” he told the County Derry Post. “Luca is laid back, very laid back, and he hates any sort of people looking at him. He would be quite happy for someone to say, ‘well done’ or ‘thank you’ and move on. googletag.cmd.push “He’s very non-assuming. Even when he scores goals in football, he doesn’t make a fuss.” Michael suggested Luca enter the competition after hearing about it on the Nuala McKeever show, and when the school added it to their homework tasks, it was the perfect fit. The Year  student’s love for animals formed the basis of his story, and although very imaginative, it has taken this success to spur him into action. “It’s come out of nowhere really, but he is full of imagination and he comes up with these quirky things from time to time. His teachers, Ms McAteer and Ms Laverty, have to take the credit. googletag.cmd.push “This has given him a boost and he’s started jotting down new characters and thinking of new stories on the back of it. “His mind is an encyclopaedia. He could rhyme off reams of animals and their Latin names as well. He reads about them and the dferent species, so the character probably came from that.” For now, the content of the story is a closely guarded secret around Maghera, but it will not remain that way for long. The finalists will now have their stories brought to le by actors and broadcast on The Lynette Fay Show on BBC Radio Ulster at the end of June. Overall winners in each category will have their story turned into an animation and featured across the BBC, while the runners-up will receive a specially commissioned illustration of a scene from their story. All nine finalists will see their stories and their illustrations featured in a downloadable digital storybook.

Emma McCann, from Moneymore, raised over pound, for Cancer Focus NI after taking on the mammoth task and said she was ‘humbled’ by the donations. “People stepped up to the mark and the live feed on Facebook really made a dference. I could see when the donations were coming through,” she told the County Derry Post. “I just didn’t know what way it was going to go. The majority of people are furloughed from their work, they’re worried about their jobs. googletag.cmd.push “They don’t have an awful lot of money and there’s a huge amount of worthy events and challenges going on at the minute. “There were even a few others locally that day, and people only have a certain amount of money to give but they were fantastic.” As well as being thrilled with the amount of money raised for the charity, Emma says the support she received from friends, family and neighbours. A small crowd had gathered as she reached the last leg of her challenge, something she says took her by surprise. “I knew nothing about that! I just thought with what had been going on that I was on my own, just me, John and the dog,” said Emma. googletag.cmd.push “I couldn’t get over that my friends all decided to come and support me. I needed it. They all arrived during the last km or thereabouts. Emma had set herself a target of  hours for the km cycle, but, spurred on by the support, and a healthy competitive instinct, he managed to beat her target. “I had given myself five hours and was absolutely chuffed to have been able to do it in four hours, twenty minutes and thirty-three seconds,” she said. “I was tootling along at an average of about -km per hour but I’m actually quite competitive. “I looked at the stopwatch and thought, ‘I can do this in about : or so’ and I pushed it hard the last km and I got there.” Donations for the challenge can still be made by visiting Emma’s Just Giving page at Emma’s Lockdown Cycle km.

Beverly Simpson moved from Guyana in South America to Derry in  to help the ‘failing health system’. She has two sons and a daughter, who was born in Derry. Mrs Simpson was one of the speakers at the Black Lives Matter rally on Saturday in Derrys Guildhall Square. Speaking to the Derry News this week, Beverly said she felt compelled to speak at the event as people from Black, Asian and Minority Ethniccommunities need a ‘safe outlet to express their feelings’. googletag.cmd.push In relation to opposition to the rally taking place, she believes that certain political parties mobilised the PSNI and in doing so ‘aggravated the situation’. Mrs Simpson said she and her daughter Jada were approached by police before reaching the Guildhall and again by three officers while standing there. “The police were intimidating us, she said. It was a safe space, controlled, we had a voice. “I thought, did police officers just see the colour of my skin and approach me. “They weren’t approaching everyone. Like every organisation there’s an element that think they’re superior. “The rally wasn’t even started when we were approached and they didn’t give us the option of going home. googletag.cmd.push “They annoyed us that much it made us more determined to stay.” She added: “They were trying to put a lid on an active volcano, it will still erupt, but instead of erupting in a controlled manner it will erupt all over the place. “Let it be addressed in a controlled environment, in schools or in church. “People should be able to speak about racism, it’s not going away no matter how many lids are put on it.” Since moving to the city, Mrs Simpson claimed that her entire family have been subjected to racism. “All three of my children have experienced racism, including my -year-old,” she said. “In Derry it may be subtle, not open or staring you in the face, but it’s there and unless we actually speak about it, people get away with it and continue to do it. “Don’t get me wrong, you have people everywhere who are good and bad, you have people in Derry who are not racist. “It’s about people’s moral compass, your ethics and what you value. “Children are born innocent and unless you teach them to hate, and teach them racism, they don’t see the person as another colour. “It is something that is learnt and unless we address our own personal prejudices we’ll get nowhere.” From April  to March , there were  racist incidents, resulting in  crimes, in Northern Ireland. Of those,  occurred in the Derry and Strabane policing district, an increase of  on the previous year. It’s understood that many incidents go unreported. For Mrs Simpson’s daughter Jada, race was never an issue until two years ago. Mrs Simpson said her friends at school are all white and ‘she never saw herself as dferent’. However, an incident in  changed her attitude. “She was at the bus station trying to board a bus when the driver shut the door in her face and drove off, leaving her standing there.” Mrs Simpson said that after viewing footage of the incident, the company apologised and the driver was said to have been disciplined. She continued: “It’s there, and unless each company can do like the bus company, address the inidual who is the rotten egg instead of hiding it, and condoning it or trying to cover it up. Address it openly.” Following the incident, the family felt that somebody had listened to them, but Mrs Simpson said a lot of people are afraid to speak out. “Where does that anger go, where does that hurt go, it stays and grows and infiltrates society.” Confirming the incident, a Translink spokesperson stated: “A complaint was received on thSeptember  at Foyle Street bus station. “This was acknowledged, investigated and followed up. “Translink’s Dignity at Work policy, in which all staff are trained on their induction, makes it clear that we are fully committed to creating a harmonious working environment in which all employees are treated with respect and dignity, regardless of race, colour, ethnic or national origins. “This equally applies to how our staff are expected to treat passengers.” In response to criticism that now is not the right time to hold protests, Mrs Simpson said: “Coronavirus is affecting everyone. It’s affecting the Black, Asian and ethnic minority community more. “We’re being marginalised anyway, we’re being segregated anyway, whether by a natural cause or a man-made cause so give us a chance to speak in a safe space.” The level of support on Saturday surprised Mrs Simpson and she said she was ‘proud’ that people ‘challenged themselves’ by turning out.

Director of Programmes at North West Migrant’s Forum , Lilian Seenoi-Barr, claimed that racism is not a distant enemy, but one that exists in Derry which must be challenged immediately. She said that to realise that change, will mean overhauling society from top to bottom. On a community level, Mrs Seenoi-Barr believes people must have tough conversations around the dinner table and confront racism when they see or hear it. She said the video of George Floyd being killed by a US police officer provoked emotions in people from BAME communities in Derry about their own experiences of racism. googletag.cmd.push NWMF provides advice and support services to BAME communities living in the city. The group aims to promote ersity and good community relations and runs youth clubs. NWMF organised the Black Lives Matters rally in Derry on Saturday. Political leaders and police had appealed for the protest to be cancelled due to public safety concerns over the Coronavirus pandemic. Mrs Seenoi-Barr told the Derry News that there was ‘great demand’ from within BAME communities to express their feelings. Meetings were held to discuss how the event could go ahead safely with public health at the forefront of their minds. “We wanted people to feel comfortable about attending a public rally, we gave advice about social distancing, to come with your own PPE, butyou couldn’t access any we had plenty,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “It was a collective community response to what happened, and our community wanted to raise awareness of what is happening here, and make clear that this is not just an American issue. “It’s an issue that also affects us here in the North, here in this city, so let’s not be side-tracked by people who say this is an American issue or ‘all le matters’. “Absolutely, all le matters but the truth is that black lives are in danger, it’s like a house on fire. “It’s like ignoring the fire that is burning in someone’s house and yours is not burning but you say ‘all lives matter’.” Prior to Saturday’s event, the police called to Mrs Seenoi-Barr’s home where, she said, a caution was issued for ‘incitement and encouragement’ of an illegal rally. “How can the right to hold a peaceful protest and the freedom of expression, which is a fundamental human right, be an illegal gathering,” she said. “How was it that the event held prior to that on Friday wasn’t illegal  How is that when everyone went to beaches, where hundreds of people gathered, not illegal  “Evenit was not organised those people pre-meditated going to the beach.” The rally faced opposition from many people in the city who feel that during the current pandemic is not the right time to hold a march. In response, Mrs Seenoi-Barr,said: “There is no right time to fight a pandemic, you fight the pandemic when it exists. “I accept the coronavirus pandemic is the biggest health crisis this country has ever faced in this generation and it is posing a risk to each and every one of us. “But what I would like to say is that racism is a health pandemic that has been in existence for centuries, it is deeply enshrined in our society and it is right for us to respond to racism. “Because in our communities, there is no bigger threat than the other, coronavirus is killing our people, so is racism.” In , Mrs Seenoi-Barr told the Derry News that migrant children and their parents were being subjected to racist abuse in the city. She claimed that Saturday’s rally proves that it still exists. “The overwhelming text messages that I’m receiving from parents who say that the event made their children feel like they have support because over the years they have been attacked, racially abused in school and the schools are not helping. “They felt that was their moment and now they see that the community stands behind them. “People who were not able to come out of their houses. Parents have told me, ‘my children don’t leave the bedroom after school, they don’t go anywhere because they’re petried of being called names on the street or being racially bullied’. “But when they heard that we were going to be protesting, -year-olds were getting their parents to come out because they felt they had hope. “Those are people who have been traumatised, living with the pain of racism and injustices that exist within our society. “Let’s not kid ourselves that racism is only an American issue, it is here, and the event on Saturday demonstrated that.” She said the frustration and anger of migrants who have felt the ‘profound racial inequalities’ that exist in this country made them come out. “And honestly, I would be failing in my job as someone entrusted by those people to represent them, support them, and provide them a ,I did not respond to their cause. “At the moment the wrong thing to say is to say nothing, and the wrong thing to do is to do nothing. “Silence in this time is criminal,” Mrs Barr added. The number of people living in Derry from BAME communities is unknown because there is no ethnic monitoring in Northern Ireland, which Mrs Barr said is part of ‘systematic racism’. “Racism is not only about a man being killed on camera. “It is also the fact that we cannot access services, the fact that we are told we are very few in this community and maybe that is why we have no representation. “It is the unconscious biases that exist within the education system, the housing system and the civil service were there is only .% representation. “We have a majority of people who work in the NHS but how many of them are decision makers. They are entrusted with lives but are not entrusted with making decisions.” Hate crime legislation that exists is not fit for purpose, Mrs Barr believes, and should be brought in line with that in England and Wales. She said that the education system must be reformed so that the curriculum includes racism, equality, ersity and inclusion. “Knowledge is our weapon, and it is also our protection,” she added.

These exclusive photographs show the special screens which have been erected at Tinneys Bar in Derry. All other pubs are expected to install similar screens between staff and customers as the hospitality sector reopens following the coronavirus lockdown.  A local blinds shop has been assisting Derry bars and businesses as they prepare to reopen safely. Ace Blinds have been operating in the Derry area, serving the community for over five years and employing local people. As businesses adjust to the so-called new normal after lockdown, they have to enforce social distancing and come up with innovative ways to protect their customers. googletag.cmd.push Therefore, Ace Blinds has fitted ‘COVID- roller shields’ in local bars and the orders have been mounting from other businesses in the city. “It has gone a bit crazy at the minute and we have already taken  orders for bars,” says John Kelly of Ace Blinds. It is new territory for Ace Blinds in terms of the material they are using. “The plastic material suits bars great as they can be moved up and down very easily, not like perspex, and they are a lot easier on the eye for customers, so more friendly.

All retailers must be able to implement measures that minimise the risk to their staff and to the people who visit their stores. “We will be co-existing with this virus for some time to come so it is vital that we continue to adhere to guidance to work and live safely.” The Minister added: “The re-opening of our local shopping sector is a signicant step forward in the Executive’s pathway to recovery. I and my Executive colleagues remain committed to moving forward in the recovery while at all times keeping the health, wellbeing and safety of people at the centre and being transparent in our approach.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There was substantial damage done to the crop.The farmer continued: ldquoI also had a man who was purposely letting his dog into a field to go to the toilet every morning. This field is used to cut silage for the animals to eat in winter. What these people donrsquot understand is that dog faeces is potentially harmful to cattle.ldquoI appreciate that people like to go for a walk and it is unprecedented times where people are more cautious about meeting people on the roads, but they canrsquot use farmland as recreational ground.ldquoThat is a farmerrsquos work space and every blade of grass is used in farming, eventhere areno cows in the field that they are walking in. The ground is being used for something, be it winter fodder or rotational grazing.ldquoThere are cows calving in my fields and what I am more worried about is that someone is going to get hurt. Cows are extremely volatile around calving season and they will attackthey think their young are in danger.ldquoThe most dangerous animal on a farm is not a bull, itrsquos a newly calved cow. They can and will kill. People think that cows are docile but they can kill.The farmer added: ldquoI am having to look into getting professional CCTV equipment put in place over the land, an expense I could really do without.Mr McGrath said people walking through gated fields, leaving the gates lying open and allowing the livestock to get out placed an ldquounnecessary burden on farmers.ldquoWith some Covid- restrictions being eased itrsquos great to see that people are able to get out and about a bit more whether that be for walking their dogs, going for a longer walk or run or just getting out and about. We need to make full use of our wonderful natural surroundings for our own health and for our own emotional and psychological wellbeing.ldquoHowever, there are issues creeping in regarding walkers and runners using gated fields and pieces of farmland as access points whether for a shortcut or just because they feel they can do this.He continued: ldquoWhen I was growing up in Downpatrick you didnrsquot dare trespass on the land. There was enough respect for the farmer and the great contribution they make to our local communities and as a child probably a healthy level of fear as well.ldquoI want our communities to respect our farmers and to appreciate that they give to the community so much more than they get back.ldquoSoyoursquore out and about and enjoying your walks or runs, please stick to the public roads and public rights of way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A walk in the pairc  ","story":"LOCAL GAA clubs are gearing up for ato action.After a three-month lockdown caused by the Covid- pandemic, clubs can look forward to a resumption of gaelic games.Thatrsquos good news for players and spectators, who have been starved of action.The clubs were able to unlock their gates for the first time this week.From Monday they were allowed to open their grounds for small groups of people to use walkways.Non-contact training for club teams will begin on June , initially in groups of no more than ten players with two coaches.Full-contact training can take place from July , with underage games commencing on the same date.

The industry directly employs , people, with thousands more supported in work through the supply chain.The impact of the virus on the sector could be devastating, Baroness Ritchie told peers during a debate on measures needed to repair the UK economy.ldquoProjections indicate that this level of employment could be reduced by  per cent, she said. ldquoThere has been no spend in the tourism industry since March  and it will be late July before tourism outlets open.ldquoMany of those people who will find themselves out of work will have to rely on the benefit system which is already under extreme pressure. It is punitive and needs to be overhauled with the needs of people put at the centre of the debate.She continued: ldquoTo encourage visitors to come to our region to spend money and to invest in our economy, we need to protect our people.ldquoThat means we must ensure our shops are allowed to open subject to social distancing rules and the British Government needs to abolish air passenger duty and reduce VAT on tourism.ldquoThat would assist our hospitality industry and those employed in it as well as the many people who depend on it for their basic source of income. These fiscal measures could indirectly make contributions to reducing inequalities in our society and community. Baroness Ritchie said the furloughing of many staff within the hospitality sector was currently concealing the true extent of the job losses that would follow when the scheme was ended.She also said the pandemic had revealed the ldquodeep levels of poverty and inequalities that are entrenched within many communities.She went on: ldquoThere have been greater levels of dependence on food banks for essential food provisions.

the reinstatement of services at the Downe Hospital.Baroness Margaret Ritchie and Alliance councillor Patrick Brown are both demanding the full restoration of services which were removed at the height of the Covid- pandemic.Baroness Ritchie says she has pressed health chiefs on the issue, but to date has not been given a timeline by the South Eastern Trust.ldquoIt is important that the work on the reinstatement of services and staff continues and that the timeline for doing so is published so that the public is fully aware of all the circumstances, she said.ldquoUndoubtedly, all the staff in the Downe Hospital, including medical, nursing and ancillary, have worked with very dficult challenges over the last few months and they deserve our support, solidarity and congratulations.Baroness Ritchie said she had been told equipment will be ed to the Downe and that the Trust was progressing plans for the rebuilding of non-Covid health and social care services.She said she had pressed senior management on the provision of endoscopy services at the Downe and was informed that the service recommenced in the day procedure unit on June .She said  patients were examined during the first session and that the Trust currently had  patients on their lsquored flag escalation listrsquo for endoscopy services.She said priority was being given to those with higher risk of cancer at this stage. ldquoThese patients are getting access to urgent endoscopy usually within the three-week target, she remarked.She added: ldquoIn response to my query about the scoping work for additional services to be provided at the Downe Hospital, the Trust has informed me that planning for the provision of services to be delivered from the day procedure Unit at the Downe Hospital is part of the overall work the Trust is progressing in relation to the rebuilding of non-Covid  health and social services.ldquoIt is also anticipated that other day case surgical work will recommence shortly afterwards.Cllr Brown called on the Trust to reconsider its decision to engage with a private firm to offer endoscopy treatment at the Downe and to reinstate the AE department, as well as investing in what he said were ldquomuch-needed services for the local community.He claimed privatising healthcare put limits on those who could receive treatment.ldquoOur constituents should have access to high quality local services, he said.ldquoWhilst the dficult and unprecedented circumstances caused by the Covid- pandemic have undoubtedly added a strain on hospital resources, the decision to involve a private contractor for endoscopy treatments should be swtly reconsidered.ldquoInstead, efforts should be made to find a cohesive solution with current medical staff and relevant unions, in order to safeguard our local services.He continued: ldquoThe decision to close the AE Department in Downe Hospital was taken to reallocate resources and staff to other hospitals to help fight Covid-, especially at the peak of the virus.ldquoWhilst it is understandable that medical services needed to adapt as a response to the outbreak, Downe Hospital failed to have a sufficient offering in terms of emergency medical care prior to the pandemic, with an AE Department that only operated for  hours of the day.Cllr Brown said a global health crisis should not be used as an excuse to remove or rationalise health services.He remarked: ldquoDowne Hospital is a vital local employer and necessary for the health and wellbeing of residents across the District.ldquoLocal rural constituents should not have to worry that they wonrsquot have adequate access to healthcare, as services have been displaced to Belfast or Dundonald.ldquoThere is a clear need to invest in services, restoring those lost

It is hard to believe that it has taken  years to get to the stage we are at now at, but the sight of new homes going up is welcome, he continued.ldquoWhile the regeneration of this part of Downpatrick is vital, so is the impact the new homes project will have on addressing a critical shortage of social housing. Many of those in need of a new home are in the urgent need category and the sooner tenants can start to move in, the better.Cllr Curran explained that those in the urgent need category are the priority as far as housing providers are concerned.He also hopes that given the progress that is being made at the former hospital site that families may be able to move in before December.The councillor said the new social housing project will benefit the wider community by providing construction jobs and boosting buildersrsquo suppliers and hopes that those on the waiting list for homes in the town will be offered the new properties.He added: ldquoThis eagerly-awaited scheme is ridding Downpatrick of a derelict site which will be transformed to deliver modern homes in an area of high

initiative aimed at revitalising Ardglass harbour are expected to be published before the end of the month.Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots is due to unveil the first stage of a report from the Fishing and Seafood Development programme whichwill include a timeline for work that needs to be done at Ardglass and the other Co Down ports of Kilkeel and Portavogie.Earlier this year, Mr Poots met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss the future of the village port.They highlighted the importance of the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy and outlined planned improvement work at the harbour, including deepening it to facilitate larger herring and mackerel vessels.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran emphasised the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure, insisting that the port receives its fair share of funding to help enhance the existing fleet.They said that the harbour was ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed in Ardglass.The politicians said additional investment is critical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand with appropriate slipways provided for larger vessels to dock safely.Several weeks after the meeting with Mr Poots it was revealed that ambitious plans to redevelop Ardglass harbour could cost in the region of poundm.The figure is contained in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the harbour which is home to Northern Irelandrsquos third largest fishing fleet.The key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, with work also undertaken to look at improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.In addition, the study included a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computer modelling.The consultants also liaised with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswhich has been given a copy of the consultants report ahead of further discussions with its officials on the way forward.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas including the so-called fish dock within the south pier.Last August, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group which has been set up to oversee the regeneration of the port. The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.Cllr Curran, who is keen to hear what Mr Poots has to say in a few weeksrsquo time, said there were plans to deepen the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.He confirmed that consideration is also being given to creating a pontoon with finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.ldquoNew investment in Ardglass harbour can help sustain existing jobs and create new employment opportunities, said Cllr Curran. ldquoThe port plays a ket part in the local economy and is at the heart of village le.ldquoArdglass lands some of the largest quantities of prawns in Ireland and deepening the harbour will mean that larger fishing vessels that currently dock where, will be able to access local facilities.Cllr Curran also fears that not deepening the harbour could potentially lead to an economic collapse for the Ardglass fishing industry.He added: ldquoI look forward to hear what the fisheries minister has to say towards the end of the month and hope that it will be positively good news for Ardglass..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Roadworks causing delays in town centre  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK businesswoman has called on Phoenix Gas to complete pipe laying work in St Patrickrsquos Avenue by next Monday mdash as promised.The company is investing poundm investment across East Down and to date has laid over  miles of natural gas pipeline, with contractors also currently working in Newcastle.Phoenix officials have been working with the Department for Infrastructure to identy areas where pipe-laying could be brought forward to avoid further disruption to traders, visitors and residents, with work in Downpatrick starting several weeks ago.A mains pipeline has already been laid in a number of areas in the town, with contractors recently completing work in the Edward Street area.

Photo: PA WireArticle  of the Detention of TerroristsOrder  authorises a secretary of state, minister of state or under secretary of state to sign an ICO. As minister of state, I was one of the ministers authorised by that order to sign, and thus to make, ICOs. The Supreme Court’s judgment does not say which minister of state signed the ICO in relation to Gerry Adams. As I say, it may be that my signature was on some of the ICOs made in this period, although they could have been signed by David Windlesham or Paul Channon. Most likely, they would have been signed by David Windlesham as he was specically assigned by Mr Whitelaw to oversee security issues, although we all worked together as a team on all aspects of Northern Ireland’s administration. I note that it was David Windlesham who on  December  moved the motion in the House of Lords that the  Order be approved. He remarked then that “applications for interim custody orders are by no means automatically granted by the secretary of state.Lord Kerr of Tonaghmore, a Justice of the Supreme Court of the UK and former Lord Chief Justice in Northern Ireland, who read out the unanimous judgement in the Gerry Adams case. Photo: Supreme Court PA WireThere is a thorough process of scrutiny before he, or anyone on his behalf, decides whether or not to sign one at all.”It is clear to me that the Supreme Court has misinterpreted the nature and scope of the  Order. The court misunderstands the signicance of Article , which specically provided for a minister of state or undersecretary of state to sign an ICO in the name of the secretary of state.This provision was understood by government in making the order and in exercising it, and by Parliament in the debates about whether to approve the order, to authorise the minister of state or under secretary of state to decide whether an ICO should be made. In so doing, weacted in the name of the secretary of state, who was responsible for the Northern Ireland Officeand the ministerial team and who was, of course, closely involved in many ICO decisions himself, as well as directing which ministers should oversee which aspects of Northern Ireland’s administration.The fundamental failure of the Supreme Court’s judgment is its total misunderstanding of the nature of ministerial and departmental government and methods of operating. A junior minister on duty at Stormont is in effect the persona of Her Majesty’s government and is thereby empowered to act for and as the secretary of state in the latter’s absence. And the secretary of state was often unavoidably absent. In relation to Northern Ireland, it was inherent in the nature of direct rule that the secretary of state had to be frequently in London – in Parliament or the cabinet – and that his responsibilities would often have to be exercised by a junior minister on the ground.On the weekends, one of us was always the duty minister. One minister always had to be available to Parliament, including to answer urgent questions. And those of us who were members of the House of Commons had also toto London frequently to vote .When the order was made, on  November , and when it was approved by Parliament in December , it was certainly contemplated that there would often be cases in which an ICO would need to be made by the minister of state or under secretary of state rather than by the secretary of state himself. The order clearly provides for this to happen. The high number of ICOs that the government anticipated would have to be made, and were in practice made, also helps explain why the order provides that junior ministers may order temporary detention. The Supreme Court’s assertion that it would not have been dficult for the secretary of state to consider each case personally and to make each ICO himself simply does not match the reality.As it happens, almost all signing of ICOs, where the actual signing of the document took place in Stormont Castle, was discussed directly with other ministers and usually with the secretary of state by telephone or message,he had to be in London or his constituency home in Penrith.The secretary of state could not always be directly involved and even when involved in some cases it would often be the minister of state or under secretary of state, in Stormont, who had reviewed the grounds for making an ICO in detail and who was satisfied that an ICO should be made.The minister on duty in Stormont was fully entitled to act in the secretary of state’s name. Other ministers were consulted, to the extent possible, not because this was what the law required, asthe junior minister were simply the mouthpiece of the secretary of state , but because that is how any team of ministers, operating as a team, would act in relation to important matters with political implications for which the secretary of state would have to accept constitutional responsibility.In any case, in relation to Gerry Adams one can be absolutely sure that it would have been discussed most fully and confirmed by the secretary of state before the ICO was made.The political salience and security implications of detaining Mr Adams would have made this unavoidable.I do not know whether there is a record of the secretary of state’s involvement in this case or any other case in which his signature does not appear on the ICO itself. The Supreme Court’s judgment implies not.This may be unsurprising in view of how ICOs were often made, which is to say by a minister of state or under secretary of state in Stormont, with the secretary of state often consulted by message or telephone from London or Penrith, but without a record of that involvement necessarily being kept or now being available. There would have been no reason, and perhaps no capacity, to record the secretary of state’s personal involvement, save in those cases where he himself signed the ICO, because Article  authorised the minister of state to sign the ICO and this signature had itself to be sufficient to authorise detention on the ground in Northern Ireland.But it is a travesty to conclude that because ministers complied with the terms of the  Order, and did not go above and beyond it to somehow record the secretary of state’s involvement, the ICO must now be quashed and the detention ruled unlawful.It is quite startling to see the Supreme Court reasoning that the prosecution had failed in Gerry Adams’s case to prove that the secretary of state had personally authorised his detention. The shape of the  Order makes very clear that an ICO signed by a minister of state or snder secretary of state is the same as an ICO signed by the secretary of state himself and authorises detention. It would have been utterly unworkable for the Royal Ulster Constabulary to have refused to detain suspected terrorists unless and until proof had been provided that an ICO signed by the minister had also been personally considered by the secretary of state. Or for commissioners determining whether there should be continuing detention to have held that they did not have jurisdiction unless and until the secretary of state had provided evidence that he had personally considered whether to make the ICO in question.This would have made the scheme of the  Order simply unworkable. The Supreme Court’s reading of the  Order was not what government intended, or understood, or what Parliament approved. The whole point of the signature requirement in Article  is to make clear who is authorised to make an ICO and thus whose signature on the face of an ICO makes it lawful to detain the person in question.The making of ICOs in -, which the Supreme Court has now denounced as unlawful, was entirely in line with the law, with the wishes of Parliament, with normal ministerial practice and with the immediate security needs of protecting the public from acts of appalling violence and bloodshed . Like Professor Ekins and Sir Stephen, I take the case for legislation to overturn the effect of the Supreme Court’s judgment – to make clear that ICOs signed by a minister of state or under secretary of state were lawful — to be overwhelming. In so legislating, Parliament would be reaffirming its clear, obvious and original intentions and the absolutely normal practices of departmental governance and ministerial responsibility.• Lord Howell of Guildford is the last surviving member of the ministerial team in the Northern Ireland Office, with responsibility under the Detention of TerroristsOrder .

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become

including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the

A wide range of services were stood down or scaled back due to the risk of spread of COVID-. New services were introduced to meet the predicted demands of the pandemic. A spokesperson said: With the first peak of the COVID- outbreak in Northern Ireland having passed, the Trust is now focused on planning, with our HSC partners, how to restart services while maintaining sufficient flexibility so that services can respond to future waves of this disease. In working together with our health and social care partners across NI to implement the recovery of non-COVID- HSC Services, the agreed regional approach will be to ensure equity of access to treatment for patients and clients across NI, to minimise transmission of COVID- and to protect the most urgent services. A set of guiding principles in the form of a ‘checklist’ has been established by the Department of Healthto guide service planning. The DoH has asked that service restart plans be assessed against the checklist to ensure that they have been subject to a rigorous risk assessment, take account of new ways of working and can be safely implemented in line with social distancing, use of personal protective equipmentand infection prevention and control requirements.The Western Trust has introduced a Reset Framework to support staff in assessing the impact of scaling up or restarting services and to ensure there is a rigorous and careful approach to planning.A spokesperson continued: The Western Trust Stage  Plan identies the services we have maintained throughout these initial months of the COVID- pandemic across a wide range of areas. It identies those that we will continue and others that we will begin to restart or scale up. It sets out some of the important preparation work needed to provide COVID- safe environments and working practices, to protect our staff, patients and service users. There are a number of constraints which are foremost in the planning process, including availability of PPE availability of drugs and restrictions on the practice of vulnerable staff.Our Stage  plan will focus on:Supporting strong community services for frail or older people. Preparing for the impact of the COVID- pandemic on mental health services. Managing risk, and providing COVID--safe services for staff and our service users. Involving our staff and service users.Speaking about the launch of Stage  of the Trust’s Reset Plan, Dr Anne Kilgallen, Western Trust chief executive, said: “There is no doubt that this has been one of the most dficult periods we have ever had to experience.I would like to thank our community and hospital staff for their hard work and dedication. Members of the public have also been unwavering in their support and this has not gone unnoticed. “There are many challenges which we have faced and will continue to face in the new COVID- environment. Our Stage  plan sets out the steps we are taking to rebuild, reset and make necessary changes to our services into the future.“It is accepted that COVID- remains a public health risk to our population and a phased and flexible approach is needed to restarting services. As a result, the way services are delivered may look and feel dferent. There are opportunities to do things dferently in ways that improve care. Many great initiatives have already begun.” Dr Kilgallen continued: “While there are signicant challenges ahead, the public should be reassured that we are committed to providing the best possible care in environments that reduce the risk of infection for staff and services users alike. We will continue to work diligently to create COVID--safe environments while we rebuild services.” A copy of the rebuilding plan – Stage One can you be found on the Trust website www.westerntrust.hscni.net  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aecdedf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cfabcdefbe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
