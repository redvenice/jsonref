So the 32 times might overstate the vaccine effect, but it is still going to be considerable.\u0027Chris Snowdon, head of lifestyle economics at the Institute for Economic Affairs, warned the statistics may have \u0027gilded the lily\u0027 slightly because of the time period used.He tweeted: \u0027This is a dodgy statistic when very few people were fully vaccinated until March. The evidence is good without having to gild the lily like this.\u0027Almost 50million Britons — or 86.9 per cent of over-12s — have got at least one dose of the Covid vaccine, and 45.7million have received both doses.The NHS started rolling out vaccines to over-80s, the vulnerable and health and social care workers in December.It is now also offering them to 12 to 15-year-olds following a recommendation from No10\u0027s vaccine advisers back in September, although uptake has been sluggish.And booster shots are being offered for the over-50s from six months after their second dose to top-up their immunity ahead of what is expected to be a very hard winter for the NHS.The report builds on evidence that Covid vaccines slash the risk of hospitalisation and death among people who catch the virus, and its variants.A report by the UK Health Security Agency — which replaced the now-defunct Public Health England — found last week that jabs work just as well against the more transmissible Delta offshoot as they do on its ancestor.Scientists said the vaccines slashed the risk of someone infected with AY.4.2 of developing symptoms by 81 per cent.For comparison, two doses are thought to block around 83 per cent of all people falling ill with the ancestor strain.The UKHSA said the preliminary results do \u0027not suggest a significant reduction in vaccine effectiveness for AY.4.2 compared to Delta\u0027 and admitted the slight drop may be down to chance.Almost 24,000 cases of the strain have now been spotted in Britain. But the true count could be 10 times higher because laboratories are only sequencing a fraction of all confirmed samples.Separate surveillance data shows the variant has now been found in all but a dozen parts of England and makes up one in ten new cases — with its proportion having doubled in the space of a month.Despite statistics showing it\u0027s still outcompeting its ancestor, some experts are now questioning how much more transmissible than Delta the subtype really is. Scientists initially estimated the strain was around 10 to 15 per cent more infectious.Figures show while cases of the mutant strain are continuing to increase, its curve is flattening off. It is increasing slower than its predecessor did at this point after it was first sequenced."},{"url":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/01/chaotic-scenes-outside-cop26-as-world-descends-on-glasgow\" class=\"dcr-g65o95\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"dcr-ghyc83\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"dcr-1d91meq\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"dcr-m4qltb\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"dcr-1gqsble\"\u003eChaotic scenes outside Cop26, as world descends on Glasgow\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"dcr-9g571g\"\u003e\u003csvg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\u003e\u003cg fill-rule=\"evenodd\"\u003e\u003cpath class=\"rich-link__arrow-icon\" d=\"m12 0c-6.627 0-12 5.373-12 12 0 6.627 5.373 12 12 12 6.627 0 12-5.373 12-12 0-6.627-5.373-12-12-12m.21 19l-.637-.668 4.888-6.326h-11.465v-1.01h11.465l-4.888-6.333.637-.668 6.79 7.158v.685l-6.79 7.157","title":"wolves v everton premier league live","story":"I also spotted the late John Sessions.

Photograph: Getty ImagesWe have left it late. But it is not yet too late. In the first of those truths lies the justification for fear. In the second lies the possibility of hope. The Cop26 summit on climate change crystallises a moment when the fate of humanity hovers between these realities.It is all too easy to be overwhelmed by terror and despair. The first report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was published in 1990. It laid out very clearly the catastrophic consequences of continuing to pump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Yet global greenhouse gas emissions are on course to be 16 per cent higher by the end of this decade compared to 2010.Thirty years of failure to heed the warnings raises grim questions. Are our political systems so corrupted and dominated by those who have vested interests in the carbon economy that they cannot act in the collective interest?Are our imaginations so limited that we have to see apocalyptic fires and biblical floods before we truly believe what is happening?There has been an abundance of sheer malignity: Donald Trump’s assaults on science and truth Jair Bolsonaro’s savaging of the Amazon rainforest Rupert Murdoch’s systematic support for climate denialism.There has been the more subtle propaganda of the big carbon producers, the false reassurance of greenwashing.And there is the gravitational pull of mere inertia, the million immediacies that obscure the wider canvas of existential necessity.These forces have driven us very close to the edge. The last decade has been the hottest on earth for 125,000 years. It is now, according to the IPCC, a virtual certainty that the world will experience within the next two decades 1.5 degrees of heating over pre-industrial levels.Some of the forces we have set in motion, like rising sea levels and the retreat of glaciers, will not be reversed for centuries to come.We are living in the future we were warned against. There is little doubt that in 2031 we will be looking back on this year’s weather-related disasters with some degree of nostalgia.Moment of crisisYet despair is both disabling and unwarranted. Those gathering in Glasgow must not allow themselves to succumb to the two most wistful words in the language: if only. It is sadly true that they can look back over the last 30 years and sigh that if only their governments had acted sooner, humanity would not be at this moment of crisis.But that realisation must galvanise their determination that their successors will not look back in 30 years’ time and utter those same words with a much deeper sense of anguish.Seeing the damage as clearly as they do now, they must act to limit it. They must commit themselves – not on paper but in reality – to cuts of at least 50 per cent in carbon emissions over the rest of this decade and their complete elimination by 2050.They have the power to do so: rapid, co-ordinated and transformational action can ensure that heating is kept to 1.5 degrees by the end of this century.The technologies needed for this transformation are already well developed. The science is increasingly difficult even for the worst deceivers to deny. Above all, people the world over now understand that the price of passivity is infinitely higher than the cost of change.Global leadersCop26 is not a chance for global leaders to make history. It is much bigger than that. It is their one-off opportunity to reshape humanity’s relationship to the natural world.The idea that our species can and should dominate and exploit nature has driven the progress of civilisation. It has now reached its end point: the realisation that if we treat the world as material to be burned we ourselves will be consumed in that fire.In this end must be a beginning. This conference can be the start of a new epoch of interdependence, one in which we finally accept that no country can prosper without the others and that no species – even one as arrogant as ours – can afford to be careless of the fate of all the others.James Connolly, in a very different context, wrote that “our demands most moderate are, We only want the earth.” That is all that humanity demands now of those who hold its fate in their hands."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Young protesters in Glasgow for Cop26 will have much to fight againstStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"four in 10 new covid 19 cases are among vaccinated people data shows","story":"More than four in every 10 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in the six weeks to mid-October were fully vaccinated against the disease, new official data shows.The figures show the scale of so-called breakthrough infections among a population with high vaccination rates.Almost 89 per cent of people aged 12 and over have been fully vaccinated.Figures from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, which collates data on the coronavirus disease, show that of 58,361 new cases between September 5th and October 16th, some 25,433 or 43.6 per cent were fully vaccinated.There were 25,571 unvaccinated people among the cases, representing 43.8 per cent of cases.The vaccination status was unknown in some 6,736 cases or 11.5 per cent.Of the 25,433 fully vaccinated people, 9,775 or 16.7 per cent were self-reported as being jabbed and 15,658 or 26.8 per cent were checked through the Covax vaccination programme system.“As the vast majority (90 per cent) of the adult population in Ireland is currently vaccinated, even with a highly effective vaccine, we expect to see more cases, hospitalisations, ICU admissions and deaths in this vaccinated group than the much smaller group who are unvaccinated,” the HPSC said.The State’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said last week that vaccines were performing better than expected in preventing severe infection but not in preventing transmission.“In truth, they are probably not performing as well as we might have hoped in terms of preventing transmission so there is an impact in transmission by and to people who are vaccinated but it is not as great as you might like it,” he said at last week’s Covid-19 briefing.Dr Holohan said that vaccinations alone were “not going to be enough” to reduce transmission and that simple health measures such as hand washing were required to stop the virus spreading.On Friday, the HPSC reported that of the 474 people whose deaths due to Covid-19 were notified between April 1st and October 23rd, 212 or 44.7 per cent were fully vaccinated.Some 267 people had been vaccinated with at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.Of the 212 fully vaccinated people who died, 120 were male and 92 were female, while the median age was 81 years. Almost 73 per cent of the people had an underlying medical condition.There were 55 deaths in October, 94 in September, 52 in August and 11 from April to July.Imperial College London research published last week showed that fully vaccinated people can contract and pass on the Delta variant – the current dominant Covid-19 strain that is twice as transmissible as the original virus – in households but at lower rates that unvaccinated people.The findings published in the Lancet medical journal found that the chance of contracting the Delta variant from someone in your home was 25 per cent for the fully vaccinated compared with 38 per cent if unvaccinated, but this protection began to wane three months after vaccination.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"further 2 855 new cases of covid 19 announced","story":"Immunology expert professor Paul Moynagh expressed surprise that Niac had not yet given approval for the booster campaign for healthcare workers. Photograph: Christof StacheAFP via GettyThe Department of Health has reported a further 2,855 new cases of Covid-19. The number of patients being treated in hospital was 515 as of 8am on Monday, it said, with 91 in ICU.The latest figures came as Taoiseach Micheál Martin discussed Covid-19 with the Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett during the Cop26 conference in Glasgow on Monday.Mr Bennett told the Taoiseach that Israel had seen a remarkable improvement from the booster dose of the vaccine, far greater than the second dose, officials said.The meeting in Glasgow comes as the National Immunisation Advisory Council (Niac), which advises the Government on immunisation issues, meets in Dublin to discuss a possible booster vaccine campaign for healthcare workers.There is considerable impatience in Government that Niac has not already recommended a booster dose for healthcare workers.It comes as the number of Covid patients in intensive care has fallen slightly over the last week but continues to hover around the 100 mark, data from the HSE shows.As calls increase for booster vaccines for healthcare workers, latest data published on Monday shows 93 people were in ICU on Sunday evening, a steady but slow decline from the 101 recorded last Wednesday. The average over the last 10 day period was 95.6.The number of patients on ventilators continues to remain stable, however – 52 on Sunday, against a 10 day average of 51.5 according to the data which tracks how the disease is presenting in hospitals.On Sunday, there were 194 general hospital beds available (excluding critical care) with just over 500 people admitted with the virus.Hospital staffThe latest daily statistics are framed by increasing concerns around hospitals and their staff as the disease progresses in the wrong direction.  Some 3,500 healthcare workers are now out sick, according to the HSE.“What we are waiting on is the decision by Niac,” Phil Ni Sheaghdha, general secretary of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) said of the vaccine boosters.“We need to ensure that the vaccine booster is provided so that we have the maximum protection.”With new cases approaching 2,000 on Sunday, the State has begun administering booster shots to older people, while the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is expected to decide on whether or not to vaccinate children.Immunology expert professor Paul Moynagh expressed surprise that Niac had not yet given approval for the booster campaign for healthcare workers, some of whom received their first vaccine 10 months ago.He noted that many workers had received the AstraZeneca vaccine for their first and second doses, and that if Pfizer was administered as a booster dose it would give them a high level of immune response.Meanwhile, the HSE has said its vaccination centres will be closed on Monday to allow for essential updates to its Covid-19 Vaccination Information System (COVAX). The system update will provide increased capability to support the vaccination booster programme, it said.However, in a tweet on Monday, HSE chief executive Paul Reid emphasised that a “steady number” of people continued to arrive for vaccinations. “Over the past six days almost 15,000 people have come to a Vaccination Centre via an appointment or walk in. Almost 7,000 via walk in. Avg 1,800 registering per day. It’s never too late,” he said.

Now that the former Google executive has a book out Tuesday on The Age of AI, written with Henry Kissinger and Daniel Huttenlocher, I wanted to ask him the same question about AI: “Friend or foe?” “AI is imprecise, which means that it can be unreliable as a partner,” he said when we met at his Manhattan office. “It’s dynamic in the sense that it’s changing all the time. It’s emergent and does things that you don’t expect. And, most importantly, it’s capable of learning.“It will be everywhere. What does an AI-enabled best friend look like, especially to a child? What does AI-enabled war look like? Does AI perceive aspects of reality that we don’t? Is it possible that AI will see things that humans cannot comprehend?”I agree with Elon Musk that when we build AI without a kill switch, we are “summoning the demon” and that humans could end up, as Steve Wozniak said, as the family pets. (If we’re lucky.) Talking about the alarms raised by the likes of Musk and Stephen Hawking, Schmidt said that “they think that by unleashing AI, eventually, you’ll end up with a robot overlord that’s 10 or 100 or 1,000 times smarter than the humans. My answer is different. I think all the evidence is that these AI systems are going to think, not like humans, but they’re going to be very smart. We’re going to have to coexist.”You don’t think Siri and Alexa are going to kill us one night? “No,” he said. “But they might become your child’s best friend.” SupergodsOpinions on AI are wildly ergent. Jaron Lanier, the father of virtual reality, rolls his eyes at the digerati in Silicon Valley obsessed with the “science-fiction fantasy” of AI. “It can sometimes become a giant, false god,” he told me. “You’ve got these nerdy guys who have an awful reputation for how they treat women, who get to be the life creators. ‘You women with your petty little biological wombs can’t stand up to us. We’re making the big life here. We’re the supergods of the future.’”We have known for a while that Silicon Valley is taking us down the drain. Preposterous claims that once could not have got traction – on everything from Democratic paedophilia rings to rigged elections to vaccine conspiracy theories – now spread at the speed of light. Teenage girls can be sent spiralling into depression by the glossy, deceptive world of Instagram, owned by the manipulative and greedy company formerly known as Facebook. Schmidt said an Oxford student told him, about social media poison, “The union of boredom and anonymity is dangerous.” Especially at the intersection of addiction and envy. The question of whether we will lose control to AI may be passe. Technology is already manipulating us. Schmidt admits that the lack of foresight among the lords of the cloud about where technology was headed was “foolish”. “I’ll say, 10 years ago, when I worked really hard on these social networks – maybe this is just naivety – but we never thought that governments would use them against citizens, like in 2016, with interference from the Russians. “We didn’t think it would then stitch these special interest groups together with these violently strong belief systems. No one ever discussed it. I don’t want to make the same mistake again with a new foundational technology.” ‘Destructive potential’He said the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, which he chaired this year, concluded that America is still “a little bit ahead of China” in the technology race but that China is “overinvesting against us”. The authors write that they are most worried about other countries developing AI-facilitated weapons with “substantial destructive potential” that “may be able to adapt and learn well beyond their intended targets”.“The first thing for us to look at between the US and China is to make sure that there’s no ‘Dr Strangelove’ scenario, a launch on a warning, to make sure there’s time for human decision-making,” he said. “Let’s imagine you’re on a ship in the future and the little computer system says to the captain, ‘You have 24 seconds before you’re dead because the hypersonic missile is coming at you. You need to press this button now.’ You want to trust the AI, but because of its imprecise nature, what if it makes a mistake?”I asked if he thought Facebook could leave its troubles behind by changing its name to Meta. “The problem is, what do you now call Faang stocks? Maang?” he said of the biggest tech stocks – Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. “Google changed its name to Alphabet, and yet Google was still Google.” And what’s with that creepy metaverse that Mark Zuckerberg is trying to lure us into? “All of the people who talk about metaverses are talking about worlds that are more satisfying than the current world – you’re richer, more handsome, more beautiful, more powerful, faster. So, in some years, people will choose to spend more time with their goggles on in the metaverse. And who gets to set the rules? The world will become more digital than physical. And that’s not necessarily the best thing for human society.”Schmidt said his book poses questions that cannot yet be answered. Unfortunately for us, we won’t know the answers until it is too late.

Unlike measles and mumps, these viruses do not induce lifelong immunity to further infection. Instead, herd immunity is maintained through continuous re-infection. Fortunately, immunity to severe disease and death does not decay on the same timescale and so repeat infections are rarely dangerous unless the immune system itself has begun to fail due to old age and other factors.The presentation of the epidemic in waves across much of the world can be readily explained by the waning of natural immunity against infection on a timescale of six months to a year (which is shorter than I expected) within a background of seasonal variation in transmissibility. It is much harder to ascribe these patterns to the imposition and withdrawal of restrictions on mixing, although these interventions will no doubt have had some effect on specific dynamics.A short duration of immunity against infection permits us to reconcile the extreme infectiousness of the virus with the apparent absence of a substantial first wave in many settings where it is clear that SARS-CoV-2 had arrived by late 2019early 2020. In other words, while the proportion immune may well have shot beyond the threshold of herd immunity in late winter (and remained so over the summer), due to the waning of infection-blocking immunity it would have declined sufficiently by autumn for another wave to occur when the conditions favoured a rise. A rapid decay in infection-blocking immunity is what maintains the seasonal increase in infection prevalence in the endemic state it is also what makes the ride towards this state so very bumpy.Although current vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 may confer durable immunity against severe disease and death, they only confer a transient and incomplete ability to resist infection. This does not compromise the value of these vaccines in avoiding a high death toll while shepherding us towards an endemic state such as we enjoy with other seasonal coronaviruses. But it does mean that these vaccines should not be viewed as tools of eradication or indeed as an alternative route to this endemic state. The latter would require a permanent dependence on regular mass vaccination which is a much poorer solution (from a resource allocation perspective alone) than allowing an endemic state to establish naturally once those who are vulnerable have been protected.Neither does the waning of immunity against infection warrant the imposition of restrictions which we now can be certain cause extreme harm to the economically vulnerable and to children and young adults throughout the world. Once the vulnerable have been protected, there is no logic to putting any further resources towards preventing the spread of infection. The vaccines should also have reduced the risk of hospitalisable illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection, thereby protecting the healthcare systems from being overwhelmed. If this is not the case, then we should rapidly invest in building resilience so that the delivery of other forms of healthcare (which should never, in any case, have been deprioritised) is not compromised.The imposition of restrictions upon the economically disadvantaged effectively transfers to them the costs of our long history of underfunding the NHS. In order to reverse this injustice, we need to increase capacity – although much of that will now be needed to deal with the other pathogens whose transmission was temporarily halted by interventions designed to tackle Covid but are now returning with a vengeance.In future, we should be more aware of the larger uncertainties regarding the potential of interventions to control pandemics and balance them more wisely against the very real possibility that they may cause harm.Sunetra Gupta is professor of theoretical epidemiology at the Department of Zoology, University of OxfordMore from NewsBoris Johnson hails ‘landmark’ Cop26 agreement to end deforestation by 2030Emmanuel Macron’s chauvinistic liberalism is a danger to the WestReverend returns home to find fraudster has sold his house and everything in itHome Office prepares for third attempt to deport 50 Jamaicans convicted of serious crimesHogarth\u0026#39s images of drunken men depict sexual violence and racism, claims Tate Britain exhibitionMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc accused transphobic 20000 speak against article","story":"The BBC has defended an article which some campaigners claimed was transphobic.The article featured interviews with lesbians who said they have been pressured into having sex with trans women.The broadcaster said in a statement that the article had prompted many complaints and had been branded transphobic and poorly evidenced.The piece, published last week, questioned whether a lesbian is transphobic if she does not want to have sex with trans women. It included comments from a number of lesbians who said they have been criticised for this.The article also included a social media survey of 80 lesbians, of which 56 per cent said they had been pressured or coerced to accept a trans woman as a sexual partner.An open letter to the BBC from campaign group Trans Activism UK, which was signed by more than 20,000 people, criticised the article.It said the piece dangerously frames lesbians being pressured into sex as a widespread issue.In a statement on Monday, the BBC said it had received a wide range of feedback from those who find the article challenging as well as those who welcome its publication.It added that while some have argued the piece is flawed because of the inclusion of a survey with a small sample size, the article itself states there is little research in this area.The statement, published on the complaints section of the BBC website, said the article stated the survey featured was conducted on social media and is therefore self-selecting and even the author of the survey admits it may not be a representative sample.It added: Furthermore, there is a link to the detail of the findings which enables the reader to make up their own minds about the replies the sample generated.The broadcaster added that the article went through a rigorous editorial review process and fully complies with the BBC\u0027s editorial guidelines and standards.It said the article, which took months of work, deals with a matter worthy of investigation.The article after one of the broadcaster’s own investigative reporters criticised the corporation’s links to Stonewall and said that staff were too “frightened” to speak out about gender issues.Stephen Nolan claimed that “there is a fear factor” among his colleagues at the BBC, who disagree with the broadcaster’s alignment with the charity. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the journalist said: “We’ve received communication from senior people within the BBC, outside the BBC, who are frightened of speaking about this issue.”Stonewall, which was founded in 1989 to campaign for LGBT rights, has been the subject of controversy in recent months amid mounting concern about the group’s influence on public policy.A number of high-profile organisations and government departments have severed ties with it and have withdrawn from its ersity scheme.More from NewsBoris Johnson hails ‘landmark’ Cop26 agreement to end deforestation by 2030Emmanuel Macron suspends sanctions deadline as Brexit fishing dispute talks continueEmmanuel Macron’s chauvinistic liberalism is a danger to the WestReverend returns home to find fraudster has sold his house and everything in itHome Office prepares for third attempt to deport 50 Jamaicans convicted of serious crimesHogarth\u0026#39s images of drunken men depict sexual violence and racism, claims Tate Britain exhibitionMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"flailing macron may win election days power numbered","story":"It started like something out of Dad\u0027s Army — Halt in ze name of ze Republic, or we will sink you! — and went rapidly downhill from there.

In addition to closing off French ports, France wants Europe to impose stricter controls on all lorries entering  by the EU from the UK — exactly the kind that last long enough to let fresh produce (like fish) spoil, not to mention delay drivers for hours of unpaid time. It makes it hard not to think of Le Blocus Continental, the policy of blockading off Britain’s seas ordered by Napoleon I on 21 November 1806, tasking the French Navy to enforce a large-scale embargo against British trade, even when conducted by neutral ships.As part of a total war between the French Empire and Fortress Britain, the prime mover of international alliances against Napoleonic France, it was a grand strategic move, correctly identifying the global source of British prosperity and her maritime reach. It was also payback for the economic war started over a decade before, when Pitt the Younger used Royal Navy ships to ferry over crateloads of fake Assignats, the paper money of the Revolution, to flood France and destroy her currency.Next to this clash of great powers, there’s something pretty Clochemerle to Emmanuel Macron’s performative bite-sized skirmishes against Britain, the itch he has to scratch. There is no way that Girardin took the initiative on her own. More than any Fifth Republic president, and that’s saying something, Macron treats his ministers like (usually unsatisfactory) lowly employees. We can be sure that the decision for this new episode of the fishing wars comes straight from the Napoléon Le Très Petit at the Élysée Palace. (“Napoléon Le Petit” was Victor Hugo’s rather unfair moniker for Napoléon III in the splendid pamphlets he wrote in his house on, er, Guernesey, where he’s found shelter from the French authorities in different times.)After his surprise victory in the 2017 elections, Emmanuel Macron started off as your generic autocratic, competent French mandarin (a species largely created by one Buonaparte, N). But with his pan-European ambitions, and his resulting determination to use Brexit as a case history of why no member country should be allowed to leave the EU unpunished, he\u0027s definitely graduated to the full Napoléon. Macron expected his re-election next April to go swimmingly, largely unchallenged except by his favourite opponent, the increasingly defanged Marine Le Pen. Enter one Eric Zemmour, the fiery right-wing journalist who’s playing the Trump part in the reshaping of French politics. Neither Macron nor Zemmour have yet formally declared – and yet the competition seems to be fought between the two of them, as Zemmour hijacks the narrative rightwards.The fishing wars actually dismay Brussels, taking place only two months before France takes the rotating presidency of the EU. There’s a broad and constant French misreading of the European mood here (other countries, including Germany, have long favoured consensus and politeness over the usual arrogant posturing common to most French bosses, the only way, they feel, of keeping their troops docile). But Macron is also gesticulating because he\u0027s en campagne at home – and he is perfectly aware that he is now following the Zemmour line.As it happens, Napoleon is Eric Zemmour\u0027s hero (with Charles de Gaulle), and he refers to him in many of his books. Napoleon rebuilt France with both grandeur and military expansionism, but also with a legislative opus of impressive scope and precision, overseen and often dictated by himself. This, to say the least, is not Macron’s forte: his legislative effort has been contradictory and fussy and such is his resentment of any parliamentary opposition that he is planning to pass a bill before the presidential election in which MP’s right of amendment will be seriously curtailed (something Eric Zemmour has never called for.)Zemmour should be announcing the creation of his own party, to be called Vox Populi, next 9 November, the anniversary of Charles de Gaulle\u0027s death. Beyond the presidential election, which he is so far predicted to lose, he is looking at the June General election, with the aim of gathering a right-wing coalition against Napoléon le Très Petit’s wobbly La République en Marche, a non-party because Macron never wanted to share an inch of his power. It’s not certain fining British fishermen will be enough to keep him at the Élysée.More from NewsBrexit fishing row in \u0026#39solutions mode\u0026#39 after Emmanuel Macron suspends sanctionsBoris Johnson hails ‘landmark’ Cop26 agreement to end deforestation by 2030Emmanuel Macron’s chauvinistic liberalism is a danger to the WestReverend returns home to find fraudster has sold his house and everything in itHome Office prepares for third attempt to deport 50 Jamaicans convicted of serious crimesHogarth\u0026#39s images of drunken men depict sexual violence and racism, claims Tate Britain exhibitionMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"flip flopping climate change makes boris look ridiculous","story":"It wasn’t many months ago that Boris Johnson was employing his most powerful political weapon – his native optimism – to condemn the ‘doomsters and gloomsters’ whom he said were dragging down Britain.  But that was before he decided to join their ranks and become the nation’s doomster-in-chief. Climate change is no longer a problem which has to be solved through international co-operation, he says, but which is threatening to cause our civilisation to collapse in the manner of the Roman empire.  “Things can go backwards and they can go backwards at a really terrifying speed,” he said on the eve of the COP26 summit in Glasgow, holding up a vision of a future in which we could even have “lost the ability to read and write”.If literacy is the Prime Minister’s concern I think the answer lies less through tackling climate change and rather more in making up for the months of proper schooling which children lost during the Covid lockdowns. He might have thought better of undermining his own educational catch-up tsar, Sir Kevan Collins by being too stingy, preferring to smother the problem by awarding children with artificially-inflated exam grades. But let’s allow that to pass. What bothers me is Johnson’s sudden flip-flop from being a climate sceptic to outright alarmism.Older readers of this newspaper might just remember a column in 2015 when Johnson wrote, of the Paris climate summit:  “I am sure that those global leaders were driven a primitive fear that the present ambient warm weather is somehow caused by humanity and that fear – as far as I understand the science – is equally without foundation”.   Or the column in 2013 which complained that wind turbines “couldn’t pull the skin off a rice pudding?”  Yet now, it is the rest of us who must “grow up” on climate change, and pretty quickly, too, as we are “a minute from midnight”.Sorry, but I am not convinced by this road of Damascus conversion.  It is as if Richard Dawkins had suddenly morphed into Billy Graham. There is a middle view of climate change which Johnson might well have held consistently had he combined, all along, his native scepticism with a bit of effort to study climate science, and to study it from multiple scientific points of view, not just from one of Sir Patrick Vallance’s infamous slide shows.  He might, for example, have come to the same sort of conclusion as has Steven Koonin, physics professor at New York University and former under-secretary for science in the US Department for Energy under Barack Obama: that the Earth has warmed over the past century “partly in response to growing human influences”, but that “our limited observations and understanding are insufficient to usefully quantify either how the climate will respond to human influences or how it varies naturally”,  that “severe weather phenomena remain within past variability” and that “projections of future climate weather events rely on models demonstrably unfit for purpose”.  That is not a set of conclusions which would lead anyone to dismiss the threat of climate change, but rather to treat it in proportion, as a technical challenge rather than  coming apocalypse.By flopping from one extreme to another, Johnson has made himself look ridiculous. His zealotry of the converted has led every other global concern – poverty, hunger, disease – to fly out of the window.  That’s why, in 12 days’ time world leaders look doomed to head home from COP without any significant progress, just with a feeling they have attended a rather bad prayer meeting.More from NewsBrexit fishing row in \u0026#39solutions mode\u0026#39 after Emmanuel Macron suspends sanctionsBoris Johnson hails ‘landmark’ Cop26 agreement to end deforestation by 2030Emmanuel Macron’s chauvinistic liberalism is a danger to the WestReverend returns home to find fraudster has sold his house and everything in itHome Office prepares for third attempt to deport 50 Jamaicans convicted of serious crimesHogarth\u0026#39s images of drunken men depict sexual violence and racism, claims Tate Britain exhibitionMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"one four middle aged people not following covid isolation rules","story":"One in four middle-aged adults who test positive for Covid no longer follow the rules on self-isolating, the latest polling suggests.Some 75 per cent of respondents aged between 35 and 54 said they adhered to isolation requirements for the entire 10-day period after testing positive for the virus. This was down from 86 per cent in the summer, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).The statistics – based on a  survey of 881 people in England in late September and early October – suggests those in their mid-30s to mid-50s are the least likely of all age groups to follow the requirements of self-isolation in full.Compliance also fell in older people, with adherence dropping marginally in those aged 55 and over from 81 per cent in the summer to 78 per cent in recent weeks, according to the ONS.However, young people are now more likely to follow the rules than was the case in the summer, with 82 per cent of 18 to 34-year-olds reporting full compliance, up from 75 per cent in the summer.The figures are based on responses collected in England between Sep 27 and Oct 2.

The survey found that 34 per cent of those who tested positive for Covid reported that isolating had a negative effect on their mental health, down from 42 per cent in July.The ONS added that the figures should be treated with care because the survey was based on a relatively small sample of respondents who chose to report their own behaviour.More from NewsBrexit fishing row in \u0026#39solutions mode\u0026#39 after Emmanuel Macron suspends sanctionsBoris Johnson hails ‘landmark’ Cop26 agreement to end deforestation by 2030Emmanuel Macron’s chauvinistic liberalism is a danger to the WestReverend returns home to find fraudster has sold his house and everything in itHome Office prepares for third attempt to deport 50 Jamaicans convicted of serious crimesHogarth\u0026#39s images of drunken men depict sexual violence and racism, claims Tate Britain exhibitionMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"really good friday agreement none eus business","story":"One of the quirks of our long relationship with Europe and the EU is that, from time to time, an obscure continental politician will briefly become a hate figure for the British press: Jacques Delors, Herman van Rompuy, Michel Barnier. The latest person to step up to this particular plate is Maroš Šefčovič, a former Slovak diplomat who is now vice-president of the European Commission with responsibility for “inter-institutional relations”.Šefčovič thinks that the current disagreements between the UK and its continental neighbours over fishing rights and, particularly, the Northern Ireland Protocol are driven by an underlying British desire for conflict he believes that the government is seeking to “engage on a path of confrontation”.Downing Street is certainly playing a robust game. There has been considerable upset at a letter from the French premier Jean Castex to Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, which stated that the EU must show that it was disadvantageous to leave the union this is now being referred to in Whitehall as “the punishment letter”.Two issues are worth highlighting. The first is that both sides in this dispute are playing politics. Of course Boris Johnson is seeking to emphasise the threat from the bureaucracy of Brussels by talking about its desire to “punish” the UK and teach us a lesson for embarking on Brexit. There has been a lot of pearl-clutching over the exact translation of Castex’s letter, but it is undeniable that the EU must seek to make secession appear as unattractive as possible.The prime minister also knows, especially when it comes to our dispute with France over fishing rights, that there are always votes in antagonising the French. There is a degree of incongruity in Johnson and Macron grappling over an industry whose real importance is symbolic, compared to the tiny fraction of our respective economies which fishing represents. But British and English leaders have understood the advantages of baiting the French since Edward III.Šefčovič’s invocation of the Good Friday Agreement is slightly different, however. The situation in Northern Ireland is delicate: the unionist and nationalist communities remain deeply ided, Sinn FéinIRA are buoyed by their electoral support in the Republic of Ireland, and many working-class loyalist communities feel excluded by economic stagnation as well as the political process.The UK government professes its support for the Union, but in recent years only the late James Brokenshire among Northern Ireland secretaries has showed much grasp of the complex nexus of loyalties, suspicions, aspirations and vested interests in Belfast and beyond. The Good Friday Agreement is 23 years old now, and has seen to adulthood a whole generation which has no memory of the worst of the Troubles but it has not proved a panacea. Huge problems remain.Brexit has exacerbated those problems in that it has drawn to the surface a very stark question: where does ultimate loyalty lie? If one has to choose between maintaining the Union and accepting a hard border with the Republic, or alleviating barriers to trade but placing a border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which way will one jump? Squaring that circle has proved impossible so far, and arguments over the Northern Ireland Protocol have been conducted under the false belief that a resolution which will please all sides is possible.But the EU wades into the Northern Ireland issue at its peril. The union’s proponents like to pretend that it was somehow a key player in the Good Friday Agreement—it absolutely was not—and that the membership of both the UK and Ireland somehow underpinned or guaranteed the peace process. The involvement of outside parties in the Troubles has a very mixed history, from the terrorist enablers of Noraid to Senator George Mitchell’s brokering of the GFA the European Commission is not a helpful actor at this stage.But let us be honest and clear-eyed: this is a political battle between two parties with competing interests. The EU must make Brexit look as damaging as possible, while the UK must fight to extract as good a deal on issues like fishing and borders as possible. The problem is the European Commission’s tendency to paint itself as a quasi-saintly supranational institution with only the highest-minded goals.Šefčovič has pulled his gloves off and Boris Johnson arguably never wore any to begin with. So long as we recognise that, we will see this spat for what it is: another stage of our disentanglement from the European Union. This isn’t over, so let us not invest too much emotion in this particular round of the longer fight.More from NewsBrexit fishing row in \u0026#39solutions mode\u0026#39 after Emmanuel Macron suspends sanctionsBoris Johnson hails ‘landmark’ Cop26 agreement to end deforestation by 2030Emmanuel Macron’s chauvinistic liberalism is a danger to the WestReverend returns home to find fraudster has sold his house and everything in itHome Office prepares for third attempt to deport 50 Jamaicans convicted of serious crimesHogarth\u0026#39s images of drunken men depict sexual violence and racism, claims Tate Britain exhibitionMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"school closures did not significantly reduce covid spread","story":"There is no evidence that school closures significantly reduced the spread of Covid, a study has found.The research, published in the journal Nature Medicine, used data from Japan, where each municipality is responsible for the closure of schools in their areas.This meant some closed schools while others did not, allowing academics to compare the number of Covid cases and examine whether there was a relationship with school closures.Researchers analysed daily numbers of newly confirmed cases of Covid per 100,000 residents in municipalities in Japan between March and June last year.Empirically, we find no evidence that school closures in Japan caused a significant reduction in the number of coronavirus cases, they said.If opening schools leads to the spread of Covid-19, spikes of cases would occur in the control group however, these were not observed. The implication is the same: school closures do not help reduce the spread of Covid-19 significantly.The paper\u0027s authors, from Gakushuin and Shizuoka universities in Japan and Michigan University in the US, noted that by the beginning of April 2020 – a month after the World Health Organisation declared a pandemic – 173 counties had closed schools.They said the closures had broad impacts including learning loss, future earnings loss and a deterioration of physical and mental health.These null results concerning the supposed benefits of closing schools suggest that policymakers should be cautious when considering similar policies in the future, especially given the substantial costs such policies can have for the well-being of both children and parents, the authors added.However, they cautioned that Japan had fared relatively well with Covid cases last spring compared to some other countries.It is possible that school closures only have a discernible effect on Covid-19 cases once the reproduction number (within a school environment) passes a certain threshold, they added. Likewise, we analyse the effectiveness of school closures in the initial months of the coronavirus pandemic, but community transmission has become notably worse in many countries (including Japan) since spring 2020.Separate research, published earlier this year, found the UK had closed schools for longer than anywhere in Europe other than Italy over the past 18 months.Between January last year and this July, British children have been out of the classroom for 44 per cent of days, according to a House of Commons Library analysis of data from the University of Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker.

Government’s ambitions for mid-century targets at Cop26.One Cop26 official said they were “surprised” by the deadline in the announcement, which is ten years after pledges by China, Russia and Saudi Arabia.The UK fears that the lack of ambition from the world’s third largest polluter could push other countries that have yet to come forward with net zero plans to delay their aspirations.Narendra Modi, India\u0027s prime minister, also committed the coal economy to significant new emissions cuts in the next nine years, including generating half of its energy from renewable sources and reducing its projected carbon emissions by 1bn tonnes.The Cop26 official suggested the net zero move was a political gambit in India’s longer term negotiations over climate financing, and suggested the target could be met well ahead of 2070.But it is a blow to the UK Government’s hopes for countries to reach mid-century net zero targets, and for momentum toward a positive outcome at the end of the two-week negotiations in Glasgow.It follows disagreements at the G20 over the wording of the final ambition, which ultimately ended with a commitment to “achieving global net zero greenhouse gas emissions or carbon neutrality by or around mid-century.China declined to update its own emissions targets, with President Xi Jinping sending only a written statement to the talks on Monday.  Russian president Vladimir Putin also declined to attend, and is expected to send a video message on Tuesday.Mr Xi also called on richer countries to “provide support to help developing countries do better”, while Mr Modi said there needed to be $1tn in extra funding made available by developed countries “as soon as possible today”.A study by Oxford Economics earlier this year said India would need $170bn a year until 2030 in funding to move away from fossil fuels, a gap of around $150bn from current funding levels.Frustration from developing countries over international financing had long threatened to disrupt the negotiations, after it emerged that a pledge to reach $100bn in annual funding from developed countries would not be met until at least 2023.Prince Charles, Boris Johnson and Alok Sharma have called for more ambitious private sector funding in their comments in Glasgow.The Prime Minister met with Mr Modi in Glasgow before India’s 2070 announcement, where they discussed a new bilateral agreement for the UK to guarantee a £750m green loan form the World Bank.India’s “serious and significant” updated 2030 targets were welcomed by the UK team, which said a target to reach 500GW of renewables in its energy sector in the next nine years was “huge”.Officials also pointed to net zero by 2050 commitments from Vietnam and Brazil, as areas of optimism for the outcome of Cop26.Responding to India’s updated targets, London School of Economics climate expert Nicholas Stern said it was “a very significant moment for the summit.”“This demonstrates real leadership, based on a track record of action and ambitious targets, that can deliver on both economic development and climate change, from a country whose emissions per capita are about one-third of the global average.“The rich world must respond to Prime Minister Modi’s challenge to deliver a strong increase in international climate finance.”More from NewsBrexit fishing row in \u0026#39solutions

We donapost have real household disposable income getting above pre-pandemic levels until the back end of , and itaposs growing at a pretty mediocre rate from then on, he told the Commonsapos Treasury Select Committee.The grim assessment came after the Resolution Foundation calculated that Brits will pay £, more in tax on average by  than when Boris Johnson took office. Economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies also took a bleak view of the Chancelloraposs plans, warning that higher food and energy bills meant workers will feel real pain, despite Mr Sunak lting the public sector pay freeze and raising the minimum wage to £.. OBR experts also sounded the alarm over other looming crises. Richard Hughes, chairman, told the committee there was a permanent hole in the rail system, and the taxpayer may be forced to subsidise public transport in perpetuity to save services from the chop. “We don’t know to what extent people are going to start ing to work five days a week, said Mr Hughes. Revealed preference seems to suggest people are going to work from home more.” He added: “Assumptions about when ticket revenues into the transport system recover to pre-pandemic levels I think have to be kept under constant review and it may be the case there is a permanent hole in the rail system, the Underground in London and local transport systems, which are going to have to be subsidised in perpetuitythey’re not going to cut services.” Turning to the longer term, Mr Hughes told MPs Mr Sunak may struggle to meet his new targets of both reducing debt and balancing the current budget deficit in three years. He said: The headroom he set aside to reach those targets is the second-lowest headroom that any chancellor has had when setting fiscal rules.

In the Budget, the Chancellor pledged an extra £bn for education recovery from COVID, bringing spending on COVID catch-up since  to nearly £bn, rejecting calls for more money to help kids catch up on learning. Labour slammed the Tories for “floundering and failing to give kids a secure recovery plan. Mr Halfon told the Commons: We know from the Education Policy Institute that it increases educational attainment from two to three months, especially amongst disadvantaged pupils.  We know that a longer school day, according to the department for culture, media, sports, increases numeracy by %. So, this increases educational attainment.Will he at least consider some pilot schemes in disadvantaged areas around the country where we can have a longer school day Mr Zahawi replied: I think the priority has to be for those children and students, who have the least time available to them to recover, which is why the £ million for the  to -year-olds additional  hours of education is so important.Plus the £ billion going into secondary and primary, making the total £ billion of recovery money.There are some excellent examples... of a longer school day which Iaposm going to look at.The average school day now is . hours and I would like to see everybody move towards that average.  Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said: Children have already had  days out of school, missing out on learning and time with friends. The Conservatives’ response is flip flop, floundering and failure to act. Labour believes students should get additional time in school for breakfast clubs, targeted learning support and new activities for every child as part of our recovery plan.We believe the best way to support children’s recovery is time with friends and teachers learning new skills, not simply extended hours in the classroom.The Education Secretary has had ample time to look at this but is still failing to listen to calls from teachers, parents and education experts for a clear and comprehensive recovery plan. Zahawi needs to get a grip.Ahead of the Budget, Mr Sunak told Times Radio: Having looked through it all, it’s pretty clear the two things that make the biggest dference to children’s learning is tutoring in small groups and making sure teachers have all the development and training and support they need to be absolutely brilliant. “We have pretty much maxed out on those things. Because there is a constraint on how much of that can be reasonably delivered.”  Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leadersapos union NAHT, said in a statement: The gains that might be possible through extending the school day must be weighed against the costs of such a strategy, including the impact on pupilsapos mental health, reduced family time and less time for extracurricular activities.Childrenaposs happiness and wellbeing should be prioritised as well as their education.Former childrenaposs commissioner Anne Longfield had supported longer school days as she warned one in six children may never be able to catch up on school time without the right support.Earlier this year, the governmentaposs then education recovery commissioner, Sir Kevan Collins, said it could take years for schools to recover from the impact of the pandemic.

Akbar Risuddin, Indonesia, lbs oz For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Akbar Risuddin, whose name means The Great in Arabic, was delivered by c-section to mum Ani in . Measuring at two feet long, itaposs thought Akbaraposs size was due to Ani suffering from gestational diabetes, meaning he consumed a lot of glucose while in the womb. Speaking to AFP after the birth, Dr Binsar Sitanggang said: “This heavy baby made the surgery really tough, especially the process of taking him out of his mum’s womb. “His legs were so big.” Akbaraposs huge size meant his weight was closer to that of a one-year-old and was around triple the size of an average newborn. Nadia Khalina, Siberia, lbs oz Tatyana Khalina was  years old when she gave birth to Nadia in , making her a mum-of-.  After the birth, Tatyana had to remain in hospital for a month before she was allowed to take Nadia back home to her husband Viktor and  other children. Speaking to Reuters after Nadia was born, the mum said: “We aren’t planning any more kids. “From now on we are hoping only for grandchildren.” The Khalina family earned a monthly income of  USD for  people - meaning they could only afford to eat bread and soup most days.

Hospital director Rita Leal told the press at the time that the mother and baby were doing well after the birth.

Chesner Abels, lbs oz, South Africa  Cathleen Abels was stunned to give birth to her daughter Chesner in March  at Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town.Perhaps even more stunning is that Cathleen delivered Chesner naturally, after a pregnancy that was reportedly free of complications.The mum-of-four, whose previous babies were much smaller, said Chesner would be her last.

The Sudanese national had fallen through the warehouse roof while fleeing immigration officers after coming to thee UK to escape persecution in his home country.On the first day of his inquest at Gwent Coroneraposs Court in Newport, the jurors were told they will be asked to decide the facts that contributed to Mr Dawoodaposs death.The court heard he was of the Zaghawa tribe from the Darfur region of western Sudan - a non-Arabic people who often face persecution from local Arab militia groups. Coroner Caroline Saunders said: Mustafa was finding living in Sudan increasingly dficult, and he was regularly stopped by the authorities - he eventually found the situation intolerable such that he decided to leave.  Ms Saunders told the jury Mr Dawoodaposs asylum claim had been refused, adding: Mustafaaposs asylum status and the actions of the authorities are outside the scope of this inquest. She said the jury would have to decidethe visit from immigration officers complied with rules and procedures and,there were any iations, whether this was a reasonable cause of action. Ms Saunders added: In the event there were any facts that contributed to Mustafaaposs death, it will be up to you to determine what they were. The officers arrived at the car wash in Albany Street at .am on the day of Mr Dawoodaposs death. The jury was shown CCTV footage of him being pursued through buildings on Albany Trading Estate. A few minutes later he was found on the floor of a warehouse with fatal head injuries. He was taken to University Hospital of Wales in Cardf but was pronounced dead at .pm. Mr Dawoodaposs mother Hameda Hamed Shogar Ahmed, who was in court having travelled from the Sudanese city of Al Fashir, told the court her son had been constantly stopped by authorities in his home country.  She said in a statement: Mustafa was very close to me and his dad and he loved his siblings very much, he loved football and he was a good and loyal friend. It affectedvery much when they heard he had died - this is a testimony as to the strength of his friendships. She said Mr Dawood had worked with his father as a lorry driver but was often stopped and sometimes imprisoned.there is so much killing every day, so many young people are killed or disappeared - thataposs why our young men have to flee to avoid the same destiny, Mrs Ahmed said. Giving live evidence through an interpreter, she added:felt a strong passion for human rights and felt that everyone should be protected and free to live their lives free from persecution and fear.  Mustafa would call me often and tell me that he was doing all right - he reassured me that everything was OK and that he was working hard to learn English and was playing football with his friends during his free time. One thing that everyone remembers about Mustafa was that he had a passion for football and his nickname was Casillas, after the Spanish goalkeeper, and he played goalkeeper for our local football team. He told me he had made lots of friends in the UK - he was popular wherever he went so this did not surprise me. Mrs Ahmed said her son had wanted to earn money to send back to Sudan to support his family. I never want this to happen to any other family, to have their child taken away. I and my family pray that Mustafa is in paradise, she said. My son was not a thief or a murderer, he was just a young person asking for safety. I want to understand what happened on June  . The inquest continues and is due to last a week.

Sarah Marie Hall, reader in human geography at Manchester University, looked at how austerity had affected people’s decisions to start a family. She chose to interview  people living in the North East of England – a region that has some of the lowest birth rates in the UK – and a place that has been damaged by austerity. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox. for the free Mirror newsletterHer work revealed the questions and insecurities people are trying to cope with at the present time. Hall discovered that the extensive and deep effects of austerity were often sufficient to curb people’s plans to have children. Their feelings had been changed about what their future might hold, and caused greater ­insecurity about their fitness to raise a family and concern about the ­pressures involved. Most people want to have children but more than that they want to be able to give their children a good le without having to scrimp and save. And like any would-be parents, they need to feel ready to have a child with material assets in place. That means being able to afford decent housing, childcare, and having a steady income before feeling able to start a family. There’s no doubt austerity measures and government cuts in spending have made people’s futures less certain. And for some people, because of ongoing financial concerns and worries, they’ve taken away the possibility of having children – or ­additional ones. Governments have been slow to recognise that austerity policies not only affect people’s ­decision making directly, but that they ­ultimately shape people’s entire lives – with those on the lowest incomes typically hit the hardest. With the added uncertainties inflicted by the ongoing pandemic, along with the fact poor young people have been the hardest hit by the effects of Covid-, Hall believes this may well be a trend that continues for some time to come.Comment MORE ON Financial crisisStarting a familyChildcare\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The mum-of-one had got her final wish for an assisted death at an organisation in ­Switzerland, where she released a fatal dose of ­barbiturates into her bloodstream.Her tearful last words to the emotional pals and medical staff at her bedside were simply: “Thank you, thank you everyone.” The sick -year-old had spent her last years fighting for the right to die, in the hope that one day the UK may enact assisted dying laws of its own.Facing a daily battle with a litany of incurable health problems, including severe arthritis, repeated brain bleeds and epilepsy, Dawn was determined to end her le on her own terms before the quality of her le, which she described as “at times unbearable”, deteriorated further. And she invited the Mirror to cover her journey to show people on all sides of the debate the realities of an assisted death. The former mental health worker described her existence as an “endless, often dficult, and usually painful, daily management of several, incurable issues”. But without suffering a terminal illness, her decision to die is hard for some to understand. Dawn said: “People often tell me, ‘Oh you look fine, you look young, you’ve got a bit of a limp.’ “But they don’t know what’s really going on inside me, the pain and the dficulties. “The daily management of my ailments and my injuries.”  Her story comes as campaigners mark World Right to Die Day across the globe. Assisting suicide is punishable by up to  years in prison in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. But prosecutors will decide whether it is in the public interest to take anyone to court. For Dawn, who lived alone in Sevenoaks, Kent, with decreasing mobility, the law also pushed her to end her le earlier while she was still fit to travel.  She added: “Part of me wants to go on campaigning, but the rational part of me knows that this could lead to not even being able to travel. I am going before I want to, but this will never get better, it will get worse.” Proposals for an assisted dying law brought by Baroness Meacher would only be available to those with less than six months to live. It last week passed its second reading in the Lords and progressed to the Committee stage for the first time in seven years. But it still has several stages to clear. And Dawn believed this model is too restrictive and has instead called for an evidence-based Parliamentary inquiry into assisted dying. It was her hope that the UK will build a model like Canada, where those with a grievous and irremediable condition can also apply for an assisted death.  Opponents of assisted dying fear any legalisation will push disabled and elderly people into ending their lives early out of fear of becoming a care burden. But Dawn hoped by sharing her journey she can show that rigorous safeguards can be in place to stop abuse. She added: “I would like to dispel all the myths around assisted dying, that people could be coerced. That it’s against God. I would just like people to know it is a dignied choice. It gives people dignity. It gives people peace that they can do it and they have this offer. It gives you autonomy. “And it enables people whose quality of le is low and can’t get better to take control of themselves and their lives.“Why must people suffer  Why is it acceptable  We wouldn’t let our pets suffer or animals suffer.” The children’s writer, who lived in Penzance, Cornwall, before ing to Kent, first began considering an assisted death in . She made her application to the Lecircle clinic in Basel two years ago. The application process required her to submit her medical history, explain her reasons for wanting an assisted death and to prove she was mentally competent. And once in Switzerland she was assessed by two separate doctors before being taken to the clinic, where up to two people end their lives each week. Unlike the better-known Dignitas, where patients drink a lethal cocktail of medication, Lecircle sets an IV drip which recipients operate themselves. Inside the clinic, in an industrial area which backs onto woodland outside the city, Dawn signed her own death ­certicate. She hugged her friends, fellow campaigners Alex Pandolfo and Miranda Tuckett, before a nurse ­positioned her bed in front of the window to look out at the trees. She said: “It’s beautul here surrounded by the trees. I think it must be the most beautul place to die.”  Lecircle’s president, Dr Erika Preisig, then asked Dawn four final questions on camera. Q: What is your name  A: Dawn Voice-Cooper. Q: What is your date of birth  A: th June . Q: Can you tell me why you came here to Lecircle  A: I want an assisted death because the quality of my le is not good and it will get worse. Q: We have set an intravenous needle. Dawn do you know what is going to happenyou open this profusion  A: Yes the drug will go into my body and I will go into a deep sleep and then I will die. Dr Preisig then said: “If this is your last wish you can open the profusion.” Listening to Nick Drake’s Day is Done, with her friends holding her hands, Dawn then released a valve on the IV. Following a police report, which takes place after every assisted death at Lecircle, her body will be cremated and her ashes scattered by Dr Preisig. Alex, who has early onset ­Alzheimer’s and will also die at Lecircle before he deteriorates, said: “It was one of the most beautul and loving deaths I have witnessed in contrast to the unacceptable and prolonged tortured deaths of my beloved mum and dad and the death my Alzheimer’s may bring to me. “Dawn’s story and experience of both pain and then peace through the support of Lecircle will be used as I continue to ask for an evidenced based parliamentary inquiry into humane voluntary assisted dying in the UK. “I live in peace knowing that when it’s my time to die comes I can rest in the arms of Dr Erika Preisig at the start of my journey into the unknown.” Figures show up to one Brit a week travels to Switzerland to end their le – a journey which costs around £, and can leave family members at risk of ­prosecution for helping a loved one. Assisted dying is legal in a number of places across the world, including the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, eleven US jurisdictions, Canada and parts of Australia. New Zealand and Spain have passed legislation which is set to come into force this year. Campaigners say it’s high time that Britain ends its blanket ban on assisted dying, but there is strong opposition, amid fears a new law could lead vulnerable people to feel pressure to end their lives. Christian charity CARE fears that “giving assent to assisted suicide would undermine the caring ethic which underpins our medical profession”. The group also believes there is a “huge risk” that changing the law would see patients who already face challenges in accessing good palliative care “reluctantly opting for an assisted death when they would have preferred to live”. Following a debate in the Lords last week, Nola Leach, CEO of CARE, said: “We believe that giving assent to assisted suicide would undermine the caring ethic which underpins our medical profession and society at large. “Introducing such a regime would integrate into our culture the belief that certain lives are no longer worth living, and would legitimise the involvement of doctors, society’s preservers of le, in the procurement of death. “This debate is not just about personal freedom for the dying, who of course deserve our sympathy and concern it is about giving medical practitioners the legal power to facilitate the ending of another person’s le and the societal implications of such a move. “Whilst for some the bill may be perceived as granting choice, marginalised groups are concerned that it will lead to others seeing the option as a duty to end their lives.” There is also a debate around who should qualy under any law change. The House of Lords bill brought by chair of Dignity in Dying Baroness Meacher would be limited to mentally competent, terminally ill adults with six months to live. However Dawn, who was a long term member of campaign group My Death, My Decision, believed this legislation is too restrictive. MDMD chair Trevor Moore said: “Dawn’s story also highlights the critical need for politicians not to lock those with incurable suffering outside of efforts to change the law on assisted dying. “As a longstanding member, campaigner, and friend of My Death, My Decision we are glad that Dawn has finally been able to find peace. “But we urge lawmakers to ensure that she is the last case of someone forced to leave their home in the UK in order to do so. Now is the moment to change the law on assisted dying.” Comment MORE ON Mental healthArthritisPoliticsAssisted suicide\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Using seven environmental indicators, local authorities have been ranked across the country on their commitment to going green. Figures include data on how often people walk or cycle, carbon emissions per person, and how much the local council spends on the environment. The analysis, published by In Your Area, shows London’s Tower Hamlet is the greenest of England’s  local authorities. The area has the lowest carbon emissions in the country, with each person living there responsible for . tonnes of CO - half the national average of ..  It also ranked number one for energy-efficient homes, with . per cent of houses in Tower Hamlets rated as efficient, almost twice the national average of . per cent. England’s renewable energy capital, Selby in North Yorkshire, was the second greenest. Another London local authority, Hackney, came third, thanks to spending the highest amount on the environment. Hacknet spends £. per person on the environment, more than triple the England average of £.. Of the ten greenest local authorities, six of them are in London.  The Isles of Scilly scored highest for the percentage of adults who walk or cycle at least five times a week, and on how easy it was for residents to access green space. Rochford in Essex, was best for recycling, reusing and composting household waste. Meanwhile, Bolsover in Derbyshire was the least eco-friendly place in England according to the ratings. As well as receiving poor scores on most ratings, it had the second-highest carbon emissions per person. Only Eden in Cumbria, which was the second worst rated area, had higher carbon emissions per person.  All of the least-green areas were located in the North of England, with Sevenoaks in Kent being the worst rated local authority in the South, ranking  of . The data used was taken from government sources, including the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The City of London was excluded from the rankings due to its low population, while carbon emissions from industry, travel, business and agriculture were not counted towards an area’s total to reduce the impact of major roads and factories on the rankings.

The Duchess of Cambridge wore a Eponine coat dress as she and Wills attended the Earthshot reception in Glasgow tonight. Pairing the £, gown with navy heels, she walked alongside the Duke of Cambridge for their arrival at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. Kate and William joined Prince Charles, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall and Boris Johnson as well as key members of the Sustainable Markets Initiative and the Winners and Finalists of the first Earthshot Prize Awards.In a rare public expression of emotion, the Queen, speaking in a pre-recorded video message, said it was a source of great pride the important role he played in encouraging people to look after the natural world, and she could not be more proud of the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge who have continued his work. Acknowledging her own mortality, the Queen, whose health has caused concern after she decided not to attend the Glasgow conference when advised by doctors to rest, said not all would benefit from the leadersapos actions as none of us will live forever. Earlier today, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were described as a real inspiration to Scouts whom they joined in a workshop about how to lead a greener le.William and Kate made vegetarian burgers, repaired bicycles, and helped to re-wild a grassy bank with the boys at Alexandra Park in Dennistoun, Glasgow, while world leaders met at Cop nearby. The workshop was part of the international Promise To The Planet campaign, which aims to teach  million Scouts how to lead more environmentally friendly lives. Both sporting red poppies on their lapels, the royal couple had travelled to Scotland by train and were driven to the park in an electric Jaguar I-Pace, where they met  members of the th Glasgow Scout Group.  Kate, , who is joint president of the Scouts, jokingly threatened to slap her husbandaposs face with her dirty gloves as they made wildflower seed-bombs with the youngsters. While making vegetarian burgers with the boys, William askedthey had ever tried one before and whether they liked them more than meat burgers. Meanwhile, Kate, wearing a Scout neckerchief with a khaki gilet and black trousers, helped to prepare ingredients and asked the boys: Do you get enough veg at school   The couple helped the youngsters tighten bike brakes and fix loose handlebars before joining the children mixing flour, soil and wildflowers into seed-bombs, which they threw at a grassy bank to encourage natural growth. Taking advice from one Scout about re-wilding, William, who wore a navy jumper and trousers, told him: Youaposve done this a few times before, havenapost you  Youaposre doing well. Youaposre leading us very well. Eddie OaposRourke, who supports Scout groups in Glasgow and Lanarkshire as district commissioner, described the royal couple as a real inspiration to the boys. He said: They were a real inspiration to all the Scouts who are working hard to make changes to protect the planet. The royal couple also met -year-old Cop ambassador Lewis Howe, who is among  Scouts who have been selected by the Government to showcase how ordinary people are taking action to combat climate change. Lewis, from the st Laurencekirk Scouts in Aberdeenshire, has been challenging Scottish schools to cut food waste by using surplus stock to provide meals for vulnerable people. He said: I have been inspired by my Scouts leaders and the amazing actions of my fellow Scouts. Kate is the first woman to hold the role of president of the Scouts, which she shares with Prince Edward, the Duke of Kent.

The couple met and chatted to some of the Scouts and learned about the new campaign at the Alexandra Park Sports Hub in the Dennistoun area of Glasgow - the city where the COP climate change summit is taking place. The pair were dressed casually for the visit, with Kate wearing slim black trousers, a black rollneck jumper and a gilet. She also wore a Scouts woggle and neckerchief due to her role as joint president of the Scouts Association. William was dressed in navy and they both sported poppies.During their visit they learned how Scouts around the world have been raising awareness of climate change and doing their bit to address it.They also cooked veggie burgers, learned about sustainable transport and joined the youngsters in scattering wildflower seed bombs. Scout Leader Eddie OaposRourke said: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge met Scouts taking part in our Promise To The Planet Planet campaign. They were a real inspiration to all the Scouts that are working hard to make changes to protect the planet.

It’s great to see The Duke and Duchess to work with our young people and recognise that everyone is capable of helping and everyone’s effort is important in the fight against climate change.” The Scoutsapos Promise to the Planet initiative, will see them spend million hours per month on planet saving activities. William and Kateaposs visit comes ahead of them attending a reception this evening, where they will meet with the winners and finalists of the inaugural Earthshot Prize. The initiative, set up by William, aims to find solutions to the planetaposs environmental problems and overcome the pessimism felt by many on its future.Earlier today, William marked the start of the COP summit by sending a rare personal tweet from the official Duke and Duchess of Cambridge Twitter account. He wrote: #COP is a landmark moment for the future of our planet — I’m proud that our @EarthshotPrize Finalists will be joining me in Glasgow to show the world that there is reason to be optimistic. I’m hopeful about what can be achieved. William signed off the tweet W, showing it was a personal message. Later, William and Kate will also join Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall at a reception for world leaders. The Queen had been due to attend too but pulled out following her stay in hospital almost two weeks ago. Instead, she has recorded a video message for the event.Meanwhile, earlier today, Prince Charles attended the COP opening ceremony, where he also gave a speech addressing delegates.He told the conference in Glasgow: The scale and scope of the threat we face call for a global, systems-level solution based on radically transforming our current fossil fuel-based economy to one that is genuinely renewable and sustainable. So ladies and gentlemen my plea today is for countries to come together to create the environment that enables every sector of industry to take the action required. We know this will take trillions, not billions, of dollars. We also know that countries, many of whom are burdened by growing levels of debt, simply cannot afford to aposgo greenapos. Concluding his speech, he added: I can only urge you, as the worldaposs decision-makers, to find practical ways of overcoming dferences so we can all get down to work, together, to rescue this precious planet and save the threatened future of our young people.

On the left hand side of Ombersley Road in Bevere, Worcester, drivers are told not to exceed mph, but on the opposite carriageway they are ordered to keep to mph.The mix-up has left drivers confused and seeking clarity.Grace Taylor, , said: Itaposs completely stupid. On one side of the road you can go at mph while leaving you have to stick to mph. The council need to make up their minds. The mph and mph road markings are even next to each other.Surely someone would have noticed when they were painted An already very busy road has been made more confusing.My Sat Nav almost had a nervous breakdown when I drove to see my mum in one direction but had to slow right down on the way out. The stretch of road had been mph between Green Lane and Claines roundabout until it was reduced to mph after a new housing estate was built.Despite this change, only one side of the road had its mph markings painted over, creating a confusing situation for motorists.The roadworks were carried out by contractors last Thursday on behalf of Bellway Homes which has a development along Ombersley Road.Councillor Mel Allcott said: It has caused confusion especially with the new housing estates which is why they changed limit.I would advise people to stick to the mph speed limit until Perrins Way because that is what all the signs used to say.We had a nasty accident before near the farm shop and it is a road where people should drive carefully.I think the contractor based it on previous speed limit but the mph section was extended a couple of years ago.It is a bit of an unusual one because the houses donapost back onto the road so Highways didnapost have to lower the limit but did it out of good will.I have spoken to a Highways officer and they are aware as well.Worcestershire County Council said it would launch an investigation into the oversight.A council spokesman said: The work was undertaken by Bellway Homes, who are the developer responsible for the new housing development on that road.We are investigating any errors and will request that these are corrected as soon as possible.Comment MORE ON Sat-navHousingWorcester Council\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Big Mac - inarguably the most iconic McDonaldaposs burger - requires .kg of CO to be pumped into the atmosphere during its production, a carbon footprint calculator shows. That is the equivalent of driving . miles in an average UK petrol car. Its younger sibling, the Double Big Mac, is responsible for the dumping the same amount of CO as a . mile journey, the analysis suggests.Millions of tonnes of CO are released into the atmosphere by humans every day in a process which traps heat and has led global temperatures to increase at an unprecedented rate.If the world population does not control its carbon emissions, a disaster scenario of environmental collapse, unbearable heatwaves and climate driven conflicts could be just decades away. The analysis attempts to show how much of an impact on the environment  of the most iconic McDonaldaposs menu items have.These figures are worked out by putting ingredients and their weights through a carbon calculator called Plate up for the Planet.It is run by the Vegan Society in conjunction with Planet Friendly Food, two organisations that argue moving away from meat based diets will have a positive impact on the environment. An important part of the calculation is where the product was sourced, due to the emissions produced transporting food from the field to plate. The Big Mac, for example, is a global burger, with a gherkin from Turkey, lettuce from Holland or France, beef from Ireland or UK, and mayonnaise made in Lancashire, among other ingredients.  By far the biggest CO emitters in the Big Mac are the beef patties, which weigh g and emit .kg CO. In contrast, the McPlant - McDonaldaposs latest UK burger made from pea protein - requires just .kg of CO to be released in the production of its patty. These figures are not official but calculations based on publicly available information provided by McDonaldaposs and other sources. Its worth noting that dferent carbon calculators produce dferent figures, due to the dficulty in working out the emissions released by the many steps of the food production process.For example, campaign group Less Meat Less Heat has calculated that one Big Mac has the same carbon footprint as using an electric hand dryer  times, watching  hours of TV, and drinking  cappuccinos. What is clear is that the items with the most meat produce the most CO, due to inefficient nature of rearing animals compared to growing plants.Beef generate  kilograms of greenhouse gas emissions per kilogram of meat produced - dozens of times more than grown produce like nuts, apples and potatoes. McDonaldaposs was asked to provide its own carbon emission calculations, but it declined.

Alicia Reid, , was allegedly snapped at Glasgow airport two days before the official October half term despite reportedly telling colleagues she had been “pinged” as a close contact of someone infected with Covid. Widely viewed video footage appeared on social media site Snapchat captioned: “Miss Reid is that you  It looks so much like her.”Ms Reid is now set to be replaced by an acting rector at Stranraer Academy in Dumfries and Galloway while education chiefs carry out a probe, according to the Daily Record. The local council’s director of skills, education and learning, Dr Gillian Brydson, said: “Miss Reid will not be in school for a period of time. An acting ­headteacher is due to be appointed as soon as possible.”  It is understood Reid had been due to work on the last two days of term before the two-week school break began on October . But it is claimed she called colleagues to say she would not be at school because she had been notied she had come into close contact with someone who had tested positive for Covid- and would have to self-isolate at home. However, she was allegedly filmed at Glasgow Airport later that day, on October , masked and queuing at a check-in desk for a holiday flight. The dad of the pupil who made the recording said: “There were two flights to Turkey around the same time on the Thursday night. We were on one and she was on the other. “My daughter was really shocked to see her headteacher there. I heard her say, “It’s Miss Reid. What is she doing here  She started filming and posted the images to let her friends see. We had no idea of the effect it would have because we didn’t know the teacher was supposed to be off self-isolating.” A spokesman for Dumfries and Galloway Council – who advise parents not to take unauthorised holidays during term time, said: “We do not comment on matters related to inidual staff. “Good progress in learning continues to be the priority for the school community of Stranraer Academy and we will provide leadership and support to the school management team.” The school did not comment when contacted by The Mirror and directed us to the council.

The vitamin is naturally gained from sunlight, but staying indoors can lead to a deficiency and the winter months are also an issue. The majority of the population will get enough vitamin D through exposure to sunlight and a healthy, balanced diet.But between October and early March mean we do not make enough vitamin D from sunlight, so need to get it from our diet, the NHS says.CoventryLive reports that one sign of lack of vitamin D is head sweats, which are an “early sign” of the deficiency. It is estimated that around % of adults may have low vitamin D status, and there are several main risk factors for vitamin D deficiency.  As far as diet is concerned vitamin D is available in foods such as oily fish, cod liver oil, red meat, fortied cereals, fortied spreads and egg yolks. In some countries milk is not fortied with vitamin D but this is not the case in the UK. As such, dairy products contain only small amounts of vitamin D. A lack of sunlight exposure, darker skin, being housebound, malabsorption, and being pregnant or breastfeeding are risk factors according to the NHS. Symptoms can include muscle aches and weakness, waddling gait, chronic widespread pain or bone pain in lower back, pelvis and foot.Health food retailer Holland  Barrett says % of the vitamin D in our bodies needs to come from getting out in the sunlight and only  percent is from our diet, Thereports. It says: “Evenyou eat fortied foods, you could be at risk of vitamin D deficiency. Symptoms of low vitamin D y from person to person.” The website also lists a number of other signs to be mindful of. Falling short of the required amount could weaken immune defences, butlow levels are left untreated, discomfort may also arise. Over-supplementation of vitamin D, however, can also be harmful and should be avoided.  The NHS says taking too many vitamin D supplements over a prolonged period can cause too much calcium to build up in the body which can weaken the bones and damage the kidneys and the heart. However people cannot overdose on vitamin D through exposure to sunlight.Vitamin D has been linked positively to coronavirus -gtcoronavirus, but the NHS says reports about it reducing the risk of coronavirus are not backed by enough evidence to know whether this is the case.“There is currently not enough evidence to support taking vitamin D solely to prevent or treat Covid-,” the Express says. In April , the NHS issued a statement, based on recommendations from Public Health England , that we should all consider taking  mcg a day of vitamin D as a supplement, to keep our bones and muscles healthy.  This advice was issued largely because of the restrictions imposed by quarantine and lockdown. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should ask their midwe or health visitor for information around vitamin D intake. If you or someone you care for is in a higher risk group they may need to take vitamin D supplements. Vitamin D supplements are widely in pharmacies, other high street stores and supermarkets and can be taken in tablet, liquid or spray form.

The charity has said it is treatable and curable, “especiallydiagnosed early”. The number of people dying of bowel cancer has been falling since the s as early diagnosis has become more likely and access to effective treatment has improved. Cancer Research UK has flagged a number of potential signs of the cancer, many of which may show up when you go to the toilet. Blood in your poo, or a change in your normal bowel habit, can be a symptom in both men and women.  A change in bowel movements could mean looser poo, pooing more often or constipation. Another sign could be a lump in your back passage or tummy, or feeling you need to strain your pack passage asyou need to poo - even after youaposve opened your bowels. According to Bowel Cancer UK, you may also feel as though youaposre not able to fully empty your bowels While blood in poo can be a warning sign of bowel cancer, it is often due to other causes, the Express reports. Cancer Research says: “See your GPyou are worried about any symptoms that you think could be caused by cancer in the bowel.” Your doctor wonapost think you are wasting their time,” the charity continued. Other conditions that could bring about these symptoms include piles or inflammatory bowel disease. According to figures from Bowel Cancer UK, more than , people are diagnosed with bowel cancer every year in the UK. It says that one in  men and one in  women will be diagnosed with bowel cancer over the course of their letime.While the exact cause of the cancer is not known, there are several things that can increase your chances of getting it.  According to the NHS, smoking is one habit that can increase your risk. It is also more common in overweight or obese people, the health body added, as with in those who have had another condition - such as extensive ulcerative colitis or Crohnaposs disease in the colon  for more than  years. Everyone aged  to  who is registered with a GP and lives in England should automatically be sent a bowel cancer screening home test kit every two years.Treatments for bowel cancer will y depending on what form of the cancer a person has, how advanced it is and where it is. The bowel is a very long organ that goes from the end of the small bowel to the anus. Most bowel cancer is diagnosed in the rectum, which is just above the anus. At its most simple, you could have surgery to take away the affected bowel and then you’d go back to normal. As bowel cancer progresses it becomes more dficult to deal with, and is treated by chemotherapy or radiotherapy.Sometimes this is before surgery, sometimes after. This would depend on whether the cancer has spread at all.

The Grade II listed building in the seaside area of Shrublands Road, Mistley, Essex, was built in  during the Cold War. It was originally designed to serve as the communications aposhubapos of the county in the event of an attack. Now, it has been carefully restored and converted into a series of luxury apartments - one four-bed and two three-beds. Developers at BuildVantage have created the homes over two floors, centred around a beautul light-filled atrium. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. All three still have the original reinforced doors and walls made from military-grade tank steel and protected by thick reinforced concrete walls, and one of the properties even features an original ventilation system housed behind a glass wall. The homes have a luxurious feel with Italian marble bathrooms, granite worktops and underfloor heating.  And each apartment comes with its own off-road parking and enclosed garden.The properties are a stoneaposs throw from the historic village of Mistley and its train station, which has direct links to London Liverpool Street.Mistley offers ious local shops, a popular restaurant and train station whilst the walk to Manningtree will take you along the picturesque River Stour and lead you into the town centre where you can discover ious local shops, eateries and other amenities. The properties were originally listed inidually with prices starting at £, but are now being sold together at auction. The auction, through Allsop, will take place on  November.Property agent Max Turner from Savills in Ipswich said: Effortlessly stylish, the developers have found the perfect balance of combining modern-day luxury with restored original features to create an extraordinary transformation. It’s a truly unique development – connecting the past and present in a landmark building that’s part of the area’s heritage and which will of course make a great talking point when friends and family visit. We’ve already received a lot of very positive feedback and people are obviously interested in the bunker’s history, but it also ticks a lot of the boxes that buyers are continuing to look for – tucked away on the edge of the village with plenty of access to outdoor space, yet within a short distance of shops, restaurants and the nearby station.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

So along with fellow Yale student Sam Teicher, he co-founded Coral Vita - an organisation based in the Bahamas that creates high-tech coral farms to grow and restore damaged coral reefs.Last month, Coral Vita was among one of the inaugural winners of the Earthshot Prize awards - an initiative set up by Prince William to find solutions to climate change and other environmental problems.Today, William will be at the Cop climate change summit in Glasgow along with the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Charles and will meet some of the winners and finalists of the Earthshot Prize .And for Gator, he believes that the world needs more leaders like William willing to speak up and bring the climate change crisis to the fore. He told the Mirror: I think itaposs very clear that climate destabilisation and environmental issues are affecting every corner of our planet. They are the most important issues to address as they affect all of the other social issues we care so deeply about. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. Without solving the climate crisis, thereaposs no way we can properly solve all of the other issues we care about. So for a leader like Prince William to spend his time, his energy and his influence in order to elevate that conversation is an incredible step in moving towards real tangible change in this space, and we need more leaders and politicians from the likes of Prince William to corporate leaders and other politicians around the world to step up and take this issue as serious as it needs to be taking, no longer paying lip service to what we are going to do with climate change goals we set at Cop but really making impactful and urgent changes to the systems we need to. We do understand the solutions and understand the problems, and know the steps we need to take but to date, there has not been the political will to address climate change at a meaningful level and in my opinion it is incredible that Prince William has been at the forefront of this and has elevated this issue out on the Earthshot stage and we need more leaders like him to play a leading role as well. Although Gator himself has not travelled to Glasgow for Cop, his co-founder Sam has and he will be attending talks and seminars on climate change - specically those that focus on the oceans and coral reefs.But Gator, a huge Liverpool FC fan, will still be keeping an eye on what is happening at the conference and says that we all must hold world leaders to account in order to force them to keep the promises they make there. He explained: I donapost think the commitments that countries make at events like Cop are the solution, we need to ensure that those commitments are both followed through on and expanded upon where successful. Too often these Cops have happened and politicians and leaders have used it as a  to say very progressive things that look like they are making progressive actions that later fall by the wayside and are never really followed upon. There are no mechanisms to hold anybody accountable for meeting any of those goals so I think itaposs very important for us to set ambitious goals at meetings like Cop, but it is even more important for us to hold our politicians accountable to meet those goals because to date it has been used as greenwashing far too often.  Indeed, itaposs fair to say that coral reefs, something that the Coral Vita team care deeply about, are at a critical point. Gator explained that half of the worldaposs reefs are already dead, with scientists projecting that primarily due to climate change and warming and acidying ocean conditions, over  per cent of the worldaposs reefs will die by . He said: In its own right, this is an ecological tragedy as coral reefs are one of the most magical ecosystems on earth. They cover less than one per cent of the earthaposs floor but they actually have a quarter of all marine le inside of them so they are one of the most bioerse habitats. But as well as being a serious ecological tragedy, it is also a serious socio-economic issue for up to a billion people around the world whose livelihoods directly depend upon coral reefs. At Coral Vita, Gator, Sam and the team are trying to restore these damaged reefs through the process of reef restoration.  Gator explained: We create innovative, high tech coral farms, which are on land, where we circulate a bunch of seawater through aquarium tanks. In those tanks we take small fragments of corals that have broken off the reef naturally, bring them into our coral farm, and we can grow them in mass. Right now our farm in the Bahamas grows around , corals a year that we have planted, but we aim with this Earthshot Prize to expand our work here towards , corals and eventually we envision having a global network of farms, each of which can grow millions of corals to distribute around restoration projects in a particular island or country. We want to accelerate coral, grow a much wider ersity and boost the resiliency of the corals against warming and the growing acidity of oceans that threaten their survival. At last monthaposs Earthshot Prize awards, both Gator and Sam couldnapost contain their delight when their organisation was named the winner of the protect our oceans category, scooping a £million prize.  And Gator said: To find out that we had won was truly the highest honour of our lives. It was an overwhelming experience where we were filled with such gratitude and pride in what weaposve done as a Coral Vita team but for all of the supporters who have enabled us to get to where we are today. It was a very special moment to speak with both Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge. They were both kind enough to spend a few minutes on a zoom call with us and the other winners and it was an incredibly special day all around to say that we even got the chance to meet and speak with the Duke of Cambridge. We are just so grateful for the vision that he has shown in creating this award, which we feel can be very inspirational in the climate crisis movement as there is a lot of doom and gloom and fear. It is is very much warranted in my eyes when we talk about the issues of climate destabilisation, and thataposs part of it that needs to be discussed, but the other end of it, what I think Prince William has done an amazing job doing, is showing the hope and optimism and the solutions and ways that we can make a dference in solving the issues that we are all so worried about. I completely agree that there is a lot to be grateful for, human beings are incredibly innovative and adaptive to quickly adapt to conditions and while the future will likely never look like the past, we can create a thriving future where humans and society are in balance with nature. But we must act urgently to do so, otherwise that balance will be skewed further and further away from thriving bioerse eco-systems that are essential for the true magic of le on earth. So there is optimism but the optimism needs to be coupled with urgency because every year we continue to not act on these climate commitments, and not make substantial changes, the outcomes that we are fighting so hard to create will be less and less positive. We know what we have to do, we know how to do it and we can be hopeful we can get it done, but we need to act as soon as we can in order to make the changes necessary.

Emily Webster, , suffers from agonising and debilitating pain and said her whole le started crashing down when she began to feel violently ill in . She was forced to take nine months off work and has spent three of the last five years in hospital. Emily has missed the last four Christmases and has seen the walls of a hospital more than her own home. She was initially told by doctors that she IBS, a common condition which causes indigestion. But it turned out to be a rare incurable condition called Gastroparesis which affects just six percent of people in the UK.  The condition causes Emily to vomit as her stomach cannot naturally empty itself of food as it is in partial paralysis.Emily, from Leeds, told LeedsLive : “I had my le taken away from me.“The past five years have been so dficult and lonely, but the worst part has been missing every single occasion of every year. “I missed four Christmases, I missed my best friend’s wedding, my best friend having a baby. “The surgery would make my le better, and it would improve the quality of my le. “I felt like I was in a never-ending cycle where I was told there was no cure and there was nothing anyone could do. Thankfully, she was handed a leline after she was told she would be a good candidate for a gastric pacemaker. The device would regulate her stomach and improve her le dramatically - but it’s not offered by the NHS and costs a staggering £,.She said: “But this is a chance. It would be incredible, even just that. “I’m planning all the things I want to do, the people I want to see.” She added: “If all goes well I should recover in time for the Christmas holidays. “It would be the best Christmas present I could ever get.”  When Emily went to her GP in , they asked her what her symptoms were and touched my tummy and told her to see a dietician. But the former bank worker said she could not go a day without feeling physical pain or vomiting - and would be sick up to  times a day. She saw her weight plummet, and at one stage tipped the scales at just five stone - the average weight of a -year-old girl.  Emily said: “It was so dficult, I was just sick every day. I went misdiagnosed for so long. “I spent most of the time in bed not being able to do anything. I kept losing weight as well. “I remember being so scared and worried how I would cope in le, even financially.” Despite her condition deteriorating, tests were unable to explain Emily’s condition and it was suggested her symptoms were caused by mental health issues. Emily was admitted to the national inpatient centre for psychological medicine at St James Hospital in  where she underwent therapy. She said: “I knew in my heart there was something wrong, but I felt so helpless because the tests were showing I was fine. “Sothere was nothing, I started telling myself maybe it’s true that it’s my own doing. “That’s when I started struggling with mental health, because I was spending so much time in hospital.  “I couldn’t work, I lost my house. My whole le came crashing down, and I felt so helpless.” But she finally had a breakthrough in , when a staff member at the hospital noticed her vomit was undigested and tests revealed she had the rare condition. She said it was the biggest relief to know she had not imagined all the pain over the last few years. The pacemaker is considered successfulit improves her condition by  percent, but Emily said she’d be happy with any improvement. She struggled with suicidal thoughts towards the end of her time in hospital, and said she was proud of herself and the journey she had taken.  She said: “It’s considered a successit improves the situation by  percent, but any improvement I would be happy with. “It would make my le better, and it would improve the quality of my le. The last five years have just blurred because so much has happened. “It’s been so lonely and scary and even terrying and heart-breaking at times. “I didn’t think I would be here now, so I’m proud of myself to have made it. I can’t believe I now have a glimmer of hope.”You can donate to Emily’s fundraiserhere .Comment MORE ON NHSHospitalsMarriageMental healthTherapy\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

After the accident, she spent two weeks in an induced coma and her family and boyfriend were not able to visit regularly due to the pandemicSummer Diaz in Hawaii in September  before her accident happened Image: Jam PressByLaura AbernethyGraeme Murray:,  Nov | commentsA woman woke up with a strong New Zealand accent after being in a coma for two weeks. Summer Diaz, , was hit by an SUV as she crossed a road on November  last year, which caused her to develop foreign accent syndrome - a rare condition where damage to the brain makes someone speak dferently. “I don’t remember anything about that day,” said the -year-old from Los Angeles, Calornia. “I came home from my job working with children who have autism. I didn’t have a parking space at my apartment so I had parked where and was walking across the street. “I don’t know what happened but apparently I was halfway across the crosswalk and I was hit by the SUV.” The driver called for help and Summer was rushed to the nearest hospital, where they discovered she had suffered a host of injuries including a broken pelvis, broken shoulder and a brain injury. After the accident on November  last year, she spent two weeks in an induced coma and as it was during the pandemic, her family and boyfriend weren’t even able to visit regularly. When she woke up, she was very disoriented and confused. She said: “I could hear people saying ‘you’re at the hospital, Summer.’ “They asked me to say the alphabet and I knew quite a bit of sign language, so I signed it. I could not speak vocally when I woke up. “I was able to do the whole thing and the staff actually asked my parentsI was deaf because of the sign language. My parents said no but I did know how to sign from taking classes in university. As Summer slowly started to talk again, one of the things she picked up on was changes to the way she was speaking but initially thought it was just due to being intubated while she was in a coma. She said: “I pulled out my tubes when I woke up causing some damage. Due to this I also have a condition called dysphagia, making swallowing dficult. “I remember trying to speak to people and my voice sounded dferent. “Then my boyfriend got special permission to visit me and he has an accent as he is from England. “He was talking to me and I felt like I was enunciating quite a bit and that it sounded dferent, but he said he couldn’t quite hear it. “Then I went to rehab and my voice started to get a bit better. I was working with speech therapists but I was still speaking quite slowly, so it was hard to hear anything. “As my voice got stronger people started to hear the accent more.” As Summer was talking more and more, people would question where she was from as she didn’t have an American accent. She said: “My nurses would come in and say ‘where are you from ’ and wouldn’t believe me when I said ‘I’m from here.’ “I would explain I was born here but they would say ‘but you have an accent.apos “I had to explain that it wasn’t my accent and I just started doing it.” Throughout her recovery, Summer has gone through a range of accents, with some lasting just a few hours and others staying for months. She said: “I had a very British accent, close to my boyfriend’s for a while. I had a French one at one point and briefly, I was Russian. “At the minute, it’s settled on an Australian or New Zealand accent.”  Summer has never even been to Australia or New Zealand but frequently people assume she was born or grew up there. She said: “I went back to the fire station to meet the people who brought me to hospital the other day and give them cake. “I saw the fire chief and I could tell on the phone he had an accent, but when I met him, he said ‘is that an Australian or New Zealand accent ’ “I explained it was New Zealand but he asked where I was from and I had to say I’m from here and he laughed. One thing that was hard for me was figuring out how to answer back when people ask about the accent. Do I go with where they think I am from or tell them the truth and get into talking about a whole incident with a stranger  Although it is a little unusual, Summer actually really loves having foreign accent syndrome. She said: “If I get hit by a car but get to the keep the accent, I’m ok with that - thataposs the best part. Thataposs fun. “I was always texting my friends telling them I really want to keep it because I really like accents.” After spending around a month in hospital and rehab, Summer was well enough tohome and was able to go back to university to finish the four classes required to complete her degree in psychology, while continuing with outpatient treatment.  This allowed her to access the university library to research more about her condition, which helped her officially get a diagnosis with an MRI on  August . There isn’t much treatment available and for some people, it does eventually go away but Summer is happy to wait and see what happens. Now, almost a year on from the accident, Summer’s accent is still far from what it was like before and her traumatic brain injury has caused a permanent disability. She said: Iaposm exhausted often. I am left with a lelong disability. I cannot work long hours at work, my stamina is poor, and I cannot do simple everyday activities. I rely on a cane when my leg aches and a wheelchair for long distances or for areas where I would have to be standing for a long period of time. I have a caregiver that helps me with my regular household chores and meal prepping. Every task requires energy andI am too exhausted I cannot perform some tasks later on in the day or the next day. Certain things will improve over time but other things will remain the same. As well as the physical side of her injury, the accent has had an impact on her work caring for children with autism. She said: I often pronounce my name as sum-mah and sometimes they hear it as So-Mah. I have had kids be confusedmy accent switches the next day, so much to the point where they have asked where the other Summer went as they donapost quite understand my condition. Learning how to navigate with a disability in the workplace has been a bit tricky for me. While this has had many downsides, it has caused my health to be more of a priority to me. I almost died so I try to enjoy the things I want to enjoy and be kind to others. I appreciate art and books more and enjoy the company of my loved ones more. I see the accent and what happened as something that will always be a conversation starter and a story to tell.

Logan Hunter shared a video of the spooky discovery on TikTok, leaving hundreds of thousands of viewers baffled. The man, from the United States, filmed himself removing a light switch cap to examine the wooden wall behind it. In doing so, Logan realised the plywood had been installed poorly. In the clip, he said: I literally think I just discovered a hidden room in my apartment. I realised that this wall is really wobbly [and] thereaposs nothing behind it. So I’m going to take it apart and see what we can find. Then, as he removed part of the wall, he found a set of stairs leading to the ceiling of the house. But at some point, Logan paused the video, leaving viewers feeling curious, before filming another clip to reveal what he discovered. As he made his way up the stairs, he said they were kind of nice and sturdier than I thought theyaposd be. Upstairs, there was nothing to see other than huge piles of dust, but going further up he discovered what he described as a cute room.  The space was empty with two boarded-up windows. On the floor, there was an old dusty bandana and a bucket of woodchips. In the clip, Logan - who rents his house but does not have any flatmates - said: Why would they have this closed off  You can even stand up. This is such a cute room. Wait, maybe the floor is not safe.  While he said he wanted to make the space liveable, some people warned him of potential dangers such as unstable flooring and asbestos. One viewer commented: Landlord probably didnapost want to invest in making it livable. So, closed it off. Another added: Youaposre really brave because I would not be going up there at night, but Iaposm glad it turned out so cool! One joked: I was waiting for the demon in the corner to push you back down the stairs. But another suggested: Please decorate it and make it look nice, it would be so cute. Some viewers also encouraged Logan to make a series of videos showing how he renovates the newly discovered space.

Pavement chalk is designed to wash away in the rain, but one person has been left so annoyed at the sight of the temporary drawings outside their flat that they contacted the building management.Ashley Woodfolk, from New York, USA, took to Twitter @AshWrites to share her story after she allowed her son to draw with pavement chalk in their building’s courtyard, and was met with resistance from one of her neighbours.And after building management listened to the neighbour’s complaints and stopped the use of chalk outside the property, the mum hit back – by writing a note to her disgruntled neighbour in chalk across the courtyard.

A picture of the note was shared on Twitter, which reads: “Good evening to everyone except the woman at my co-op who complained to the board about me and my toddler using sidewalk chalk in the courtyard. “So I wrote her a little letter. In sidewalk chalk. In the courtyard.” In the letter, Ashley explained using the pavement chalk had brought her toddler “joy” amid the COVID- pandemic, as she’s wary of taking her son to public places. She continued to say: “This will be my last time using sidewalk chalk in the courtyard since it seems to be such a problem for you . “Iaposm sorry such harmless fun that brought my toddler joycauses you so much distress that you have to complain to the board and waste everyoneaposs time when our building has much bigger real problems. “I think youaposre aware that weaposre in a pandemic and while Iaposd love to take my kid to museums and the movies, I donapost feel doing that, and sometimes even local parks are more crowded than Iaposm comfortable with.“The courtyard was a safe space but now there are limits on that too. “There are only a few weeks of nice weather left, and I sincerely hope that you enjoy the use of the sidewalk-chalk free courtyard for the remainder of the fall. And I hope that every time it rains, rain that would have washed away any colourful ABCaposs I wrote on the ground, you think of me.” Ashley’s post has received more than , likes and many people can’t believe the cheek of the mum’s neighbour. One person said: “I very much applaud your response to a ridiculous prohibition of your child’s creativity.” While another wrote: “Before I became disabled, I would hop every single chalk hopscotch that I came across.

The -year-old, who originally hails from the United States, moved to Aberdeen in Scotland for university, and decided to download the app in a bid to meet new people. But, despite having to much interest from potential matches, the journalism student confessed she was very apospickyapos over who she swiped right to, so she didnapost actually end up getting many matches. I set my Tinder account up in my last year of high school just to see what would happen but I didnapost use it much and only went on one date. Then when I got to uni people were using it a lot more - everyone had it, Eliana explained. I wanted to seeI could meet someone and it was a way of meeting people to make friends as well because I was completely new, Iaposd never been to Scotland before. However, she was left stunned when she was contacted out of the blue in  and told she was in the top  aposswiped rightapos people on Tinder in the UK and Ireland that year - making her in the top  women within this. When the ranking was published, along with a link to Elianaaposs Tinder profile, this rocketed even more to where , people were swiping right on her in a week. The summer after my first year of university a magazine contacted me about the top  swiped right people on Tinder that year. At first I thought it was a scam email because I thought thereaposs no way out of all the amazing, beautul people in the UK that Iaposm in the top  - it was definitely an ego boost, she recalled. I was shocked as I didnapost have too many matches because Iaposm quite picky and I only really spoke to and met up with two guys, but it was based on how many people swiped you. Iaposve never seen myself as someone who is extremely attractive or interesting enough for people to swipe right on. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. But despite this, things never worked out or lasted more than two dates with anyone she met on the app, as she says most singletons seemed only interested in a aposquick hook-upapos. Eliana said: My goal was not one night stands like it is for a lot of people and some of my friends, but to meet people and establish connections. Thereaposs two sides of the app - thereaposs the side trying to meet up with people for a quick hook up and then never talk to them again and then thereaposs the other side of people genuinely looking to meet someone and that side is much smaller. There were so many people that contacted me that I didnapost end up going on dates with because they would use a bad pick-up line or there just wasnapost an instant connection. I got asked to be a sugar baby a few times and some people outright askedI wanted to come over and have sex, it was really creepy.  One of the guys I met up with from Tinder clearly was just there because he thought he had a chance of hooking up later and he even got his phone out to show me his other matches and was saying how fit they were. She has since abandoned online dating, saying meeting people in person aposworks  times betterapos and is  months deep in a happy relationship with her boyfriend, Jordan Benson, , who she met through mutual friends. Eliana said: We met through mutual friends - we were under Covid restrictions at the time but you were allowed six people in a house so I said to my friend you bring two friends over and Iaposll have two friends here. The first one and a half months of knowing each other we were just friends and met up as a group and then it blossomed into something more. I think the best romances come from friendship and establishing connections in person works  times better for me because you find out who they are and see what theyaposre like. You donapost have that awkwardness of knowing youaposre meeting someone to try and be together and the fear of going on a first date. Elianaaposs boyfriend Jordan said: We definitely clicked well as friends at first and after being friends for a while I just started to feel more of a romantic connection and she did too but we didnapost say anything for a while. I donapost like dating apps. I donapost like the idea of looking for people online as youaposd look for clothing. Iaposve never used them.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

The cat lives in the district of Sungurlu in the northern Turkish province of Corum, where local residents keep him well fed and provide water every day. Local cobbler Ahmet Koylu said: I know this cat has not left the roof for at least four years. Even the efforts of local fire brigades were all in vain. Bazaar shopkeepers bring it food and water. Along with normal cat food, we also leave liver, chicken and fish. He comes for it after we leave. When the cat is out of food, he calls down to us like he is begging.  Koylu added: The cataposs story is very well known around here. He has refused to come down from the roof for anyone including firefighters from the area, and has become a local attraction. Other residents said they have been trying to get the animal off the roof for a long time, but he runs away as soon as he sees someone. Tea shop owner Muttalip Yavuz, who also helps to feed the feline, said: The cat jumped there from an opposite roof two or three years before the pandemic and we cannot get it off the roof to this day.  He really does not like people. He decided to stay away from everyone and live on the roof on its own. Yavuz added: The fire brigade have come three or four times to rescue it from the roof, but with no luck. As a result, shopkeepers around here decided the best option was to put food and drink on the roof.

Neighbours of the property in Kyzyl, the capital of Russia’s mountainous Tyva republic, heard terrible screams as the girls fell - several minutes apart - in the early hours of the morning.

He was described as being on the run from police over a car theft. He had fled from court and was on Russia’s federal wanted list. A neighbour called Irina heard the terrible screams as the girls were thrown out. I woke up from a slammed balcony door and terrible screams,” she said. “While I was trying to figure out what was happening, literally a minute passed, there was a strong roar, terrible screams, and then everything subsided for three or four minutes. “Then it happened again… “I was alone at home with my children.” Irena said she didn’t stick her head out, but instead called the police. The Russian Investigative Committee confirmed the  year old had been detained for two months.

We will see somewhere in the region of  world leaders in Glasgow next month for the COP climate change conference, and that will occupy the front pages for its duration.However, itrsquos clear that the scale of action needed in the face of catastrophic climate change requires strong collective leadership at every level. Where better to begin than education to relay the message of how urgently our behaviours need to change.With that in mind, Scotlandrsquos colleges are providing leadership on a strong collective front. Not only do they need to be the messengers, but they also need to pay attention to the message, with shts in their own working models and practices.Many colleges in Scotland have been working on this steadily. Following the Paris agreement at COP in , colleges have been making good progress in reducing carbon emissions. In fact, since reporting began in  . The sector has achieved an overall % reduction in emissions. This is better progress than the whole of the public sector, which has reduced by % over the same period.Clearly % is impressive but there is work to be done towards achieving the Scottish Government reporting expectations, and the sectorrsquos own statement of commitment, to achieve Net Zero climate emissions by  or earlier.Bringing together the current thinking and setting out a joint agenda, College Development Networkrsquos Climate Emergency Expert Group hosted the inaugural College Climate Change Conference, earlier this month.Held online with representatives of the college expert group and partners, it gave a strategic overview of the climate change actions that the college sector should be engaged in.It follows the development of the Scottish Colleges Statement on the Climate Emergency, which lists  key actions that colleges have committed to delivering.ldquoThe college sectorrsquos role in this is going to be huge, says Jim Metcalfe, Chief Executive of College Development Network . ldquoWe have a role to make sure that our own institutions, campuses, and staff and student travel is Net Zero. We have a role to provide the skills to ensure the economy can reform itself to be Net Zero ndash how we teach and train and develop people. And we have a role in how to influence change in our communities ndash we are crucial anchor institutions across the country that can influence the way our regional economies can change for the better..removeSkills development is something that is absolutely crucial in the contribution of colleges. The vocational courses that many offer, those that have an impact on our everyday lives will clearly need to change in line with green technologies as well as manufacturing and building practices.ldquoTo achieve Net Zero wersquoll need new green jobs, which in turn means wersquoll need to ensure we have people with the right skills to take up those jobs, says Dr Mike Cantlay OBE, Chair of the Scottish Funding Council.Providing an idea of scale, at the conference he pointed out that one change, the sht to electric vehicles, will require , people to be trained or retrained to support the new technology.ldquoThat means we have huge reskilling and upskilling tasks ahead of us. Through initiatives such as the National Transition Training Fund, colleges are already providing great opportunities for reskilling and upskilling ndash and these examples demonstrate the responsive-ness and agility of the college sector. But our success will rely on our ability to inspire future learners to consider these new career options, and I commend the work of colleges in this crucial task.Its clear that colleges are playing a crucial part in our rapidly changing landscape and as Angela Cox, Principal and CEO of Borders College, explained at the conference, colleges, perhaps more than ever are acting as catalysts of change.Also a lead Principal on the Climate Emergency within the College Principals Group, Angela Cox details some of the changes happening at Borders College.ldquoAll students at Borders college will complete a carbon literacy module at the start of their programme but this is only a small part of their development, she explains. ldquoHowever, that needs to be brought to le in their subject learning. A small but good example is a project with Bordersrsquo hairdressing students looking at the choice of dye products ndash synthetic versus organic and what happens when the waste product including peroxide is rinsed and flows into the water system.Angela Cox points to projects that are initiated by students, and through creating employer partnerships are also powerful catalysts for change. An example is a former Borders College plumbing student who invented a device to stop water leaks immediately while the fault was found. His company Kibosh now operates globally.She says, ldquoWe are also sharing our carbon literacy module with our schools and housing associations and supporting the delivery through a train the trainer approach. Over time this means that students progressing to the college already have the basics and our projects become more innovative and collaborative through our community partnerships.Angela Cox adds, ldquoColleges are in a unique and privileged position to take a leading role in achieving Net Zero. We have the power to influence the behaviours and values of our students, staff and communities. I am proud that Borders College is seizing the opportunity to help secure a sustainable future for the Scottish Borders and beyond.College staff and students have spent a considerable amount of time creating this new culture for colleges, where the consideration of climate impact isnrsquot a tick box but goes to the heart of everything they do.In November  Dundee and Angus College was invited to take part in the pilot of the College Learning for Sustainability Champions course, run by EAUC and Learning for Sustainability Scotland.Christine Calder, Academic Development Lead at the College explained at the conference how important it was for Dundee and Angus to be involved.ldquoOne lecturer from each of our  curricular departments attended the course. This gave us a real opportunity to know who a friend of sustainability was in each department.  lecturers, working with an average of  students. Thatrsquos  people directly affected. Thenwe add in the conversations that have happened in those studentsrsquo homes and with friends or the conversations that the lecturers had within their departments let alone their friends and families as well as students in other classes. Thatrsquos the ripple effect.Dr Katie Paget, Science Lecturer and Learning and Teaching Skills Mentor at Dundee and Angus College was one of the lecturers who was part of the pilot for the science team. She says, ldquoIn many ways the pandemic has brought the themes within the UNrsquos Sustainable Development Goalsinto the limelight, and this gives us a powerful opportunity.ldquoThis academic year we have embedded the SDGs into our Lecturer Professionalism Pathway. Within the course lecturers can reflect on, and share ways that they can embed such themes within their teaching and have the opportunity to try out ideas in a supportive environment.ldquoOur hope is that by weaving these into our curriculum with new lecturers during their early career, linking SDGs in their classrooms can become a foundation within their teaching, and not an extra.Its clear that the sector has put time and effort into creating a climate change strategy with clear goals and is working with a greater shared purpose than ever before.ldquoThe sector is now focused on operationalising those actions and achieving against that statement of commitment, on campuses and in teaching across the country as a sector, adds Jim Metcalfe, Chief Executive of CDN. ldquoIrsquom hopeful and aspirational about this agenda. ____________________________________________________________________Roadmap outlines path towards Net Zero futureWORKING towards the same ends takes collective knowledge and purpose. To that end a Climate Action Roadmap for colleges has been developed by the Climate Commission for UK Higher and Further Education, to support colleges at all stages of their progress towards Net Zero.The roadmap was developed closely with college leaders, students, and partners to ensure that it was relevant to every college, no matter what stage it hasreached on its sustainability journey.Itrsquos a tool that can be a useful gap analysis, to show where you are doing well, but identy where improvements are required. The roadmap alsofactors in cost and time commitments for each action, which helps in that planning.It covers all areas of the college, so you look at distinct areas in detail, such as leadership and governance, teaching and learning, estates and partnerships, and engagement.The Climate Action Roadmap illustrates clearly what an emerging college could look like. It helps colleges to tailor actions to match strategy. This is seen as an opportunity, in advance of COP to show how Scottish colleges are leading the way on climate change.From the date that every college commits to the roadmap, it has a full year to develop targets and show how those will be implemented.Workshops to develop the roadmap were carried out in June, attended by staff, and partners of Scotlandrsquos colleges. Billy Currie, Head of Corporate Services at Dumfries  Galloway College attended those workshops and says he could identy benefits for reviewing climate change plans immediately.Some colleges across the sector havebeen working in this area this since . Billy believes that one of the roadmaprsquos great strengths is its flexibility, where it can strengthen and consolidate the work that has already been done.At the College Climate Change Conference he explained, ldquoAt Dumfries  Galloway we carried out something of a progress review. We have used the Colleges get to work on key climate actions roadmap to reflect on our previous climate change action plan, to see where we could identy successes.ldquoWe could identy elements such as using renewable technologies in new builds, looking at our electric fleet vehicles, and identying partners for our student transport. We also have an established waste network with zerowaste goals for going to landfill.Billy Currie adds that an area that they could strengthen was governance. ldquoWe had already taken steps at Dumfries  Galloway in terms of setting our targets and annual reporting, both to the board and the cross-college Climate Action Group.ldquoBy using the roadmap we were able to declare a climate emergency, signed by the Principal, the Board Chair, and the Studentsrsquo Association President. ldquoThe declaration document commits the college to taking continued action on climate change matters. ldquoClimate change is now embedded into our systems and infrastructure strategies. We also have key performance indicators measuring what wersquore doing year on year ndash these are monitored by the Board, senior leadership and the climate action group.Billy Currie adds that working on awareness among staff and students, particularly in subject areas, is crucial to achieving the sustainable development goals.ldquoClimate change action is embedded at Dumfries  Galloway College, and we now have a revised plan, which is more focused because of the roadmap. As well as identying the key areas where we need to make changes, we can look at not only the college itself but how we fit in to the wider plan, regionally and nationally."},{"url":null,"title":"eyemouth-man-involved-two-domestic-bust-ups-borders","story":"A MAN involved in two domestic bust-ups within the space of a month has been ordered to carry out  hours of unpaid work at Jedburgh Sherf Court.Aleksandrs Kravcovs, , was abusive to the woman at a party in Eyemouth on Christmas Eve and then followed it up by assaulting her a month later.Describing the first incident Depute fiscal Alison Atkins said: \"The accused attended at the locus with a number of people on the evening of Christmas Eve.\"People were consuming alcohol and in good spirits.\"However as the evening progressed the accused became aggressive and wanted to go home and take his young daughter with him.:lsquoMajor incidentrsquo stood down but number of roads still lsquoaffectedrsquo by flooding\"A witness and his partner both said this was not a good idea due to his level of intoxication.\"This caused the accused to become even more aggressive and was shouting and swearing in an aggressive manner.\"He was prevented from entering the daughters bedroom and the police were contacted.\"In January the fish processing factory worker got involved in another argument with his partner which escalated and resulted in him slapping her face and seizing hold of her by her arms.Ms Atkins said: \"She was knocked to the ground.

Id spoken with him a few times and he said Melrose has connections in Jamaica and Scotland.\"I wasnt too aware that there was a Melrose in Jamaica, but he said Melrose in the Borders is a lovely place to visit.\"Although she knows of no direct connection to the town ndash \"I think my mother told me it was my sister who chose the name, I dont know where she got it from,\" ndash Melroseand Jamaica have a shared history.The local National Trust of Scotland attraction, Harmony House, will be known to many in the region.The house was built in  by Robert Waugh.Melrose said visiting Harmony House was a \"seminal moment\" in her trip, not only because of the link between Waugh and her name, but also how he profited from her ancestors..removeIn the s Waugh used the profits he brought back with him from Jamaica, where he owned lime and pimento plantations ndash named Melrose and Mount Nelson ndash and slaves, to build his home in the Borders and the nearby chain bridge.Waugh was also financially compensated when slavery was abolished.\"He had built this house out of profits made from my ancestors in Jamaica,\" said Dr Stewart.She added: \"But all in all, in such a short period, the couple of hours we spent there [Melrose], there was just so much to capture about my history and for me it was well worth a visit.\"Dr Stewart explained that she has been able to look back on her history up to the late s.\"Its very dficult as a black person to begin to trace your ancestry because names changed, there was lots of cruelty and all the things going on in terms of how iniduals were treated.\"And this is the sort of history ndash which is painful for all of us from Jamaica because I really dont know where my journey started. It was probably the west coast of Africa. Im not sure who bought my ancestors, how they arrived ndash its just something I started touching the tip of the iceberg really.\"As October marks Black History Month in the UK, Dr Stewart hopes that by addressing the connections we all have to slavery and Britains colonising history, we can have more open and honest conversations about race.She said: \"I think everyone needs to know their history ndash I wasnt taught it at school ndash I knew nothing about my name and its connections with Scotland when I was growing up as a child in England.\"I came here when I was  so all of my secondary schooling was done here and so all of the history I have learnt has been me finding out for myself.\"And obviously things have moved on a bit since then ndash not much.\"I dont think people really know how to manage it [discussions on slavery].\"Because of the sensitivities, people probably think, I didnt do it, its the people that went before me that did that.\"We need to have those sorts of discussions because you might not be personally responsible, but it helps explain in depth why were in the position we are in now.\"The last  months during the coronavirus pandemic have been marked with a number of events where the topic of race has been very prevalent ndash namely the death of George Floyd in America in March , which sparked worldwide Black Lives Matter protests.In the UK this brought about conversations on how we view commemorative statues, plaques and other memorabilia to figures known to have profited from the slave trade.Some call for the figures to be removed from their literalpedestals.The statue of Edward Colston, a slave trader, was famously toppled and thrown into Bristol Harbour in June last year and a statue of Winston Churchill in London was also defaced last year.But others feel the statues could remainmore is done to make their connections to slavery clearer.\"We hope that by learning about the past we dont repeat these atrocities in the future,\" said Dr Stewart.\"We just want history to be told as it was.\"\"We can make it [learning about the slave trade] really interesting for children in schools.\"There are lots of interesting ways in which the curriculum can be changed, and should be changed, the narrative made factual from dferent perspectives.\"Especially in places like Melrose where they probably can even connect with a school in Melrose in Jamaica.\"Making connections is something I would strongly encourage, for children to have the conversation so they can share stories.\"You can imagine how dferent the children in Melrose in Scotland are from the children in Melrose in Jamaica ndash yet theres this strong connection.\""},{"url":null,"title":"ticket-sales-going-well-borders-book-festival","story":"TICKETS for this yearrsquos Baillie Gford Borders Book Festival are selling well with a number of shows already sold out and people are being advised to book early to avoid disappointment.The popular annual event which normally takes place in June at Harmony House in Melrose is being held at Abbotsford House between  -  November.A host of famous names are appearing including Alexander McCall Smith, Ian Rankin, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Hilary Mantel, winner of the th Walter Scott Prize for Historical Fiction for her book The Mirror and the Light.Also attending are crime writer Val McDermid, former politician Ed Balls, Labour MP Ed Miliband, rugby star Gavin Hastings, and travel writer Michael Palin.Discussions during the festival will also include Jonathan Dimbleby on how Hitler lost the war, political journalist Robert Peston on his new thriller The Whistleblower and Pat Nevin on his autobiography The Accidental Footballer.Festival Director Alistair Moffat told us: ldquoIrsquom really looking forward to it now.

followed an impersonal ldquotick list and felt more ldquorushed.ndash Patients and medics both said that video and phone consultations were worse than face-to-face appointments in terms of ldquoaccuracy of assessment.ndash But more than six out of  patients and doctors said telemedicine was ldquomore convenient, citing reduced waiting times, no travelling, and safety from infection as the main advantages.ndash Some doctors said that NHS technology was ldquoembarrassingly primitive for delivering telemedicine, though others cited improvements which were implemented as a result of

Look out for the third and final piece in next week#s paper.Wartime needs created additional traffic and pressures for the two main operators, thereafter, once into peacetime, West Coast Motors and its rival were able to modernise their fleets.McConnachie#s stole a march by bringing Kintyre#s first double decker to the town in , buying two more in the late s which older residents may still remember. However, failing general economics resulted in West Coast acquiring this business in . These #deckers never ran for West Coast and it would be more than  years later before such buses entered their fleet.Liveries iniably provide a recognisable identity for any bus operator and West Coast is no exception. The flowering of the company#s one surely came to its climax in the s with the flowing combination of ivory, red and maroon, set off by polished body trim lines and wheel embellishers. Styles continue to evolve but, in the opinion of this writer, no other Scottish operator has chosen a more distinctive colour scheme than West Coast which still uses two of those principal colours, ivory and red, which it bestowed on its buses  years earlier.During the s and s, West Coast#s modern vehicles were typical examples of their time. In the latter period, new bus grants were obtainable under certain conditions resulting in some splendid coaches being purchased.In post war years, the company gradually built on its service network in Kintyre and Mid Argyll. In , it picked up the East Loch – West Loch Tarbert mail ship link from Tarbert-based Dickies then the Tarbert – Kilberry service from McEacherns in , the Lochgilphead Tayvallich service from McLachans in  and, perhaps somewhat prophetically, the Benderloch-based operations of McColls in .Without doubt, the most signicant developments in West Coast#s history occurred in the - period. During the s, William Craig had attempted to introduce a direct Campbeltown to Glasgow service but failed in this ambition then and at later attempts. Finally, in , these hopes were realised when the company became a joint operator, with Scottish Citylink, of the through service between the two locations.The s continued to see signicant developments. Firstly the acquisition, also in , of the buses and Mid Argyll routes operated by Lochgilphead-based Stag Garage. This was followed, a year later, by the purchase of the old MacBrayne garage in Ardrishaig, giving West Coast an excellent base in the area.The early s saw a further involvement in Oban when West Coast secured responsibility for the Oban to Glasgow service and by  it had acquired the former Alexanders depot in Oban enabling it to build further on its already signicant presence in Argyll.Since , the rate of change has quickened further. West Coast secured the Cowal and Bute area contracts and depots in  and when Bowmans, the long-established Mull services operator retired in , West Coast added this to its portfolio. Their Oban base allows vehicle and manpower deployments on Mullneeded. Of the major Argyll islands, only Islay remains independently served by the Mundell concern of Tarbert, whose lorries are also a familiar sight in the county."},{"url":null,"title":"arkell takes dunaverty golf clubs october medal","story":"Lee Mathieson, first man out, took full advantage of the conditions to record the lowest gross score of the day.He completed the first nine in  strokes which included three birdies and one bogey.Despite having a double bogey at the th and a bogey at the th, two birdies on the way back helped him to  strokes.Donald MacNeil was next best, concluding his round in  strokes, having had two bogies on the front and back nines.James Finlay, out in the sixth group, set a nett target of  for those following him to chase.Match secretary Alex Arkell responded in exemplary fashion by not only posting the third lowest gross score of  but also taking the lead from James with a winning nett .Result:  Alex Arkell -

with  minutes played, after a long-range effort arced beyond Ferguson into his top right-hand corner, after nicking off a Pupils defender.Then, on  minutes, the sixth and final Rossvale goal was scored after Ferguson#s save from a striker#s shot rebounded off the post and into the path of a grateful Rossvale winger, who slotted into the net from point-blank range.Overall, the Pupils can reflect on a respectable cup performance,not a giant-killing, against an established semi-professional outfit, especially with an injury-ravaged squad, as the Kintyre Park club adapts to its busiest fixture schedule in its years in amateur football, with  competitive matches already played by mid-October.Despite the heavy defeat for the Pupils on the field, one notable footnote to the game was the presence of former Tarbert AFC and Pupils player Reverend John McGregor, who is club chaplain for Rossvale, having performed the same role at Dumbarton FC in previous years.After the match, he met and chatted with the Pupils management and the current Pupils squad#s Tarbert contingent, Lewis McNaughton and Rhys Casci.Tomorrow, Saturday, the Pupils are back on league duty, travelling to Paisley to play St Peter#s FC.

Let#s Go! presenter Ramsay MacMahon provides his #ultimate guide# to Scottish staycations.#If lockdown and travel restrictions have taught us anything, they have given us a renewed appreciation of the benefits of getting away from it all,# said Ramsay.#Whether it#s a long journey or just a short drive away, it#s revitalising to leave the familiar behind to de-stress and re-connect with ourselves.#The mental health benefits to being awe-inspired by spectacular Scottish landscapes or thrilled by the adrenaline rush of high-speed or challenging outdoor activities, are manold, as researched by Visit Scotland in January this year.#It is this escapism, getting away from the humdrum and weekly grind, that is adventurer Ramsay#s secret to a happy le.For him, planning an unforgettable trip away at the weekend is what gets him through Monday to Friday and prevents him from feeling penned in by his own surroundings.With each of the eight episodes exploring a dferent area in Scotland, the series is brimming with ideas for a re-energising and restoring Scottish getaway.In South Kintyre, which features in the show#s seventh episode on December , Ramsay visits Saddell Bay where Paul McCartney filmed the pop video for the Wings hit Mull of Kintyre.An advocate for Scottish local produce, Ramsay enjoys smoked fish in Campbeltown and learns how to make whisky cocktails on the shores just outside the town.He stays the night on Davaar during his two-day visit to the area. After carefully choosing his time to cross the pebbled causeway, he has some special accommodation lined up in a former wartime signal station.Exploring the island, Ramsay picks his own cockles for dinner and discovers the island#s famous cave featuring an iconic painting on its walls.The other locations visited are Crinan and Kilmartin, North Mull and Ardnamurchan, Skye, Aberdeenshire, Stirlingshire, the Black Isle and the Cairngorms.Throughout the series, Ramsay sees and does it all – from giving a rhino a mud bath in Stirlingshire to visiting the ruined Slains Castle, where Bram Stoker was inspired to write Dracula, in Aberdeenshire.He also walks to Skye#s iconic pinnacle, the Old Man of Stòrr, which is featured in countless Hollywood movies, and drives to the summit of one of Scotland#s highest public roads, the Lecht, in the Cairngorms.In the Crinan and Kilmartin episode, Ramsay explores the area by bike, starting his journey at the Crinan basin. He helps out at the boatyard before following the famous Crinan Canal by bike.Turning off the canal, he heads to Knapdale to find out about Argyll#s newest arrivals – beavers – before going inland to Kilmartin Glen where he visits the ancient fortress of Dunadd and the ancient burial cairns further up the glen.There#s plenty of humour and quirky accommodation in the series including stays in a refurbished Naval helicopter near Stirling and in a shepherd#s hut next door to an organic brewery in the Black Isle.Ever in search of adrenaline, Ramsay also abseils down  metre high clfs in Skye, windsurfs on Aberdeenshire#s coastline and rides cross-country on a Segway.Mach a Seo! Let’s Go! begins on Thursday, November , at pm on BBC ALBA and each episode is available on the BBC iPlayer for  days afterwards."},{"url":null,"title":"late late show as pupils cruelly lose out","story":"Campbeltown Pupils were left to rue the loss of another late goal last Saturday after an th-minute strike resigned the Kintyre Park side to a narrow defeat away to St Peter#s.Playing at Renfrew FC#s impressive New Western Park, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils started the match brightly, despite another y injury list which saw several established first-team players ruled out and others unavailable due to work commitments.The Pupils took the lead before the -minute mark when John McCallum, playing at right wing in a --- formation, reacted quickest to Craig Lamont#s long throw-in, which bounced up on the dry synthetic surface, to guide a deft looping header beyond the reach of the St Peter#s keeper.The Kintyre side had efforts from left winger Scott Souden and lone striker Sean Grady go wide of the target – the latter#s promising effort deflected wide of goal – while McCallum was released by Grady and rounded the hosts# keeper only for his cutback to be cleared for a corner, away from the feet of the waiting Souden.At the other end, the Pupils had a new-look combination in defence, with full backs Craig Lamont and Michael McKinlay, and Ross Souden in central defence partnered by -year-old debutant Antonio Akoulli, studying in Scotland and hailing from Thessaloniki, Greece.The four had to be alert to the efforts of St Peter#s wingers Menzies and Lewis on either flank, and did so very well for the opening  minutes until a lapse in concentration saw Scott Lewis – signed from fellow WoSFL side Benburb FC for a transfer fee – ghost along the edge of the box and slot home a fine finish across keeper Alasdair Ferguson with his weaker left foot, into the young keeper’s bottom left-hand corner to make it -.Impressively, the Pupils rebounded from this setback and scored with  minutes played when Liam Renton, playing as an attacking midfielder, latched onto a ball from Scott Souden just inside the hosts# box, and turned his marker sharply before guiding a left-footed shot beyond the keeper#s grasp.All the while, the Pupils# deep-lying midfield pairing – a real contrast of experience levels between skipper Keith Mitchell, and Conner Brown beside him making his club debut – continued to break up play and keep the Feathers Inn-sponsored side moving forward.Despite this, there was a further scare in the visitors# penalty area when St Peter#s hit the bar from a powerful volleyed shot on the stroke of half time, but the Pupils# lead remained intact.Into the second half, though, the Pupils were pegged back in the opening few minutes of proceedings, a clever turn and precise shot beyond the grasp of Ferguson providing a fine equaliser.Admirably from a Pupils point of view, there was no onslaught from the ision#s third-placed team, also boasting a loan signing from Greenock FC, another semi-professional side, in their midfield ranks, and smatterings of semi-pro experience across their starting .However, what followed instead was a gradual build-up of pressure which the Pupils had to work increasingly hard to contain, the home side#s willing forwards continuing to probe for openings in the visitors# defence.The hard-working pair of Matthew Lang and Calum Houston were introduced in attack for the Pupils with  minutes remaining, with fresh legs required as the embattled visitors# energy levels began to wane.But even the dismissal of Lewis for the hosts, hitting out at Renton in reaction to a robust tackle from the latter, which earned the Pupils man a booking, couldn#t deny the Paisley side a late, late winner, a long ball going undefended in the Pupils ranks, and slotted home in the box by a St Peter#s midfielder to give them all three points, and in turn deny the Pupils a probably deserved draw.The Pupils# management team conveyed thanks to the travelling players for their efforts, even in defeat, and will surely take consolation from giving experience to young talent in the side, with four club debuts made in the space of week – after -year-old Andrew Renton#s appearance against Rossvale on cup duty – and within that clutch, a potentially very useful defensive addition.Tomorrow , the Pupils are at home to Glenvale FC, from Paisley, again on league duty, with kick off at pm.For more information, visit @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"leader october 29

The consequences of this decision could be huge.#Tracy explained that the forum, which will hopefully be launched in early November, will have the primary aim of keeping parents and carers updated on all educational matters affecting Argyll and Bute.The forum#s members hope to help parents make their own informed decisions by summarising and bullet-pointing council reports and removing jargon to make it easier for parents to process.#If parents don#t have the information, it#s hard for them to be focused on the issue,# Tracy said.#My concern is not that everyone must think the same way as I do, but that they have the correct information to make up their own minds properly and they don#t agree to something they might later regret.#Parents have got power so they need to make their voices heard.#Argyll and Bute Council#s policy lead for education Councillor Yvonne McNeilly said: #The best outcomes for our young people are at the heart of all our work.#We are a council that listens to our communities and this proactive engagement programme will be at the core of our decision-making.#We very much welcome the views and ideas of our communities and look forward to seeing what their vision is for the future of education services in Argyll and Bute.#To provide the very best for our children and young people we must take positive action to deliver a sustainable education service.

everyonersquos attention. The rest of this waterbirdrsquos body consist of a white chest, silky grey head and a dark grey back. This plumage fades over the autumn and changes into a rather dull combination of white and grey. The spectacular red throat also disappears and turns white, whilst the red eyes appear dark brown. Although the winter plumage is far less spectacular than the summer plumage, I still find this bird attractive.Red-throated er. Image: Zan BlaszczykRed-throated ers are fantastic swimmers they can e up to  feet deep, stay underwater for over a minute and even run on the water during their courtship dance! Although graceful in water, they are not as skilful when it comes to standing or walking on land, as their legs are set too far back on the body, making it challenging to keep the right balance. It is a great adaptation for spending time in water and it does not affect their ability to fly but it makes the birds look clumsy as they come to land.Red-throated ers nest in the north of Scotland, particularly on Shetland, where over a third of the total British population use the Shetland lochs as their breeding grounds. During the winter, the birds start to migrate along the coast.It is not uncommon to see them around the coasts of East Lothian however, they usually appear further out in the open sea and do not hang around for long. What certainly is unusual is to still see them in their summer plumage. Generally, the birds would stay at their breeding grounds until they have finished moulting before starting migration, but this year has been dferent!Red-throated er.

When I heard of the ers in Musselburgh, I took time off work, checked the tides and went out.As I reached the river mouth, the tide started to rise and I spotted my first er. The walk along the seawall produced even more sightings but nothing that would make me stop for longer.Red-throated er.

The bird started swimming slowly towards the river mouth, where it decided to pause to fish. Each time the er disappeared underwater, I was hectically looking left and right in anticipation for it to resurface. My heart was racing so fast like it was about to explode. There were times when the bird resurfaced so close to us that it was impossible to photograph it with our big lenses!I was looking at the er with my eyes and mouth wide open, as I could not believe my luck.

Butart has any use at all, perhaps it provides an outlet for the myriad fantasies that consume our minds, preventing the spread of too much insanity on the planet. In a sense, Anuradha Royrsquos intriguing sixth novel, is about two artistsrsquo constant negotiation between fantasy and reality.Actually, it has two-and-a-half protagonists. Elango is a potter and rickshaw driver in Kummarapet, India. His young apprentice, Sara, is a girl whom he drives to school. Chinna is a stray dog, who wanders through their lives, providing solace to the battered humans. Sara is given first-person narration, but Elangorsquos perspective is offered in the third. Much of the story is set in , although Sara narrates her story when she is a university student in England, years later. These changing perspectives might, at first, seem baffling, but it works. The novelrsquos world becomes clay on the potterrsquos wheel, being viewed from dferent angles in space and time.The big political event of  was the fall of Indira Gandhi. Sara recalls the jubilation in the country at the start of the premiership of Morarji Desai: \"while our parents talked about an end to the brutalities of the Emergency, what interested me and my sister was Mrs Grsquos successor, a humourless old man who drank his own urine as a tonic.\" Sara and her sister sing a song about their new leader: \"Dear Mr Desai, would you like some tea   Oh no, little girls, Irsquod love a glass of pee.\"Rightly, politics is treated with both seriousness and light-heartedness. The religious tension between Hindus and Muslims in India is encapsulated in the secret relationship between Elango, from a Hindu background, and Zohra, a Muslim. When Elango decides to mould a giant terracotta horse, he searches his imagination, through Greek and Indian myths, to find out where the idea came from. He imagines himself \"a potter trapped in an epic of his own, a woman at its centre, two blighted lovers, their union thwarted by warring tribes\".The project takes over his le. He asks Zohrarsquos grandfather, a calligrapher, to inscribe the horse. This turns out to have consequences that reverberate through the years, for better or worse. When he leaves town, the novel subsequently shts more permanently to Sara, and becomes a mini bildungsroman. In England, Sara uses the universityrsquos pottery studio as a place of familiarity in a strange land. The characters in Royrsquos novel are constantly being disoriented in the world, forced to find their place once more.The plot shts again, but Roy never loses control. Her writing can sometimes become a little prosaic, and a few scenes, including one where an old chauvinistic Hindu woman incites a riot, seem forced. Nevertheless, itrsquos worth persevering. Near the end the style improves and the characters take on a sharper focus. Darius, a minor character, is described as having a body that \"has been assembled with more joints than necessary hellip he is liable to trip over his long limbs and fall any minute, like a puppet tangled in his own strings\".Darius is the boyfriend of Sararsquos one friend at university, Karin, who is also caught between dferent cultures. Sara spends a lot of time listening to her friend talk about her le it just confirms her \"ideas about the nature of the cosmos, that itrsquos hell-bent on doing things we can neither anticipate nor prevent\". Growing up, for Sara, is a realisation that our desires are always compromised by that old foe, reality. Itrsquos insights like these that make The Earth Spinner such a lucid and enjoyable novel."},{"url":null,"title":"cop26-glasgow-news-updates-free-herald","story":"Here at The Herald, we have been preparing for the summit for months.

You may not have heard of him, but thousands around the planet have ndash he has travelled the world giving lectures about ETs and ghosts, Nessie and demons, and written a slew of books on weird phenomena.You donrsquot have to believe what Robinson says ndash I certainly donrsquot, Irsquom an atheist and sceptic ndash but hersquos fascinating company, andlike me yoursquore curious about why so many of us obsess on the paranormal then he is the man to talk to. After all, half the planet has probably had at least one odd experience they canrsquot quite explain.I have interviewed a fair number of paranormalists over the years and while I donrsquot buy into their claims at all, Irsquove always thought most truly believed what they are saying. In other words ndash charlatans aside ndash these people seem well intentioned and not deliberately lying, even though their claims are  to many.Someone can be genuinely convinced they have seen a ghost ndash even though there is no such thing as ghosts. I donrsquot view Robinson as a charlatan or a liar ndash I view him as a pretty decent guy who really believes what he says, despite folk like me viewing his claims as fundamentally impossible. Itrsquos a neat little paradox, given wersquore talking about the paranormal.Obviously, millions of people around the world would disagree with me ndash those who believe in ghosts and UFOs ndash and see Robinson as an important researcher in a much-mocked field.Anyway, whether you believe in the paranormal or not, itrsquos Halloween so letrsquos give him a hearing at least.Birth of an obsessionROBINSON says he started out as a sceptic and there are still some signs of healthy scepticism alive in him today. ldquoIrsquod like to impress this upon people, he says.ldquoWe laughed at John Logie Baird and said his invention [television] would never work ndashit did. We laughed at the Wright Brothers, saying lsquoitrsquoll never flyrsquo. Just because something sounds ridiculous doesnrsquot mean it is so. Mankind has much to learn, wersquore at the bottom rung of understanding.ldquoHowever, itrsquos quite right in these times that we question everything, but donrsquot turn your head away just because something sounds ridiculous.As a kid in the s, Robinson was fascinated by science fiction and spooky stories. While working in a glass factory as a young man ndash in between playing lead guitar in a band ndash he began reading about cases of so-called ldquoreal le hauntings and devoured books by Erich von Daniken, who has made outlandish and unsubstantiated claims about aliens visiting Earth.ldquoI started out to disprove these subjects. I thought there was no validity in them ndash that it was all nonsense, Robinson says. ldquoThen I began my own investigations. Irsquove seen things ndash unbelievable things. Thatrsquos when I came off the fence.UFO encounterTHE case which changed Robinsonrsquos le was the infamous incident which has gone down in the annals of ufology as ldquothe Dechmont Woods Encounter. In , Scottish forestry worker Robert Taylor was walking through Dechmont Woods near Livingston when what he described as a ldquoflying dome appeared, hovering over the forest floor. Taylor ndash who everyone claimed was a sober and serious man ndash said something like ldquosea mines emerged from the craft and seized him.He lost consciousness and later awoke, bruised, with this trousers ripped and the craft gone. Taylor tried to drive away but careened his car into a ditch. When he made it home to his we, says Robinson, he said these famous words: ldquoIrsquove been attacked.His we asked who attacked him and Taylor replied: ldquoA spaceship.Taylor received medical treatment ndash as he was genuinely hurt ndash and police were called. What makes the case remarkable is that this is the only alleged UFO incident where police recorded a criminal assault. Officers also found marks on the ground where Taylor said the craft had been.Now, there are plenty of facts that can be found to dismiss any notion of ET in this case. Taylor previously had meningitis and reported a strong smell during the incident. It could have been a mini-stroke or psychotic episode. Taylor is now dead so wersquoll never truly know.But Robinson ndash now the proud owner of Taylorrsquos ripped trousers ndash- believes the case to be a real alien encounter. At the time, the event was big news in Scotland. Robinson heard the story on the radio and went to interview Taylor.ldquoIt stands the test of time as a great case, he says. ldquoYoursquoll never meet a more genuine, sincere man who didnrsquot want any attention in his le. This was my first big investigation though Irsquove done so many since. You get to know peoplersquos body language ndash whorsquos telling lies. I saw the depth of honesty in this man.Robinson went on to write a book about the case. He does retain a sliver of scepticism, however. ldquoI do agree with the statement lsquocould it not have been a medical episodersquo ndash which meant Taylor believed hersquod been attacked. Thatrsquos the only other possibility. Other than that I do believe he saw what he saw that day.After investigating the Dechmont Woods Encounter, people began ldquobanging on my door and phoning me up, says Robinson. And thatrsquos when he began hunting ghosts hellipHaunted housesONE case involved an elderly woman in Stirling who had heard about Robinson, by now the founder of Strange Phenomena Investigations, with a team working alongside him. ldquoJust like with UFOs, I started out to disprove ghosts too, he says. However, once again, Robinson adds, as with his UFO investigations, his experiences turned him into a believer.ldquoThis old lady was getting bombarded with paranormal events, he says. ldquoThings were falling off shelves. Shersquod lost her husband. Chests were moving ndash all that stuff.One of Robinsonrsquos team was a psychic. In an upstairs bedroom, the psychic asked Robinsonhe ldquofelt a spirit in the room.ldquoI felt nothing, Robinson says. Then a lsquoghostrsquo slapped him. ldquoSuddenly, he says, ldquotherersquos this tremendous force, which pushed itself down on my hand ndash my hand actually hit my leg. Nobody was near me. It was incredible.At another case in Tullibody, Robinson was investigating a haunted bedroom. ldquoItrsquos always a haunted bedroom for some reason, he laughs.Nothing happened for hours and Robinson was questioning ldquowhy I do this to myself. One of his team was filming while the room was in darkness. Then out of nowhere, he says, ldquothe whole room illuminated with thousands of tiny pinpricks of light in the air, adding: ldquoIt only lasted  seconds before the room was catapulted back into total darkness.And was there evidence on camera  ldquoNothing. Nothing appeared. Robinson says that evenhersquod captured proof, ldquosceptics wouldrsquove said itrsquos a hoax.Clearly, no evidence has been found ndashanywhere or ever ndash to prove any haunting or alien encounter.Later, during another ghost hunt at Stirling Tolbooth jail, he ldquofelt a kick on the leg. I thought it was one of our investigators, but nobody was near me. I turned around and I can only tell you what I saw: a leg, from the knee down. It was only there for two or three seconds and it disappeared.Robinson is now rattling through his adventures at a rate of knots. ldquoTherersquos another case we were working in Kirkintilloch. It was an ex-police officerrsquos home. Every wall had a photostat copy of the Lordrsquos Prayer on it, there were crucixes everywhere. It was creepy. As wersquore walking into a room upstairs, it was like somebody grabbed my hair and pulled me back. I shouted for one of my colleagues to put the light on. I thought Irsquod walked into a childrsquos mobile or Airfix model or loose plaster, but there was nothing hanging down. It was like fingers going through my hair ndash it was extraordinary.Now, obviously, sceptics like me would say of these cases that perhaps some of the people seeking Robinsonrsquos services were a little disturbed, or that creeping around in a house yoursquove been told is haunted might play tricks on the most logical mind, or that even group hysteria might kick in. Robinson says he asks people who call on him to investigate whether they use drink or drugs or have mental health problems, and he insists he is seasoned enough not to let his imagination run away with him.Hoaxes and liesWHAT about being conned  Many well-intentioned or gullible ldquoghost hunters have been duped by charlatans and Robinson tells of one incident where he witnessed ldquothe most sensational thing Irsquove ever seen.Robinson has taken his investigations all over Britain ndash and this case happened in Chingford, north London. He was invited to a home where a medium sat behind a curtain in a darkened room. Bells tinkled, voices wailed, faces emerged from curtains and a chest of drawers rose up and flew across the ceiling. Robinson says he thought it all a hoax until he placed his hands on the chest of drawers, holding it down, and asked the medium to move it again. Once more it rose and flew through the air. ldquoI cannot stress enough that even though I believe in the paranormal, Irsquom still sceptical about every case I go on, he says.I point out that Irsquom a bit of an amateur student of stage magic and therersquos a history of such tricks played by phoney spiritualists going back to the Victorian period. Therersquos even a trick called The Spirit Cabinet which sounds a little like the event Robinson witnessed.Robinson accepts that ldquotherersquos wonderful magicians who can do wonderful spooky things but itrsquos all a trick. However, he insists that he cannot explain how the chest moved the second time as he held it down. ldquoDo I have evidence  No, the lady whose house it was wouldnrsquot allow cameras.As we talk through his cases, I tell Robinson that when it comes to events where he was present I wonrsquot call him a liar. He seems a genuine man who believes what he thinks he saw and what he thinks happened. However, that doesnrsquot mean those events really involved ghosts. Other explanations are clearly more likely ndash and when it comes to the Chingford event, itrsquos stinks of trickery, I say.ldquoI agree that you have to think that way, yoursquove got to think itrsquos a magic trick. The medium is behind a curtain. Why  Why did he have to do that  It makes you wonder. I couldnrsquot see any form of trickery but there are magicians, so people can be fooled. The phenomena was amazing but there mightrsquove been something there to fool me.However, his scepticism is clearly beaten by his need to believe, as he quickly adds: ldquoWhat happened after that was this tremendous cold gust of wind pervaded a small council bedroom. It was so cold you could see your breath. It was like being in an industrial freezer.Again, thatrsquos not a trick which is hard to pull off. Just ask Derren Brown. But Robinson has another encounter to tell of: the Sauchie Poltergeist.Scotlandrsquos poltergeistROBINSON has been down into the depths of Loch Ness in search of the monster in a mini-sub but therersquos only one thing that really scares him: the ouija board. He believes it can raise malevolent spirits intent on harming humans. Itrsquos a fear which the classic horror movie The Exorcist was built around.Events in  in the town of Sauchie in Clackmannanshire have weird echoes of the film. We donrsquot have to take Robinsonrsquos word for it ndash even though he recently wrote a book about the case and interviewed folk involved in the tale. We can just flick through Alloa Advertiser reports.The claims go like this: -year-old Virginia Campbell moves from Donegal to Scotland with her family. The move makes her unhappy. Strange noises begin to plague her, and one night she goes downstairs to tell her family but a terrying sound follows her. The sounds continue, ornaments move, a linen basket opens by itself.The family see a sideboard move.A local minister is called and is said to witness the linen basket move again. Virginiarsquos bedclothes, says Robinson, ldquowould ripple asa stone had been thrown into water.At school, Virginiarsquos desk lid begins banging up and down and her teacherrsquos pointer moves of its own accord. Then the teacherrsquos desk is said to move and a bowl smash in the class.The teacher, it is claimed, tries to let the children out of the class ndash as by now theyrsquore hysterical ndash but the door wonrsquot open. Later, a doctor is called to attend Virginia and shersquos sedated. The doctoris said to have witnessed Virginiarsquos pillow rotate on the bed. Virginia even moved house but the knockings followed her.In December , the Alloa Journal reported Virginiarsquos aunt being pushed off a bed and blankets rising up of their own accord. Not long afterwards, the story dies down and Virginia vanishes. Nobody knows where she is to this day.Robinson, who spoke to Virginiarsquos classmates for his book The Sauchie Poltergeist, tried to find her and traced her to Bedfordshire in the s but after that the trail goes cold.Robinson doesnrsquot believe that the Sauchie events were a con, or down to a mixed-up, unhappy child acting out, either consciously or subconsciously, or mass hysteria, or ldquoa child going through puberty and sexual energy projecting out and moving things like cupboards. I believe a bad spirit attached itself to her in Ireland and moved to Scotland with her and itrsquos been with her ever since. Therersquos a nasty side to the spirit world.What do you think ROBINSON says he has not made much money out of a letime as a paranormal researcher. Books donrsquot earn a fortune, he adds, and mostly he simply gets his expenses paid for travelling to and from lectures.Proof, he says, ldquois in the eye of the beholder. When it comes to the inidual theyrsquoll know themselves whether what theyrsquove experienced is true. Proof is always nice, but belief is personal. Wersquove seen so many photographs claiming to be ghosts or UFOs that were nothing of the kind.He accepts, though, that with so-called hauntings, creaky floorboards and cooling pipes could lead people to believe in the supernatural.For Robinson, around ldquo per cent or even higher of ghost cases are easily explained and not otherworldly. With UFOs, he says, only about % of sightings cannot be explained as either natural phenomena like planets or military aircraft.However, that %, he genuinely believes, are aliens.As long as folk donrsquot mock Robinson, he says, hersquos perfectly content to be the subject of doubt and questioning. ldquoMy raison drsquoecirctre is just to tell people about these subjects and say lsquothere you go, itrsquos up to you to believe it or notrsquo ndash thatrsquos all.If yoursquove got a paranormal experience yoursquod like to share why not write in and let us know to sunday-letters@theherald"},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive accessas we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive pound for two months offer here.From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expectground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content ndash as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just pound for two monthshere.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as ldquounsatisfactory on pollution, according to data from the ScottishEnvironmentProtection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oilcompanies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as ldquovery poor in .

We had council workers that took on additional and dferent duties and they’ve had no reward.”Responding to the announcement of the strike, an OIC spokeswoman said: “The council was informed in writing by UNISON on Monday afternoon that, following a ballot for industrial action, they would be calling their members who work in school catering, cleaning and janitorial services to participate in strike action during the period November  to November , .“Other trade unions have not established a mandate for industrial action in Orkney.“The action announced is in response to the ongoing national dispute in relation to a pay award for local government staff for the year - which is negotiated between the trade unions and COSLA as the umbrella body for local government.“The council will be evaluating what impact this announcement may have on service provision as a matter of urgency and will ensure appropriate communications are issued in due course.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, there are a growing number of folk self-isolating, and the community has taken quick action to prevent any further transmission.#I think there has maybe been a few folk that have had positive lateral flow tests — myself included,# Mr Cooper explained.#A similar thing happened maybe back in August, where there was just one confirmed PCR case, and the whole island just closed down for a peedie while.#Mr Cooper has praised the population of around  for the way it has responded during the pandemic to self-isolation — particularly in terms of folk supporting each other when many are unable to leave their homes for essentials.#It#s a small community,# he said.#Everybody just pulls together. If anybody needs something, there is always someone there to help out.#As those who have received a positive lateral flow result now receive PCR testing via the Stronsay surgery, Mr Cooper anticipates that there may be a rise in confirmed cases. He is confident, however, that the community will remain on top of the situation by taking the appropriate self-isolation, social distancing and hygiene precautions advised by the Scottish Government.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As a group we have yet to win the MacTavish and it would be one more cup than we managed in , so it would still be a step in the right direction for us“ The end goal is obviously a grand slam.

I sense every step of that journey.In , Borrodale school closed for that last time. And yet,we listen, we can still hear from Borrodale, forever young and in timeless cèilidh.Put in this kind of context we can sense how community relationships are deeply connected to change. The continuity of change, both backwards and forwards, gives us insight, and proximity with dferent and creative ways of being in place.Times change and culture continues. It is important to be hopeful in this and to not perceive the shadows of the past as a fading le force but as an index pointing to future relationships.The second social experience is of course relates to the typical excitement of guising at Oidhche Shamhna. Originally, Oidhche Shamhna was integral toour sense of place and the cultural relationships of le cycles, including time itself.Oidhche Shamhna is ‘the night of summer’s end,’ and in our older understanding of the festival, it reveals that new le begins in darkness and is born into light similarly, just as days used to begin and end at dusk, the move to the darker half of the year is also the continuation of a cycle and is equally about new beginnings.In the deeper memory of Gaelic cosmology, this is the beginning of the new year, and of course, November is still called ‘an t-Samhain’ in Gàidhlig.My earliest memories of guising would be like those of many, our dad taking my sister and I for a few easy visits to long-standing neighbours and family friends. Even though we would only go to a few houses in those early days, the intensity and excitement of the initiation on a cold dark night was largely experienced through the warmth and kindness revealed in the relationships that emerged in the evening.Guising, then, is a form of cèilidh, where the encouraging and nurturing of the gt of exchange is more intangible than we always appreciate. It is that dimension of sustaining or developing relationships that seems most important to me.One of the first homes we would have visited on my first Oidhche Shamhna will have been that of Angus and Effie Ross in Fàsach. In my early years it was a home that we probably had more time in than any house outside of my family.It was a home I visited everyday day walking home from Borrodale school. My errand was to collect our newspapers from the post office, but it wasn’t a job, it was a relationship.Our family had a strong connection with these Rosses. In , Angus Ross’ great-uncle Alexander Ross had been nominated to deliver the prepared statement for the Fàsach croftersto the Napier Commission.In it he testied specically to the clearance of my great-great-grandfather from Ramasaig , who was removed along with all the families from Ramasaig around -, to make way for sheep, congesting further the land in Fàsach. So, it is from at least that time that our family had been friends.Alexander Ross’s brother, Kenneth Ross, also Fàsach, had among his eight children a first son called Neil and a second called Norman, both being young boys during the land wars....I did know Margaret but I never did met James Ross as he had a fatal accident in the early s in Glasgow, outside the BBC.Angus Ross and Seanair worked together on the County lorry . We saw Angus and Effie a lot and my mum credits him with telling her and her siblings about their Cameron origin story in Glendale.A mysterious tale of a man with long grey hair and a beard living in a cave at Scornandaoine on the east side of Loch Poolteil. He had arrived from Lochaber, in the mid to later s, likely a refugee from any number of social problems in the Gàidhealtachd of that time.Even now it still sounds like a good Halloween story. Certainly, my mum has never been a fan of beards in the family, but we were always welcomed by the Rosses in the ceilidh ethic of everyday relationships., Tobraichean a’ Gluasad .Here, ‘Tuam’ talks about his knowledge of local wells the necessity to move between dferent wells for sustenance, and so there will be times when a well in one place becomes dry while water would be plentul in another well.A resource such as Tobar an Dualchais helps us think about our many and ied relationships with culture, place, and time.Part of the intangible gt to be found within the archives, and also with the people and places around us, is how the wells of culture will be found popping up with all their potential, anywhere and everywhere, carried through the voices and relationships we nurture and come to know.Importantly, this can activate new dialogues, experiences, and gestures of cèilidh, and to embrace these for all in our communities, our futures, wherever the wells emerge."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4193378.jpg--.jpg?1635492771000\n","title":"frightful fun for all at hallowena 2021","story":"THE People’s Park, Ballymena will host one of the scariest nights of the year on Friday, October , from pm to .pm.The free event, organised by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, will thrill and chill with a packed programme of spooktacular activities for your little monsters to enjoy, with a huge walking dragon, fire juggling display, a fancy dress competition, a kiddies funfair, live music from The VIPs and a spooky illumination trail.You can sink your fangs into some sweet treats or tasty hot food to beat those Halloween hunger pangs, while the fun and festivities will finish with a fangtastic fireworks finale at .pm.Why not have your own #MEAdventure in the park  Outdoor areas including the brand new play equipment will be accessible during the event and there will be a free kiddies fun fair to entertain your little terrors.Wandering ghouls and spine tingling figures will be ready to spook you at every turn with a few hair-raising special additions.Follow the extended spooky illumination trail throughout the park and bump into some familiar characters along the way!Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, encouraged everyone to join in the Hallowena fun: “It is a great delight for us to be able to safely welcome our community to events this year and the Hallowena celebrations are always among the most popular on Council’s entertainment programme.“There is literally something for ghosts and goblins of all ages to enjoy on Friday  October in the stunning People’s Park in Ballymena, and I am really excited about the evening.“I am privileged to welcome everyone in our community to the park for some spooktacular fun, and I encourage those attending to observe the necessary public health guidelines so that we can protect ourselves and those around us.”There are over  off-street car park spaces within a -minute walk of People’s Park so make an evening of it with a visit to any of the fantastic shops or restaurants in the town.Parking for blue badge holders is available from pm at the People’s Park council car park off the Ballymoney Road.To help with a safe set-up of the site People’s Park will be closed to all members of the public on Friday  October until the event starts at pm.For everyone’s safety dogs, alcohol or fireworks are not permitted in the park and under s must have a responsible adult with them.Admission is free and no tickets are required.Visitors to the Hallowena event are asked to use the hand sanitisers provided and observe social distancing.

But I am up for policing. I’ve been on the Policing Board for longer than anyone , so I must be up for it.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read More‘Rebranding RUC to PSNI worth it for peace’: Judith Gillespie says name change crucialJoe Brolly:OpinionFair and well run, the PSNI is the jewel of the peace process“People have come to me, and there has been a number, looking for assistance to join the PSNI and I have assisted them.“On one or two occasions there were barriers I couldn’t understand, and so I went and asked about them. SoI can assist, I will do that.”Mr Kelly said while people from nationalist areas are joining, “they need to do more for working-class communities”.“We need more working-class people in policing,” he said. “And, to be frank, they need more women, they need more Catholics and more minority groups in the higher ranks — and that comes up on an ongoing basis.”He added that the build-up to republicans endorsing policing reforms was a “dficult” one.“This was all post a very vicious conflict, so it was huge, to be honest,” he said.“There were suspicions around Patten.But when we looked at the  recommendations, to our surprise — to my surprise — there was a lot of it made sense and it looked like a genuinely independent approach to it.“All of this was surrounded by caution, and at times still is. When you have the history of what policing meant in the Orange state, then you start off with policing in a much more dficult position.“I was policing spokesperson and I remember going to five or six ard-fheiseanna and standing up at each one of them and saying: ‘We are in a negotiation, we believe that society needs policing, we believe that there is at least an opportunity and potential to achieve a proper policing service and people need to be aware of what is going on here’.Read MoreJoe Brolly:OpinionFair and well run, the PSNI is the jewel of the peace process“Then we did a lot of town hall meetings, the leadership and quite a big team. Gerryled it along with Martinand went around big and small meetings.“We took the questions and had to deal with the criticisms.“In any conflict resolution it needs a dferent mentality. I have always said we need the same people to change their mentality.“It’s not asyou have people with a military or conflict mentality and then you leave it for someone  to deal with the resolution. The people who were involved had to be part of that.“It was a huge mountain to climb and some people couldn’t deal with it. But for some of the more vocal people, who say they left over policing, when you analyse it, they stayed after policing and left for other reasons.“But there were people who couldn’t deal with it, and I understand that it was too much for them. It depended on what they’d been through and their personal experiences were, but that is the dficulty in conflict resolution.“You have to make decisions, you have to put it behind you.That’s not to say that you forget, but the police have memories as well. It was a conflict and people had views on both sides.”It wasn’t until  that Sinn Fein nominated members to join the Policing Board. Alex Maskey, Martina Anderson and Daithí McKay were the first to take up the posts.“Getting the  recommendations into legislation was the biggest battle and that took several years,” Mr Kelly added. “You have to remember some people in the system on the state side didn’t want to change.”Mr Kelly joined the Policing Board in  and has remained the Sinn Fein representative ever since.“I was one of the people who was always involved in talking to the base, so I wouldn’t have been arguing for something I didn’t believe in,” he pointed out. “Once we went out to sell it, at that stage I was convinced.”Mr Kelly says, with hindsight, Chris Patten’s biggest success was actually producing his report, “which is now looked at by police services internationally and is a historic document in itself”.Related topicsGerry KellySinn FéinPolice Service of Northern IrelandMore On Gerry Kelly PremiumOff-duty officer who left gun in hotel is expected to face disciplinary action PremiumStormont’s gang of seven: MLAs elected to the first Assembly in  who have stayed the courseNI political leaders hold ‘robust’ talks with Lewis on legacy plans PremiumRegulation on bonfires badly needed now, insists Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie PremiumAndrew MaddenOpinionThe weekly political spin: The Illuminati-run council to sovereign sausages and a leak or twoMost ReadStep in right direction: Dancing revellers celebrate reopening of Northern Ireland nightclubsUVF linked to Newtownards bus hijacking as police up patrols after attackPhoto finish at Down Royal as race fans go extra furlong for Ladies DayGame of drones... the NI man who is taking online betting giants for a rideFormer Irish reality TV star who made  claims about Paddy Jackson’s father facing demands to state defence under oathTop VideosPlayVideo: Bus hijacked and set alight in apparent Northern Ireland Protocol protestPlayVideo: Return to the dance floor at Northern Ireland nightclubsPlayWatch: New trailer for Kenneth Branagh#s Belfast releasedLatest Northern IrelandGunmen who set bus on fire in Newtownards ‘from Protestant Action Force’Crime boss John Gilligan used prison football match to forge links with IRA, and have them kill gangland rival Martin #The General# Cahill, new book claimsKenneth Branagh hoping to ‘understand’ childhood trauma of witnessing riots in new film BelfastEmergency department in Northern Ireland could close due to extreme pressures, warns medical directorTesting is not a signicant factor in lorry driver shortage – MallonLatestGunmen who set bus on fire in Newtownards ‘from Protestant Action Force’Crime boss John Gilligan used prison football match to forge links with IRA, and have them kill gangland rival Martin #The General# Cahill, new book claimsKenneth Branagh hoping to ‘understand’ childhood trauma of witnessing riots in new film BelfastEmergency department in Northern Ireland could close due to extreme pressures, warns medical directorBat swoops in to claim New Zealand Bird of the Year title,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

To do some self-remembering without indulgence, simply trying to open what had been covered up. Because there’s so much of who I am that was formed in that period up to  years old and before that riot occurred.“But from that moment there was a guardedness, there was an inability to roll with things in the way that one had done before.”Mr Branagh said in the interview that he hesitates using the word “trauma” as “this little story exists in a place among groups of people who had many, many more traumatic experiences.”He added that this was never spoken about with his family.“Partly because a cardinal sin for my parents was to be suggesting that anything you’d been through was worthy of categorizing in such a way,” he said. “There’s no question that being shaken by the events of that time from my very particular -year-old perspective was, yes, I suppose you’d have to call that traumatic.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseSTARS: Jamie Dornan in Belfast with Ciaran Hinds and Jude Hill FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueSTARS: Jamie Dornan in Belfast with Ciaran Hinds and Jude Hill“But another cardinal sin was to indulge in your suffering. And yet over the years I’ve thought one doesn’t have to be doing that to go back and try and understand that this was a dficult time, which plenty of other people might recognize as such,” he added.“Not to elicit pity but to share with them recognition that might be insightful in some way.”Mr Branagh said that the “tribalism” of Belfast -which he portrays in the film- was shown as a “way of trying to understand the world” as a child growing up at that time.“This way of trying to understand the world, which I encountered back there in that particular area of tribalism in Belfast — you’re with us or you’re against us — it seems to me allows for little of the humanity that appears in the gaps between those harshly drawn lines,” he said.“In those gaps all sorts of human behaviour occurs. Sometimes irresponsible behaviour and sometimes heroic behaviour.The Academy award-winning director said that his father always taught him to “understand the dferences” of others which helped to shape his view of religion.“Although there was this fascination with what the Catholic religion did — this business of confessions seemed handy — my father was always clear with me thatpeople are honest, decent and true, then it didn’t matter where they came from or what they were and what they did,” he said.“As rosy-tinted as that seems, that’s how I feel. What’s evolved is the necessity of understanding more than silly thoughts about confession, actually trying to understand the dferences and what can be celebrated, understood, disagreed with respectfully.”“But the process is dficult,” he added.“That desire to understand what appears to be, in crude language, “the other side” — it’s very easy to get lazy about.“But I do believe that voices can and should be heard. More than heard, understood, and that’s the dficult thing, because you’ve got to work at understanding.”He explained that, growing up, he would have been labelled as “nominally Protestant” in the sense that was the church they went to, but insists that his father was essentially “independent”.“He encouraged independent thinking. I think anybody’s view of politics in the north of Ireland has to have changed over the years, particularly since the Good Friday Agreement,” Mr Branagh said.Read MorePrestigious award for Branagh at film festivalJust last week, the Belfast native received the Letime Achievement in Acting and Directing at the th SCAD Savannah Film Festival as he was promoting his new film.He previously said it was the silence of lockdown last year that spurred him to write a story.Speaking at the BFI London Film Festival last month, he said: “I think lockdown triggered dferences in lots of people.

We were very disappointed that the screening was not completed at the earliest opportunity in the policy development process and we queried the potential for the screening to actually inform the development or delivery of the High Street Scheme.”She added: “The screening lacked data or information on which to determine impacts across the Section  equality grounds and consequently the assessments that there were no impacts for most of those grounds lacked coherence.A more robust and timely equality assessment would have enabled the Department to thoroughly consider and consult on the potential equality impacts.”She said the scheme appeared to be causing problems for specic groups such as some married women and older people who may not have forms of identication such as a driver’s licence or a valid passport required by the scheme.“There is potential for discrimination against some of these groups who may experience less favourable treatment than others, in this case on grounds of their sex,” she said.“We are writing to the Minister for the Economy today to remind him of the importance of adhering to the Section  duties and asking him to review the deadline set for applying for and using the card to ensure some groups of people are not adversely impacted and left out.“Importantly this situation also highlights the lack of protection for older people who are currently not protected against discrimination in the provision of goods, facilities and services, unlike their counterparts in the rest of the UK and Ireland.”Meanwhile, the Ulster Unionist MLA Andy Allen has called on the Economy Minister Gordon Lyons to extend the period for people to spend their £ vouchers after delays of issuing the cards.“Colleagues and I continue to be contacted by a considerable number of constituents, many of whom applied at the outset of the high street voucher application opening, who have still not received their spend local card,” he said.This is against the backdrop of the thousands of people who were contacted because they could not be veried by the automated process, asking them to provide further evidence. Many of them have been informed it is likely to be a number of weeks before they will receive their card.”Mr Allen said it was now “clearly” the case that the Minister could not guarantee everyone would have four weeks to spend their £ and that it was time to review the end date.Most ReadStep in right direction: Dancing revellers celebrate reopening of Northern Ireland nightclubsUVF linked to Newtownards bus hijacking as police up patrols after attackPhoto finish at Down Royal as race fans go extra furlong for Ladies DayGame of drones... the NI man who is taking online betting giants for a rideFormer Irish reality TV star who made  claims about Paddy Jackson’s father facing demands to state defence under oathTop VideosPlayVideo: Bus hijacked and set alight in apparent Northern Ireland Protocol protestPlayVideo: Return to the dance floor at Northern Ireland nightclubsPlayWatch: New trailer for Kenneth Branagh#s Belfast releasedLatest Northern IrelandGunmen who set bus on fire in Newtownards ‘from Protestant Action Force’Gerry Kelly: ‘Selling policing to nationalist community was a huge mountain to climb... some people couldn’t deal with it’Crime boss John Gilligan used prison football match to forge links with IRA, and have them kill gangland rival Martin #The General# Cahill, new book claimsKenneth Branagh hoping to ‘understand’ childhood trauma of witnessing riots in new film BelfastEmergency department in Northern Ireland could close due to extreme pressures, warns medical directorLatestGunmen who set bus on fire in Newtownards ‘from Protestant Action Force’Gerry Kelly: ‘Selling policing to nationalist community was a huge mountain to climb... some people couldn’t deal with it’Crime boss John Gilligan used prison football match to forge links with IRA, and have them kill gangland rival Martin #The General# Cahill, new book claimsKenneth Branagh hoping to ‘understand’ childhood trauma of witnessing riots in new film BelfastEmergency department in Northern Ireland could close due to extreme pressures, warns medical director,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She also called the dad of a young service user “a dirty old man”, and used foul language to describe the mum of another child.A fth witness, who was in the team as a social worker from October  to December , told the  Ms Nixon “was at times extremely unprofessional and used derogatory and sexualised language in her everyday speech”.The former colleague said Ms Nixon used a derogatory slang term for a sex act on two occasions when talking about sexual assault, and that she used a vile description when referring to “friends, personal acquaintances and colleagues”.However, the witness also said “she believed there was no malice” in the inappropriate language and this “may have been the registrant’s way of dealing with pressure”.The  also heard from a corporate financial accountant and fraud liaison officer at the Southern Trust, who carried out a review of claims submitted by Ms Nixon and “calculated the miles over claimed at , miles”, the cost of which amounted to just under £,.Explaining its decision to remove Ms Nixon from the NISCC register, the  said she had not shown any insight or attempts at remediation, meaning there was a risk of repetition of her behaviour.It referred to a written submission from Ms Nixon in which she described the trust’s investigation as “a witch-hunt, and claimed she was a victim of bullying and harassment”.She also contested all the allegations against her and “emphasised that she did not wish to be part of the social work profession and felt abused by the relentless process against her”.The committee concluded Ms Nixon’s misconduct was “fundamentally incompatible with registration as a social worker”.The committee said a removal order “was the only sufficient sanction” to impose due to the misconduct.Most ReadStep in right direction: Dancing revellers celebrate reopening of Northern Ireland nightclubsUVF linked to Newtownards bus hijacking as police up patrols after attackPhoto finish at Down Royal as race fans go extra furlong for Ladies DayGame of drones... the NI man who is taking online betting giants for a rideFormer Irish reality TV star who made  claims about Paddy Jackson’s father facing demands to state defence under oathTop VideosPlayVideo: Bus hijacked and set alight in apparent Northern Ireland Protocol protestPlayVideo: Return to the dance floor at Northern Ireland nightclubsPlayWatch: New trailer for Kenneth Branagh#s Belfast releasedLatest Northern IrelandGunmen who set bus on fire in Newtownards ‘from Protestant Action Force’Gerry Kelly: ‘Selling policing to nationalist community was a huge mountain to climb... some people couldn’t deal with it’Crime boss John Gilligan used prison football match to forge links with IRA, and have them kill gangland rival Martin #The General# Cahill, new book claimsKenneth Branagh hoping to ‘understand’ childhood trauma of witnessing riots in new film BelfastEmergency department in Northern Ireland could close due to extreme pressures, warns medical directorLatestGunmen who set bus on fire in Newtownards ‘from Protestant Action Force’Gerry Kelly: ‘Selling policing to nationalist community was a huge mountain to climb... some people couldn’t deal with it’Crime boss John Gilligan used prison football match to forge links with IRA, and have them kill gangland rival Martin #The General# Cahill, new book claimsKenneth Branagh hoping to ‘understand’ childhood trauma of witnessing riots in new film BelfastEmergency department in Northern Ireland could close due to extreme pressures, warns medical director,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It comes as part of the Northern Irelands Executives winter Covid contingency plans. The Executive said there was a need to keep as many sectors open to the fullest possible extent. First Minister, Paul Givan said doing that would depend on as many people as possible getting vaccinated.” googletag.cmd.push Just over % of people aged  and above in Northern Ireland had received one dose of the vaccine. Mr Givan said: Our vaccination rates are very good but there is still room for improvement.” Further Covid restrictions are due to be relaxed by the Executive onOctober . This will allow for nightclubs to reopen, restrictions on indoor dancing lted and the requirement to be seated in hospitality to drink and eat food will no longer be in place. Mr Givan said it was a fact of le that Covid remains an ongoing issue, and that the Executive needed to continue to find ways to manage the situation. The First Minister says that the Executive will launch a new public information campaign before the end of October to build on the need for all of us to keep making safer choices. He also said that there would be a focus on “flexible and hybrid working” in workplaces.

Mr Eastwood was speaking ahead of the easing of restrictions in the North on Sunday October . SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon argued for the introduction of vaccine certications at the Executive, but it was opposed by Sinn Feacutein and the DUP. googletag.cmd.push Mr Eastwood said: “The easing of restrictions this weekend has been cause for much excitement. “The public will be happy they can once againto nightclubs and businesses will be rightfully ecstatic to open their doors for the first time in nearly two years. While this is welcome, we cannot ignore the fact that our hospitals are under increasing pressure. “Rarely a day goes by without another horror story about the state our health service is in. This year’s winter pressures have arrived earlier than normal and are affecting services across the board. Our health staff are crying out for help, they know what’s to come. We are still recording over , new cases of the virus daily and people are dying.“We cannot continue to lt restrictions without mitigations while we are in this situation. Eventually the pressure on our health service will increase and we will be faced with tough decisions. Nobody wants to see another lockdown, it will have a devastating impact on people’s mental health, businesses and their staff. “We have a proven alternative that will allow us to prevent another lockdown while protecting our health service from being overrun – vaccine certications. “The evidence from other jurisdictions is clear – the introduction of vaccine certications encourages vaccine uptake, particularly in younger age groups. Surely this is not too much to ask in the interests of keeping the public, their families and our staff safe. “Our proposals for vaccine certications were blocked at the Executive by Sinn Feacutein and the DUP who instead left the matter in the hands of inidual businesses. This will create confusion and pressure for both businesses and their staff from patrons who may experience dfering rules from one venue to the next.“This decision marks a serious abdication of responsibility and leadership, with the consequences set to play out in our hospitals in the months to come. I hope the impact of this weekend’s reopening will be closely monitored and Sinn Feacutein-DUP ministers will reconsider their decision on vaccine certication before it’s too late.” The Welsh and Scottish Governments have both implemented proof of vaccination in order to enter nightclubs and other large capacity events and venues.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

If you’ve just had a baby, your body is recovering, you’re living in the feeding-changing-soothing cycle, and you’re fighting with the baby blues. For you, this past year has been a year like no other to become a parent: denial of partners in the appointments and birthing room and restrictions resulting in isolation from loved ones. There are small things you can do to make this journey easier for parents and their babies, especially when things are tough. We gathered some tips from the music and art therapists working in UL Maternity Hospital on how we can use arts to promote the wellbeing of ourselves and the little ones.  googletag.cmd.push   Art is everywhere! We are born creative. Long before we learn to speak, we communicate with our hands, eyes, feet and voice. Later this can be communicated into art making, singing, poetry and dance to name a few. Colour, shape and texture stimulate the senses and can offer moments of inspiration or calm. Nature, human faces, food art can be seen all around us. It is in the noticing, taking time to embrace it, something as small as a falling helicopter from a sycamore tree. Pointing up in wonder, watching it swirl its way down to the ground with baby.How about music  Music is our best companion in good times, bad times, and ugly times. Whether it is listening to soothing music trying to sleep, moving to the beat during daily chores, crying over a sad song, or breathing and screaming through a birthing playlist. Studies suggest that listening to the right tunes can relieve stress, anxiety, sadness, and physical discomfort. Do you know your baby loves your voice most  Research shows when the parent sings to their baby, the baby responds and there is positive effect on the parent-baby bonding and baby’s development. Singing to your baby in the womb can establish a strong connection between you and your baby and the baby remembers the tunes. Parents reported that the tunes they sang during pregnancy could quiet and soothe their babies after birth and continue to strengthen the bond. These loving first conversations and singing together can bring a unique, meaningful, and fun connection with your child and the whole family.     Using the arts in these everyday moments like nappy changing and meal time with your baby will help develop a strong bond, soothing your little one when they are crying with gentle touch , friendly faces , playful talking, laughing and chatting and taking a few minutes to watch your baby and see what they can do and like helps your baby’s brain. They bank every smile and cuddle and this helps them feel safe and secure, now and into the future. Using the arts can be great for the stressful times, helping release feel good hormones and relieving stress. You don’t have to be Picasso or P!nk, find what you and your baby like to do, and enjoy the everyday moments of being creative together!Just as physical health needs care, so does mental health. If you are feeling overwhelmed as a Mum, Dad, worried about a partner, family member or need further advice   support for you and   or your baby, talk to your Public Health Nurse, GP, or health care provider who will be able to help.This article was contributed by Pui Sze Cheung and Emilie Browne, music and art therapists with the Specialist Perinatal Mental Health Team in UL Maternity Hospital and Helen Ryan in ABC Start Right.

Our true self is being in such a way that others’ opinions of you do not matter. You are happy in yourself and do not need validation or approval from others for your way of being in the world. You embody joy and love and express this joy and love in all areas of your le. googletag.cmd.push A worthwhile endeavour to reconnect with ourselves. We live in a world of distraction where our phones, television, our chores and even our work serve in a way that takes us further away from our true being. However, to reconnect with yourself is no easy task. It requires an ability to sit in silence, with no distractions, and be happy with yourself and your thoughts. Noticing thoughts as they come and go. Noticing your anxieties and worries as they come and stay until you “do” something in an attempt to control them. For many people, the thought of this is excruciating and as soon as silence hits, the habit has been built to look for ways to distract and break the silence. This may manest itself in scrolling through our phones, turning on the television, having a drink, smoking a cigarette, breaking the silence with conversation or even future thinking of ways to crowd your le with “things” that will have fleeting moments of ecstasy in a world that, to some, may appear mundane. The truth is that the real extraordinary things live within the ordinary facets of our le. There is grace in being in silence. They say the voice of God exists in the silence of man. I would go a step further and say that not only does God, or spirit, or the universe live in silence, but it does so in our highest selves. An idea to some and a reality or awareness of others that, indeed, everything we attribute to being larger than ourselves is in fact our fear of that – ourselves. But how do we connect with this higher self  There are many known techniques that provoke this connection and will help you connect. Meditation, spending time in nature, social connection, mindfulness, prayer and so on. To walk in nature, without your headphones in, can be an overwhelming experience for all of us. The silence of the trees, water and mountains unearth something in us that we find dficult to intellectualise, conceptualise or put into words so to speak. It is the silence of our surroundings that brings us back to our higher self and a feeling of connection with something larger than ourselves. Some people label this in order to make sense of it – call it God, something bigger, the POWER of nature, spirit, ine etc. However really, it is yourself. It is you who you are connecting with, in essence. This may cause a little fear. To think or believe for one second that the power that we connect with in the silence of nature is in fact our true essence and ourselves. How could we have gotten so “big” for want of a better word  How, in a world that tells us we are small and insignicant to the power of the “almighty” how is it that this “something bigger” is in fact ourselves  It is because we are afraid of ourselves and we have been conditioned to be fearful of ourselves or our highest self. Afraid of our talents. Afraid of our capabilities. Afraid of our own power. So, when we sit in silence, we meet ourselves or our higher self, our best self. It is an opportunity, in that time, to reconnect with what is truly important to us and what our mission is in le. It is an opportunity to meet yourself. To sit with the hurt, the losses, the grief, the pain is dficult. To bask in joy, happiness and success is much more welcome. So why is it that many people find it so dficult  I would argue that the distractions we create are to avoid the pain. To avoid the hurts and losses. However, they will crop their heads up in other areas of our le. In our relationships with others, in our work, in our daily le and most importantly in our relationship with ourselves. I invite you this week to notice the distractions you are creating in your le in order to surpass the act of actually feeling. We have become desensitised to our own emotions through the act of distractions. It can be dficult to sit in silence. It can. The world is not designed for silence. An even more worthwhile exercise would be to invite silence into your le and find time for the said silence.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The scheme is a recycling initiative which he had championed during his time as Environment Minister and has worked to progress in recent years. In response to an Assembly Question tabled by Mr Durkan, the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , Edwin Poots reaffirmed his commitment to introduce the scheme, following the department’s joint consultation with DAERA and the Welsh Government. googletag.cmd.push The Foyle MLA said: “I’m pleased that work is continuing to progress a depositscheme for Northern Ireland. “This is a scheme which began work on during my time as Environment Minister, having seen their benefits in other countries. “Unfortunately, at that time my attempts were met with some resistance, both politically and commercially. “In February , the Executive supported my calls for the introduction of a depositscheme and committed to the North’s participation in a proposed UK-wide rollout. I welcome that the consultation process has been completed and welcome Minister Poots commitment to delivering this scheme and move towards a circular economy. “While awareness in recent years has improved where recycling is concerned, we are still not at the level we need to be. “A cash incentive under a Deposit Return Scheme, in my opinion, is the best way forward and will encourage an uptake in recycling. “Our throw-away culture is completely unsustainable and our planet is bearing the brunt of it. “In recent years, we have witnessed a growing realisation that action must be taken by governments, businesses and iniduals to address the damage being done to our environment. “I would like to see this scheme expanded to include cans and plastic bottles, building on the success of the carrier bag levy, to tackle the scourge of single use plastic on our communities. “I hope the Minister will revisit an all-island approach for this initiative but for now it is crucial that we push forward on implementing this environmentally transformative scheme without further delay. “ ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Mr Durkan, who is the SDLPs Communities Spokesperson, said that Mr Murphy and his party – Sinn Feacutein – had struck a huge blow to people across Derry and the North. googletag.cmd.push The Finance Minister was accused by Mr Durkan of rejecting a bid from Mr Murphys Sinn Feacutein colleague – and also the Executives Communities Minister – Deirdre Hargey for poundmillion to keep in place the pound uplt for the rest of the financial year. Mr Durkan said: “The decision by Sinn Feacutein Finance Minister Conor Murphy not to reverse the pound, a year cut to Universal Credit will be devastating news for the around , people currently in receipt of this welfare across the North. “SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon supported the bid for this money, but Sinn Feacutein and the DUP have gone over the heads of the rest of the Executive and rejected it. “This decision will leave a wide range of people, from families to single parents, to workers signicantly worse off at a time when we are seeing electricity and gas bills rising to record levels, essential goods are getting more expensive and national insurance contributions are set to go up. “These people will now face dficult decisions about how they are going to put food on the table and heat their homes this winter. “The British government had the chance to reverse this cut when they unveiled their budget earlier this week – they chose not to take it and now Conor Murphy has done the same thing, he’s failed to protect local people from this cruel cut despite having the power to do so. “What’s even worse is expectations were raised when news emerged that a bid had been made by the Sinn Feacutein minister for this money, people believed that a reprieve was coming only to have their hopes dashed. “I understand the financial constraints the Executive is under and it’s only right that our first priority should be health, but the mental and physical health of thousands of people will be affected by this cut as they struggle to get by. “To keep this funding for the rest of the year would have required just poundm, less than . per cent of the Executive budget and I hardly think that is an insurmountable sum to find for the Finance Minister.” However, Mr Murphy hit back expressing disappointment at Mr Durkans comments and accused the SDLP of “shameful electioneering”. He said: “At the Executive meeting last Thursday I set out allocations for the October Monitoring Round. “This included poundm for Health in line with the Executives priorities. No alternative allocation was proposed. “I also offered the option of a pro rata reduction from Departments other than Health in order to fund the Universal Credit uplt this year and in the longer-term. “The SDLP Minister did not express any support for this option. “Following the Executives discussion I asked for the allocations to be cleared through urgent procedure, which is cleared by the First Ministers on behalf of the Executive. “No Minister objected to this. “I’m disappointed that the SDLP’s public position on this issue is clearly at odds with their private position. “This smacks of an effort to speak out of both sides of their mouth. This is cynical electioneering with no regard for the people on Universal Credit whose pound uplt was shamefully snatched from them by the British Tories.” Meanwhile, Foyleside Councillor, Shaun Harkin of People Before Profit, launched his own broadside towards Mr Murphy saying both the Minister and the Executive had “deemed it acceptable to turn its back on the least well-off”. He said: “The call for Stormont to take responsibility for the pound-a-week cut to Universal Credit has been ignored. “In failing to prioritise funding to restore the Universal Credit cut, the Executive has once again deemed it acceptable to turn its back on the least well-off. This is utterly shameful. “Point scoring and isive squabbling from Executive parties wont do anything to defend those among us facing a winter of pain. “Genuine resistance, not lip service, is the only way to push back against spiralling inequality. Thats not happening with this lot on the Executive. “Derry has the highest deprivation levels in the North. Thirty per cent of the population are below the poverty line. Our child poverty levels are criminal. Yet, there are more super rich people than ever before. “This hasnt happened by accident but because the Executive parties emulated the Tories over the last twenty years in prioritising elites by encouraging privatisation, lobbying for tax cuts for corporations, greenlighting cruel welfare reforms and promoting food banks. “The cut to Universal Credit alongside rising energy costs, new tax burdens and below inflation wage increases for most workers is going to put many more people and children into hardship. “Its urgent we organise a fighting people power response. If we do that a real alternative will become possible.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Figures obtained via Assembly Questions from the Department for Communities showed the number of new social homes built in   amounted to , with almost , applicants on social housing waiting lists as of June . googletag.cmd.push The figures show that at the current building rate it would take over  years to clear the existing waiting lists. Foyle MLA Durkan said the current strategy from Sinn Feacutein Communities Minister Deacuteirdre Hargey would see waiting lists get even longer and plunge applicants into more misery. The SDLP is bringing a motion calling on Minister Hargey to increase the supply of social and affordable housing before the Assembly tomorrow. Mr Durkan said: “The growing numbers on social housing waiting lists indicate the scale of the housing crisis now facing the North. “Social housing is only one aspect of housing need here in the North and things are only getting worse, particularly in light of the added pressures brought to the sector as a result of the Covid- pandemic. “There are almost , inidual and families in housing need with nearly , of those determined to be in housing stress. “Given the current rate of building, a simple assessment of this situation means it would take in excess of  years to clear the current waiting list. “That time frame will be even greater in areas like Upper Bann where just four social homes have been built this year. “Upper Bann currently has nearly  people on housing waiting lists and to build just four homes to tackle this issue is an insult. “How can we tell families living in overcrowded properties, staying with family and friends, or people with disabilities in properties wholly unsuitable to their needs, that it will take decades to tackle the housing waiting list  “The current rate of building is falling woefully short of meeting demand. “It’s important to take stock of the lives behind these statistics to consider that behind each application are iniduals, families and many children waiting in anguish, with many having already given up hope of finding a home of their own. “Tackling this crisis demands creative thinking. The Housing Supply Strategy and Private Tenancies Bill will hopefully play their part, but drastic action must be taken before housing demand spirals even further out of control. “Minister Hargey needs to get a grip on this issue and come up with a plan that will increase the number of houses built and get people off our waiting lists. “People have been waiting long enough and vague words and promises mean little to those in need of a home.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

House builder, BW Social Affordable Housing– part of the Braidwater Group – welcomed residents from the area to an information session as part of a public consultation regarding amended plans for the new housing development. googletag.cmd.push The session took place last October at the Hazelbank and Ballymagroarty Community Centre and it was an opportunity for both BW to present details on the extension of the neighbourhood and for residents to ask questions and to express any concerns. The revised proposals, which received overwhelming support from residents, include the residential development of roughly  new homes for the area with associated open space that includes a new community parkland. The new parkland, which existing residents will have access to, will include a k walking loop dotted with trim trails, outdoor exercise equipment and rest areas. This new development is proposed for lands north of Aileach Road, Ennis Place, John Field Place, Rafferty Close, MacNeice Close and Magill Court. BW has said that they hope the new development will be an enhancement of the existing neighbourhood in Ballymagroarty and will address the demand for housing, particularly in the west bank of Derry. Vincent Bradley from BW said: ‘‘Our drop-in information session was a great success. “We are grateful for all those who attended, and to the Ballymagroarty and Hazelbank Community Partnership who allowed us the use of their centre as a venue to host residents. “The event was a good example of meaningful public engagement, and it was important to hold this session to let residents in the area know that we have been addressing their concerns regarding the proposals and to take on board their feedback. “We believe that these new homes to be built with a community parkland will be an exciting enhancement of the existing Ballymagroarty neighbourhood, and we thank residents for their feedback on our plans.” For those who couldn’t attend the recent information session, BW says they can contact them with any questions about the extension by emailing: enquiries@bwltdADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

House builder, BW Social Affordable Housing– part of the Braidwater Group – welcomed residents from the area to an information session as part of a public consultation regarding amended plans for the new housing development. googletag.cmd.push The session took place last October at the Hazelbank and Ballymagroarty Community Centre and it was an opportunity for both BW to present details on the extension of the neighbourhood and for residents to ask questions and to express any concerns. The revised proposals, which received overwhelming support from residents, include the residential development of roughly  new homes for the area with associated open space that includes a new community parkland. The new parkland, which existing residents will have access to, will include a k walking loop dotted with trim trails, outdoor exercise equipment and rest areas. This new development is proposed for lands north of Aileach Road, Ennis Place, John Field Place, Rafferty Close, MacNeice Close and Magill Court.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.     Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N.

Also included are Manus and Majella Martin. uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ue u uc p ue r n ucp ueThe youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O ursquoNeill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from  ulsquoTeenage Kicks ursquo to  ulsquoMy Perfect Cousin ursquo to  ulsquoIt ursquos Going To Happen ursquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O ursquoNeill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThe way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage, urdquo he said.  uldquoWe really have no bad feelings towards him. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. uc p ue r n ucp ueCaroline O ursquoNeill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoHe ursquos going to kill me for saying this, urdquo she said.  uldquoBut he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ue ucstrong ueNot so good-natured abuse uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ueThe laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThere were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street, urdquo admits Damien O ursquoNeill. uc p ue r n ucp ueAnd Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home:  uldquoIt was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn ursquot buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. uc p ue r n ucp uePaul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal ursquos shoes described the documentary as  uldquobrilliant, really enjoyable urdquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueJohn O ursquoNeill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets:  uldquoI think it ursquos great.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound. Manus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins. Two versions of the film have been compiled and the BBC will broadcast the -minute ‘short version’ by Perfect Cousin Productions Ltd, in association with the BBC, Arts Council and Irish Film Board.

The comments were made during a Government press conference on Tuesday October th, after the announcement of the countrysrevised reopening plan, where Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin confirmed all of the restrictions set to ease from Friday,  October and the restrictions that will remain in place. googletag.cmd.push The pandemic isnt over yet. Unfortunately, were going to have to get through at least another winter before we can safely say that its behind us, Varadkar said at the press conference. The situation took a turn for the worse about two or three weeks ago and since then, weve seen rising case numbers, rising hospitalisations and rising ICU numbers.So, were not where we hoped to be or expected to be for  October... were not past the peak of the Delta wave. Later in the press conference, he said the government would be meeting with unions and employer representatives to update the Work Safely Protocol. Well have that done over the next couple of days and essentially what were saying is that a staggered and phasedto the office is possible, he explained. So, people going back to the office for a specic business purpose, like a meeting or a training, for example, or inductions - that is allowed. But certainly people who can work from home and want to continue to work from home, their employer should facilitate that. But bear in mind, there are also people whove been working from home with a laptop on a bed for  months now and they really want to get back to the office. Andthat can be facilitated,they can be in an office on their own or in an office where theyre socially distanced from other people, that should be facilitated too. But the fullto offices as we knew them, that will be next spring, added the Taacutenaiste. The announcement from the Taacutenaiste comes days after Deputy Chief Medical OfficerDr. Ronan Glynn advised the public towork from home where possiblethis autumn and winter.

After continuing with his le, as best he could, he collapsed last year in his garden with back and leg pain. googletag.cmd.push Kevin travelled to Istanbul last month to meet a specialist and will require surgery within a matter of months, which will cost in the region of pound,. A crowdfunding page has brought in poundK so far and Ballinderry are aiming to help raise the remainder. On Friday, June , their  and  U Feacuteile teams will play in a novel charity game, with all the funds going help Kevin and his family. “We are trying to raise as much money for Kevin and his family as possible,” said Philip Muldoon, one of the organisers. “We want the good people off Ballinderry and surrounding areas to come along and donate on the night of the match to keep the date free. “To any business people who would like to sponsor a prize for the raffle in the Bridge Bar afterwards they can do so by contacting myself or Karl Conlan. “Kevin is going to need a lot of help post and pre surgery and this will go a long way to doing that.” To mark the occasion Noel ONeill of Arboe based company ND Sports has made the outstanding gesture of sponsoring a one-off retro top for both teams.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment.

And so it proved. St Patricks are back in the last four for the second year running under the tutelage of Bradley and Antrim native Kevin Brady. googletag.cmd.push The Loughshore side have hit an impressive  goals in championship football, winning all but one game a group clash with Dungiven. Joint manager Kevin Brady says the scores are a sign of the players footballing intelligence. “The boys have taken the goals well and the boys themselves on the field sense when a goal opportunity is on,” he said. “We have quite smart players in that regard, and so far, they have executed them well. They will probably be fewer and farther between in terms of the chances that Glen will give us. “Weve unearthed another couple of players, not necessarily young players, but guys who are early to mid-s who might not have been making the senior team previously. Loup manager Paddy Bradley. “Theyve taken their chance. Some players have seen that was the case last year and a few other fellas have stepped up and staked their claim for a place.” That progress will be needed as they prepare to take on Watty Grahams. The  finalists misfired in last years championship, exiting to fierce rivals and eventual winners Slaughtneil at the quarter final stage. Glen have set about righting that wrong with a vengeance and showed their intent in appointing Malachy ORourke as manager. They have amassed a - championship haul over five games, with goals from Paul Gunning and Conleth McGuckian easing them past Swatragh in this years quarter final. It is a side sprinkled with talent and the mercurial Conor Glass and Ciaran McFaul at its heart, and the conveyor belt has created a cohesive blend of youth and experience. Terence OBriens renaissance has had a big impact for Loup, and the big midfielder fired home a goal in the win over Bellaghy. Midfield partner Paddy Coney also chipped in with a goal in that game, and the ever-present trio of Anthony ONeill, Ciaran Devlin and Caolan Devlin are a handful for any defence. Defensively, the lads from the Glenshane have the edge, conceding -to Loups -throughout the championship, but the figures suggest it could be an open game. Malachy ORourke is in charge of Glen. Kevin Brady says thats not necessarily the case. “Hopefully it will be an entertaining game from a neutral point of view,” he said. “Glen certainly put you under a lot of pressure. You dont really get any time to catch your breath, so I expect it to be high intensity. “Its sometimes hard to know. A goal going in at some point can make the other team come out and play. “Hopefully the disappointment of last year will spur our boys on to go one step further and make the final this year.” The bookies will certainly favour Glen, but Loups traditionally attack-minded managerial duo will be relishing a chance to lock horns with Malachy ORourke in the heat of championship battle. The Owenbeg pitch is in better condition than it has been in previous years, and will help create firm enough underfoot conditions for both these sides to serve up an entertaining battle. Loup have managed an average of three goals per game, and this game could well all come down to how well Loup manage to balance the guages of risk and reward on Sunday evening.

Greyhound racing willto the venue, which has been closed since August , under its new owners, The Lford Greyhound Racing Club . Contracts were signed this week and Derry Now understands that a date of March ,  has been pencilled in for theof racing at the border venue. The news is welcomed not just by sporting enthusiasts in the area, but the venues impending reopening also serves as a signicant employment boost. googletag.cmd.push In June, Greyhound Racing Irelandapproved Lford’s application for a licence. A signicant investment into the stadium reopening came from the UK Tote Group, who will also operate at the stadium. The new owners are made up of a group of businessmen from England and Ireland with greyhound enthusiast Harry Findlay said to be the driving force.  Earlier this year, it emerged that Paul Lawrence, the former Crayford racing manager, and Lorraine Sams, an ex-GB Greyhound Board stipendiary steward, were to head up the management team having agreed terms with the consortium, who purchased the stadium from the Duffy family. The Stadium, which underwent a €million refurbishment in , was put up for sale in , tagged with a €.million price. In August , the traps were closed for the last time, the owners citing a lack of support from the sport’s hierarchy. Lford Stadium was first opened in  and the . acre site includes a -seater restaurant overlooking the track. The  Indecon Report, which identied Lford among the tracks for closure, said: ‘An important point to note is that there may be opportunities for inidual stadia to continue to operate without IGB prize money or with lower fundingthey can generate resources from sponsorship, fundraising or local support, or sufficiently reduce costs.’ The new owners have already confirmed that they will be in a position to operate without a reliance on government funding.

It looked asPromise Omochere’s second half goal would be enough for Bohs, until Boyce struck with his th goal of the campaign to save the hosts. Bohs shocked Derry by taking the lead less than five minutes into the second half. A ball forward saw Eoin Toal and Promise Omochere battle for possession, and the striker emerged with the ball before shooting low past Gartside and into the net from  yards. googletag.cmd.push It should have been game over for Derry  minutes from time when Gartside completely messed up a routine clearance, and Ali Coote set up Ross Tierney for a tap in, only for an incredible clearance from Eoin Toal to deny Bohs a second goal. Derry responded well to that scare and came so close to equalising. A long throw into the area by Will Fitzgerald was flicked on by Toal, and it came to Junior who volleyed the ball past Talbot but the ball hit the underside of the crossbar and somehow stayed out. It looked asDerry were out of luck, but deep into added time, James Akintunde’s cross went all the way to the back post where Boyce was on hand to bundle the ball over the line to save what could be a huge point for Ruaidhri Higgins’ team.

It looked asPromise Omochere’s second half goal would be enough for Bohs, until Boyce struck with his th goal of the campaign to save the hosts. Bohs shocked Derry by taking the lead less than five minutes into the second half. A ball forward saw Eoin Toal and Promise Omochere battle for possession, and the striker emerged with the ball before shooting low past Gartside and into the net from  yards. googletag.cmd.push It should have been game over for Derry  minutes from time when Gartside completely messed up a routine clearance, and Ali Coote set up Ross Tierney for a tap in, only for an incredible clearance from Eoin Toal to deny Bohs a second goal. Derry responded well to that scare and came so close to equalising. A long throw into the area by Will Fitzgerald was flicked on by Toal, and it came to Junior who volleyed the ball past Talbot but the ball hit the underside of the crossbar and somehow stayed out. It looked asDerry were out of luck, but deep into added time, James Akintunde’s cross went all the way to the back post where Boyce was on hand to bundle the ball over the line to save what could be a huge point for Ruaidhri Higgins’ team.

AlthoughHannah Peel loses both the NI Music Prize AND The Mercury Music Prize you can safely assume that the Irish music scene has imploded. googletag.cmd.push Incidentally, Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic was the best album released in the last year, including re-released eps, Waldorf  Cannon’s We Are Your Government was the best single. There haven’t been any new bands apparently to contend with nor was there any live acts to mention…but were there in   Anyway. Stendhal. For some unknown reason people tend to review bands at festivals and neglect the organisation. John once said: “The first festival back felt a bit magical. Before the event, setting up it felt like the whole placewere sitting simmering to deliver something very special. “Everyone who turned out, be it artists audiences or crew, just got into the spirit of what it was and how much it meant after a long  months. July’s instalment of Stendhal Festival was a success on several dferent levels. From finally being allowed to provide artists a live  to a captivated responsive crowd, bringing much needed economic benefit to the local area which depends so much on tourism, to helping find a way forward for the events industry in a post pandemic environment. The team at Stendhal have again done the event proud in their endeavours to find a balance in providing a safe yet welcoming environment. “On a personal note, being able to see the excitement of the artists, festival heads and families over the course of the weekend brought a smile to my face”. And Colm O’Donnell once added “After a long  months, July’s instalment of Stendhal Festival was a success on a number of dferent levels. From finally being allowed to provide artists a live  to a captivated responsive crowd, bringing much needed economic benefit to the local area which depends so much on tourism, to helping find a way forward for the events industry in a post pandemic environment. With those in attendance noticeably enjoying theof live music to the farm, it’s made the work behind the scenes worthwhile. “The team at Stendhal have again done the event proud in their endeavours to find a balance in providing a safe yet welcoming environment. On a personal note, being able to see the excitement of the artists, festival heads and families over the course of the weekend definitely brought a smile to my face.” Following their ambitious endeavour in producing two covid compliant music festivals in , Stendhal Festival has announced that it will be ing to the one festival format in  and that their one festival will begin on the very last day of June , running to July nd. The two smaller events which instigated numerous social distancing protocols combined to create the largest gathering of tents at a music festival anywhere in Ireland in  and with that experience under their belts, the team behind the multi-award- winning event have decided that the best way to try and get back to normality is to press forward with one larger event for approximately , people. Festival Director Ross Parkhill explained: “Despite the dficulties, the uncertainties and all the additional rules and regulations we had to impose, both events in  went off really well and people really worked incredibly well with us to ensure that was the case. “Running two events provided big challenges for us but happily, as always, our amazing team rose to the occasion twice and more people camped at a music festival at Stendhal than anywhere  on the Island of Ireland this year, something we can really be proud of.” Ross continued: “Going forward though, to continue with the model of two smaller events would not be practical for us and we are confident that people are a bit more confident themselves now about ing to large scale outdoor gigs, as witnessed at a number of events in Belfast throughout September. “With that in mind, with the eradication of social distancing rules for outdoor spaces and with plenty of lessons learned from our events in , we are confident that we canto our usual event set up in  and safely welcome over , patrons to the farm once again.” Super Saver Early bird tickets for Stendhal  will be on sale on October thth at pm and will be available until January th, when the organisers are hoping to make their first batch of line-up announcements. “By moving the event forward by about  weeks we have to hit the ground running,” added Ross, “we also don’t have any major uncertainties aboutwe can run or not next year so expect us to have plenty of info regrading Stendhal  out early in the new year, when we will also be opening our annual artists submission process.” For tickets and more info regarding Stendhal Festival , visit www.stendhalfestival  Magee on Music: London Calling with Derry-born Stephen McLaughlin  Kevin Magee speaks with Derry-born and London-based artist Stephen McLaughlin    Magee on Music: New Sounds with Conor Cummings  Kevin Magee speaks with Derry based singer Conor Cummings    Magee on Music: Not Peter Gabriel  Kevin Magee speaks to Derry band members Invaderband on the upcoming launch of their new album  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The replica kits were brilliant even though the shorts were a wee bit too long for my liking, said Tollymore club chairman Adrian Howard.ldquoOur guys really got into the spirit of things with the  moustaches and at one point I thought history was repeating itself with the teams locked at -. But it wasnrsquot to be with the English boys winning -.After such a wet and dismal start to last week, Donard Park was bathed in sunshine for the match and despite all the best laid plans, the England team was delayed on route from the airport.However, this gave Mr Lewis the opportunity to meet some volunteer coaches and officials from the Tollymore club. He chatted to coaches Simon Thornton and Dr Gavin Devlin about their involvement with the club and volunteering in general.Mr Lewis also met Seamus Heath and Mark Hughes, from the NI Veterans team who were involved in organising the fixture.The project is one of  funded through the Shared History Fund which supports groups to mark the Centenary, in a thoughtful, inclusive and engaging way.The Tollymore Club has been working on its project since October last year and was very pleased to hear that it had been awarded funding to deliver the project and to date the ious events have been extremely well received.ldquoI would like to thank everyone for taking part and making this part of our project such a success, in particular, the guests for attending and Rob Manley of the Anchor Bar for providing gts for the Secretary of State, council chairwoman Cathy Mason and Darren Rice from Heritage Lottery NI, said Adrian.The Tollymore club presented a number of gts to the Secretary of State including a framed print of Newcastle, circa , provided by Mr Ivor Anderson. He also received a replica  England top and The Friend at Hand Irish Whiskey presentation box.Gts of The Friend at Hand Irish Whiskey were also made to the council chairwoman and Mr Darren Rice.Also in attendance at the event was South Down MLA Jim Wells, a huge Northern Football fan and regular attender at the teamrsquos home fixtures.The latest football match starring the veterans is a testament to how far the teams have developed over the past few years.Formed almost  years ago after Tollymore United organised a long running five-a-side football programme, the NI Veterans encourage men that had stopped playing regular football to get back playing.The veterans believe that age should not be a barrier to playing football and that there are incalculable health benefits, both physical and mental, to keeping active.Players ages range from rsquos through to rsquos with teams at over rsquos, over rsquos, over rsquos and over rsquos age groups.Every year the NI Veterans take part in a home internationals tournament with their English, Scottish and Welsh counterparts and travel to venues across the UK, with the home internationals played in a dferent country each year.Players meet their own travel and accommodation costs with Tollymore United offering their pitch for home fixtures and the Anchor Bar providing visiting teams with food and refreshments.Veteranrsquos football is huge in England and Wales with organised leagues and dozens of teams. It is also becoming increasingly popular in Europe with the NI Veterans having played European opposition.Last Fridayrsquos football match was the third of four events that the Tollymore club is delivering as part of their project.The first part of the project was a talk on the events leading up to lsquoThe Partition of Irelandrsquo with leading historian Dr Cormac Moore and took place in July.

In my opinion this does not appear to be consistent with the regulations which clearly suggest mph was more appropriate, but it is still a positive result after many years of campaigning.ldquoRoad Service Officials confirmed to me last January that the mph limit would be introduced this year and we have all been tenterhooks waiting delivery day.

It didnrsquot even rain on the day. All in all, it was a good way to start the season.The event included a full programme of junior racing so the atmosphere was buzzing by the time the seniors arrived at the Billy Neill playing fields in Comber.As the last junior race finished, the senior women swarmed to the start area. East Down AC was out in force with  females on the start list plus Wayne Giles by virtue of being in the Male  plus age group was in the same race.The runners were herded into pens to await the whistle and in fact when the race started two minutes early, some of the team were nearly caught on the hop as they were facing the wrong way getting their photo taken.Off they went at a pace across the level grass of the pitches stretching out quickly from a pack to a winding snake of coloured vests.They then turned sharply to get on to the hilliest section for the first time.This part is a gradual but leg sapping climb with the odd flatter bit for respite.Even after reaching the top, there are a few lumpy bits before a welcome downhill section. The runners then have a road crossing to contend with before sweeping round to the next loop.For women and male plus, it was three laps to make the k which meant three chances to try dfering techniques on the hill.At the end of the last lap there was an added cruel twist - a steep uphill to the finish which seemed primarily to be for the entertainment of spectators.It required huge reserves to push to the very end but the cheering onlookers provided the much needed encouragement with gusto.Caroline MacNabb led the team in with a gutsy run. She went out strongly and kept pushing to keep in contention. This earned her eighth overall in . and should encourage her that her consistent training is paying off.Catherine OrsquoConnor not far behind was forced to work hard for her tenth place coming home in  minutes exactly. This placed her first in her age category.Further back the rest of the team were all putting in the hard yards and finished in the following order: Sharon Madine , Wendy Findlay , Maureen Kelly and Janine Murray, who spent the entire race neck and neck, crossed the line together in ., Roisin Gaffney , Alison Carroll , Shauna McGreevyand Rachel Madine .Wayne Giles smiling as always placed nine  veteran men.The women had no time to relax as they took on the supporting role to pay back the shouts given by the EDAC men earlier. The men had an even bigger team.This level of participation is a sign of the numbers currently attending training. The club has definitely bounced back post Covid- and the enthusiasm to race is ing.Neil McCartan was out to show that his recent speedy . for K was no fluke so he was gunning for action.He along with a bunch of sharp shooters came out of the pens at a rate of knots, fighting to get away from the melee and make sure that they were not impeded in any way.Aaron McGrady also close to the front at the start was determined not to get sucked into a chase situation but found it hard to stay controlled when he saw the way the pack was breaking up.Neil ended up having to run solo as the top three were hammering on but to his credit he stayed solid and claimed a worthy fth place finishing in . for K.Aaron settled as per plan and worked his way through the field each lap ending up ninth overall .Gordy Graham wasnrsquot a fan of cross country before and hadnrsquot changed his opinion after but still managed to come th in ..The rest of the team streamed in not far behind.Neil Curran , Conaill MacNabb , Martin Willcox , Jonny Holmes , Barrie Atkinson , Dee Murray , Mark OrsquoConnor , Eamon Holmes , Seamus Savageand John Taylor .Cross country is definitely a dferent kettle of fish from a road race and many found that the iation in terrain made for an interesting outing while others found it an extremely hard session.The truth is that cross country is the most valuable way to pass the winter as it adds strength and stamina and the camaraderie almost makes up for the pain.Hopefully the turnout at Ballyclare in a couple of weeks time will show that that our members have been convinced of the merits.Declan Teague is continuing to push himself by completing multiple marathons in a short time frame.This weekend he headed to Kildare for his third crack at the . miles in five weeks. EDAC was well represented as Phillip Vint, completing his th marathon, and Dermot Cahill were also on the start list for the Thoroughbred Autumn Marathon.They had taken part in this event before but on a two lap route. This time it was one lap which was ldquotough enough according to Declan.He described it as rolling countryside and said that it felt like there was more up than down, with a bit of a headwind for good measure.On a positive note there were many plus points such as welcome sunshine and blue skies, plenty of support along the road, a great t-shirt and medal and best of all chicken curry at the finish.No wonder they recommend this race. All three men were pleased with their run. Declan set himself a target of : and worked hard up to  miles to give himself a cushion for the inevitable slowing after miles.His strategy worked well as he completed in three hours  minutes. Phillip Vint ran a commendable three hours  showing no repercussions from his recent efforts in the London Marathon and Dermot Cahill was pleased to lead the trio home in three hours .They were th, th and st respectively out of the  entries. A great showing on behalf of the club.Sam Anderson headed for Shanersquos Castle for the Championship Half Marathon to make the most of the long miles of training that she has put in for the recent Belfast full marathon.She might also have thought that she was escaping the mud of the cross country as the two events coincided.She was wrong though as overnight rain had left the estate very mucky and their mud was mixed with manure so it was a very smelly, sludgy . miles for Sam.With her usual stoicism, she coped with the adversity and came home smiling in two hours .On Sunday, the junior cross-country season got off with a bang at Billy Neill playing fields in Comber.It was the NI and Ulster Even Age Group Championships and there was a massive entry at all ages. Memories of the horrendous weather the last time it was hosted two years ago were still fresh in everyonersquos minds but it couldnrsquot have been more dferent.The sun shone, the wind was light and the ground was dry even though it had poured the night before.The East Down AC junior entry list was depleted over the days beforehand for a number of reasons but in the end the club had eight runners in five races.The runners were in age categories U-, U-, U-, U- and U- based on their age before the end of December .Luke Napier was first up running in the U- boys racewith his sister Cara running in the U- girls racejust after.Cara was also the clubrsquos only female junior running. This was their first race at this level and although they found the pace tough going they really enjoyed it and were excited to be part of an Ulster race with runners from all parts.Luke came nd out of  runners, the biggest junior field on the day, and Cara came th out of  runners.Alex Robinson, Finn Gibney and Freddie Ferguson were next with ,m in the U- boysrsquo race. As always the start was a mad stampede.As with the Napiers, Alex and Freddie were young in their category and it was Freddiersquos first race of this scale.At the finish Alex said he went off too hard but despite this he managed to come th out of  runners. Finn came th and Freddie st.As the runners get older the distance increases and so it was a tough ,m which faced the U- boys.Jacob Crawford and Oliver Robinson have been training hard over the last few months under the watchful eye of their coaches and race tactics were much discussed before the race.Ollie likes to lead from the front but was given strong advice to sit with the pack. He wasnrsquot surethat helped when he got hemmed in on the first shorter lap of the course in the big leading bunch.Jacob was wisely sat close to Ollie but managed to stay out of trouble. The U- race was the first to include a bigger lap which started with a long uphill section.Thankfully the wind was behind them for part of the lap as it had picked up a bit. This was Jacobrsquos first XC race for EDAC and he did the club proud coming th out of  runners.Ollie was just behind in th place with a sprint finish after struggling with a stitch for over half of the race. Last up for the juniors was MacKenzie Murray in the ,m U- boys race.He stayed resolute with the tough competition and came rd out of  runners. The standard at the age groups is high so all the EDAC Juniors should be proud of how they performed.As well as medals and podiums on the day, runners are seeking qualication for the All-Irelands either as an inidual or via slots based on the placing of their club or county.It is fantastic that as a result of their efforts that Alex Robinson and Finn Gibney , Jacob Crawford and Ollie Robinsonand Mackenzie Murrayhave all qualied to run for the County Down team in Santry Dublin on November .This All-Ireland event will literally take them to another level and is an exciting achievement.

work to repair Shrigley clock  ","story":"FRESH appeals have been issued for the restoration of the historic Shrigley clock, with Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey urged to step in to help put the tick back in the ageing structure.Owned by the Housing Executive, the Martin Memorial clock dates back to the Victorian era, with ious calls made over many decades for it to be restored to its former glory.The latest politicians to throw their weight behind the campaign are Strangford MLAs Michelle McIlveen and Harry Harvey who, in addition to raising the issue with Ms Hargey, have contacted Housing Executive chief executive Grainia Long.The housing body is responsible for the clock which had its bell and interior mechanism removed over three decades ago and placed in storage.Many are concerned to see the historic landmark falling into disrepair, but hopeful that it can be restored to be enjoyed for generations to come to reinforce its connection with the villagersquos industrial past.Shrigley was founded by the Martin family, who came from Pott Shrigley in Cheshire in  and who owned the spinning factory in the village.It was powered by water supplied from the nearby Clea Lough and while the mill mdash which is reported to have employed  people at one time mdash has long gone, the clock tower erected by the people of Shrigley in  in honour of the Martin family remains.Ms McIlveen mdash who is also the current Stormont education minister mdash said the clock which enjoys protected status and is one of the last remaining pieces of Victorian architecture in the village.She said while full restoration could be very expensive, there is a need to focus on what can be done in the interim to prevent further deterioration of the clock.ldquoIt is unacceptable that an old clock of this signicance and splendour should be allowed to fall into such a sad state of repair, she declared.Ms McIlveen said that previously, funding was provided for a conservation management plan by the Department for Communities Historic Environment Division which was developed on behalf of the Follies Trust.She said the report found that it would cost almost pound, to fully restore the Shrigley clock tower, a cost which the Housing Executive was unwilling to meet.Ms McIlveen and Mr Harvey said they have written to the housing body to not only highlight its public responsibility to maintain this listed property in its possession, but stressed the importance of the monument to the people of Shrigley:ldquoMonuments such as these are an important snapshot of our history and part of the fabric of our built heritage which should be cherished and protected said Ms McIlveen.ldquoWe have asked chief executive Grainia Long to outline what measures can be put in place ahead of a full restoration of the clock.The MLAs added: ldquoWhile I appreciate that full renovation works might be extremely expensive, it is very important that further deterioration of the monument does not occur.In a response to the Strangford Assembly members, Ms Long confirmed the clock is owned by the Housing Executive and sits on land transferred to it in the early s by the local council.She continued: ldquoThe condition of the monument has been raised with us and other agencies on a number of occasions and I can assure you that I appreciate the interest in our plans for it. ldquoHowever, while we have recently undertaken minor works to de-weed the monument and address any potential health and safety issues, it is our position that, at a time at which we have a signicant funding shortfall for investment in our tenantsrsquo homes, it would not be appropriate to use income derived from rents to fund the considerable costs that would be required to undertake a full restoration.The Housing Executive chief executive said that over the years, the organisation has explored options with others to secure the restoration and long-term sustainability of the monument but that these had proved unsuccessful.However, Ms Long said the Executive remains open to speaking to any interested parties and looking at any proposals.She added: ldquoThe establishment of a trust or the monumentrsquos disposal to, for example, a heritage organisation appear to be the best long-term courses of action and we would be happy to discuss these again with Newry, Mourne and Council and others..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27October2021_vandals.jpg","title":"Vandals target special school  ","story":"A SPECIAL

at Knockevin Senior School which recently opened at the site of the former Castlewellan Primary at Mill Hill.Following one recent incident, staff were forced to close the school.Attempts have been made to strip lead from the roof of the building and, more worryingly, drug paraphernalia has been found in the school grounds and in the vicinity of St Paulrsquos Church of Ireland church which is next door.Underage drinking in the school grounds has also been reported, while electrics and a satellite dish have also been damaged, with staff concerned about the risk the ongoing trouble poses to vulnerable students.Police have been asked to increase patrols and it has been confirmed that additional security measures are to be implemented, with politicians hoping that there are no further incidents during the Halloween holiday.The elected representatives, who have been liaising with Education Authority outreach workers and the anti-social behaviour committee attached to the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership , have called for the Castlewellan trouble to end.They have warned that Halloween must not be used by troublemakers as an opportunity to step up their anti-social behaviour, appealing to those involved in recent incidents to show more respect to education and church properties.Slieve Croob councillors Alan Lewis, Roiacutesiacuten Howell and Cathy Mason mdash who have appealed to anyone who knows those involved in anti-social behaviour to contact police mdash say the trouble must stop.Cllr Lewis, the current PCSP chairman, has appealed to young people to stay away from Knockevin school and the nearby church. He said teenagers who are not a ldquopositive part of the Castlewellan community should remain at home.He visited the school last week where a Halloween party was in full swing and revealed he was disappointed to learn of further incidents of anti-social behaviour.ldquoOnce again, youths had entered the school grounds, climbed on the roof and attempted to remove led, with drug paraphernalia and empty medication packets also found, confirmed Cllr Lewis.ldquoMembers of St Paulrsquos Church leaving a service found empty pill boxes littering the area outside. The fact that a service was taking place did not put these people off and the mentality and lack of respect which is being shown is shocking beyond reason.Cllr Lewis said empty packets of Pregabalin are routinely found at the school and church and warned those who consume them are potentially at risk from blackouts or death.He added: ldquoThere is a fear that over Halloween that the anti-social behaviour will intensy and we hope that does not happen. I will be working with local council staff, police, youth workers and colleagues to ensure the Halloween period is quiet and appeal for a no-nonsense approach to this issue.Cllr Howell she and Cllr Mason recently visited the new school to welcome staff, pupils and parents to the Castlewellan community.ldquoI was deeply disappointed when contacted by the school last week to learn about the anti-social behaviour taking place in the grounds. In one incident, vandalism caused to the property led to the closure of the building, she confirmed.ldquoI am disappointed and frustrated that a small number of youths are causing these issues to a special school. I know first-hand the work and commitment that is put in to delivering the curriculum to the Knockevin children.Confirming that she and her colleague have raised these issues with the PSNI and asked for increased patrols in the vicinity of the school, Cllr Howell said she has also been liaising with Education Authority outreach workers and the PCSP to ensure everything possible is being done to alleviate the ongoing trouble.ldquoNo school should have to face these issues and I would ask for the wider community to be vigilant and report any activity of this nature to police as soon as they become aware of it, she added.Describing the Castlewellan trouble as ldquocompletely unacceptable, Cllr Mason said it will not be tolerated by the community in Castlewellan which is a safe and pleasant place to live.She added: ldquoThe management of the school have reported incidents such as underage drinking, damage to electrics and a satellite dish and roof tiles being broken, along with drug paraphernalia being left on the ground and a multitude of rubbish.ldquoStaff are understandably concerned about the potential risk to pupilsthey were to find any of these items, as well as the potential risk to the youths themselves on top of a school building..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27October2021_hinch.jpg","title":"Victory for ‘Hinch men  ","story":"THIS Intermediate League game started at a fast pace, with both teams wanting to retain possession.Although CI got the ball into the Hinch , the home side showed some great defending and quickly cleared the danger.Hinch continued to display some skilful hockey passing the ball around the back from Andrew Mulholland, Ray Coffey to either Ashley Brown or Craig Harkness on the wings.This enabled Hinch to tactically move the ball up the pitch, allowing Matthew Martin to have a shot on goal.Unfortunately, it went wide hitting the side of the goal while, at the other end, Aaron Donnell was on form in nets, saving any balls getting through the strong defence.During play, Coffey was able to find the back of the net, unfortunately he was just slightly outside the CI circle.The second quarter began with the Hinch men in defensive mode and able to keep the ball out of the net.As time progressed, they settled into the game and pushing the ball up the pitch towards Martin and Adam Dodds while there was some great passing across the back from Mulholland to Harkness across to Brown.The latter was able to work the ball up the pitch, passing to Jason Campbell who saw the opportunity to knit the ball across the CI goal, to be tapped in by the prolic Alex Millar.Quarter three began with Hinch gaining the first of several penalty corners, although were unable to break though the CI defence. aEnd to end play continued with each team determined to score.

All it takes is for the DUP, UUP, TUV, PUP to agree principles within each other’s manesto which promote similar policies and pledges.Consistently %+ of unionists vote in elections with % staying at home. The immense gain of enticing %-% of the stay-at-homers to rally and turn out cannot be ignored. A % unionist turnout would restore unionism as the indisputable community majority.In facing an election, unionists have no choice other than to confront SF-SDLP-Alliance– Greens in the battlefield to overthrow the Union. It can only be achieved through unionists standing shoulder-to-shoulder in the contest.Then, and long overdue I concede, will unionists be trusting and confident in their own intuitions to address what David Montgomery speculates on ‘the emergence of a nation in its own right’.

What’s it been like working with her “It’s completely dferent,” says Riley. “We used to all be in the same room together but because of coronavirus everyone’s off separately having their make-up done so we don’t see each other as much. We’ve not really done much team bonding.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Sheis a completely dferent character.”For now, the -year-old maths whizz is understandably much more focused on motherhood. Her Russian husband Pasha Kovalev, erstwhile dance partner from Strictly in , has been fantastic with their toddler daughter, Maven, who turns two in December.“He’s the best dad in the world,” Riley beams. “He’s amazingly patient and will let me sleep in in the morning and look after her when I’ve been up working late.“He’s taken to being a dad like a duck to water. And Maven looks just like him. He goes to the soft play, the bouncy castle and the park – then I get home and he’s made dinner!”Rachel Riley has decided to remind us all how to ide and conquer once more, mostly by mastering long ision, fractions and alegbraThe presenter started dating Kovalev after orcing her husband, Jamie Gilbert, who was a fellow Oxford University student, in .Today, she is clearly still besotted with her professional dancer other half. “He’s the most unique person I’ve ever met. He’s such a chilled, calming influence. Nothing fazes him.”She’s planning to have her second baby at homeand isn’t intending on going on a massive drive toto her pre-pregnancy weight quickly.“I’ll be breastfeeding, so you need the calories. If you are losing it really quickly it just means you are probably not giving your baby what it needs. The weight comes off in its own time and I’ve got a whole range of dresses ready in dferent sizes for when I go back to work.”She’s still breastfeeding Maven, although she hopes that will subside in the New Year, and hopes to be back at work in January, she says.“When you have a newborn, and especially when you have a toddler as well, you don’t have time for a shower. So when I get back to work someone will be paid to do my hair and make-up. You don’t recognise yourself the first time you go back because you’ve just been in mum mode and haven’t washed your hair for a while.”She and her family live in London and also have an apartment in Manchester, where Countdown is filmed. Kovalev will look after the children while Riley is working on the show, taking the baby in for breastfeeding when she’s on a break.They don’t want any more children after the new baby, she says.“We only want two. You can fit two in the car, that kind of stuff. It was a maths decision,” she says, laughing.They married in Las Vegas in  when she was pregnant with Maven, she recalls.“My friend was taking a sabbatical in the States. She said she was going to Vegas and askedI wanted to come to see Robbie Williams. We said, great. Then, when I was four months pregnant, just before the trip, Pasha said, ‘Shall we get married next week ’ We found a little chapel and I bought my dress the day before the wedding.”This year Riley has written At Sixes And Sevens, a maths book for adults, featuring tips and tricks on how to navigate your way through the minefield of equations, formulas, fractions, algebra and BODMAS , among other conundrums.“I’ve always enjoyed making maths accessible and trying to demysty it, even when I was at school,” she says.Her acumen is clearly rubbing off. “My daughter has already started counting on her hands, one, two, three,” she enthuses. “And she can do it in Russian as well.”Riley, who grew up in Essex, studied maths at Oxford University and clinched the Countdown job pretty soon afterwards. As a top maths scholar, did she ever feel her brain could be better utilised than it is on a popular show “I enjoy what I do,” she says simply. “Being on TV has afforded me lots of opportunities and I’m lucky I get to use my maths background as an advocate for maths and science and numeracy.“Through programmes like It’s Not Rocket Science I get to meet people who want to break the land speed record with the fastest car in the world, I got to interview Tim Peake. I’ve got the background to give me enough confidence to interview these people.”For now though, she is having to take things a bit easier. While knowing that sleep deprivation is coming with the new arrival, she is trying to enjoy her Friday night treat – episodes of Ted Lasso, supporting Manchester Utd , going to the park and meeting friends and family.Riley and Kovalev don’t watch Strictly these days, but do keep in touch with some of her old Strictly cohorts, Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Deborah Meaden, and a while ago they went to Majorca to see Brendan Cole and his family.And though she might feel tired right now, Riley is also planning an energetic future for when she is ready: “Once I’m back on my feet, I’ll be ready for a new challenge,” she says.Thanks to Rachel you can master long ision and fractions once moreOn Countdown, Rachel famously replaced the long-serving fellow maths wizard Carol Vorderman. Like Vorderman, Riley’s role is to handle the placement of tiles on the board for the letters and numbers rounds and to find an exact solution in the numbers roundsthe contestants are unable to do so.Riley’s appointment to Countdown was announced at the same time as new main host Jeff Stelling replaced Des O’Connor the duo of Stelling and Riley was in place for the new series beginning in January .Although she had never had any ambition to become a television presenter, Rachel was encouraged to apply for the show by her mother, and decided to do so because she was interested in the numbers part of the game. Having beaten , applicants for the role, she said: “There’s only one cool maths job around and I was lucky enough to get it so I’m absolutely thrilled”.Since it was first broadcast on January , , Riley has also performed her Countdown role on the comedy crossover spin-off version,  Out of  Cats Does Countdown, alongside comedian and host Jimmy Carr, team masters Susie Dent and Jon Richardson and a revolving door of guest stars including Bob Mortimer, David Mitchell, Richard Aoyade and other comedy greats of our time. While Countdown is seen as a straight light entertainment show, in explaining the dference between the two, Riley sees Countdown as the role she is “happy for her grandmother to see”, while Cats Does Countdown is the more risqué, cheeky role which she shows to her friends.Her new book, At Sixes and Sevens, is described as “an engaging, accessible introduction into how numbers work and why we shouldn’t be afraid of them.”It’s designed for those of us who don’t know our fractions from our percentages, or what is adjacent to the hypotenuse on a triangle or exactly how to help your offspring with long ision since those brain cells very likely perished long ago.According to the blurb: “You won’t be At Sixes and Sevens for long. In this brilliant, well-rounded guide, Rachel Riley will take you back to the very basics, allow you to revisit what you learnt at school , build your understanding of maths from the get-go and provide you with the essential toolkit to gain confidence in your numerical abilities.”Sounds like a tome the less numerically literate could definitely benefit from reading -though flashbacks from the agony of double maths at school may ensue.At Sixes And Sevens by Rachel Riley is published by HarperCollins, priced £..Maven  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most Popular‘I mean, what !

I think this is why my we and I enjoy a nostalgic steam journey when we visit an area with a preserved railway, which we did recently.Although more modern engines are more efficient and cleaner, they seem to me to not have the raw power of a steam locomotive and particularly those that used to haul express trains.This book has made me think of the power we need to live in our journey of le.There may seem to be more modern ways of living with many ideas offered, but the nothing beats the power of God.It may seem old fashioned and nostalgic to think like this, but when I see Godrsquos power at work all other efforts pale into insignicance.The Bible shows Godrsquos power with Jesus healing people, raising the dead and feeding large crowds among other things.It was supremely shown when He died and rose again which is central to the Christian faith.That power is still at work today with countless lives changed when people have an encounter with Jesus and see His power at work on their behalf.We all need help in the journey of le and God is always there for us.May I suggest that we do what The Bible says this week:.remove\"Ask where the good way is, and walk in it and you will find rest for your souls\"PhilipGet involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have had great success with online bridge during the pandemic, but now we have reopened for Face-to-Face bridge our numbers are too small to be viable.Please come and support this historic club. However, letrsquos be positive. We are exploring merging our Tuesday and Friday evening sessions with another club.And,all fails, we will resume online bridge. Penarth Bridge Club will live on!So, here is a recent hand played at a Face-to-Face session where careful judgment by both declarer and the defence were required to achieve the optimum result.The AuctionNorth had seven spades and just seven points, ideal for a pre-emptive opening of three spades. The aim of pre-emptive bids is to put a spanner in the wheel of the defence.However, the danger always is that, as here, your partner has a good hand and so has a dficult decision to make on whether to pass or bid on for game. After some thought, South could see at least six spade tricks, evenhis partner did not have the king of spades.There were also two certain heart tricks, and it ought to be possible to rustle up a trick in diamonds and one more from Northrsquos hand. So, South bid four spades.The playTrick  ndash East was on lead and did not fancy a diamond or a club. And the jack of hearts lead was fraught with danger. So, interestingly, East chose to lead the five of spades, reasoning that his king was safe for a trickNorth held the ace..removeAnd evenSouth held three spades to the ace, North must surely have an entry somewhere to take the spade finesse. Anyway, declarer paused to consider the hand.Without the trump lead the contract would have been secure as he could have ruffed a losing club in dummy. But now things were dficult.North decided to play the ace of spades, hoping to drop a singleton king in Westrsquos hand. But no luck. Tricks  and  ndash Declarer then played a club to his ace, followed by a small club from hand, the trick being won by Eastrsquos king.East was now quite pleased he had decided to lead a trump at the first trick. Trick  - East won the next trick with the king of spades, preventing declarer from ruffing his losing club.Trick  ndash East then led his ace of diamonds, which was ruffed by declarer in hand. Trick  ndash Declarer drew Eastrsquos last trump with his queen, discarding a heart from dummy. But he could now see he still had a losing club and a losing heart, one down, having already lost two tricks.But could there be a squeeze on  Tricks , ,  and  ndash Declarer then rattled off his last four spades, forcing four discards from both East and West. East could see that dummy had to discard before West, so he jettisoned his remaining four diamonds, keeping the jack of clubs and two hearts.Declarer decided to discard one more heart and the rest of dummyrsquos diamonds. West had to hope his partner East held the jack of clubs, otherwise he was genuinely squeezed. So, he discarded the rest of his clubs, keeping his three hearts to the queen.Declarer then played a small heart to dummyrsquos ace. He followed this with the king of hearts. Bad luck, Eastrsquos jack dropped but not Westrsquos queen. Trick  - West then won the last trick with his queen of hearts, declarer only making nine tricks - six spades, two hearts, and one club, one down for a loss of  points.Four spades was a perfectly reasonable bid by South. But well done by the defence for the opening lead and care in their discards.What have we learnt . areful judgement is needed when responding to partnerrsquos opening pre-emptive bid, particularly when non vulnerable, since the pre-emptive bid is likely to be quite weak.. Sometimes it can quite be safe to lead a trump from three to king, as here.Penarth club resultsFriday  October: . Joy Seculer and Mike Downey. Peter Craig and Sean Macdougall.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
