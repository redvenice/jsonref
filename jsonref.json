It also has its own crypt so you can stay forever. I am doing some work on the crypt at the moment, it’s quite a nice crypt, but I am not looking to be buried there.\u0027 A charitable employer Peterson also said an admission fee should be charged which would go towards some small cottages he had built for the labour force which helped construct the tower, at a cost of £30,000 at the time.Entrepreneur Paul said he first took over Peterson\u0027s legacy using the proceeds he made from selling and transporting a Bentley to New York.Paul, who has bought and sold goods and furniture all his life, said: \u0027When we opened as a hotel we had some pretty important guests come to stay including the speaker of the House of Lords and celebrities from stage and screen. \u0027We\u0027ve got a rather nice guest book that comes with the tower.\u0027Paul\u0027s wife Julie said when the family first moved the tower was mostly occupied by pigeons and jackdaws.She said: \u0027One jackdaw became part of the family believing that I was his parent, he spent most of his time on my shoulder telling me what to do.\u0027The spiral staircase was like a helter skelter so we cleared out the tower and it took two lorries to move the debris. After this the tower quickly became an office, a sewing room, a woodworking shop and even a garden shed.\u0027The swimming pool and garden took up most of our time and of course our two children growing up.\u0027We kept the tower tidy and enjoyed amazing views of the Solent, Isle of Wight, winter with the snow on the fields, watching cows driven down the lane to the farm for milking and in June the light summer evenings were spectacular.\u0027We opened our doors to our new gorgeous hotel and restaurant in 1991, this was the most exciting time for all of us, our guests were very varied and enthusiastic about this amazing tower, its place in history and construction.\u0027Nobody complained about the stairs and they forgave us for not offering room service. We made for being new to the business by offering a very special small restaurant run by two talented young chefs at the start of their careers.\u0027The fascination with tall buildings endures, in the recent census the tower has a special position of being the tallest building in Britain occupied by one family.\u0027Life in the tower has settled down and we became dog owners at our son\u0027s request and walked more frequently in the New Forest. We also keep fit by going up the 70 stairs to the bedroom at night.\u0027We all tended to communicate with each other by using our landline at first, or even walkie-talkies, now the mobiles help us, as they are always in our pockets.\u0027Sway Tower: For sheer folly, nothing beats a four-bed home with 330 steps to the top | News | The Times"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/058b47cc4daa45259e594e1d960b8c0000a4b0de/0_415_7703_4621/master/7703.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=937ca3be28d72135e2fc3399855a9071","title":"its made a difference to the family the children going back to school","story":"As primary and secondary schools put measures in place for a partial return, staff, parents and pupils explain to Rosie Mullender how they are adaptingHome schooling has become the new normal for millions of children across the UK. And while there is evidence of broad disparities in the quality of education these pupils are receiving, the majority are unlikely to return to school before September. For certain age groups though, the school gates opened again earlier this month, meaning that students at pivotal points in their learning could have face-to-face access to their teachers for the first time since March.Before reopening the doors of Bonneville primary school to reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils on 3 June, headteacher Andrea Parker spent weeks preparing pupils, staff and the school building itself for a safe and productive end to the summer term.From installing hand sanitisers and distance markers to iding children into “bubbles” with their own classrooms, equipment and playtimes, Parker took pains to keep staff, pupils and teachers safe.Before her doors were opened to the children, she communicated the changes to everyone involved, including in weekly newsletters and a video hosted by teachers showing pupils what to expect on their return.“To see everyone sticking to the timetable – to see parents coming in and lining up on the 2-metre lines as you planned them to do, bubbles of children moving at the right times, and everything running smoothly, makes me exceedingly proud,” says Parker.“It’s been a community effort, and has taken a lot of hard work from education professionals who’ve spent hours perfecting what we need to do in order to get children back to school – we’ve been living and breathing it.“But the result was that there was no reluctance on the children’s part when they came back – they’re thrilled to see their friends and be able to play with each other. The parents have been very grateful too, and our teachers are really happy to be back.”The safety measures put in place at Bonneville have run as planned, with the addition of Friday afternoon “induction days” for any staff who are returning to school for the first time the following week.“Any teachers who were anxious before coming back were reassured as soon as they saw how everything worked,” Parker says. “So we introduced the induction days to give them the opportunity to walk through and see the school in action for themselves before returning.”“We were apprehensive, obviously, but I was desperate for my daughter to go back to Bonneville because she was getting a bit down at home,” says Miriam Paridjanian, whose 10-year-old daughter Rosa was one of those returning. Paridjanian, who is a qualified teacher, found home schooling “very challenging”, and jumped at the chance for her daughter to be able to work alongside her friends again.“Rosa is normally very bright and bubbly, but she just wasn’t feeling happy,” says Paridjanian. “I had a really hard time motivating her – she was getting a bit despondent and unmotivated, and she didn’t want to do the work.“The school seemed to have prepared for reopening very well – there was lots of communication, and I knew if I had any queries they’d be answered – so whenthe offer came to send her back, I took it.“Psychologically, I think children need that routine of getting ready and leaving the house in the morning, and since we sent Rosa back after half term she’s perked up so much – she’s like a different child. It’s made a difference to the whole family.”Despite some initial misgivings, Rosa is equally happy to be back at Bonneville.“I was excited when Mum told me I’d be going back to school but nervous too, in case it didn’t work and we’d have to go back to being home schooled,” she says. “Some parts aren’t great – we have to eat lunch in our classrooms, then go out to play, whereas we’d usually just all eat together in the dinner hall, which is better.“But I’ve made some new friends, because we all play together in our bubble in the playground now, and lessons are easier to do in school because we’ve got help from our teachers. I also like seeing my friends – everything’s more fun with friends.”With primary schools such as Bonneville reopening, the next stage of the UK government’s plans to bring children gradually back into formal education began on 15 June. Years 10 and 12 are encouraged to receive some “contact time” in advance of the summer break, and exams taking place in 2021.Hinchingbrooke school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, is one of the secondary schools that has reopened its doors to years 10 and 12.“I’m extremely proud of our teachers and the whole army of support staff who’ve worked really hard to make the school safe,” says Andrew Goulding, chief executive of a four-school academy trust that incorporates Hinchingbrooke school.“Teaching is a lot more than just imparting knowledge and giving pupils the opportunity to develop their skills. It’s about supporting iniduals and their complex emotions.“Although Hinchingbrooke and many others have done a great job with online learning, there’s no real substitute for being face-to-face with a teacher, because a good teacher motivates students in ways online learning can’t. Fundamentally, teaching is about human interaction.”To prepare for its new arrivals, the school has split its year 12 pupils into two groups, who attend one day a week on Monday and Tuesday. Similarly, the larger year 10 has been ided into three groups, each attending on Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.Between the year groups, some children will attend school every day of the week, and the system allows the school to manage a large number of students across each week during what are key educational years.“It’s really clear from the feedback we’ve had from parents that they’re desperate for their children to get back to school,” says Hinchingbrooke’s school principal, Mark Patterson. “They need that safety net and routine.“Quite a lot of the students, particularly the younger ones, are struggling with self-discipline. But while it’s important for everyone to be back at school, you have to prioritise those students who are nearer to their national exams, because they’re the first ones who’ll be tested externally next year. Giving them some time in person before the summer, so we can direct their learning, is crucial.”Like Parker, Patterson has prioritised communication to reassure students and ease them back into lessons, via weekly virtual assemblies and video call sessions for each tutor group.“We’re one community, and have had to rise to the challenge of keeping that sense of identity through the crisis,” he says. “But when students come back, it’s a dramatically changed picture from the one they left before lockdown. Familiarising them with school again shouldn’t be underestimated.”Returning children have received a set of safety guidelines, and both students and parents have been asked to sign a contract agreeing to abide by them.Safety measures put in place at the time include red circles marked on the ground 2 metres apart to help with queueing, reorganised classrooms with distanced desks and chairs, and one-way systems to ensure students don’t have to pass each other in close proximity. There’s also signage around the school reminding everyone of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand-washing and keeping their distance.Year 12 Hinchingbrooke student Rheeya Makwana, 17, had to learn how to adapt when she returned to school on 15 June – and so far, she’s pleased to be back.“I can study quite well independently anyway, but it’s better to be back at school,” she says. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom – and although it was obviously quite different being 2 metres away from the teacher, they still tried to teach as normal.“Seeing my friends again was so great, too. During lockdown, I FaceTimed them every day, but it’s different seeing them at school.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Then a voice echoed around the west London housing estate: “We are passing through the valley of the shadow of death, but we are not alone.” It was Sunday 19 April, when the Covid-19 pandemic was at its most intense in London and the earth was shifting beneath our feet.The Rev Pat Allerton, a Church of England vicar, pressed a button on his phone to play Judy Collins’ powerful rendition of Amazing Grace, and something extraordinary happened.Faces appeared behind glass, windows opened and people leaned out. Residents came on to balconies. Some held up small children to see. A woman aided by a walking frame shuffled on to a path. A couple of older men in vests stood with their arms crossed women in hijabs came out of their homes a man wearing a kippah stopped to listen.Amazing Grace faded and Allerton took up his microphone. As he began the Lord’s Prayer, some people bowed their heads, some put their hands together, some mouthed words taught many years before. A few wept. No one laughed or jeered or heckled. In the middle of one of the most cosmopolitan cities on earth, this was a communal moment of spirituality.A month earlier, the Church of England had suspended services and locked its church doors. Mosques cancelled Friday prayers, temples closed, synagogues shut. At a critical moment when people were frightened, uncertain and in desperate need of comfort and hope, congregational prayer and worship, the cornerstone of organised religion, was no longer. Faith leaders were forced to find new ways of reaching out.Allerton decided that if people were unable to go to church, he would take church to the people. He rented a cargo bike, borrowed a sound system and bought a portable generator online. He was uncertain how people would react to his bite-sized services on the streets, in estates and outside hospitals. But he said: “I’ve been amazed by the response. People feel very emotional. They are looking for answers.” The crisis had shown a “spiritual hunger out there”, he added.Five million people tuned in to a service led by Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, at a makeshift altar on his kitchen table on 22 March, broadcast on the BBC and Facebook. The C of E, which has seen a steep decline in churchgoing in recent decades, said it was the largest single “congregation” in its history.Clergy at St Martin-in-the-Fields in Trafalgar Square were astonished to find more than 1,000 people joining their online morning prayer sessions. At St Nics in Durham, more than 2,300 people watched a streamed service one Sunday in March, compared with a normal attendance of about 300.The Church of England launched a 24-hour free phone line for Christian worship and prayer, aimed at people with no or limited access to the internet and offering “words of comfort and hope”. More than 6,000 calls were made in the first 48 hours of operation.Other faiths and denominations saw similar trends. Anglicans, Pentecostals, Catholics, Muslims, Jews, Sikhs, Hindus and others rapidly developed or expanded online prayers and services. Remarkably, the transfer of faith to the easily accessible and informal virtual world unleashed a new experimentation.“People who might be curious but perhaps inhibited by unfamiliar dress codes or arcane rituals discovered they could try out faith anonymously, log in to different services, even cross religions,” said Ed Kessler, founder director of the interfaith Woolf Institute. “You might think: I wonder what happens at Muslim prayers – now you can find out.” Rather like a pub crawl, people could do a “place of worship crawl”.As religious leaders learned to master the mute button, some sought more creative ways to keep the faith.In Stamford Hill in north London, Europe’s biggest ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, the closure of synagogues and the government’s edict to maintain physical distance from people outside one’s household were grievous blows.Two weeks before lockdown began, Jews celebrated the festival of Purim with prayer services and parties, where dancing, singing and embracing almost certainly spread the virus. Two weeks after the start of lockdown, as the Jewish death toll from Covid-19 was rising at an alarming rate, Passover – traditionally another time of communal worship and family feasts – was marked in isolation.For many Jews, the directive from faith leaders to pray at home or online was not simple. Many ultra-Orthodox, or Haredi, Jews have limited access to the internet, and the use of technology is prohibited on Shabbat, the Jewish sabbath. Moreover, a minyan – a physical quorum of 10 males over the age of 13 – is required for prayer. How could they meet both the requirements of their faith and the coronavirus constraints?Joel Snitzer had an idea. The owner of a construction company and the father of 10 children, Snitzer went to the synagogue to pray three times a day before lockdown. Now the synagogue was locked, but perhaps he and his neighbours could form a minyan, each separated in their own back garden.Over a weekend, he built a bimah, a raised platform from which the Torah is read, where his garden meets the garden backing it. He fetched the Torah scroll from his synagogue. The neighbours agreed on a daily act of worship at 9.45am. To all intents and purposes, they created a backyard synagogue.“We’re fortunate to have so many of us living in adjacent properties,” he said one morning in early May. “Jews have had many challenges in our history, and we usually find a way of adapting – and this is what we’ve done now. People are thriving on it, especially the older generation who can’t leave their homes.”After attaching tefillin – small leather boxes containing handwritten parchments – to his forehead and bicep, winding the straps seven times around his forearm and hand, Snitzer adjusted his tallit, or prayer shawl, and climbed the steps to the bimah for their daily act of worship. In gardens and on flat roofs, his neighbours gathered with their prayer books.Not quite all the neighbours: the family living next door to the Snitzers are Muslim. Wass Bham had no problem with daily Jewish prayers. “I think it’s a good thing that people find a way to practice their religion and achieve a sense of community in a safe way at this time,” he said. “Muslims and Jews have a lot in common. And at the end of the day we are living side by side.”By then, Bham had been fasting during daylight hours for two weeks, with another two weeks still ahead of him. Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, was an unprecedented challenge this year, with people unable to go to the mosque to pray after sunset and prohibited from sharing their iftar meals to break the daily fast with loved ones.“This is something completely new for us,” said Mohammed Kozbar, the chairman of the Finsbury Park mosque, shortly before Ramadan began. “We would normally have about 2,000 people coming through the mosque every day – even those who don’t normally pray. Now the mosque is locked and empty. It’s heartbreaking.”The silver lining was the chance to spend more time with his family, he said. With the closure of mosques, Muslim men and women began praying at home together for the first time. It was “one of the small blessings we can see in this horrendous situation,” said Shaykh Ibrahim Mogra, a Leicester imam.The East London mosque, which serves the UK’s biggest Muslim community and usually has around 7,000 people in attendance on Fridays, decided – similarly to Allerton – that if people couldn’t come to the mosque for iftar, they would take iftar to the people. In partnership with the charity Supporting Humanity, throughout Ramadan they delivered hundreds of meals to Muslim and non-Muslim staff at the Royal London hospital.One recipient, Boshura Khatan, a respiratory and cardiac nurse, said the hospital felt like “a war zone” when Ramadan began. She had prioritised her patients over her prayers on many evenings and had often gone home with a “banging headache” after a 12-hour shift in full PPE and with no food or water. Ayesha Khan, another nurse, also had not always found the time to pray. “I feel sad about it, but I also feel I’ve become closer to God through this crisis. My faith has definitely deepened.”For many people, the pandemic has led to a fundamental recalibration of the way we live and what is really important. In contemplating mortality, the question “is this it?” takes on weight and urgency. No wonder there has been some degree of religious revival – but how enduring it is remains to be seen.Now some faith leaders are asking themselves whether the changes in the way they have practiced their faith under lockdown will leave a lasting mark. In conversation with Kessler about the new religious landscape, Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, wondered whether time was up on the concept of religious institutions as “official brokers” between people and God. Joe Aldred, a Pentecostal bishop, said lockdown had “solidified my longstanding sense of wanting to understand God beyond the euphoria of what happens on a Sunday”. Isolation, he added, could “enrich the spiritual experience”.Faith leaders had adapted surprisingly quickly to new circumstances, said Kessler. “They have generated new communities, some of which will survive. But the institutionalisation of religion will be less important in the future. People might want certainty, but they don’t want rigidity.”Allerton had similar thoughts. Of his church congregation, he said: “Like any family, we miss each other and we long to be back together. But there’s been real learning about how to reach out and reconnect with the world. Our message stays the same, but its delivery needs to move with the times.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8161a84ea7248da610194c1541cca38ed5496a0/0_220_3398_2040/master/3398.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecdd76016effaaee231ab036c032a9c4","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"Black Lives Matter protests, protests in Hong Kong and the impact of Covid-19: the most striking photographs from around the world this week"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23383ebdfeb9ecb9979d5ae9ea696d35537e2760/0_0_3549_5327/master/3549.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=114fda46e252af2ccbf05cdc53f9e903","title":"letter from italy this pandemic is showing us who we really are","story":"The coronavirus response, once a parallel dance, has become a chaos of separate choreographiesIn March, the acclaimed Italian novelist Francesca Melandri wrote a letter to fellow Europeans “from your future”, describing experiences of lockdown. Now, as restrictions are eased, she has another message.I am writing to you from Italy, which means I am writing from the accelerated present of the pandemic. What started as a parallel dance among successive epidemics’ charts has become a chaos of separate choreographies. Depending on the country, the dance moves have been authoritarian, orderly and effective, fallible but humane, incompetent, in denial, abusive or even genocidal. The Covid-19 dancehall, however, is the same for everyone. Its walls are covered in mirrors. They are showing us who we really are and there’s no way we can avert our gaze.The lifting of lockdown restrictions brings excitement, relief, anxiety, mistrust and trepidation. Some people will worry that it’s too soon, with the curve still far from being flat. They will stay put if they can, and wait and see. Others have decided that it’s over and will refuse to be stifled both in action and mood. It’s a landscape of ruins – grieving families, rising poverty, mental health crisis, the virus still roaming at large – but invisible for those who haven’t been directly affected. This will change soon.There will be no lifting of lockdown for those at risk due to previous health conditions. They understand better than anyone else that the pandemic is far from over. Will they see the end of it alive?Some healthcare workers will at last be reunited with toddlers who were beginning to forget their face. Others will have to remain quarantined so as to keep saving the lives of strangers. Both regard as a personal insult the word “hero” on the lips of elected officials whose policies curtailed their wages and made their shifts unnecessarily gruelling.Teachers will be happy that nobody ever called them heroes, even though they’re the ones who’ve kept the public education systems running online they too would appreciate better wages.Long-fought gains in gender equality, which required the struggles of generations, have been obliterated in a day, as soon as working women were left without daycare centres.Out of respect to the pain of others, many will hesitate to admit how much they enjoyed lockdown: its slowness, freedom from social pretence and the permission to be unproductive, to relinquish control.Families and couples who avoided petty quarrels like sailors weathering a storm, who took good care of each other, may treasure forever all that unscheduled time together, like a precious gift. For others, instead, lockdown together was hell, but now, with even less money, where can they go?Young people will rush out of isolation to finally have a good time, forgetting to wear their face masks. Older generations will say: “They are irresponsible, they only care about themselves, they are going to kill us all!” Young people will reply: “Let us remind you how you’ve handled climate change.”The collective scale of events highlights the irrelevance of iniduals. This will be embraced without qualms by the naturally empathic and by those women trained since childhood to put the needs of others before their own. It will shamefully confirm instead the secret low self-esteem of narcissists, and turn them into even more histrionic nuisances.All of the above also applies to world leaders. Some of whom, especially the inept ones, will sometimes curse their fate. Why didn’t this impossible mess fall into their predecessor’s lap?The Covid-19 dancehall mirrors are hurling at our face the enormity of the world’s suffering – the decimated Amazon rainforest tribes, the jobless Indian labourer who walked for hundreds of miles towards his ancestral village, the homeless man who slept in the entrance of an office building until metal spikes were placed on the floor – and the understanding that we are all connected.For many of us, this will make the world’s monstrous inequality increasingly unbearable, the environmental catastrophe something to be addressed at all costs, just like the cesspit of racialised history.But not for all of us. “We struggle to pay our bills, we might be jobless soon and our wife just filed for orce. Now, on top of all that, we are meant to feel guilty and repent?” The resentment at being defined as “privileged” will lead some of us to hate those whose existence reminds us that, yes, even if only relatively to them, we were dealt a better hand. And we’ll vote for anyone who promises to allow us to feel separate, superior and not responsible in any way for their pain.Maybe one day we will look back at the quarantine confinement, regardless of how it was for us – traumatic, soothing or just plain odd – not at all like the exceptional experience we thought it was as we were living it. But more like the rehearsal before the dress rehearsal, well before the real drama."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d85c9dd1efd98d63e39ac1131df624a69565db3d/0_243_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84aa2d5b122bb7c8d9f2b12cf722f668","title":"uk buys stake bankrupt oneweb satellite rival eu galileo system","story":"Investment with India made in US firm OneWeb after Brexit locks UK out of Europe’s satellite navigation systemThe UK government has pledged to invest $500m (£400m) in bankrupt satellite company OneWeb, giving it a stake in a business that provides broadband from space.The government, which has proven so far unwilling to take stakes in major British companies hit by the coronavirus pandemic, will receive a “significant equity share” in the loss-making company as it seeks to make “high-risk, high-payoff” investments of the kind advocated by 10 Downing Street adviser Dominic Cummings.The deal, which is still subject to US court approval, is expected to close before the end of the year. It includes a pledge to bring manufacturing of OneWeb’s satellites to the UK, where it is headquartered.Indian telecoms company Bharti will also invest $500m, which will “bring OneWeb a revenue base to contribute towards its future success”, the government said on Friday. Much of India does not have access to high-speed internet.Downing Street said: “The deal will support the UK to be a pioneer in the research, development, manufacturing, and exploitation of novel satellite technologies, whilst boosting UK manufacturing.”The investment is backed by the Unite trade union, which represents many aerospace manufacturing workers, in the hope it will bring secure, high-skilled jobs for workers.However, some space experts have raised concerns over the suitability of its technology for navigational purposes. The government had ambitions to create its own rival to the US’s global positioning system (GPS), although it had reportedly scaled back those plans. The UK has been barred from the EU’s Galileo system because of Brexit.Dr Bleddyn Bowen, a space policy expert at the University of Leicester, told the  last week it was a “tech and business gamble” that the satellites could be redesigned to allow navigation. The existing major satellite navigational systems all use satellites orbiting about 20,000km from the Earth’s surface, compared with only 1,200km for low-Earth orbits.OneWeb’s network has been described as unsuitable for navigational purposes by the UK’s own space agency, according to internal documents cited by the Daily . A spokesman for the agency declined to comment on the documents.Graham Turnock, the UK Space Agency chief executive, said: “Now is the right time to look at new ways to use space to boost the UK’s prosperity, security and global influence, while benefitting people across the whole country.”The satellites were previously built in the US by Airbus, the European aerospace manufacturer, which was also an investor in OneWeb. OneWeb’s main competitor in low-Earth orbit satellites is Starlink, the satellite company run by the billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX.OneWeb was founded in 2012 by American businessman Greg Wyler with the aim of providing cheap internet access around the world through a network of hundreds of satellites. OneWeb had raised $3.4bn in equity and debt to fund its “constellation” of 74 satellites, with plans for a network of 650 covering the globe. However, it failed to secure new funding at the end of March from investors including its largest backer SoftBank, the big-spending conglomerate controlled by Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son. OneWeb filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in the US at the end of March to try to find a buyer.Alok Sharma, the business secretary, said: “This deal underlines the scale of Britain’s ambitions on the global stage.“Our access to a global fleet of satellites has the potential to connect millions of people worldwide to broadband, many for the first time, and the deal presents the opportunity to further develop our strong advanced manufacturing base right here in the UK.”The deal will give the UK a “sovereign global satellite system”, as well as “strategic opportunities across a wide range of other applications”, the government said.Sunil Bharti Mittal, the chairman of Bharti Enterprises, said the low-Earth orbit satellites were the “only viable mechanism through which the ‘last billion’ can be connected”, referring to the roughly 1 billion people in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and India who do not have internet access.The UK will have a final say over any future sale of the company, and over future access to OneWeb technology by other countries on national security grounds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2c1d0ab015b1f7fd1ab186ea1fc211b71a50a29/0_241_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=557d831d7fa7d24bf91db6d275f796b9","title":"theyre all passing the buck uk travel firms flout the law on holiday refunds","story":"Thousands of UK travellers face long struggle to get their money back for trips cancelled because of pandemic Travellers whose trips are cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic face a summer of stress as companies rewrite the rules to avoid refunding them. Thousands of holidaymakers have been struggling since March to get their money back, and the problem is likely to worsen now the government has eased the ban on travelling abroad.Summer bargains advertised by travel firms could be scuppered if new lockdowns are imposed in the UK or overseas. The law entitles customers to full refunds when a flight or holiday is cancelled, but many are being forced to accept vouchers or charged large processing fees.Some companies are stalling claims by passing their liability on to others. Several airlines, which are responsible for issuing refunds under the denied boarding EU regulation, are insisting passengers apply through the agent who handled the booking. Package tour operators have been telling customers to reclaim the cost of their cancelled holiday from travel insurers, despite being liable under the package travel regulations. Some travel insurers have told customers with valid claims to recover the money through their bank or credit card issuer.“Each company is passing the buck,” said Alice (not her real name), who has been struggling since March to get her cancelled flight to San Francisco refunded. “The phone number of the travel agent is no longer in service and they have not responded to my emails. Virgin Atlantic said it cannot refund me directly as it would be in breach of its contract with the agent, and risk “prosecution”. My bank says it’s not liable for the cost under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. And my travel insurance only covers me if the company goes bust.”A spokesperson for Virgin told the Observer that its email had incorrectly referred to the risk of prosecution, but that passengers must apply for a refund through the agent they booked with. “We work in partnership with travel agents, who are best placed to deal with those bookings made directly with them as they have access to the terms of the conditions of the booking and the final price paid, including any extras that may have been purchased,” he said.Virgin’s policy contravenes the denied boarding regulation according to Coby Benson of the consumer law firm Bott \u0026amp Co. “Airlines cannot delegate their legal responsibility to provide refunds, and court proceedings can be issued if they try,” he said. “But this tactic is widespread, and I’m currently representing several thousand passengers trying to claim refunds.”Campaigners say the travel industry is trying to safeguard its finances at the expense of customers. The consumer group Which? says it has been contacted by scores of holidaymakers left out of pocket after being illegally shunted between companies. “These attempts to pass the buck for providing refunds further erode trust in an industry that has repeatedly let people down over this difficult period,” said Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel. “Meanwhile, some insurers and card providers have hardly covered themselves in glory by appearing to move the goalposts on the protection they offer to customers. Airlines and holiday providers that don’t abide by the law must face strong enforcement action from the regulator.”The government regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, says the majority of complaints to its Covid-19 taskforce have been about unfair refund policies for cancelled holidays. It is considering legal action against companies that do not comply with the law. The Civil Aviation Authority has also launched an investigation after finding that only a “minority” of carriers have been issuing timely refunds. A spokesperson said: “We do not expect airlines to systematically deny consumers their right to a refund, and our review is considering whether any further action needs to be taken to protect consumer rights.”It’s certainly risky. The pandemic is on the increase worldwide and countries – or even cities, like Leicester - may declare sudden lockdown, which would either doom your booking or, worse, trap you abroad. Then there’s the government track and trace system which could require you to self-isolate and scupper your plans. If you can’t resist the many bargains out there, start by finding travel insurance that covers Covid-19 risks, then go for a package holiday rather than a DIY compilation. Your trip is a package if you book at least two elements of the holiday simultaneously through the same company. The Package Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements Regulations 2018 require travel companies to return your money within 14 days if they cancel your holiday and any flights are protected by the Atol scheme which prevents you losing money or being stranded abroad if the company you booked with goes bust. However, many travel firms have ignored their legal duty to reimburse passengers during the pandemic, so even with these legal protections you may face a fight and those that do refund are taking many weeks to pay up.If you booked a package holiday, the tour operator would be obliged to cancel it and refund you. If, however, you organised the trip yourself, you would only be entitled to a refund for the elements in the country which has imposed the ban. So if the UK returned to lockdown before a planned holiday to Spain, your flight would have to be cancelled and refunded, but your Spanish accommodation provider would have no obligation to reimburse so long as Spain was still open for tourism. If Spain closed its borders, both the hotel and the airline would have to cancel and refund you. None, provided your flight and accommodation are still available and the country you are going to is open to tourists and on the UK government’s list of places “safe” to fly to. Nor would any insurance policy cover you for a change of heart.Many airlines travel companies are fobbing customers off with vouchers or credit notes for cancelled trips instead of the refunds they are legally due. You don’t have to accept these but may have to reclaim your money through your bank or the small claims court. Under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act, a credit card issuer is jointly liable for purchases of £100 or over if the goods or services don’t materialise. A voluntary scheme for debit card transactions allows you to request a chargeback through your bank which, if successful, reverses the payment to the trader. If you do accept a voucher, it may become worthless if the travel company goes bust. Most travel insurers will not pay out for a cancelled trip when the travel company has a legal obligation to refund.Policies bought before March may cover you, depending on the terms and conditions. Very few new policies will pay out if your holiday is curtailed by Covid-related travel restrictions. A select few allow you to claim if you catch the virus or have to quarantine before you travel and a slightly larger number will pay for medical expenses and repatriation if you are infected on holiday.

Just as the former were liberated from the British sovereign 244 years ago, so the latter were (mostly) liberated from the government’s lockdown rules today. To quote one of the founding fathers of my music collection, George Michael, “Freedom! I won’t let you down. Freedom! I will not give you up.” Also on the theme of enjoying one’s independence, George Michael once sagely asked, “So why don’t we make a little room in my BMW, babe, searching for some peace of mind?”I’m a little confused about what, exactly, we are allowed to do in England today, and it’s possible that sex with a stranger in your car is not yet fine. But one of the first things we were allowed to do when lockdown started to be less locked down was visit a car dealership, and, truly, the nation breathed a sigh of relief over that one. So you probably can now have as much car-based shagging as you like, but only in a BMW showroom. Go on, treat yourself.When I was growing up in the US, my mother would make a flag cake on the Fourth of July, a chocolate cake decorated like an American flag thanks to the judicious deployment of strawberries, icing and blueberries. Eating the flag is almost certainly an act of treason, but one of the tastier ones. As much as I loved the Fourth of July, I thought about its origins as much as I thought about the pilgrims at Thanksgiving, which is to say, not at all. On Jewish holidays, you do nothing but think about the miserable past, because that is how we Jews treat ourselves. But unless you’re a person who spends your weekends in a tricorn hat doing re-enactments of the US civil war, American holidays tend to focus more on the present trappings (flag cakes, turkey) than their less than festive roots (slaughtering the British, killing the Native Americans).Americans could do a lot more with the Fourth of July, and I don’t just mean singing the first act of Hamilton, which all right-thinking people do on a daily basis anyway, surely. It should be a kind of New Year’s Day for the US, with Americans making resolutions every year about how they want the country to be. You might think the constitution serves that purpose already, but the constitution is showing its age these days. It needs to get some retinol, which is constitution-speak for redrafting the second amendment.The UK doesn’t have a constitution, but what better time to write a shiny up-to-date one than on independence day? After all, look at the mess the US is in, with the president and the electorate pinballing from one culture war to the next, minute by minute. Britain, you don’t want this you need to keep a calm focus on the big picture, and as your mum always told you, the best way to do this is to write a list (or, to use its fancy word, a constitution).When lockdown started, many noted how nice the air was without all the car pollution. But our concern for the collective good has slipped away as the national mood has turned crotchety and febrile. Still, it was amazing what a difference it made, even just psychologically, to take my kids to the park without having to fight through plumes of smoke, as if we were Kurt Russell and Billy Baldwin in the 90s classic Backdraft (the world has changed, but I’m still here with my cutting-edge references). So car-free days should definitely be added to the constitution.I would also like Britain to be a place where libraries, nightclubs and pubs aren’t sold off to luxury-flat developers, because of all the things this country has too much of – betting shops, estate agents, news programmes featuring Nigel Farage – “luxury flats” are definitely number one. The deranged fetishisation of the second world war, in which everything from the idiocy of Brexit to the hideousness of coronavirus is compared to the Blitz, also needs to end aside from everything else, it’s quite weird for us Jews how much you guys get off on that war. Also, for the love of God, can you all stop sniping at the BBC? Have you seen American TV? Seriously, you don’t want that.Obviously, there is much to be written in our constitution about the NHS, our schools and the welfare state, and I’ll leave it to the experts to detail that. Sticking with my own areas of expertise, I would like someone to record the definitive meaning of “sorry” in England. It’s not actually true that the Inuit have 50 words for snow, but in England, the word “sorry” has at least 500 meanings, ranging from “I am not sorry” to “You just rammed your shopping trolley into my ankles, you idiot”. This needs to be spelled out as it is incredibly confusing to foreigners (which, admittedly, may be the point). Finally, Britain must become a place where the American snacks Twizzlers and Chex Mix are widely available, as opposed to sold only at very overpriced tourist shops near Oxford Circus (so I’ve, um, heard).Life is starting anew, and it’s ours to shape. We are the change that we seek, as Barack Obama said. Or, as I say, take this independence day seriously, by which I mean, write a constitution and make a flag cake. Believe me, the future will look better already."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bcfb8b8f5a5c021afb034de8606be1982e7db02/0_413_6747_4047/master/6747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b02bfdf8aabc862d95f2eb0a9f7e9ea5","title":"on my radar rachel parris on her cultural highlights","story":"The comedian and Mash Report star on Lemn Sissay’s memoir, Tank and the Bangas’ mindblowing hip-hop, and a very weird podcastComedian and musician Rachel Parris was born in 1984 in Leicester.

You see sitcoms that use it, like Parks and Recreation and 30 Rock, but you don’t see actual shows where they get a word or an idea, and just go. These two guys are amazing together. You can tell when two improvisers have been working together for donkey’s years, because they’re just so good at riffing off each other. In this country, commissioners are so scared of improv, but I really hope this is the start of something… that people watch this and go: “That’s really funny every time – there’s no risk.”Marek Larwood takes famous works of art and tries to recreate them in 15 minutes. It’s really pure. I like that he’s not an expert at it. He did The Hay Wain by Constable and has done some modern and some really classical stuff. They’re not always good, and at the end of every one he goes: “Oh Christ, this is appalling.” He invites people who have watched him to send in the ones they’ve done in 15 minutes. So there is a sort of gallery at the end. It’s really well meaning and quite wholesome.Tank and the BangasI met poet Lemn Sissay through my husband. Lemn wrote this amazing and heartbreaking book last year, which I have only just read. It’s about his journey through the social care system in the 70s and 80s. He publishes the official records of what happened to him when he was a child. It’s incredibly page-turning. The racism that Lemn faced even from his own foster family… you can’t believe what you’re reading. I was prompted into reading it with everything that’s happening with Black Lives Matter.The Anthropocene Reviewed by John GreenThis podcast is so weird. John Green reviews things ranging from tuberculosis to the remote control. He reads these beautifully written essays and at the end gives the thing marks out of five. Things that he’s reviewed include the qwerty keyboard, the human capacity for wonder, the Notes app. The board game Monopoly was an interesting one, because its origins are actually a really damning indictment of capitalism. It was invented by a woman years before it was later released by Parker Brothers, after a man stole the idea and got a patent for it.Viggo Mortensen stars in this film. It’s about a dad raising a family in the middle of a national park in America with no electricity and no contact with the outside world. It starts off being really idyllic, but then begins to explore the reality of what happens when the kids need to go out into the real world. Mortensen plays a very hands-on dad, but you begin to find out the backstory – what happened to his wife, why this life means so much to him. It all gets complicated, but it’s really uplifting and visually beautiful.

Reminiscent of those enchanted species in children’s fables, this ancient sentinel’s huge varicose limbs yawn upwards and outwards, towards a canopy of leaves that scratch the sky. Eight adults linking arms would struggle to encircle its vast girth, proof of the aeons it has stood guarding the edge of Trinidad’s Maracas valley.It could be that this tree was a mere sapling when the indigenous people who first lived here named this land Iere, or “Land of the Hummingbird”. So bewitched were they by these bejewelled creatures that they created a myth to protect the birds, which they believed represented the souls of their dead. According to the legend, the La Brea Pitch Lake – a sprawling bitumen wonder in the south-west of Trinidad, now a Unesco world heritage site – was once the home of the Chima Indians. However, the tribe induced the wrath of the gods by dining on hummingbirds at a celebratory feast. In their fury, the gods opened up the earth and summoned the sulphurous lake of pitch to consume the village and its people.The Amerindians and their myths could not protect the hummingbird for ever. The birds’ population and that of its human defenders was nearly decimated when the first European settlers arrived on the islands 500 years ago. The hummingbird’s striking plumage, exemplified by names such as ruby-throated, emerald-chinned and blue-chinned sapphire, was highly prized in the courts of 19th-century Europe, where its feathers were worn as jewellery. The trade in thousands of birds was only halted with the introduction of the 1918 Migratory Bird Treaty Act. It took decades for the island’s hummingbird population to recover – with some species disappearing altogether.Today, the twin islands of Trinidad and Tobago have 19 species of this tiny creature, each the size of an adult thumb. Hummingbirds are found exclusively in the Americas and this vast continent has approximately 345 species, mostly located in the northern Andes.The Fergusons’ lush garden, in the shadow of the silk cotton tree, teems with hundreds of hummingbirds daily. Fifteen species have been spotted in the garden, including a new discovery in October 2019, the glittering-throated emerald. Entering the space, a tropical oasis of vivid, trumpet-shaped blooms, the air beats with the frenzied wings of these tiny creatures, which flit, zoom and shimmer among the scarlet feeders like miniature rainbow-coloured strobes.So blessed are the Fergusons with these diminutive visitors that they named their home of 34 years Yerette, Amerindian for “home of the hummingbird”.When Theo Ferguson was a young boy growing up in Grenada the beauty of these “fairies of the natural world” eluded him like other boys his age, he occasionally pelted them with stones when bored.It was only later in life, following a long and distinguished career as a scientist and lecturer in agriculture at the University of West Indies’ St Augustine campus that he began to really see the birds.Ferguson returned to Trinidad and “went on a search for a better understanding of myself in relation to the natural world that I live in. The bush is a wonderful place to spend that quiet time and I got very close to nature at that point, taking up bird photography. I discovered a whole new world of beauty that I had been blind to.”Trinidad and Tobago is rich in birdlife: the scarlet ibis, the white egret and the flamingo are just a few of the stunning birds that inhabit the islands, but it was the aerial stunts of the hummingbird when viewed through the lens of a camera that entranced Ferguson.“You cannot see these behaviours with the naked eye and when you view the bird through the long lens, you see behaviours that are unimaginable, you see its agility in the air. You see the uniqueness of each bird. Each bird has its own personality,” he says.“My admiration for the indigenous people of these islands grew because they were able to see the magic of these creatures that I didn’t see for most of my life. They saw the birds as linking the spiritual with the earthly world, and they awarded them special status. When a bird does something amazing that brings out the ‘wow’ in you, I call it the chi moment. It only lasts a fraction of a second but if you can capture that moment and freeze it for perpetuity, it is something so special.”Hummingbirds are true biological wonders: they are the only birds that can hover in mid-air and fly in multiple directions – including backwards and upside down. The speed at which they beat their wings, anything from 25 to 200 times a second, allows them to create vortices that enable spectacular movements such as aerial suspension and plummeting es. A true miracle in miniature, the birds have a resting heart rate of 200 beats a minute and hold the world record for the fastest metabolic rate of any vertebrate on the planet, guzzling nectar for fuel every 10 to 50 minutes. The average life of the bird is five to seven years, but they can live up to 15 years.Taking advice from Trinidad’s Asa Wright Nature Centre, Ferguson created a nectar food drink for the hummingbirds from white granulated sugar mixed with water (brown sugar is poisonous to the birds because of its high iron content) and distributed it in feeders throughout the garden.What happened next was astounding. “We thought we would attract a few birds, but they came in large numbers in their hundreds, sometimes thousands. The garden used to have a few hummingbirds nesting. But hummingbirds love to nest where it is quiet, where they can raise their young without being molested. So we no longer see nests in the garden but they bring their young to feed.”Ferguson became an expert on the birds. “I now get the odd vet calling me. The bird is so tiny, not many veterinary surgeons can treat it. It’s so small you can’t even attempt to put a splint on the wing. We’ve managed to nurse back to health those with a strained wing or so, gently using a pipette to feed them … but some are so badly damaged there is nothing you can do for them.”The birds came in such numbers that Ferguson, now in his 70s and lecturing on leadership development, saw an opportunity to combine two of his life’s passions: nature and educating others to build a better world. After persuading Gloria to open up the garden to visitors – “she thought I was crazy at first” – he educates visitors to Yerette about the world’s smallest bird and how fundamental it is to Trinis’ national character.“Trinidad has a deep emotional connection with the hummingbird. It’s entwined in our history,” he says. “There are documents going back to the 1800s describing Trinidad and Tobago as the Land of the Hummingbird. It’s our longest and most used national symbol – the bird features on the national flag, on airlines, on stamps. One of our most famous carnival costumes – From the Land of the Hummingbird, designed by Peter Minshall in 1974 for his sister Sherry-Ann Guy – is etched into the nation’s memory, a pivotal moment in carnival history.”A few part-time staff help the couple but the enterprise is a small one, by strict appointment only. After nearly a decade of being open, Theo says the project has brought him and his wife great joy.The garden closed on 16 March when the islands went into lockdown because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the couple missed the visitors. But it reopened at the end of June and guests are once again enjoying the garden.“People take nature for granted – it’s there, but because people don’t spend a lot of time in nature they don’t really see the bright lights of nature. It doesn’t attract them as much as the bright lights of the artificial world they live in,” Ferguson says.“When people come to Yerette, all their senses are engaged. The hummingbirds are such lovable little creatures, they force people to fully engage with nature. Visitors call it a sacred place, a sanctuary, a church, an ashram for the hummingbird they have a deep reverence for these creatures.“I truly believe that if one person turns up at Yerette and sees the magic we have created in our backyard and spreads that message, we can begin to change the world around us and how people think about nature one person at a time.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/558060fd22f2f77700da11b17322d6ae2e956c97/0_0_3177_2153/master/3177.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3f31108831ffcee2f41dd8bdcb15b3ac 1400w","title":"family romance llc review werner herzog japan rent a family romance","story":"Herzog tells the story of a Tokyo company that offers stand-ins for absent family and admirers in this thought-provoking tragicomedy shot like a documentaryAccording to its director, Werner Herzog, this surreal, strangely moving tragicomedy, based on Elif Batuman’s 2018 New Yorker article about Japan’s rent-a-family industry, is not a documentary. The scenarios are scripted and there’s no narration or acknowledgment of the gonzo film-maker’s presence. Yet Yuichi Ishii, the real-life head of Tokyo-based rental company Family Romance, portrays a version of himself. Both this metatextual casting and Herzog’s use of handheld camera emphasise the film’s hybrid quality. It might be staged, but it has a scrappy, fly-on-the-wall feel.One of Ishii’s jobs is to perform the role of 12-year-old Mahiro’s long-absent father. The two duck into photo booths and visit a petting zoo, where they encounter a hedgehog called Sweetie Pie. Inevitably, Mahiro becomes attached. “You create illusions to make your clients feel better – you should feel good,” a colleague insists. Later, the vulnerable pre-teen’s mother invites Ishii to live with them. He awkwardly, hilariously, suggests she pay him to fake his own death instead. As Ishii reflects on the ethical limits of his work, there is the uncomfortable sense that his conundrum is real.The genuine emotional service Ishii provides as a stand-in father is treated with solemnity, but so is the transactional reality of the performance.

I admit I had to laugh. It reminded me of the author’s words in 1968’s A Good Heart and a Light Hand: Ruth L Gaskins’ Collection of Traditional Negro Recipes: “It’s amazing to us to think that anyone could grow up without greens, but every time we shop in the supermarket, white women ask in surprise: ‘What in the world do you do with those things?’ ”For many on Twitter, this recipe was a bridge too far. “For other people, collards are a trend – for us, they are a tradition,” food writer and historian Michael Twitty said at the time of Whole Foods’ announcement. But it’s also fair to ask: what is that tradition? In this case, it may have been the peanuts that shocked people. But there is also an impression that old-fashioned, Southern or country-style greens must be boiled to death to be authentic soul food. Any other way, and you might as well just designate the dish #fakesoul. That notion, though, hasn’t always been set in stone.With those words in mind, I tweaked the recipe for sauteed greens, so they cook quickly and their bright colour and firm texture are preserved. The unexpected addition to our holiday dinner table thrilled my niece the year she turned vegetarian.I like the way this poem by Aneb Kgositsile, which I first saw in The African American Heritage Cookbook: Traditional Recipes and Fond Remembrances from Alabama’s Renowned Tuskegee Institute (2001), honours the memory of the dish: “Collards and cornbread, communion meal of daily resurrection.I ate the survival leaf as I stood at the field’s edge,soaking its cure through pores and spirit.”For the smoky soul stock (makes just under 2 litres)2 smoked ham hocks, or 2 smoked turkey wings 2 medium onions, peeled and quartered 4 celery stalks, including leaves, halved 2 carrots, trimmed and quartered 2 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed ½ tsp black peppercorns 2 bay leavesFor the dish1.4 litres smoky soul stock (see above)75g chopped onion1 garlic clove, peeled and minced450g collard greens2 small dried red chilli peppers, or 1 tsp crushed red pepper flakesSalt and black pepper55g all-purpose flour225g  coarsely ground cornmeal1 tsp baking powder1 tsp sugar2 tbsp butterFirst make the stock. In a large, heavy stockpot, bring 2.8 litres water, the smoked meat, onions, celery, carrots, garlic, peppercorns and bay leaves to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, partially covered, for about two hours, until the flavours are well blended the longer you let it simmer, the stronger the broth will be. Remove the meat from the broth and, when cool enough to handle, pull it off the bones (discard the skin, fat, and bones), chop and reserve for another use. Use a fine-mesh sieve to strain the stock, then refrigerate until the fat floats to the top. Use a slotted spoon to skim off and discard the fat, then store the stock, tightly covered, in the freezer.To make the greens, put the stock, onion and garlic in a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat, cover and leave to simmer while you prepare the greens.Thoroughly wash the greens and trim away the stems, if desired. Discard the stems or coarsely chop. Stack two or three leaves at a time on a board and roll tightly into a log. Slice the greens crossways into ½cm-wide ribbons. Drop the greens and chillies into the broth and return to a simmer. Cook, covered, for about an hour and a half for very tender greens you may cook them for less if you have young greens or preferthem with more chew. Season to taste, spoon out 125ml of the pot liquor and set aside.Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, sugar and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt. In a small saucepan, melt the butter. Add the reserved liquor and heat to just below boiling, then take off the heat and whisk into the dry ingredients to make a dough. Leave to stand for five minutes, then, when cool enough to handle, use wet fingertips to shape the dough into six dumplings.During the last 15 minutes of the collards’ cooking time, carefully drop the cornmeal dumplings into the pot with the greens, making sure the dumplings rest in the liquor. Cover the pot and simmer for 10-15 minutes, until the dumplings are cooked through.Serve the greens and dumplings in bowls with plenty of the potlikker.But that was just the beginning. Black chefs continued to adapt macaroni and cheese. In 1911, chef Rufus Estes of the Pullman railroad layered cooked macaroni, cheese, melted butter, salt, and black pepper in a pan, then poured milk over it all before baking. In her 1912 The Kentucky Cook Book: Easy and Simple for Any Cook, by a Colored Woman, Mrs WT Hayes spotlighted two African American culinary practices – croquette making and frying – in her macaroni croquettes, a special-occasion dish. And, of course, today, mac and cheese is still a staple on soul food and holiday menus.This mac and cheese resembles the one Texas caterer Bess Gant rolled up in ham jackets, made of thin slices of ham, like crepes, in 1947. If you’re so inclined, fadd chunks of ham, cooked shrimp or lobster.115g butter, melted, plus extra softened butter, for greasing454g elbow macaroni470g shredded cheddar cheese470g shredded Monterey Jack cheese125ml soured cream3 large eggs, well beaten450g evaporated milk½ tsp salt, plus more to taste¼ tsp white pepper1⁄8 tsp cayenne pepperPaprika, to dustHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)350Fgas 4.

Pour the cream sauce over the macaroni and cheese, top with the reserved cheese and sprinkle generously with paprika. Put the dish on a rimmed baking pan to catch any juices that spill over, then bake for 30-45 minutes, until the cheese is bubbling and the top is browned and crusty. Remove from oven and leave to stand for 10 minutes before serving.• Reprinted with permission from Jubilee: Recipes from Two Centuries of African American Cooking, by Toni Tipton-Martin, © 2019.

Today is the day that here, in England at least, we can finally reopen our restaurants after many months of lockdown. The level of excitement is high, particularly for those of us who love our industry as much as we love our own families, but there is also a deep fear for its future and the livelihood of those who work in it. Across the ocean, some will be celebrating American Independence Day, while others will be asking for a much-needed, soul-searching conversation about broken race relations. In such times, it is hard to talk about just food, but I think it is also vital to focus on the power food has to fix things that are broken and, eventually, to unite.Tater tots are deep-fried cylinders of grated potatoes served in diners and cafeterias across the US. This version is baked, rather than fried, and served with tangy feta yoghurt and coriander oil. Serve as a nibble or a side.1kg baking potatoes (ie, 3-4)Salt and black pepper1¼ tsp cumin seeds, lightly toasted and roughly crushed in a mortar2½ tsp cornflour3 limes – 1 zested, to get 4 tsp, 2 juiced, to get 1 tbsp, and 1 cut in half2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for shapingFor the feta yoghurt80g Greek feta, finely crumbled80g Greek-style yoghurtFor the coriander oil 4 tbsp coriander leaves, roughly chopped3 tbsp olive oil1 garlic clove, peeled and roughly choppedPeel the potatoes, put them in a medium saucepan for which you have a lid, and fill with enough cold water to cover by about 3cm. Season the water with two teaspoons of salt and bring to a boil on a medium-high heat. Turn down the heat to medium, cover and leave to simmer for 10 minutes, or until a knife can slide into the centre of the potatoes but still meets with some resistance (the potatoes shouldn’t be completely cooked through). Drain, run under cold water to stop them cooking further, then pat dry with a tea towel. Use a box grater roughly to grate the potatoes into a large bowl (they will be a little sticky). Add a teaspoon of cumin seeds, all the cornflour, a tablespoon of lime zest, three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper, then, using well-oiled hands, mix everything together to combine.Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)425Fgas 7. Put a small bowl of oil next to your work surface, and start shaping the tater tots. Use a spoon to scoop up about a tablespoon (20g) of the potato mixture, and, again using well-oiled hands, roll it into a compact ball. Shape the ball into a cylinder – don’t worry if it’s not uniform and perfect, but do try to make it as tight and compact as possible. Transfer to a large oven tray (or two smaller ones) lined with greaseproof paper, and repeat with the rest of the potato mix, spacing them slightly apart – you should end up with about 42 tater tots in total. Drizzle the tater tots all over with two tablespoons of oil, then transfer to the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, turning them all once halfway, until nicely golden on both sides.Meanwhile, make the feta yoghurt by whisking the feta, yoghurt, tablespoon of lime juice and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt in a bowl until smooth.Now for the oil: put the coriander, oil, garlic, an eighth of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper in the small bowl of a food processor and blitz smooth.To serve, spread the feta mix on one side of a serving platter and drizzle some coriander oil on top. Pile the tater tots alongside, sprinkle with the remaining quarter-teaspoon of cumin seeds and a teaspoon of lime zest, squeeze the lime halves over the top and serve warm.These enchiladas are a Tex-Mex favourite, and with good reason. The chilli paste is a fantastic condiment in its own right – you could just make that alone, if you like, and keep it in a jar in the fridge, ready to add to sandwiches, sauces and stews.Prep 25 minCook 1 hr 20 minMakes 6, to serve 2350g cherry tomatoes, roughly chopped300g roasting potatoes, skin on, cut into 1cm cubes450g lamb mince6 corn tortillas (choose ones about 15cm in diameter)80g soured cream2 spring onions, trimmed and cut into julienne strips1 avocado, stoned, peeled and cut into 2cm cubes3 jalapeño chillies, finely sliced into rounds2 limes, cut into wedges, to serveFor the chilli paste2 tsp chipotle flakes2 red chillies, roughly chopped¾ tsp ground cumin1 tsp chilli flakes110g tomato paste5 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped½ onion, peeled and roughly chopped75ml olive oil, plus extra for brushingSaltHeat the oven to 240C (220C fan)475Fgas 9.Put all the chilli sauce ingredients in a spice grinder or the small bowl of a food processor with two and three-quarter teaspoons of salt and blitz to a smooth paste, scraping down the sides a couple of times as you go. Transfer half the paste to a 30cm x 20cm oven tray, add the tomatoes to the rest and blitz again to a smooth salsa, to make the salsa roja.Add the potatoes and lamb mince to the chilli paste tray and toss with your (gloved) hands until everything is well coated, breaking apart the mince into small chunks as you go. Transfer to the oven and bake for 35 minutes, stirring once halfway through and breaking the mince apart again, this time with a fork. Scrape the lamb and potato mix into a medium bowl and keep the tray unwashed, because you’ll be using it again later.Turn down the oven to 210C (190C fan)410Fgas 6½. Pile up the tortillas on a piece of foil, wrap them up and put in the oven for six minutes, just to warm through and to make them easier to roll.To build the enchiladas, put a sixth of the lamb mix in the middle of each warm tortilla, then roll up tightly and place seam side down on the reserved tray. Brush the tortillas with a little oil, then spoon the salsa roja on top and bake for 25 minutes.Spoon the soured cream over the enchiladas, drizzle with some more oil, then top with the spring onions, avocado and jalapeños, and serve with the lime wedges to squeeze on top.Cheesecakes and blueberries pies are as American as puddings get. Here, I’ve combined them into one dish. This crostata isn’t overly sweet, which makes it perfect for a brunch spread or an afternoon treat.For the pastry100g plain flour50g wholemeal flour30g icing sugar¼ tsp salt145g fridge-cold unsalted butter, cut into 1½cm cubes65ml ice-cold water1 egg yolk, beatenFor the cream cheese filling200g full-fat cream cheese, softened at room temperature50g icing sugar2 tsp cornflour3-4 limes – zest grated to get 4 tsp, and juiced, to get 1 tbsp½ tsp vanilla bean paste, or vanilla extractFor the blueberries200g blueberries, fresh, or frozen and defrosted20g icing sugar, plus 1 tsp extra, to serveFirst make the pastry. In a large bowl, whisk both flours, the sugar and salt to combine, then add the butter cubes and incorporate them into the flour by squashing each one between your fingers: don’t overwork it though – you want chunks of butter throughout the dough – so just a light squish will do. Add the water and use your hands to gather together the dough into a shaggy mess.Transfer the dough to a well-floured work surface and use a well-floured rolling pin to roll it out into a roughly 30cm x 20cm rectangle. Fold the longer ends in towards each other, so they meet in the centre, then roll over once with a rolling pin. Fold in the shorter ends in the same way as before, roll out again, then fold in half, and then in half again, so you’re left with a square. Wrap in clingfilm and refrigerate for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, make the base. In a medium bowl, whisk the cream cheese, icing sugar, cornflour, a tablespoon of the lime zest, all the lime juice and the vanilla until smooth and with no lumps.In a separate bowl, combine the blueberries and icing sugar, and use a fork or whisk roughly to crush the berries until some are mashed and some are whole.Line a large oven tray with baking paper. On a well-floured work surface, use a floured rolling pin to roll out the chilled dough into a rough, 32cm-diameter circle (it doesn’t have to be perfect). Carefully lift the circle on to the lined tray, spread all over with the cream cheese mixture, leaving a 1cm border all around the edge, then use the back of a spoon to spread it out evenly. Next, dot with half of the crushed blueberry mixture, so there are still some white bits exposed.Use a knife to make small, 2cm cuts about 8cm apart all around the outside of the galette. Take one of the resulting dough strips and fold it inwards towards the centre. Repeat with the next strip, pulling gently so it overlaps slightly with the previous one and seals the previous fold. Repeat with all the strips all around the edge of the galette, then refrigerate on the tray for 30 minutes.Heat the oven to 230C (210C fan)450Fgas 8. Brush the exposed pastry edges with the egg yolk, transfer the tray to the oven and bake for 10 minutes. Turn down the oven to 180C (160C fan)wgas 4 and bake for another 25 minutes, until golden and cooked through. While the crostata is still warm, gently lift it on the baking paper lining to a cooling rack (this will help prevent it getting a soggy bottom), and leave to cool for at least 30 minutes.Lightly dust the crostata with the remaining teaspoon of icing sugar, sprinkle over the last teaspoon of lime zest, and serve with the remaining crushed blueberries in a bowl alongside."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/939d3293d14e1e5c474df5c011d7081583f1fbdf/0_70_4477_2686/master/4477.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11220fb869f26a1e2df137253452c20a","title":"leicester crystal palace premier league match report","story":"It was a struggle, for a long time it was not hugely convincing, but it was a win – and given how things have been going recently for Leicester, that is the most important thing. There must be encouragement too in the fact the goals came from Kelechi Iheanacho and Jamie Vardy, neither of whom have been prolific of late, even if it required Crystal Palace errors to set them on their way.It is three years since Iheanacho joined from Manchester City but his 49th-minute strike was only his ninth in the league for them. That he got the opener does not mean the 23-year-old is back to anything like his best. At one point in the first half, he led a dangerous break only to run down an alley that was less blind than invisible, eventually petering into indecision despite no defender getting close to him. And it was perhaps significant that as Brendan Rodgers added a midfielder to try to close the game down just after the hour, it was Iheanacho who was withdrawn.Still, his goal was evidence his instincts remain finely tuned. Youri Tielemans’ low cross looked too close to Vicente Guaita, but the goalkeeper dithered before making a strange shovelling gesture at the ball as it passed in front of him, allowing Iheanacho to pounce and send Leicester on the way to just their second win in nine games.The suggestion that they haven’t got going since the restart is only partially true. Leicester haven’t really haven’t recovered from the back-to-back defeats to Manchester City and Liverpool over Christmas. They took 39 points from the 17 games before those setbacks they have taken just 19 from the 14 games since. The Champions League qualification that looked all but secure when football shut down remains in jeopardy, with Manchester United, Chelsea and Wolves all closing in.Injuries and the slenderness of the squad, clearly, are part of the problem. Ricardo Pereira’s attacking thrusts from full-back were a large part of how Leicester played, but he has not featured since suffering a serious knee injury in March. James Justin, who arrived from Luton last summer, is 22 and was making only his eighth league start for Leicester – though he almost got his first goal for the club, smacking a 14th-minute drive against the bar.Leicester’s downturn coincided with Wilfred Ndidi’s knee problems in January. Although he missed only five matches, he still has not recaptured the form of the end of last year. The injury problems got worse. Ben Chilwell had required an injection in his heel to start and, after having treatment during the first-half drinks break, he was withdrawn at half-time to be replaced by Ryan Bennett, making his debut for Leicester after joining on loan from Wolves in January.Hand in hand with Leicester’s struggles had been a reduction in the flow of Vardy’s goals. His 100th Premier League goal was just his third since Christmas and was one of the simplest he has ever scored, rolled into an empty net after Harvey Barnes had capitalised on Mamadou Sakho’s slip. His 101st was a classic late breakaway capped by a confident dinked finish. Rodgers had been keen to stress that Vardy’s drought was indicative of a collective failing, and that there has been a problem getting players up alongside him. To that end, he selected Iheanacho alongside Vardy, with Ayoze Pérez deployed behind them.Numbers in forward areas, though, don’t necessarily equal creativity. James Maddison, who missed out after aggravating a hip injury during a substitute appearance in the defeat by Everton, was badly missed. The lack of confidence was reflected in a lack of imagination and an almost complete unwillingness to take risks, particularly before half-time. It was all very cautious, all very predictable.But Palace made two desperate mistakes, Leicester took their chances and then had the wherewithal to hold their opponents at arm’s length. The points may have been the result of Palace’s generosity but, for now, Leicester retain their grip on third."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73b21bd40372dc0d8efc258231b1f4f2ac7f062e/54_0_3391_2035/master/3391.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba8fbf11070473c0f39a445d16719282","title":"manchester united bournemouth premier league match report","story":"Bournemouth took a shock early lead at Old Trafford but Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial each scored to reach 20 goals and become the first Manchester United players to do so in the same season since Dimitar Berbatov and Javier Hernández in 2011.The star, though, was the 18-year-old Mason Greenwood, who struck in each half to take him to 15 for the campaign in what was a topsy-turvy contest that featured two offside goals in addition to the seven legal ones as United ended nine years without a quintuple in the league at Old Trafford.This victory made it 16 unbeaten for Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side and took them into fourth – maybe only briefly as Chelsea play on Saturday night. Yet while it was also a third straight league win for the first time since January 2019 United suffered a few scares and the manager may not be happy with what was a slipshod defensive display.Junior Stanislas scored the opener for Bournemouth as he nutmegged Harry Maguire before beating the equally hapless David de Gea at the near post from a tight angle.By the break Greenwood’s first – a strike of some power – plus Marcus Rashford’s penalty and Anthony Martial’s curled finish in off the bar had United 3-1 ahead.Yet United’s flaky rearguard had Eric Bailly hand-balling an errant Nemanja Matic pass for which the referee, Mike Dean, awarded a penalty that Joshua King smashed home. This preceded the first goal chalked off for offside – by the Bournemouth substitute Arnaut Danjuma – and was followed by one by Rashford.Next, came Greenwood’s second, the youngster skipping right, then beating Aaron Ramsdale with a sweetly hit strike. A breathless contest had its seventh – and final – finish when Bruno Fernandes beat Ramsdale to the goalkeeper’s left with a fine free-kick.By the close United had dominated and though they could not find a sixth were up into a Champions League berth, an inferior goal difference meaning Chelsea will have to beat Watford to take back fourth.Bournemouth, though, are second-bottom, and have to start winning if Eddie Howe’s side are to avoid the drop."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/167bde9baf17b22a7eba0107128b0bb7a16f4320/0_122_3651_2191/master/3651.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c8024f7ae1bbe86d336f1b29da6c03d","title":"norwich brighton premier league match report","story":"The game is almost up for Norwich. In a week meant to herald the start of a great escape, an insipid defeat by a Brighton team heading in a different direction leaves them almost resigned to their fate.Leandro Trossard’s smart finish was enough to seal the victory that almost certainly assures Brighton’s Premier League survival for a third successive season – they look good to match the club’s best period in the top flight between 1979 and 1983.How Norwich must wish for such stability. Even with fixtures against fellow strugglers Watford and West Ham this week a third relegation in seven seasons appears inevitable.“It’s a tough day for us – we knew it was more or less our last chance to be back in the mix,” Daniel Farke said. “The story of our game was the story of our season, we didn’t find the cutting edge and we then make a big mistake.”Norwich’s form since the restart had given supporters little reason for optimism, with the 4-0 capitulation at Arsenal in midweek leaving them almost needing snookers to survive. Before the kick-off Farke insisted there was still hope his side could conjure up a miracle with six matches left but opted to leave the top scorer Teemu Pukki and the rising youngster Todd Cantwell on the bench as he made four changes to the team  who surrendered so meekly at the Emirates last Wednesday.Brighton’s victory over Arsenal and a draw against Leicester had eased their own relegation concerns but with a tricky run-in that includes home games against Liverpool on Wednesday and Manchester City on Saturday, it was important to take another step towards safety. Graham Potter also made four changes following the 3-0 home defeat by Manchester United, with the top scorer Neal Maupay restored alongside Aaron Connolly.Connolly came close to opening the scoring within three minutes after Norwich failed to clear a free-kick but his effort went narrowly over. Brighton were second best yet aside from some neat touches around the box, the home side never seriously threatened.Trossard thought he should have been awarded a penalty after a coming together with Max Aarons, only for the referee, Stuart Attwell, to wave away his appeal. There was nothing Tim Krul could do to prevent the winger from touching home Aaron Mooy’s precise cross from the right just after the drinks break. Not for the first time this season Norwich were the architects of their own downfall, Timm Klose having given the ball away in Brighton’s half.It was a surprise when Norwich emerged for the second half unchanged given the lack of threat coming from Josip Drmic and Ondrej Duda. Dan Burn came within inches of doubling Brighton’s lead when Mooy’s free-kick came off his back and erted just past Krul’s post.Cantwell was sent out to warm up but Pukki, who was taken off at half-time against Arsenal having also been left out of the home defeat by Everton last month, initially remained in his seat. The striker scored 29 times in the Championship last season and would surely have thrived on a cross from Jamal Lewis that flashed across goal.Farke decided to roll the dice in the 67th minute, just after Drmic had registered Norwich’s first shot on target. On came Pukki, Cantwell and the 19-year-old Adam Idah in the hope of rescuing something, although Yves Bissouma almost sealed the points for the visitors, forcing a save from Krul.Norwich had to wait until the third minute of injury time to create an opportunity themselves, when Idah’s header came back off the inside of the post, summing up a deeply frustrating match. As if contemplating what might have been, a disconsolate Cantwell remained on the pitch deep in thought almost 10 minutes after the final whistle.The victory means Brighton have picked up as many points as they did in the whole of last season under Chris Hughton, although Potter warned they are still not over the line. “It’s a great win but I don’t think it makes us safe,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7b740f6fcbd3ed603c13be93c879598ed34c79a/71_132_2249_1350/master/2249.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=755f09285fce1f7b03242a6269ba54b1","title":"football clockwatch leicester v crystal palace blackburn v leeds and more","story":"And that’s your lot. Stay on the site for MBM coverage of Wolves v Arsenal and, later, Chelsea v Watford, plus reports and reaction from this afternoon’s action. Thanks for following. Bye.And while I was talking you through that, Torino pulled a goal back at Juventus deep into first-half stoppage time through Andrea Belotti. It’s 2-1 to the champions at the interval.In the Championship, Leeds give us another excuse to overuse the phrase “16-year exile” as they strengthen their position at the top. Ten points from their final five games will put them back in the Premier League. Brentford in third are now only two points behind West Brom, who host Hull tomorrow, and the Bees must fancy their chances of nicking an automatic promotion spot. Fulham are back up to fourth, and Cardiff in sixth now have a three-point cushion to Derby in seventh.At the bottom Luton and Barnsley played like condemned men today but are still only five and four points respectively from safety and are likely to have Wigan slotted in beneath them when and if the Latics’ points deduction is applied.So what does all this mean for the league tables? Manchester United are now up to fourth, though Chelsea can go back above them this evening, and Leicester remain third, with currently a four-point cushion to fifth. Bournemouth are still second-bottom, a point from safety but having played a game more than Villa and Watford. Palace have 42 points and don’t much care.And here’s Jonathan Wilson’s report on Leicester’s win, and Vardy’s century:And that’s enough to win it for Fulham. They should be good for a play-off place now.A lovely team goal breaks the deadlock at the last.Cardiff have clung on to beat listing Bristol City 1-0 and Stoke have beaten Barnsley 4-0.And Leicester’s lean run has ended - not a performance as emphatic as the scoreline but the manner, and identity, of their goals and scorers will cheer them. Palace thoughts drift closer to that beach.Leeds have won 3-1 at Blackburn – Bielsa’s side get ever closer - and Reading have walloped Luton 5-0. And Man Utd have beaten Bournemouth 5-2 in another scintillating display.An absolutely textbook Leicester, and Vardy, goal, Barnes feeding Vardy on a speedy break and the latter doing his thing.Tom Ince has just curled in a beauty with his left foot to add some more gloss to a victory that has been inevitable for an hour.Juan Cuadrado has doubled Juventus’s lead against Torino. Second-placed Lazio host Milan later tonight by the way.Sending off! Wigan’s sub Joe Garner left his foot too high and he has been, somewhat harshly, given a straight red. As injustices go it perhaps pales compared to your club being taken over by people who don’t seem to have the money but nothing is going right for Wigan.The job Neil Harris has done since taking over at Cardiff has gone a little under the radar, but they look play-off bound at the moment, and they lead now at Ashton Gate, Lee Tomlin feeding Danny Ward with a surging run through the centre before Ward’s low drive.Jamie Vardy comes out of the nervous 90s and has his 100th Premier League goal at last, profiting from calamitous defending from Palace’s Sakho, who lost the ball, Barnes played in Vary who finished comfortably. An actual Leicester win looks in the offing.McCarthy has replaced McArthur for Palace, in what is a long way from a classic at Leicester.There’s no doubt Benrahma meant this, the Algerian sending a crisp instinctive first-times shot into the bottom corner after fine work from Josh Dasilva. What a player, what a side, and what a model Brentford have become for clubs of their stature.Fulham have upped the ante against Birmingham after a lacklustre first half, but can’t make the breakthrough. Likewise for Cardiff at Bristol City.At the King Power, Praet has come on for the scorer, Iheanacho, a surprisingly defensive substitution perhaps. Leicester need to stay alert at the moment, Cahill having just gone close with a header for Palace.It’s that man again! Benrahma executes a bit of trickery down the left, cuts in then out, then curls a cross over an out of position keeper. Did he mean it? Whatever, his attacking audacity was rewarded and Brentford continue to breathe down West Brom’s necks and Wigan’s week goes from bad to worse.And Yakou Meite has scored his fourth of the afternoon against disintegrating Luton.A goal in Serie A. Juventus aren’t hanging about, Paulo Dybala putting the Serie A leaders ahead in the city derby at home to Torino after only three minutes.Luton’s defence has totally given up the ghost at Kenilworth Road, George Puscas applying some salt into their gaping wounds with Reading’s fourth. A couple of bookings to tell you about at the King Power, Marc Albrighton for a foul a few minutes ago for Leicester, and Palace’s James McArthur just now, also for a clumsy foul. Leeds restore their two-goal cushion, somewhat fortunately.

United move up to fourth, at least for the next few hours, after a thrilling win over Bournemouth. Mason Greenwood scored two sizzling goals, while Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford both grabbed their 20th of the season. After seven years of post-Fergie misery, United might finally be going places. Bournemouth, alas, are going down.90+5 min Ramsdale makes yet another save, leaping to his left to tip Fred’s shot over the bar.90+2 min Ramsdale makes another save, falling to his left to push away Fernandes’s long-range shot.90+2 min Pogba’s curling free-kick is punched away by the flying Ramsdale. Good save.90+1 min Gosling fouls James 25 yards from goal. Mata, Fernandes and Pogba are over the ball.90 min Five minutes of added time.89 min A wildly entertaining match is finally starting to peter out. 84 min And now Ighalo misses an excellent chance, clipping the ball wide of the far post after running onto Fernandes’ through pass. He should have scored.83 min Ramsdale makes a fine block from Shaw, who poked the ball towards goal after pulling down Pogba’s lovely crossfield pass.81 min Kelly lunges to make a vital last-ditch tackle on James just outside the area. 80 min United make their final changes: Mata and Ighalo replace Rashford and Martial.80 min A lovely deep cross from James is muffed by Rashford beyond the far post. I think Martial got in his way.79 min Martial wriggles away from Kelly, who recovers excellently to block Martial’s shot at the expense of a corner. It’s cleared by Rico.78 min Rashford’s low cross flashes across the area, just in front of Martial (who was offside) and James (who wasn’t). In the other Premier League game, Jamie Vardy has scored his 100th Premier League goal to put Leicester 2-0 up against Crystal Palace.77 min Jack Stacey comes on for Bournemouth, replacing Adam Smith.75 min Another change: Dan James replaces the remarkable Mason Greenwood.74 min The corner is sliced towards his own goal by King, and Ramsdale dances across his line to make a comfortable save.73 min After some lovely, quick build-up play, Martial’s shot deflects wide off Ake.70 min A replay of the Fernandes goal suggests that Matic’s heel was offside, and he was close to Ramsdale’s eyeline so I’m surprised it wasn’t disallowed. I don’t really understand the laws of football any more.69 min The last time United scored six in a league game was the 8-2 win over Arsenal in August 2011.68 min “Somewhat ironically, I was just mumbling to myself the other day that the only goals that won’t be VAR-checked (and enjoyed with full elan) will be from free kicks,” says Matthew Richman. “How I do appreciate being corrected.”66 min Three changes for Bournemouth. Harry Wilson, Dan Gosling and Philip Billing replace Stanislas, Solanke and Lewis Cook. And Manchester United have brought Fred on for Nemanja Matic.66 min: Rashford has a goal disallowed for offside. It’ll be checked. It was a great move from United, which ended with Rashford sliding in Wan-Bissaka’s cross. It’s extremely close, but his knee was just offside.61 min Ramsdale probably shouldn’t have been beaten on that side. In his defence, Fernandes absolutely smashed it.GOAL GIVEN! Bournemouth thought Matic was offside when Fernandes took the free-kick. VAR decided not.Another brilliant goal! Fernandes whipped the free-kick over the wall and into the far corner, but it’s being checked by VAR.58 min Kelly fouls Martial just outside the area. Pogba and Fernandes are over the ball.58 min A vicious long-range shot from Pogba is blocked by Ake.55 min VAR checked for offside against Rashford in the build-up. It was very tight but the goal stands.This kid is a star. That’s his 15th goal of the season, and it was unstoppable. Matic found him with his back to goal on the edge of the D. He turned and veered to the right, away from Rico, before blistering a rising drive back across goal. It went through the fingers of the leaping Ramsdale and into the top corner. Greenwood has beaten Ramsdale for pace on both his goals, once with his left foot and once with the right.51 min: Danjuma has a goal disallowed for offside! Bournemouth are all over United at the moment. They broke three on three, with Danjuma beating de Gea with a nonchalant toepoke. But he was offside when King put him through on goal.50 min That was a shambolic start to the second half by United. Maguire’s sloppy pass eventually led to Danjuma hitting the post then Matic played an equally loose pass towards Bailly that he had to control with his shoulderarm.Joshua King scores emphatically, sidefooting the penalty into the corner at pace. de Gea went the right way but couldn’t get there.49 min: Penalty given! That’s the right decision.What a start to the second half. This is all a bit of a mess, and VAR are checking whether a) it came off Bailly’s shoulder or the arm and b) whether it was inside the area. Both are very close. I’m not sure there’s enough evidence to overturn the original decision, so I think the penalty decision will stand.47 min: Danjuma hits the post! And now Bournemouth have a penalty for handball by Bailly!46 min Peep peep! United begin the second half in driving rain. Eric Bailly has replaced Victor Lindelof at half-time, while Arnaut Danjuma is on for the injured David Brooks for Bournemouth.Peep peep! Manchester United started sluggishly and went behind to a fine goal from Junior Stanislas, but their response was emphatic. Mason Greenwood added another ruthless finish to his portfolio, Marcus Rashford scored from the penalty spot and Anthony Martial wafted a beauty into the top corner.Anthony Martial gets his 20th goal of the season, and it’s a beauty. United moved the ball patiently from side to side, looking for an opening. Eventually Fernandes found Martial on the left, just outside the area. Shaw made a good overlapping run to distract the defence, which allowed Martial to zip infield and curl a quite glorious shot into the far top corner. Brilliant.45 min Three minutes of added time.42 min The corner is headed way by Rashford.41 min King teases Lindelof and wins a corner for Bournemouth.40 min Bournemouth have been bright on the break, so they aren’t out of this game yet.36 min: Brooks has a goal disallowed! It came after a couple of dodgy passes, first by de Gea and then Maguire, but Solanke was offside in the build-up.It’s Rashford, not Fernandes, who takes the penalty - and he scores, sliding it into the bottom-right corner. Ramsdale went the right way but couldn’t quite get there.PENALTY TO UNITED! The corner leads to a scramble in the Bournemouth area and a clear handball from Adam Smith.32 min Rashford’s fierce long-range shot hits Ake and deflects wide.

A couple of no-nonsense, searching, direct passes already. This could be a long evening for David Luiz.2 min: After that hectic start, Arsenal settle themselves by stringing a few passes together across the back. “Bugles, eh? If we’re bringing musical instruments into it, then Arsenal have been progressing from kazoo to tin whistle to recorder in the last three matches, so there’s every hope that they might graduate to something orchestral in this one. Not too adventurous - fife or piccolo would do. Of course, there’s an equal or greater likelihood of that old favourite, the swannee whistle.” Charles Antaki busking it, there, a one-man band.1 min: Within the first ten seconds or so, Traore nearly gets on the end of a Jiminez ball down the middle. Martinez does extremely well to block his toe-poke on the edge of the Arsenal box. What a start that would have been!Wolves get the ball rolling. But only after everyone takes a knee of solidarity, respect and love. Black lives matter.Nuno Espirito Santo speaks. “Every game in the Premier League is a very difficult game. Today we have a very difficult opponent in front of us.”Mikel Arteta adds. “It is better than two weeks ago. Tonight’s game is crucial regarding the future. We come here to win the game. We have no margin for error. We are trying to compete as well as we can.”The pubs are open again, aren’t they, ahead of the second wave of coronavirus. Here’s one in Wolverhampton, named after Billy Wright, the legendary captain of England and Stan Cullis’s three-time champions of the 1950s. See how the fans congregate with a view to raising a glass to the great defender and leader of men. However, Arsenal fans of a certain vintage may not remember Wright with quite so much affection, the Gunners having descended into extreme mediocrity during his stint as manager in the mid-60s. The low point of Wright’s mid-table reign was a match against Leeds, played out in front of a Highbury crowd of 4,554. One of the punters brought in a bugle, and treated everyone to a tinder-dry rendition of The Last Post. Ah well, nobody’s perfect.In today’s 3pms ... Leicester City snapped their miserable sequence with a precious 3-0 win over Crystal Palace, while increasingly impressive Manchester United played out an absurd and highly entertaining 5-2 win over Bournemouth. That puts a wee bit of pressure on Wolves to respond in the chase for a place in next year’s Champions League: Leicester are now six points clear of Wolves in third, while United are up to fourth and three points ahead. Wolves are about to play their game in hand if they win, they’ll barge Chelsea out of fifth spot, for a couple of hours at least. (Frank Lampard’s side host Watford tonight.)Wolves make one change to the XI that started the 1-0 victory at Aston Villa last weekend. Adama Traore replaces Diogo Jota, who drops to the bench.Arsenal make three changes to the team that battered Norwich 4-0 midweek. Cedric Soares, Bukayo Saka and Eddie Nketiah take the places of Hector Bellerin, Alexandre Lacazette and Reiss Nelson, who are all named as subs. There’s no room in the squad for Mesut Ozil or Matteo Guendouzi, while Nicolas Pepe is missing as his wife has gone into labour.Wolverhampton Wanderers have had the better of Arsenal since their return to the big time in 2018. They’ve played the Gunners three times, winning one at Molineux, drawing the other two at the Emirates. This fixture last year saw Nuno Espirito Santo’s excellent side run out easy 3-1 winners on current form - as the only side with a 100 percent winning record in the league since lockdown was lifted, having gone 405 minutes without letting in a goal - they’re favourites to do something similar again this evening.Having said all that, Arsenal are beginning to turn their Project Restart world around, after a dismal start that saw them lose to Manchester City and Brighton. They’ve since won three on the bounce, against Southampton and Norwich in the league, and Sheffield United in the cup. A win here today would extend their lead over Tottenham - the upcoming north London derby is going to be a belter - and keep their faint hopes of Champions League football next season alive.But it’s Wolves, realistically, who are much more likely to claim a place at Europe’s top table. A win here would be priceless, as they dream of their first European Cup campaign since 1959-60 and the heady days of Stan Cullis. Much to play for, then, as two of England’s oldest and grandest clubs lock horns. It’s on!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/891d0a67418d6c94ae3673cf0071b1c999b11657/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83bafa3e8f2714e57f1ac19b3eb87300","title":"kale to kimchi 12 foods that are good for gut health","story":"The contents of your shopping basket can have a huge impact on your wellbeing, so stock up on the items which can help to promote digestion and a healthy gutWe’ve probably never been more aware of how the groceries we choose impact on our health. Who among us hasn’t tried to resist the lure of the cake aisle? The connection between food and wellbeing seems particularly salient when it comes to gut health. And, it turns out, by making simple changes to our diet, we can start to take care of our tummies. Try popping some of the items listed below into your shopping basket and see if you notice a difference.Potatoes Pile plenty of potatoes into your shopping bag, but resist peeling them because their skins contain fibre. Fibre helps to maintain a healthy digestive system, passing through our small intestine without being broken down. The UK government recommends we aim for 30g of fibre a day although British adults manage to eat only around 19g on average. Potatoes are also a source of resistant starch, a form of starch that can’t be digested in the small intestine and so is classified as a type of fibre. This, too, may aid gut health.WholegrainsChoosing wholegrain varieties of bread and pasta is an easy way of boosting your fibre intake. Unlike the refined grains used in white bread and pasta, whole grains include the bran, the fibre-rich outer layer that gets stripped when grain is refined. Remember to check the label on any packets you buy so you can be sure about the ingredients, fibre content and nutritional values. European regulations state that a product claiming to be a source of fibre should contain at least 3g of fibre per 100g or at least 1.5g of fibre per 100 kcal, while a product claiming to be high fibre should contain double those figures.Wheat bran A daily intake of 10g of wheat-bran fibre is known to support your gut health by helping to accelerate the transit of food through your intestines. An easy way to boost your intake is by eating breakfast cereals high in wheat-bran fibre, such as the Kellogg’s high fibre range, which includes Bran Flakes, All-Bran Original and Fruit \u0026amp Fibre.Oats These are another handy breakfast option. Oats are known to provide a type of fibre often referred to as soluble fibre. This fibre dissolves in water and forms a gel in the gut, which can beneficially impact digestion and metabolism. Remember oats aren’t just used to make porridge but are the basis of muesli, oatcakes and oat bread.Leafy vegetables Parents down the generations have told children to “eat up your greens”, and it turns out they were right. For example, broccoli and kale can provide a source of fibre.Probiotics and fermented foods We can enrich the ersity of our gut microbiome by eating probiotics – technically defined as live bacteria that, when consumed in a viable form and adequate amounts, are beneficial to health. Kefir, a fermented milk drink, is an example of a food providing a probiotic source. Such foods may complement a fibre-rich diet, in the context of gut health. Other fermented foods such as certain yoghurts, sauerkraut, miso and kimchi are examples of probiotic sources.Bulgur wheatIf you’re bored of potatoes but need something on the side, this wholewheat grain is your friend. It comes in four sizes, from fine to very coarse, and is great as a basis for salads. Mix it with anything from tomatoes and cucumber to parsley and lettuce, for a tasty side dish.PulsesThese come in all sorts of varieties, with some of the most familiar being lentils, chickpeas and kidney beans. All three contain fibre, as well as resistant starch, and can be added to soups, stews, curries or salads.Nuts and seedsPumpkin, sunflower and flax seeds are handy if you’re looking for a fibre snack while on the go. Nuts and seeds can be sprinkled on stir fries, blitzed into curries, stirred into homemade cereal bars, or added to breakfast cereals. And don’t forget nut butters, which come in varieties such as cashew and almond as well as peanut.Assorted fruitsIf you fancy something sweeter, remember that plenty of fruits contain fibre, such as strawberries, blackberries and pomegranates. Avocados might be savoury but they are a fruit, and another good option.BananasWhen green, these are a good source of resistant starch. As a rule of thumb, the greener the banana, the more resistant starch it contains, so try to eat them before they turn completely yellow.PrebioticsFibre reaches the large intestine undigested. Once there, some types of fibre become “food” for the good bacteria in our gut. These types of fibre are referred to as prebiotics. Small amounts can be found in foods such as chicory root, onions, garlic and artichokes. But you can also opt for foods with added prebiotic fibre."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf479be0a5b8ca436ddcd7e6e5c0b586a4c25edf/0_195_5835_3504/master/5835.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=103a4f7f1dd0e2892a9569695091d78a","title":"english pubs pour first pints for customers since lockdown began","story":"Establishments across country welcome back drinkers after latest easing of lockdown rulesEnglish pubs poured their first pints since mid-March on Saturday morning, some as early as 6am, after laws allowing them to open their doors came into effect.While the vast majority of pubs do not have a licence to serve at the crack of dawn, several welcomed customers for a breakfast-time drink after more than three months standing empty.At the Moon Under Water in Colindale, north-west London, drinkers began filtering in shortly after the doors opened at 8am, ordering beers and breakfasts.On arrival, they were asked to fill out an NHS test and trace form giving their name, phone number and the length of their stay. Markers on the floor indicated where to stand, while plastic screens had been installed at the tills to protect staff and customers. Hand sanitiser dispensers had also been installed in several places.Patrons at the Wetherspoons pub were encouraged to use the chain’s app to buy drinks and food but could still order at the bar the old-fashioned way.Stephen Barrie, 56, a semi-retired binman, nursed the pub’s first pint of the day, a Bud Light poured shortly after 8am. “I thought there’d be a queue but I was the first in the door,” he said. During the pandemic, he bought beer at the supermarket but said “it wasn’t the same”.Krzystof Stankiewicz, 40, a minicab driver, came in at the end of a night shift. “I’ve been waiting for this for three months,” he said. “This situation with coronavirus, all days have been the same, Monday like Sunday, Thursday like Friday.“I listened on the radio and heard this pub was open. I live in Colindale and it’s my favourite pub. I’ll have a beer, go to sleep, then wake up and go to work this evening.”Neither of them are too worried about catching coronavirus in the pub. “It’s everywhere and you can’t stop everything,” said Joe. “There’s no vaccine and there’s not going to be for years so what’s the point? You have to support local businesses and we’ll go to some smaller pubs later on. It’s going to be a bit of a crawl.“The rest of our mates aren’t up yet but they’ll be coming out later. We’ve been missing this for four months.”While the law permitted pubs to open from 6am, very few have a licence to do so.One of the few that does is the Sportsman in Whitworth, near Rochdale, which can lay a claim to having served the first indoor post-lockdown pint in the country.“I would have opened at 12.01am but Boris changed his mind,” said landlord Steve Butterworth.“We had plenty of people in and it was all done properly, with social distancing.”The 6am timing was designed to thwart plans by some pubs to open at 12.01am for late-night drinking sessions lasting into the small hours.Brewery and pub chain Brewdog had planned an invitation-only event at several of its venues, starting at midnight, but had to cancel it at the last minute after the government confirmed the law easing lockdown restrictions would not take effect until the morning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fc89901ab172495bfe32a04be062af475cc4c4a/0_153_2272_1363/master/2272.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1f8e9f039737258f91702ac0eede5a8","title":"fit in my 40s this tennis ball launchers got me running like a jackrabbit","story":"It’s a much better workout than a regular game of tennis – it’s tireless, consistent and it doesn’t have feelingsIn the great list of things I would never have considered without a lockdown, the tennis ball launcher is probably in the top 10. Why have a Slinger Bag when you could have a partner? Why play in your garden when you could go somewhere that was the right size, like a tennis court? All these questions answered themselves when we weren’t allowed out or to see anybody, but even with lockdown easing, it still seems unbelievably versatile.You can play in a titchy garden or on a balcony (get ready to lose a few balls). I saw a video of someone in New York playing it indoors, though I think that’s only if you trust your accuracy or don’t care about any of your stuff. And even with courts tentatively back open, I can still see its superiority over a human partner. It is much more consistent. You can set it to your skill level. And it doesn’t have feelings.I remember ball launchers from my youth and they were pretty lame, puffing out balls asthmatically in a very predictable direction, getting wilder the older and more knackered the machine. This is better and more ergonomic, even before you start playing: easy to manoeuvre, no bother to charge, intuitive to set up. The broad settings are beginner, intermediate and pro, which I didn’t delve too far into (I’m not even intermediate, and nor are the kids, even though one of them, at least, claims to be the best tennis player in the postcode). But there’s also an oscillator pad that basically fires the balls in random directions. This is meant to improve agility, obviously, but it’s also a better workout than a regular game of tennis it’s tireless, has no psychological tells, and has you running about like a jackrabbit to keep up. You can adjust the elevation bar to vary distance and speed, to a maximum of 45mph. You can bring the ball speed down enough to incorporate mini-circuits between balls – ideal for people who like to work incredibly hard and feel nauseous after a short time.In the end, if you have a titchy garden, you can’t escape it: very soon you want more space. It’s on wheels so you can take it to a park, but that feels like a huge breach of modern etiquette. I recommend having an ex-spouse whose garden is gigantic. It’s actually better than a tennis court because when you’re not hung up on what’s in and what’s out, you can concentrate on your own consistency, accuracy, reflexes – all the stuff you need before the rules mean anything.The higher the machine’s speed, the greater the topspin effect, which looks incredibly professional if you can master it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dc7d56aebe71e8ed60f19bad6561f4f78ae066f/0_227_3456_2074/master/3456.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c2acddf61f0a4abb6d049e08c2f280c","title":"gardening tips donate seeds to refugee gardeners","story":"Be creative about watering your garden and plant Mexican giant hyssopDonate this If you have spare packets of flower and vegetable seeds, why not send them to another gardener?

Much later, I learned that in the oldest cultures laughter is the only free emotion. Obviously, fear can be compelled. So can love, if we’re dependent for long enough, we enmesh even with a captor in order to survive. But you can’t compel laughter. It’s a flash of recognition. Never go anywhere you’re not allowed to laugh, including church.I became a grown-up too early, from 10 to 17, a small person responsible for a big person. My mother was ill and often couldn’t look after herself. I never knew what I would find when I got home. Since then I’ve had friends who were the children of alcoholics, and I’ve learned we share some of the same feelings.One of my lowest points was waking up on a summer night with a pool of blood on the floor. My hand had been extended over the bed and I’d been bitten by a rat. My mother got me to a local hospital for a tetanus shot, but when we came home the pool of blood had been licked up. I remember longing for a cage to sleep in. I say this because in cities around the world, there are people living with the same fear right now.The boys in my neighbourhood dreamed of getting out through sports, but the only place I saw women leading free lives was in the movies. So I had the dream of becoming a dancer and literally dancing my way into a better life and world. In high school, I answered an ad and became a magician’s assistant. Briefly, because he left town with the money he was supposed to pay me and a young couple who sang with his act.The women’s movement feels like a big chosen family. From New York to New Delhi, I can find women friends I trust as family. We are communal animals, so it’s important to have the support of others: friends, colleagues, lovers for company and laughter, a rescuer if I’m in trouble, a will to help if they need it.I’m so excited by young women now. Remember, I was a 50s person, so I feel as if I just had to wait for some of my friends to be born. We’ve always been accused of “going too far”. That’s why Robin Morgan wrote a brilliant book with that title. Unless you’re accused of that, you haven’t gone far enough!What we now call the #MeToo movement started in the early 1970s, when women college students first coined the term “sexual harassment” to describe what happened to them on summer jobs. Then the great legal mind, Catharine MacKinnon, wrote this into sex discrimination law. Several cases were brought, all by black women, and there were the Anita Hill hearings that educated the nation. Recently, women have begun to feel OK about coming forward to say that our bodies belong to ourselves. We have yet to explain that there’s no democracy without power over our own bodies.Seeing New York shut down is sad and frightening, yet there’s also a new sense of concern and connection between and among us. People hang out of their windows to sing and shout together, and even on television you see news anchors at home with their books and dogs and children. I think we have a chance for positive change.The virus knows that race, gender, class and national boundaries are all fictions. This could help us realise we are all passengers on Spaceship Earth. I’m hoping that this crisis not only exposes inequalities, but helps us learn what movements have been trying to teach us: we are linked, not ranked.The Truth Will Set You Free, But First It Will Piss You Off!

How did they fare? On day two of lockdown, bone tired after an anxiety-induced sleepless night, I sliced into my forefinger trying to cut through a frozen bagel. I cleaned the wound, dressed it as best I could, and prayed it would heal. It seemed to symbolise my deepest worries: I was going to have to get through this one alone.Like everyone, my concerns about Covid-19 were many – not least that I had a lingering chest infection – but as a solo parent, they were amplified. Who would look after my daughter if I got ill? How was I going to shop for groceries with a child in tow? How would I work as well as look after a child? Friends who suspected they’d had the virus spoke of exhaustion so deep they needed four-hour naps – and these were people with supportive partners. How would I cope alone?The knot in my stomach tightened every time I turned the radio on. To calm myself, I turned off the government’s daily briefing, chopping vegetables instead to the comforting blandness of Bob Harris’s Country Show on Radio 2. I took each long day as it came.When, seven years ago, I made the life-changing decision to have a child on my own, and was lucky enough to get pregnant, I knew I would have to build a support network. We have hands-on grandparents nearby, cousins a 10-minute walk away, a supportive childminder, and her teenagers who babysit regularly. But when Covid-19 struck, that safety net was pulled from under us: it was just me and my five-year-old daughter, with weeks of intense, one-on-one time stretching out before us.I usually filled our spare time with meet-ups, cultural outings, weekends away and sleepovers. It was my way of expanding and peopling our small unit, and staving off the occasional loneliness of solo parenting. The thought of a single day without someone to see or somewhere to be would fill me with a sort of low-level claustrophobia.Single parents, along with many others – from key workers to those from black, Asian and minority ethnic communities from people in care homes to those on precarious incomes – have been hit hard by coronavirus. A group of solo mothers recently submitted evidence to the women and equalities committee on the unequal impact of Covid-19. Talk on my solo mother WhatsApp and Facebook groups pointed to depressing common ground: people reported mental health issues, financial concerns, anger and impatience with their children, and resentment at coupled-up parent friends.Christelle Chamouton is mother to nine-year-old Etienne, and working full time from home as head of contracts for a publishing company. “I snap every time he comes to the room and asks me something, even if it’s just the time,” she says. “Although I am physically present, I don’t have the energy to spend quality time with him.”She is making herself take 30 minutes off a day. “I close the computer to chat to him or hug him or go for a walk, even if it means working in the evening. I try to read in bed, and we have a movie night on Friday – and that’s the extent of my me time.”Sally McIntyre, who works for the NHS and has a four-year-old daughter and one-year-old son, has suffered from the lack of outside stimuli. “There have been no cafes or play dates to lighten any loads, no playgrounds to allow a bit more distracted parenting,” she says. “And all the while, I’ve been shouldering worries I can’t share, and don’t have anyone to hold me while I have a good cry.”Slowly, my daughter and I figured out our new living arrangements. At first, all but the essentials (washing, cooking, laundry, work and sleep) fell away. I worked out what I was good at: engaging her in an hour or two of schooling after breakfast snatching work while she was occupied and, later, while she slept baking together inventing games in the park. And I accepted there were some things I had neither the time nor the energy for, such as endless Zoom dates with my friends or her classmates, yoga, and creative writing. I was consoled by the fact that our day-to-day circumstances were not too different from that of many friends juggling childcare and work.As the first weeks of isolation passed, I began to relax. We whiled away rainy hours doing a 1,000-piece jigsaw, playing cards and board games. She turned six, and we had a socially distanced party with a few neighbours, friends and family.One day, I suggested we take her bike to the park. She had shown no interest, but I was determined she should learn to ride. After an afternoon or two of sulks and frustration, she nailed it. It had simply required the momentum of a few consecutive days’ trying, which our previous lifestyle hadn’t allowed. As she freewheeled round an empty car park she shouted: “I feel so free!” I hadn’t felt so happy in weeks.I’m grateful for a salaried job I can do from home, a roof over our heads, and food on the table. Others have it harder. Lucy Walker is a paramedic working shifts, and a solo mother to two children who have been going to school a few days a week. She has witnessed several colleagues die of Covid-19, and on one day dealt with five patient deaths. When she gets home, she’s shattered.“I feel overwhelmed,” she says. “I no longer have my usual backups, or meals provided by school, so I’m prepping nine meals a day. My children are old enough to be aware that healthcare workers have been dying. I’ve been asking myself, have I been irresponsible, going to work?” She has taken annual leave to avoid having to work nights, and misses the few hours a week she used to get to herself. “I sometimes feel other families don’t really understand: their ‘difficult’ is our ‘normal’.”For Sam Perry, solo mother to a four-year-old boy, dealing with the death of two people she was close to – a friend’s mother and her uncle, both from Covid-19 – has been very hard. “There were two moments when I found myself wailing over the fence, as I just needed a real person, not a screen, to support me. Not being able to be hugged by an adult, and not having another parent who was perhaps less emotionally connected to both losses to explain them to my son, was difficult.”While some friends have reported loving home schooling, I am not one of them (though as a mathematically challenged person, teaching my daughter the basics of ision has been rewarding). I have noticed that I am being more educational with her in our day-to-day lives, asking even more questions, being more curious.She, in turn, has enjoyed being part of my working day, a silent presence in our daily Zoom meetings. She has favourites among my colleagues, and loves seeing other people’s kids pop into shot. But perhaps the biggest change is that we’ve become a more democratic unit. I have never been good at putting myself first. But with two of us at home, jostling to accommodate each other, that thinking has shifted. So my writing group continues to meet once a week, and she has to keep herself busy for an hour a live-stream talk I want to watch at 7.30pm falls in the middle of storytime, so we do stories first and extend bedtime by half an hour.I have learned that there are ways of telling a six-year-old that you need some space that don’t involve shouting. I summon up a firm but friendly tone, one I’ve noticed my childminder use, and suggest a few things she could do by herself. It doesn’t always work, but she can amuse herself far better than I ever gave her credit for.Life got a lot easier on 13 June when single-parent families were allowed to form bubbles with another household, and my daughter went back to school. But although my mum is spending more time with us, I don’t want to overexpose her. We’ve survived three months and counting, my finger has healed, and although I can’t wait for our world to open up, I intend to hang on to our new, improved way of being.• Some names have been changed.Find your tribe Join a friendship group through single-parent family charity, Gingerbread , or start your own.

Baked either by the sun or lurid neon, a tourist hell trading on successive eras of American nightlife notoriety – 40s gangsters, 80s hair metallers – it is not the sort of locale where anyone, let alone a scion of precision-cut, post-mod cultural rectitude, should find inspiration.And yet his 15th solo album, On Sunset, finds the now 62-year-old Weller taking in the avenue on a visit to his son. The years dissolve around him. The Jam played the Whiskey a Go Go in 1977 – punk-enervated modernists sorely disappointed to find a California hippie pall clinging to the area.But on Sunset, “the sun was higher than it ever was before,” this son of Surrey reminisces. Soon, a jazz flute kicks in heady 60s female vocal harmonies and classy vintage string arrangements light up the song’s dazzled take on the passage of time. “The world I knew has all gone by,” Weller notes, without rancour.The song, it turns out, is a microcosm of the album – a sunset-within-a-Sunset, one where Weller ponders maturity and its epiphanies, dancing and inner peace, while flicking through racks of vintage soul sides. This is not the kind of sunset in which mortality looms, but where the gentler evening light casts everything in a fresh aspect. There is warmth and succour here, undercut with a playful scattering of mischievous sounds orchestral soul with eloquent quirks nuances that hark back to Weller’s second band, the Style Council, whose keys player Mick Talbot contributes Hammond organ to three tracks.There is more than a little zen abroad, too. Even before lockdown, Weller’s just-so hair had grown long and flowing. On a song called Village, he extols his own contentment. The video, filmed in his Black Barn studio, features a cameo from a shiny silver statue of the Buddha.Not for Weller the bucket list. He’s pretty kushti where he is. “I don’t need all the things you hold in high regard They mean nothing at all,” he sings, again without disdain.A song literally called Equanimity swerves away from On Sunset’s core soul and solicits the Beatles and David Bowie. There is more than a little Buddhism going on here too. “You suffer hurt because you can’t let go,” Weller sighs benevolently.Where once Weller was synonymous with gruff stylistic intolerance preserved in aspic – the sort of man who watched his barber like a hawk, lest he trim a millimetre off the wrong part of Weller’s chiselled haircut, a cultural figure who could mobilise a motorcade of Lambrettas with just a nod – this ever-more mutable “Changingman” has actually presided over a decade of wild musical experimentation.In 2008, Weller confessed to a penchant for cosmic jazz, releasing Song for Alice, to mark the 2007 death of Alice Coltrane Robert Wyatt played trumpet on it. In 2009, matter met anti-matter on a song called 7 \u0026amp 3 Is the Striker’s Name, a collaboration between Weller and My Bloody Valentine feedback-merchant Kevin Shields. From 2008’s 22 Dreams onwards, Weller has dabbled in all sorts of outre soundmaking, releasing albums as varied as they were regular. Perhaps strangest of all, in January, he released an EP, In Another Room, full of musique concrète.A hangover from that experiment makes its way on to Mirror Ball, the album opener. Despite the glam of the title, the track never actually goes disco, but Weller hymns the liberation of the dancefloor to a blissed-out, nomy-tinged take on soul. Halfway in, the song finds room for analogue warbles, shimmering bits and throbbing pieces, applause. All these excellent found-sound, retro-futurist tendencies aren’t enough to carry Earth Beat, however. Here, a Col3trane guest spot and well-turned textures don’t make up for the song’s pat, woolly lyrics, which impede the consummate glide of the rest of Weller’s words.The album’s most riveting two tracks are – of all things – treatises on value. On Rockets, a graceful and emotive closer, Weller emulates Bowie again, underscoring their shared intonations. The song’s realisations are couched in grace and beauty, but they are bleak. We are puny “little fireworks, exploding in the streets”, just pawns in a bigger power game. “All the wealth is hidden, diamonds that glisten and solid gold,” croons Weller. “We’ll have it all, it’s worthless.”Meanwhile, More is an eloquent centrepiece on an album whose spiritual leaning is a far cry from Oasis calling their most bloated and least mindful album Be Here Now just to ape George Harrison. Weller’s reckonings feel earned.Materialism is a busted flush, muses Weller: “Little came from having more,” he sings. That mere stuff doesn’t make you happy is clearly not news. But intoned in Weller’s inimitable husk – and with a long, gorgeous, funky instrumental passage that refuses to settle on genre – it more than bears repeating."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f8b289e09a3434c54e4b8435379b10cb0ef395a/518_89_4468_2681/master/4468.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b10b22fb0171e8cc9ba3b68c666f2f40","title":"labour unemployment could go way beyond anything weve experienced","story":"Shadow minister Jonathan Reynolds calls for flexibility on furlough scheme and condemns return of benefits sanctions Unemployment could soar to levels “way beyond anything we’ve experienced before” unless the government extends the furlough scheme and gets to grips with the looming crisis, Labour has said.As the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, prepares to deliver his summer statement next Wednesday, the shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “Nothing we’ve seen so far suggests that their response matches the gravity of the situation.”Tens of thousands of job losses have been announced in recent weeks in sectors ranging from airlines to retail, and the claimant count measure of unemployment has more than doubled to 2.8 million since the pandemic began.The government’s job retention scheme, which is currently paying 9.2 million workers’s wages, is due to be wound down in the autumn.Reynolds cited recent analysis from the Institute for Employment Studies which found that without intervention, a second wave of job losses as the furlough scheme is unwound could lead to the claimant count soaring to 4 or even 5 million. “That doesn’t sound alarmist, it doesn’t sound impossible,” he said“I cannot understand why the employment side of this crisis is not the main thing people are talking about. They can see it around them. The furlough scheme has touched every community.”Boris Johnson told the Evening Standard on Friday that the job retention scheme was “keeping people in suspended animation” and must end in October.Employers are being asked to make a progressively larger contribution to the costs of the scheme over the summer months. It is unclear whether alternative forms of support will be put in place to extend the help for hard-hit sectors such as hospitality or the arts.Reynolds said: “There should definitely be flexibility on the furlough scheme. That’s the biggest difference you could make. Extending it beyond the date that has been given, and recognising that some sectors can’t possibly make a contribution at this stage.”He was scathing about the government’s decision to reintroduce benefits sanctions, which have been suspended during the crisis. It means claimants can again be financially penalised if they miss appointments.“Unemployment is high, vacancies are down, the schools aren’t back, people are shielding – the idea that the answer to that is to dock people’s social support because they’re not out looking for jobs … it just looks unthinkable,” he said.Confirmation that sanctions were being restored only came after Reynolds asked the question of his opposite number, Thérèse Coffey, in the House of Commons.As well as extending the job retention scheme, Reynolds urged the government to introduce something like the Future Jobs Fund, the programme drawn up by Labour during the 2008 financial crisis, which created 100,000 taxpayer-funded jobs for unemployed 18- to 24-year-olds.Johnson has said young people will be offered an “opportunity guarantee”, giving them the chance of a work placement or apprenticeship but it is unclear how this will be achieved.Reynolds claimed Johnson’s cabinet may be failing to grasp the gravity of the situation because “a lot of people in government are just so far removed from people who are going to be looking for jobs”.He said: “Politicians often overstate their memories of what it was like when they were growing up, but in the north-east in the 1980s – the miners’ strike, the shipyard closures – my sense of unemployment being the biggest problem around is definitely one I have from childhood.“And I think we know that if you’re unemployed during a crisis, the impact of that in years to come, you never really recover. It has such a scarring impact.”As the man with the job of drawing up Labour’s benefits policy for the next general election, Reynolds argues that the pandemic should be a “Beveridge moment” for the welfare state.Sunak poured £7bn into uprating universal credit and working tax credit payments in March, in what Reynolds says was an implicit acknowledgement that the safety net was inadequate.The government was also forced to create “whole new pillars of support” in the form of the job retention scheme and the self-employment support scheme because the generous “wage replacement” systems that exist in some other countries were not there, he said.“You’ve seen even the government say: ‘The system we’ve got isn’t going to get us through this crisis,’” Reynolds said.Reynolds first won his Stalybridge and Hyde seat in 2010, just as Labour lost power after 13 years. Before that he had worked for his predecessor in the seat, James Purnell.He has held a series of frontbench jobs since then, including rejoining Jeremy Corbyn’s team as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury after Corbyn saw off Owen Smith’s leadership challenge in 2016.After Corbyn stepped aside in April, Reynolds was one of several younger MPs handed prominent roles by Keir Starmer. He turns 40 next month.Like his frontbench colleagues Nick Thomas-Symonds and Annaliese Dodds – Starmer’s shadow home secretary and chancellor respectively – Reynolds has a reputation among colleagues for being clever, hard-working and unshowy.He has previously flirted with ideas considered radical in Labour, including striking electoral pacts with other left-of-centre parties in a so-called “progressive alliance”.His views on the future of the welfare state are being closely scrutinised by the Labour left for clues as to whether Starmer will abandon aspects of Corbyn’s legacy.Asked whether he stood by Labour’s promise to replace the universal credit system, Reynolds said: “We use the language of full replacement, because we are clearly opposed to some of the features of it, like the two-child limit and the benefit cap, and we feel the brand is too tarnished. And also we reject the ethos behind it – that punitive, stick-based system.”But he conceded that any new system would share key features with UC, including bundling once separate benefits into a single payment. “I’m listening to what people say, but my instincts are: because of the lack of a legacy system to go back to, there are merits in combining particularly out-of-work support and in-work support and housing benefit at the same time.” And it would make sense to bundle council tax benefit into the same payment, he added.Reynolds has previously expressed interest in the fashionable idea of a universal basic income – a flat-rate payment made to everyone. But he said there was no “magic wand” to resolve the complex challenges the welfare system needs to meet.“UBI comes up a lot in conversations with members. I’ve always been interested in it because I don’t like means-testing, and I think there’s something in that,” he said. But he warned that the idea faced “two very significant conceptual problems that might be so big they don’t have answers”: how to treat disabled people in the system, “because obviously disabled people need more support and they should get it” and the wide variation in housing costs across the country caused by the dysfunctional housing market.He said Labour had “struggled” politically on welfare in the decade he has been in parliament, as the Conservatives imposed successive waves of benefits cuts. “It was George Osborne who was in the ascendancy after 2010 and we were reacting to it,” he said, referring to the former chancellor’s language of “strivers” and “skivers”.“The biggest problem about that Osborne language, apart from the fact it’s offensive about people, is that it attempts to ide people into a group of people who pay for the system and a group of people who pay for the support,” he said.“It was good politics for the Conservative party – you’d hear those words sometimes repeated back at you when you were canvassing – but it has left us fundamentally with a safety net that wouldn’t have got us through a crisis like this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f7161259a5950eabf076fb4dfba2a127b607b3d/0_334_7200_4320/master/7200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34aa470bdd0f24a436efd5b072b34484","title":"we never ran out of toilet roll the edinburgh eco store thats thriving in lockdown","story":"The husband and wife team running The Eco Larder have been stranded in different parts of Scotland in lockdown, but that’s not stopping them from keeping their zero-waste store openOn 5 June, The Eco Larder co-owner Matthew Foulds had his first day off work for 90 days. Making the most of his free time, he picked up a hire bike and went for a ride. An apt choice, given that when lockdown began, The Eco Larder started offering bicycle deliveries for the first time.This new option is one of the ways that Matthew and his co-owner and wife, Stephanie Foulds, have adapted their business during the coronavirus pandemic. “We started offering a delivery service as soon as the lockdown came into place because of how difficult it was for people to get hold of groceries,” says Stephanie. “And because we’re an environmental company, we decided to do this by cargo bike.”The Eco Larder is a zero-waste social enterprise food store in the Haymarket area of Edinburgh. It opened in November 2018 after a successful crowdfunding campaign helped the couple to raise £23,000. Their vision was inspired by their daughter, who was only six months old at the time. “She’s a really big driver for why we do what we do,” explains Stephanie. “We just wanted to bring her up in a world that takes better care of the planet than we have been seeing over our lifetime.”Juggling a newly established business and a small child is a challenge. Add a global pandemic into this mix? “It was total chaos”, laughs Stephanie, who is currently staying on the Isle of Bute with her mother and daughter. They travelled there before any of the lockdown restrictions came into force so that her mother, who shares their flat in Edinburgh, could recover from a period of ill health, which included a week in intensive care.Until she is able to return to Edinburgh, Stephanie is handling ordering for the store remotely while Matthew keeps the shop doors open with the help of assistant Charlotte Wood.Yet despite the physical ide, they have worked together to adapt their business model as circumstances changed. As soon as the store’s local Post Office shut, for example, they stopped orders of lifestyle products through the website. They also reduced the store’s opening hours to manage deliveries and the extra cleaning now required.The couple are both qualified yoga instructors and have a studio at the back of the store. While the physical classes have had to come to an end for now, Matthew is managing to find time on Sundays to offer a Zoom class for their regular yogis who are still keen for their weekly fix.The lockdown has resulted in more positive innovations too. As well as introducing cargo bike deliveries, The Eco Larder now offers click-and-collect. “It’s a contactless service,” says Stephanie. “We leave the goods outside the shop for people. That’s been really popular now that lockdown is easing.”Stephanie is keen to highlight Matthew’s hard work over the last few months (“I’m really proud of him for everything he’s doing and showing up every single day”), but it is thanks to both of them that their business has done so well. “We never ran out of toilet roll,” says Stephanie with pride.The couple have also been able to draw on support from various sources. Thanks to an existing relationship with a walking and cycling charity, they were able to borrow two cargo bikes and find two volunteers to do their deliveries. Being part of the Visa network has helped too. “Having the support of bigger companies is necessary for smaller businesses,” says Stephanie. “They have the resources to raise the profile of a small business like ours.”The couple have been keen to give back to others, too. Rather than charging for their deliveries, they asked for a £5 donation and put a food box together every week, based on how many deliveries they had, and delivered it to the foodbank at Tollcross community hub, which is close to the shop.Looking to the future, Stephanie and Matthew would like to open another store in Edinburgh as this would expand their zero-waste mission and allow them to reduce prices. “Being the type of shop we are, it’s all small suppliers,” states Stephanie. “It’s just an issue of supply and demand. The more demand that there is, then the lower we can provide prices.Until that is possible, the couple are focused on buying their own cargo bike and offering deliveries on all weekdays, not just three days a week – so Matthew had better get more practice miles in on his next day off too.Shop local.

The life in which I didn’t develop anxiety and agoraphobia.In 1995, aged 23, after years of auditions, my application had been accepted for the Royal Welsh College of Music \u0026amp Drama. My desire to act since the age of eight was firmly cemented and my dreams were coming to fruition. I was living in London so I’d arranged some viewings of potential digs. My boyfriend and I decided to make a trip of it and planned an extended scenic route – a concept now incomprehensible. But by the time we left, I was getting nervous.Anxiety and I were no strangers. At 20, my life became one long panic attack. Ironically, I was more likely to experience claustrophobia at this point and I’d frequently head to London’s West End for relief from my anxiety. But by the time I was off to drama school, I was feeling better, thanks to some CBT and beta-blockers. I was confident it was all behind me and excited about what lay ahead. The nerves I experienced that day, as everyone assured me, were normal.We headed down the motorway – music loud, chatting me eating the cheese and piccalilli sandwiches we’d packed for the journey. But I’d barely finished the last one when I had the mother of all panic attacks and they made a reappearance over my boyfriend’s van.That was the moment my world shrunk smaller than the set of The Truman Show. The moment I became agoraphobic. And 25 years later – I still am.It’s a misconception that agoraphobia is a fear of open spaces. Though the word originates from the Greek for “fear of the market square”, according to the NHS website it is “a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult or that help wouldn’t be available if things go wrong”. Although true, that is a simplistic description of a complex beast whose manifestation is particular to each person. It can morph and shapeshift. Worlds can shrink and enlarge like pufferfish. But generally (though not always) it’s an unfortunate upgrade from the already debilitating panic disorder. It’s the promotion no one wants. At its core, it’s a phobia of having panic attacks (a very real, terrifying physical reaction) in triggering situations, leading to avoidance. It is, ultimately, a fear of fear.When not in the throes of a deadly pandemic, I do go out. Agoraphobics are not all housebound – that’s another fallacy. I love going out and about. But I’ve also developed an irrational system of imagined borders that depict where I can and cannot go.Please don’t expect it to make sense. That’s the whole point. It doesn’t. On one hand, I’m a rational person who friends come to for solid advice someone who’s been a director of a company for 20 years and who has written a novel. On the other, I think I may die because I’ve passed through the traffic lights on Liverpool Road, crossing the line of my invisible boundary.The reasoning behind choosing the “safe” areas is also illogical. Some nearer destinations are out of bounds or a scarier prospect than somewhere further yet familiar. But to clarify, none are far from my house. I’m trapped within the constraints of my hometown – the only occasion where the term “Madchester” would be acceptable. My restrictions aren’t limited to the where but also the when. The only thing worse than a journey is a journey with bad traffic. The vision of red brake lights ahead is a certain trigger. Overheating, nausea, dizziness, palpitations and derealisation are all exacerbated by the fact I can’t escape.Of course, this isn’t a continual state. If you met me, you probably wouldn’t suspect any of this. Most of the time I even forget I’m like this myself. Until I receive an invitation to something I’d like to attend. If it’s outside where I feel comfortable, I contemplate if it’s manageable. I investigate, gather further information, such as parking and other events happening that would increase traffic. Whereas the average person may think, “Oh yes, I’m meeting such-and-such in half an hour,” I would have to practise beforehand, attempt missions to the destination some successful, some failed.Hopefully, the invite would be a casual one with no pressure. But if someone is relying on me or travelling a distance, my worries intensify, forcing me to add multiple disclaimers and caveats. I am certain I’m considered flaky or selfish, but the reality is the opposite. I don’t want to let people down. So, more often than not I reject the offer despite my desperation to go and the reality being that most likely I’d have been fine.Imagine what it’s like dating. I’ve had relationships. I’ve been in love. But I also appreciate it’s difficult for the other person. When talking to potentials online, I dread making the announcement. But then that can create a horrifying lead-up where I declare that there is something so awful about me I need to tell them, that when I do, they’re usually just relieved I’m not a convicted killer. The catch-22 is that being with someone helps. I feel safer with a person I trust and love someone who would be there for me if I collapsed in M\u0026ampS, which in turn would reassure me that I wouldn’t collapse in M\u0026ampS.My mum was my safety person. I could even travel from London to Manchester with her and go to the seaside. When she died five years ago, followed by my dad a few months later, it wasn’t just agonising grief I was dealing with, but my capacity to negotiate the world had gone, too. The pufferfish deflated to the size of an anchovy. I was metaphorically cast adrift, with the additional misfortune of potentially never being able to see the sea again.What about now? At the beginning of March, I started self-lockdown before the lockdown was a thing. Panic disorder, agoraphobia and Covid-19 is quite the cocktail that on a menu would be called “The Life Ruiner”. Going outside was no longer an option. For the first few weeks, my anxiety rocketed, culminating in continual panic attacks and more hand washing than Lady Macbeth. Irrational fears I’ve carried for 25 years became a reality. Going out had a tangible threat. A friend rang me when lockdown came into force and said, “You’ve been waiting for this moment your whole life.”But the fact is, the majority are worried about the virus. I see tweets from people experiencing anxiety for the first time, and even agoraphobia. A friend recently had his first panic attack. It’s strange being more on a level with the norm. If you’re suffering, I can assure you, it is transient. No state of panic or anxiety is sustainable. Yes, my overall disorder has lasted, but it’s not consistent, otherwise I’d now be living at Warwick Service Station after once having an episode there, convinced I could neither continue the journey, nor go back home.The pandemic has forced us to reassess our lives. I wonder if this will be the turning point for me: an extreme-exposure therapy session. I long for the weight to be lifted. When I imagine it is all over, going places doesn’t seem a scary prospect any more. The simple fact of not potentially contracting a deadly virus would make a jaunt to Manchester city centre a total breeze. For the first time in a long while I am optimistic.Yes, life with anxiety and agoraphobia is excruciating at times. It’s often saddening and exhausting and frustrating. But I don’t look back and wish it had all been different because, well, what’s the point in that? Contrary to what some believe, it’s not a choice. I’d rather laugh at its absurdity and remain hopeful it will change for the better while making peace with the fact it may not.Going back to that day in 1995 – if I’d made the journey and attended drama school, the highlights of my career could have been a bit part on Casualty followed by a panto run in Blackpool. I wouldn’t have made the friends I have or experienced the same relationships. If I hadn’t had endless therapy, I wouldn’t understand the complexities of humans to the extent I do, enabling me to write my book. And as for Louis Theroux – well, we’re all allowed one regret.If I Can’t Have You by Charlotte Levin is published on 9 July (£14.99, Mantle).

Fancied horses like English King and Kameko were never seen with a chance as the chestnut eased clear and stayed there to score at 25-1, delivering a record-breaking eighth win in the Classic for his trainer Aidan O’Brien.Khalifa Sat, who was always prominent, stayed on to be second at 50-1, suggesting the steady early pace was to blame for the odd result, along with the beaten jockeys failing to respect the chance of the early leader. Amhran Na Bhfiann nicked third place at 66-1 to complete an outrageously good result for the bookmakers.“I think I got a little bit of a freebie,” said the winning jockey, Emmet McNamara, with happy understatement. It was the first winner he has ridden since October. He reported his instructions from O’Brien as being: “Jump off and go your own tempo”.“I couldnt hear a thing,” he added. “ All I could hear was the horse breathing. I knew I was a few clear, all right. It’s unreal. I can’t believe it.”It made for a Classic double for O’Brien, whose Love had been an impressive winner of the Oaks about an hour earlier.

Then maybe to watch the match, because now, as lockdown eases further, you can be indoors with other people too – as far as you can figure out, from the government guidance, which is over 5,000 words long for England alone.Yes, here: “Indoors in groups of up to two households … you should continue to maintain social distancing.” Hmm, not sure how 2 metres is going to work on their sofa. Or “1 metre-plus”, whatever that looks like.This new lockdown relaxation throws up a whole fresh load of anxiety: about the virus itself, whether you’re going to get it, and whether easing is a good idea or a fast track to a second spike.But also how are you supposed to behave? How do you greet the other household – smile and a wave, elbow bump, or fully-eased hug. What do you bring – your own plates, food, PPE?Jo Bryant, etiquette expert, handily condenses it down to three Cs: consideration, communication and confidence. “If you’re hosting something you have a duty to make sure people can have the option to socially distance. And the option – if they’re not comfortable – to maybe bring drinks or their own cutlery or even food. You need to be very open and loose with the arrangements, allow people to have those options.”Communication is about telling people what to expect, or about how you’ve been at home, “making sure people realise you are aware that people might have different levels of comfort”.She mentions a picture of a wedding that did the rounds, in which people wore different coloured wristbands depending on levels of contact they were comfortable with, from green (“OK with hugs and high fives”) to red (“Hi! I’m keeping my distance”).“Confidence is that very unBritish thing of having the confidence to say what you think,” says Bryant, confidently. “People are putting themselves out of their comfort zone and possibly even breaking the rules because they don’t want to offend.” If you’re not happy about the bottle of ketchup that’s gone through five pairs of hands, don’t have ketchup. Same with distance, stick to what you’re comfortable with, respect what others are.What about that greeting? “Normally I’d give you a hug but I can’t, ha ha ha,” is one suggestion from Bryant. “We are coming out of lockdown, we’ve got a bit of feelgood, approaching it with humour and lightheartedness is a good way of communicating what you’re comfortable with.”Dr Charlotte Hilton, a behavioural psychologist, says that while more freedom is preferable for many, it will also cause increased anxiety about what to do and how to behave. “I guess the recommendation from a psychology point of view is take the point of keeping yourself and other people safe as the starting point.” That might mean wearing a face mask in public, certainly on public transport, hand washing etc.“It has to be a personal decision,” Hilton says. “Some of the difficulty is a lot of these decisions are based on trust in the government, which is notoriously problematic. Particularly when there seems to be this incongruence between science and government, health and economy, it makes the decision-making process more difficult.”Harder still if your decision-making’s a bit wobbly. “After a few drinks in the pub it’s reasonable to think that attention might very well reduce,” says Hilton. “Therefore what we have is much more dangerous behaviour and I think that’s what most people are concerned about.”Professor of health psychology at UCL, Susan Michie, who sits on the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), acknowledges the psychological importance of socialising. “It is really important, and one of the mental-health costs of the pandemic has been isolation and loneliness, especially for younger people, especially for younger men … The issue is about how to enable that in a way that the risk level is commensurate with the situation we are in at the moment.”She points to the still relatively high rate of transmission, that a vast majority of it happens indoors, the lack of a fully functioning test, trace and isolate system. And to the fact that alcohol disinhibits behaviour. “So even for those people who have gone out with really good intentions to keep socially distant, wash their hands frequently, not touch other people etc, after two or three drinks we know that will be out the window.”Visiting another household of people you know and trust is one thing, the pub is another. In a situation of risk assessment and risk management, opening pubs is “the top of the hierarchy of riskiness,” she says. “I think it is a recipe for disaster.”Michie is not impressed with the government’s decision-making on easing then, especially when it comes to indoor pubs. It’s too soon. But what about us, how should we behave? She has more faith in us, pointing out how many people locked down before being told to. “I say carry on exercising your good judgment like you did when you locked down before the government asked,” she says. “Avoid pubs despite the government saying it’s fine to go to them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c1139fb4487225aa5566becb7ec1e419f10ec80/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f80794cc627ac7b780efa1e62fa3016","title":"hidden language hong kong security law residents wordplay","story":"Residents use wordplay including repurposed Chinese Communist party dogma to express frustration Hongkongers are finding creative ways to voice dissent after Beijing blanketed the city in a new security law and police began arresting people displaying now forbidden political slogans.Faced with the sudden threat of prosecution for anything that might promote greater autonomy or independence for the restless city, residents are using wordplay and even subverting Chinese Communist party dogma to express their frustration.On a bridge in the busy shopping district of Causeway Bay, a popular spot for pro-democracy protests over the past year, traffic thunders past fresh graffiti that says: “Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves.”The phrase is taken from the first line of China’s national anthem. While the graffiti could conceivably have been written by a patriotic nationalist, it is most likely a declaration of dissent.Social media and chat forums have filled with suggestions for how to find safer ways to protest after Beijing on Tuesday imposed broad legislation banning subversion, secession, terrorism and foreign collusion.In a semi-autonomous city used to speaking its mind, people would find ways around the law, said Chan Kin-man, a veteran democracy activist who has previously been jailed for his activism.He said: “In a public space, one might either not say anything or use an ’officially-approved’ language to protect themselves. But hidden language is something that cannot be banned by laws.”The local government on Thursday said the popular protest slogan “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times” would now be deemed illegal.For some the phrase represents genuine aspirations to split Hong Kong from China, a red line for Beijing, but for many others it is a more general cry for democracy and an expression of rising frustration with Chinese rule.But coded language is allowing people to keep the slogan alive. One version “GFHG, SDGM” uses English letters from the transliterated phrase “gwong fuk heung gong, si doi gak ming”. Another more complex example mimics the tone and rhythm of the slogan using the numbers “3219 0246” in Cantonese.Chinese characters themselves also provide ample room for linguistic subversion. One phrase people have started adopting online is “seize back banana”, a play on the similar characters in traditional Chinese for Hong Kong and banana.Others have gone for English slogans that appear positive but are a clear dig at Beijing – for example the Trumpian phraseL “Make Hong Kong great”.The first arrest made under the new security law involved a deliberate linguistic challenge. During protests a day after the law was enacted, police announced they had arrested a man with a flag that read “Hong Kong independence”, posting a picture.But attentive web users zoomed in on the flag and spotted that a man had written a small “No” before his much larger phrase.Multiple pro-democracy restaurants and shops across the city have taken down their “Lennon Wall” displays expressing support for the pro-democracy movement after police told people they might violate the national security law.The walls are often made up of colourful sticky notes with protest slogans on them.One cafe replaced its wall with blank memos. “What is essential is invisible to the eyes,” the shop wrote on its Facebook page, citing children’s book Le Petit Prince.Another symbol of defiance that has replaced some protest art across the city is blank white pages. The gesture represents the inability to speak out and also “white terror”, a Chinese phrase used to describe political persecution.“Suppression catalyses people to fight back,” said Chan, who is also a sociology professor. He likened the situation to how people in mainland China reveal dissent or anger towards the government with a wink and a nod.“Hong Kong people will definitely respond more actively, it’s just that it might happen in a grey area,” he said.A slogan that went viral this week was a quote by Mao Zedong: “Those who suppress the student movements will not come to a good end.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dff92751c7221b0989876513f778b6aa9295e06/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fb08827b3f9f5650d256adfda1133ec","title":"hongkongers on chinas crackdown i feel helpless and hopeless","story":" readers in or from Hong Kong share their views on the new national security lawIn late May, a week after Chinese officials announced a plan to impose a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong, the  issued a callout to people who believed they would be affected. We wanted to hear how people felt about the law, how it might change their lives, and how they felt about the last year of protests.The response was overwhelming. Within days we had received more than 30,000 messages from people inside and outside Hong Kong – the most for any  community callout.After the law came into force this week, the contributions continued to pour in. People have expressed fury, frustration and a sense of hopelessness they oppose the law but have no recourse to stop it. Many asked the international community for help. Others mourned the end of a city they loved and lashed out at China’s Communist party. Some said they welcomed the law, hoping for an end to the months of protests that at times turned violent.Here are a few of the messages we received:“Feeling heartbroken seeing the latest developments. It is like waking up in the morning and being told that my home no longer exists. Freedom of speech, rule of law and social justice are the values that Hong Kong represents. If Hong Kong loses these values, Hong Kong will no longer be Hong Kong, and I will no longer be myself” – Sandra, curator in London, originally from Hong Kong“I am frustrated, furious and feel powerless. I have seen this place – with values of justice, openness, ersity, rule of law, freedom of expression – turned into a police state. Many people are disappointed and considering leaving. What worries me most is our young people. Most of them do not have the ability to emigrate. They are too brave. They should not be the ones to sacrifice for this unjust situation” – Louis, 55, in Yuen Long, Hong Kong“I am extremely worried about the future of my homeland. I don’t want Hong Kong to gradually become another Xinjiang. I am scared that writing this could be considered collusion with foreign countries and I will be arrested. If the example of Hong Kong teaches the world anything, it is the necessity of vigilance in preserving the institutions of liberty and democracy with concrete actions. Don’t wait until it is too late” – Cheung, 22, Hong Kong university student“I feel pretty helpless and hopeless. The protesters are afraid they will be caught by the police, or get caught and sent to China. We don’t know what will happen if we are sent to China” – Leanne, 13, student“One country, two systems has totally vanished. Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, is not listening to the demands of the local population but listening to instructions from Beijing. The situation is destroying the freedom, law and order of Hong Kong. The protests a year ago were disciplined and peaceful, but the government is not listening. So people became violent to express their concerns. Riots are the sound of the unheard” – Wong, Hong Kong’s New Territories“The national security law for Hong Kong sets a very bad precedent: the mainland Chinese legislature legislating for Hong Kong. The autonomy of Hong Kong will be eroded and freedom of expression will be restricted. People can no longer express views that are not in line with the Chinese government” – anonymous 59, retiree in Hong Kong“We are facing the end of our treasured, free and open society. As an elderly person, my only contribution to this movement is to give support as much as possible – attending peaceful rallies and marches, whether legal or not” – Samson Cheng, 68, retiree in Hong Kong“So much has died in the last 23 years. Bit by bit, the mainland government has infiltrated Hong Kong, wanting to control it. Watching from afar, it is even more heartbreaking. My nephews will now be brainwashed. They may not even have the right to keep quiet they will be forced to say things they may not believe in” – Linda Chan, 63, retired Hongkonger in London“One thing that worries me is my own future after I finish my studies in the UK. Should I return to Hong Kong? Will I come under their secret surveillance? Will I face retaliation or arrest just because of my political stance? I will have to come to terms with the possibility of never returning to my homeland and being separated from my family for the rest of my life” – 26-year-old PhD student in the UK, from Hong Kong, holder of a British national (overseas) passport“It’s completely nonsense to argue that Hong Kong people have no freedom. What place on earth would allow riots and violent protests to carry on for more than six months? The series of outrageous violent protests are unequivocal evidence of the almost unlimited freedom of speech enjoyed by Hong Kong people. My freedom has never been diminished by the laws and regulations in Hong Kong. The only time that I felt threatened was during the violent protests” – D, 38, lawyer in Hong Kong“I welcome the proposed implementation of the national security law. I truly believe that is the only and effective way to end the mess that we have suffered and been facing since last June” – Catherine, 56, translator, Hong Kong’s New TerritoriesMany of us support the protests and feel angry about what the CCP, the Hong Kong government and the police have done. But we are also pressured by our bosses whose businesses rely on the mainland. We are helpless and frustrated. Some of us are trying to escape to foreign countries but some have got no choice. We do need help from the world. Please” – Chan, 27, surveyor, Hong Kong“Although there is nothing we can do, I will continue to speak the truth. Even though I am scared to death of the law, I can still tweet, sign petitions, donate money. At least I know how to ‘be water’. We are grateful for the sacrifice of the young people and we should not give in. We hope the free world will help us. We will do whatever we can to fight for our freedom. Please continue to stand with Hong Kong” – Cecilia, 53, mother of two, Hong Kong“I wish the UK government could take action to protect Hong Kong and Hongkongers. It is indeed the UK’s responsibility. Why do we have to suffer from their wrong decision? We have shown our passion, our dignity. We built Hong Kong. We contributed our time, our life to the city. Didn’t we do enough?

Now, Kim’s parents are sharing her life and tragedy in a new bookOn a winter night in 2017, Joachim Wall was sitting in front of his daughter’s laptop at his home in Trelleborg, a town of around 45,000 and Sweden’s southernmost. He was going through thousands of pictures, trying to reorganize her archive – a task that would keep him busy for many more months.Suddenly, he heard a familiar ding: Kim, are you there?Joachim hadn’t realized that Facebook was open on one of the browser’s windows, a little green dot next to his daughter’s name, Kim Wall. As soon as he checked the message, he recognized the sender to be one of the women Kim had visited several times in Sri Lanka and then written a story about: the women fighters of the Tamil Tigers.After some hesitation, Joachim decided to reply: This is not Kim, it’s Kim’s father. Do you not know what happened to her?A no was quickly typed on the other end of the chat, and Joachim’s heart sunk: although he had never been in touch with this woman before, he had to be the one to let her know that Kim was gone.Upon hearing the news, more dots appeared immediately as she started typing frantically: Oh no! No! Why Kim? She was my best friend!When Joachim told me this story a couple of weeks ago in mid-June, as I accompanied him and the family dog, Iso, for a long-distance walk over FaceTime from my apartment in New York, I could feel the weight of his words and his silences – each of them still hurt. I imagined him and the former Tamil Tiger, two people who had been strangers until that moment, now crying together five thousand miles apart.Kim Wall was a smart, curious, adventurous and empathetic person. She was an ambitious, talented and dedicated journalist, whose reporting had taken her to far-flung places such as the Marshall Islands and Haiti, North Korea and Uganda, to cover what she called “the undercurrents of rebellion”, chasing counter-narratives and making sure that the voices of those who would normally not be listened to were finally heard.She was a generous friend – the kind whose jokes turned your day around – a loving daughter and sister to her brother Tom, and a girlfriend who was “ridiculously in love” with her partner, Ole, as she often put it. To me, she was a special friend – a “soul sister”, as I wrote before. We met at the entrance exam for Columbia University’s Journalism School in early 2011 and started our careers together, as each other’s first reporting partner.Kim was always on the go, always running after the next thing – a show, an interview, some kind of food she had never tried before – and it would always be worth it, if not for the experience itself, at least because she would have had one more story to tell.On 11 August 2017, Kim became the story: she was reported missing off the coast of Copenhagen, a mere 30 miles away from her home in Trelleborg, hours after boarding the UC3 Nautilus, the world’s largest homemade submarine. She was there to interview its eccentric inventor, Peter Madsen.It was supposed to be a quick interview to top off the reporting Kim had already done on the story, days before she and Ole finally moved to Beijing, starting a new chapter that had been in the works for months. Instead, Kim never came back: the submarine was sunk and the truth with it – at least for the first few days, until a police investigation and the search for Kim’s body shed light on a much more grim reality than anyone could have imagined.It was in those days – when Kim went from “missing” to “slain” – that her mother, Ingrid, started writing what at the time she still didn’t know would become the book she’d co-author with her husband, Joachim: A Silenced Voice: The Life of Journalist Kim Wall, which alternates joyful episodes from Kim’s life and her infinite list of travels and achievements, with a gut-wrenching chronicle of the year that the tragedy of her murder hit the Wall family.“It’s the journalistic way to work,” Ingrid told me when I asked her about how the book came to be. “I think that was the first thing that came in my mind: I have to make notes because I want to be sure in the future of what really happened and when it happened.”Having worked with words for over 40 years, Ingrid’s job conditioning led her to start keeping a diary, which she said at first contained only the hard facts: when did the police call, what did they say, who else reached out.After a couple of days, once it became clear that the worst might have happened, Ingrid realized it actually helped her to put her “feelings into the computer”. She described it as “some kind of healing process”, forcing her to remember all the good times. To that aim, thousands of pictures and videos of Kim were also shared by friends all over the world, which let the Walls finally see some of the adventures Kim had told them about, and learn more about the life of their grown up daughter.The other reason to write was to remain in control of the narrative. “There were hundreds of journalists calling us in different ways and all they all wanted to write Kim’s true story” – Ingrid spelled out the words to emphasise the irony – “in about 2,000 signs or whatever. And we said from the first day that if anyone will write Kim’s story, it will be us, and no one else.”As they told me how the idea of a book started taking shape, Ingrid and Joachim were sitting in their home office, surrounded by a lifetime’s worth of notebooks, boxes of photographs and archives of newspaper clips that had long taken over every inch of the room. I couldn’t stop thinking that a few feet away, in Kim’s room, her whole life was also still piled up in suitcases, Ikea bags and boxes – some that the family had brought back from the home in Copenhagen, and others that had been shipped from her last base, New York, filled with the posters and books I had last seen in her living room.“We must, we will tell who Kim was as a human being, as a friend, as a journalist, as a daughter, a fiancee and sister,” Ingrid continued.As I learnt reading the book, by the end of 2017 more than 60,000 articles worldwide had been written about Kim, her murder and the investigation – which have now surpassed 100,000.“They’re all about the case and about the murderer, but Kim is nowhere – she’s only mentioned as the victim, and we don’t want her to be remembered as the victim.”At the end of November, Kim’s arms are found. First the left, then the right – her writing arm. By then, 111 long days have passed. As have 111 even longer nights.Reading certain passages of the book, my brain still short circuits. In the months that followed Kim’s death, every one of us had a different way of coping with updates about the investigation. Some had set up Google alerts and compulsively read everything that was published about it. Others, like me, preferred not to know for a little longer, and were often alerted by a friend’s kind text message – I just saw the news about Kim – whenever the most recent gruesome details were released, which at least made us prepared to read them.Sometimes though, that strategy failed, and the news would hit me while I was scrolling my phonedistractedly. I remember exactly where I was the morning I saw the news about Kim’s head being found on the bottom of Køge Bay: I was about to walk across the Williamsburg Bridge on my way to work in Manhattan, and all of a sudden I couldn’t breath and had the closest thing to a panic attack I have ever experienced – on that same bridge Kim and I had walked across together so many times, leaving our homes in South Williamsburg behind to look for dumplings in Chinatown.I asked myself incessantly how Kim’s parents could handle it all. As she had said many times previously, Ingrid told me: “There is no manual for parents whose kids have been murdered, so we have to deal with the problems whenever they show up.” For them, not reading the news was never an option: they had already been deprived of knowing what Kim’s fate had been for weeks – the harshest sentence – so checking the news was actually a way of retaining a minimal control over the situation.“From day one we made a deal with a company, a digital crawler. They go through everything that is written on the internet,” Joachim told me. “We could see that the name Kim Wall was mentioned in this and this article and we have the link to it.”“We read a lot, and a lot we saved for later,” added Ingrid. “In due time we will read it.”Once again, what they call their “journalistic training” dictated how they responded to most situations, including what Joachim described as a “siege” by mostly foreign journalists. For the first few weeks, many were camped outside their home in Trelleborg – and still somehow managed to take pictures of the wrong brick house, mistaking it for the Walls’, as Joachim remembered laughing to himself, having been a photographer working with newspapers for over 40 years.Joachim and Ingrid knew the rules of the game, because they had played it for so long. “What saved us from disaster is that we didn’t give any interviews,” he continued, arguing that otherwise the insatiable hunger for comments would have consumed them. To Ingrid, another important point was that Kim was a journalist: the fact that she was killed while she was doing her job helped to at least contain some of the speculation that is the bread and butter of true crime reporting.“We heard from so many: ‘It could have been me’, ‘So many times as a female journalist I’ve been out on assignments alone with a man, without even thinking that I could be in danger’,” Ingrid said, and after a short pause she added: “I have been in that position for 25 years. I didn’t even think about it.”Almost three years later, no thoughts are wasted on Peter Madsen. “It’s very easy to feel hatred and thoughts of revenge, but in that case we will be the only losers, because the man who is sitting in jail won’t care at all,” continued Ingrid. “We must concentrate on the good things.”In the nightmare that followed Kim’s death – hours, days, weeks of anguish – the most trivial things offered a little respite to the family. “Life goes on, despite everything,” as Ingrid often writes in the book, and behind ordinary tasks laid a glimpse of hope: that for just a few seconds in the day, she and the rest of the family could think about something else other than Kim.“It’s very easy given the circumstances that you fall into this big black hole, and you stay there because you can’t cope with reality. But when you have a dog, like Iso,” Ingrid said turning away from the camera towards the family’s dog, who had been panting in the background for most of the Zoom interview, “you have to go out three times a day. You have to get up in the morning, take a shower and go out with him. And you meet people.”The Walls never really had an opportunity to hide from reality – so they decided to just face it.“I was afraid in the beginning that when we walked in the streets of Trelleborg, people will avoid us, that they will go to the other side of the street,” Ingrid told me, “and I thought that would be extremely terrible if they do, because we haven’t done anything wrong.”Their overwhelming fame – something they would do anything to give back, as repeated over and over in the book – initially made their grief lonelier, as many didn’t want to interfere with the mourning. Sometimes though, the barriers were broken: Kim’s name written by a stranger in a heart made of stones on the beach, a hug from the cashier of the local grocery store on the day that the local newspaper printed the unspeakable as a headline. If there is another thing that this book can teach people, it’s how to treat someone who has lived through such a tragedy.“I don’t know how many times we have heard ‘I don’t know what to say’ and we said ‘You don’t have to say anything, because a hug today will say more than words’,” Ingrid continued. “Then we know that we are not alone in the sorrow.”.In its Swedish original version, the title of the book translates to: “When there are no more words.” Fortunately though, there are: the words that Kim’s parents wrote in the book, the ones written by Kim’s friends all over the world – “We must be the most rainbow family in the world!” Ingrid said proudly – to remember her life and her work, and the words written by past, present and future grantees of the reporting fund in her name, the Kim Wall Memorial Fund, which will allow generations of female reporters to continue writing the stories Kim would have wanted to write.In Ingrid’s words: it gives us a meaning. We must concentrate on the good things."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d61264b1960660e970c55aff1d08438c7130072/0_236_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b249d3fe4fe486dc8effe86e0ab580ed","title":"melbournes hard lockdown orders residents of nine public housing towers to stay home as coronavirus cases surge","story":"Five hundred police sent to enforce command that 3,000 tenants remain in their unitsThree thousand people living in nine public housing towers in Melbourne have been placed under the harshest lockdown rules of the coronavirus pandemic in Australia so far and banned from leaving their homes for at least five days.Five hundred police officers have been dispatched to monitor the nine towers in Flemington and North Melbourne and ensure that the residents do not leave their small and often overcrowded units.Residents living in the flats are among the most vulnerable and heavily policed people in the state of Victoria, with a high population of new migrants, Indigenous people, people experiencing severe mental illness and people who have experienced family violence or homelessness.Residents told  Australia they felt “singled out” by the lockdown order, which was implemented with no warning at 4pm, and “intimidated” by the large police presence.Victoria’s premier, Daniel Andrews, announced the “hard lockdown” of the nine towers late on Saturday, at the same time as he announced that two new postcodes – 3031 and 3051, taking in Flemington, Kensington, North Melbourne, and Hotham Hill – would be placed under stage-three stay-at-home orders from midnight.The difference between the more than 300,000 people in Melbourne under the stage-three orders, and the nine towersis that those under stay-at-home orders can leave their homes to exercise, do grocery shopping, conduct essential caregiving and attend work or study if they cannot do so remotely.Those living in the towers cannot.“If you’re in one of those towers the minister has just read out, you will not be allowed to leave your unit, your dwelling within that tower, for any reason,” Andrews said.He said the lockdown would be in place for at least five days, because that was how long health officials estimated it would take to test every single resident in those units, and get the test results back. But the lockdown could last 14 days, he said.There are more than 1,300 units in the nine towers. Residents were not forewarned before the premier made the announcement and police arrived at their door. Andrews said the state government would be arranging for food, healthcare and other essential services to be delivered to the residents, but the details of how that will work have not been announced or discussed with residents.The housing minister, Richard Wynne, said people living in these public housing towers were “some of the most vulnerable people in our community”.“Many of them are subject to co-morbidities and we want to ensure that we wrap around them all of the services that they are going to need, not just over the next five days or indeed potentially the next 14 days, but going forward that we provide them with all of the support they need to maintain their tenancy but obviously to maintain their wellness also,” Wynne said.But no social workers or other support services were observed outside the tower blocks in Flemington on Saturday night – only armed police officers wearing gloves and face masks.Hana, who shares a three-bedroom flat in one of the Racecourse Road towers with her mother and sister, said she had returned from grocery shopping just after 4pm to be met by an “intimidating” police presence.“I was just shocked,” she said. “I thought, I don’t know, it seemed like there was some criminal activity or something, like a stabbing or something … I asked, ‘What’s happened?’ and they said, ‘Oh, there’s an outbreak. You can’t leave your house. Just park your car, you can’t leave your house.’”Hana said it was unfair that the public housing blocks had been locked down when other large apartment buildings in the area had not, and also unfair that they had not been given any warning.“You had other suburbs where they had 48 hours warning before they were put in lockdown,” she said. “How come we are any different? It just feels like we have been singled out.”Another woman, who lives in the tower block at 129 Racecourse Road, Flemington, said she had received a text message while she was at the supermarket telling her not to leave her home.She said she was concerned for her grandmother, who lives in a neighbouring block and requires visits from carers several times a day.“I’m actually a bit worried about my gran because she has carers coming to feed her daily … and I don’t know what’s going to happen with the carers now and who’s going to be feeding my grandma,” she said. “So I am hoping they have got that organised … she needs to be fed today.”She said she had expected the tower to be locked down “at some point”.Most people living there had been trying to self-isolate, she said, but with shared amenities that was impossible.“It’s still down to the elevators, which are shared, our laundry, which is shared, and even where put our rubbish, there’s a handle that we all have to keep touching to lift,” she said.“So it was going to go around the flats ... I am glad that we’re trying to limit it as much as possible but … I am not sure how they are going to handle this because this is the first time it happens here. Are we going to go through this every three or four weeks? Because that’s going to drive us insane.”Australia’s acting chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, said the public housing lockdown was “unprecedented”. Both he and Andrews compared it to the lockdown of an aged care home once an outbreak had been detected.Kelly said while these steps are unprecedented, given the vulnerability of many people living in the towers, to do anything else would be contrary to public health advice.The extension of the lockdown to 12 postcodes from 10 was made on the back of Victoria recording 108 new cases of Covid-19 in 24 hours, the highest single-day increase in the state’s figures since the national daily incidence peak on 28 March.Those new cases include 23 people who live in the nine public housing towers but Victoria’s deputy chief medical officer, Dr Annaliese van Diemen, said there were “hundreds” of high-risk close contacts spread across the towers. If they were not locked down, she said, it would risk an “explosion” of new cases among vulnerable people living in housing estates.Nationally, Australia recorded 113 new coronavirus cases in 24 hours. New South Wales reported five cases in hotel quarantine, and added 189 historical cases – mainly crew members of the Ruby Princess cruise ship – to its tally for the purpose of the World Health Organization’s accounting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1faf6f5adc79e5a92d99e466d7fc916c0a8d8ac/8_0_3434_2062/master/3434.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=024dafc8fdae0525787f43f86c33a7cc","title":"no 10 faces ridicule after tweeting incorrect lockdown rules","story":"Critics attack ‘confusing’ tweet about guidance on meeting people from other householdsNo 10 has courted mockery after tweeting the wrong lockdown rules hours after an easing of restrictions in England.The official Downing Street Twitter account, which is verified and tweets on behalf of the prime minister, wrote just after 9am: “You can only meet people who don’t live with you outside. Whatever the weather.”The tweet was swiftly deleted after an angry backlash when users ridiculed the government for apparently not knowing its own guidance. Labour lambasted the “confusing and incoherent advice”. Piers Morgan called No 10 “completely clueless”.As of Saturday, official guidelines state that in England two households can meet indoors and outdoors. Special events such as weddings can go ahead with up to 30 attendees, provided physical distancing is observed.From 6am, businesses including pubs, barbers and galleries were able to reopen for the first time since the lockdown came into force on 23 March.Morgan also derided the gaffe, tweeting: “No 10 tweeted this earlier, then realised it was utter nonsense \u0026amp contradicted all their new guidance re pubs, restaurants, hair salons etc - so deleted it. They’re completely clueless.”It comes after a backlash forced the Treasury to delete a tweet posted from its official account, which encouraged Brits to “raise a glass” for the reopening of pubs.The post was condemned for being in poor taste given that more than 43,000 people in the UK have died from Covid-19. Public figures including Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said it was irresponsible government messaging at any time, let alone during a pandemic.Before the 72nd anniversary of the NHS on Sunday, during which a minute’s silence will be observed for the lives lost to the coronavirus, health workers tweeted on Saturday morning to implore people to approach the easing of restrictions responsibly.

She examines how housing pressures, in-work poverty and racial inequalities contributed to the deaths of 36 residents from Covid-19 journalist Aamna Modhin tells Rachel Humphreys about reporting from Church End, a small neighbourhood in Brent, north London, which has a large Somali population. In early March, residents began to fall ill from coronavirus, eventually resulting in 36 deaths. Locals believe the cluster, which is the second worst in England and Wales according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics, does not account for the true scale of the devastation, as it does not factor in people who work in Church End but live nearby.  Aamna met Rhoda Ibrahim, a 57-year old community leader who has been left devastated by the deaths of so many people she knew. The virus thrived on the structural inequalities that Ibrahim has spent much of her life fighting against. It flourished in a housing crisis that was 40 years in the making, stark in-work poverty that left many struggling to put food on the table, and deeply entrenched racial inequalities. The council leader, Muhammed Butt, believes the government’s failure to provide tailored support to communities such as those in Brent worsened the situation, and that the country should have gone into lockdown earlier.

He was in the USA on the evening of 20 June but was out and about earlier today. Millions of people have had to abide by the rules, and he should as well,” Davey wrote.Hallo this is Paul MacInnes, taking you through the next hour of coverage as England eases its lockdown restrictions and its citizens try to work out what to make of that.Roads in south-west England were “very, very busy” as lockdown restrictions eased on Saturday, with holidaymakers flocking to the region, PA Media reports.Traffic cameras and pictures posted on social media showed busy service station car parks, congested motorway carriageways and caravans making their way towards the coast.Travellers were urged to avoid peak times, while police asked caravan owners to check their vehicles before setting off to prevent hold-ups.As well as roads in the South West, a broken-down vehicle at junction 25 of the M25 caused traffic to build as Londoners tried to make their way out of the capital.Devon and Cornwall police and Dorset police’s roads policing teams tweeted: The roads are wet and very, very busy heading in to Devon and Cornwall.We’re out in force trying to keep things moving but please keep a safe distance.Theme parks including Thorpe Park and Chessington World of Adventures have begun a phased reopening as lockdown was eased significantly in England today.In many cases, to allow for social distancing, theme parks are asking guests to pre-book a ticket online to guarantee entry, so as they can restrict the number of visitors each day. Hygiene and safety measures are in place.Guests will have their temperature checked on arrival, empty rows and seats will be left on rollercoasters and enhanced cleaning will be carried out throughout the day, including to ride seats and restraints.Guests at Chessington are also encouraged to bring and wear a suitable face covering, with securely fitted face masks mandatory on some rides. At Thorpe Park, you will need to bring one, and everyone over the age of six must wear one on certain rides. For water rides they recommend you remove them “in case they get wet”.Here’s a report from Sky News.Our Jason Rodrigues is in Soho, which looks quite lively with many bars, cafes and restaurants open for business.The national chairman of the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) said feedback from branches suggested up to half of pubs have not reopened today.Speaking after raising a pint of Marston’s Pedigree to mark the easing of England’s 105-day pub lockdown, Camra’s Nik Antona told PA Media many licensees had done a fantastic job to manage to reopen in the face of insufficient notice from the government. I think it’s going to be difficult for pubs. They are opening up under uncertain circumstances. They don’t know if they’re going to get their customers back.The government have not really been helpful with their guidance, leaving it to the last minute in a lot of cases.Urging drinkers to vote with their feet and support local bars and pubs, while maintaining safety through social distancing and respecting staff, Antona added: It’s important that people come back to the pub - but do it safely.Blood Cancer UK has urged people to continue to observe social distancing and to approach the easing of lockdown restrictions responsibly.Gemma Peters, the charity’s chief executive, implored the public to do all they can to stop the virus spreading and to protect those who are still shielding.There are around 200,000 people with blood cancer who are shielding in the UK and the condition increases the risk of becoming ill with the coronavirus more than almost any other.A further 39 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals to 28,871, NHS England said.My colleague Amy Walker has been out and about in Manchester where the atmosphere was far less raucous than expected as lockdown restrictions eased significantly across England today.James Micklethwaite, 28, who lives in Didsbury, had been “counting down the minutes until pubs reopen”, but was making his trip to the pub a short-lived affair. He said:I’m anxious about how other people are going to be around us and if they’re going to be adhering to everything.Ruth Hemmingfield, the co-director of music venue turned bar and diner YES, said that young people were simply seeking a bit of “normality” and to see their friends casually.I know it’s been dubbed ‘Super Saturday’, but I don’t think it’s being seen as that.A pub has managed to open despite a car crashing into its front in the early hours, the landlord said.The Swan Inn at Little Chart, near Ashford in Kent, will still be able to serve pints to customers outside despite the landlord being woken by the devastation at around 2am on Saturday.Ray Perkins told the PA Media news agency: It was absolutely devastating because obviously we were opening today.We’ve had everybody rally round and clear up the bar, every single glass has had to be washed again.We’ve got open, we’ve managed to open the pub - not inside, only outside.Perkins said he was “absolutely gutted” and “exhausted” by the incident, but was determined to open up for his customers.We’ve worked hard for the last god knows how many weeks now to get it ready for today.At 2am they basically nearly destroyed today for us, but that’s life.We just didn’t want to let anyone down because we’ve got 200 people booked to come and eat and drink outside and be merry on the first day of opening.Kent police said they were called to the scene shortly before 2.25am alongside paramedics and the fire service. Three 17-year-old boys inside the car were taken to a local hospital and treated for minor injuries. One of them has been arrested on suspicion of taking a vehicle without consent and drink driving. He remains in custody.Pubs across England have been allowed to reopen as lockdown restrictions were relaxed early this morning.Restaurants, bars and cinemas have also been allowed to welcome customers for the first time in three months.Pubs in Wales and Scotland must remain closed until later this month as the devolved nations are lifting their own lockdown rules more slowly, but hotels, bars, restaurants and cafes in Northern Ireland reopened on Friday.No new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19 were recorded in Scotland in the last 24 hours, the Scottish government said.A further 11 confirmed cases were recorded, bringing the total there to date to 18,287.Public Health Wales said a further five people have died after testing positive for Covid-19, taking the total number of reported deaths in Wales to 1,530.The total number of confirmed positive cases increased by 34 to 15,875.This is from the Manchester Evening News’ Rebecca DayThe home secretary, Priti Patel, has urged people to enjoy the weekend, but to do so safely and responsibly. Writing in the Daily  (paywall), Patel stressed that, though “our long national hibernation is beginning to come to an end”, it remains crucial “that we stay alert while the coronavirus is still present in our communities”.She warned people not to jeopardise the hard work and sacrifices the country has made, in particular those made by health and social care workers, through “irresponsible behaviour and carelessness”.Cinemas in England have begun to reopen their doors to customers following months of closure.Filmgoers are being welcomed into venues with reduced capacities and are being encouraged to follow measures such as wearing masks, paying by contactless transactions and using hand-sanitising stations on arrival and exit.However, while some cinemas resumed trading on Saturday, a large number have remained closed despite restrictions being lifted.PA Media reports from the Showcase cinema in the Bluewater shopping centre in Dartford, Kent, where staff are all wearing masks and being subject to mandatory temperature checks on arrival at work.Perspex screens have been put up around tills and stations where food is served, and one-way systems around the venue guide customer’s movement in an effort to stop them coming into close contact with each other.A dearth of new film releases means the cinema is showing old films including Harry Potter And The Philosopher’s Stone and Back To The Future.A steady stream of people were coming into the venue on Saturday and very few were wearing masks.Andrea Necchi, a 31-year-old project manager for protection at a construction company, said it was a “strange” experience, adding that his children had their temperature taken on the way in.It’s all a bit eerie, but apart from that it is good to be back.Michelle Major, 57, who is a dog carer, said she is glad that normality is slowly returning as it has been difficult to explain the lockdown restrictions to her son, who is disabled and autistic.“It has been hard for him to understand what is happening,” she said, adding that he was “super excited” to be going to the cinema.She said she has been “impressed” by the measures put in place by the cinema.I think it is very safe, it is not the staff or the cinema who will mess things up, it is the customers.Molly Ladbrook-Hutt, a 36-year-old director of media, said it “felt great to be somewhere different”, adding:I’m really impressed so far with the measures, everything has been really clearly explained and it has been a lot easier than expected.While cinemas are allowed to resume trading on Saturday, a large number of venues have not immediately done so. Cinema chain Cineworld pushed back its reopening date to 31 July, blaming the delay on changes to planned film release dates.Odeon has opened 10 of its cinemas on Saturday before opening a further 88 by the end of the month.

Photograph: Saul Loeb-PoolGetty ImagesThe remarkable global effort to produce a range of Covid-19 vaccines in parallel with developing new treatments – many of which are adapting proven medications for other diseases – is gathering pace.The scale of scientific endeavour is unprecedented, not just in terms of finding a new vaccine, but in the level of co-operation between scientists in quickly sharing results, data and critical genetic details indications of variations in the form of what is known as SARS-CoV-2. Then there is verification of the work of others, enabling promising work to push on.That is the reassuring bit. It heightens the chances of success on both vaccine and antiviral fronts. A rough assessment of timings on potential vaccines would suggest early optimism needs to be tempered and early 2021 is the most likely time one will become available - and only then to some countries.Should we plan for a vaccine in 2021?The realists among the ranks of virologists, immunologists and vaccine developers, who are familiar with all too frequent experience of failure, would say all this is very much on the optimistic side.Trinity College Dublin immunologist Prof Luke O’Neill always refers to a horse racing metaphor you may be leading the Grand National and have just one fence to clear, and fall at the last hurdle.The world also has to face up to the fact that there may never be an effective vaccine. But he is quick to add that the ability to contain the novel virus through a combination of therapies is very likely – as was the case with Aids. Likewise, there are already treatments emerging that will act as a bridge to getting a vaccine in place.The one discordant note undermining this tremendous team play is wealthy countries buying up treatments, as seen with the US recently purchasing all the next three months’ projected production of the drug remdesivir from US manufacturer Gilead – it cuts recovery times, though it is not yet clear if the drug improves survival rates.There remains the risk that more wealthy countries aligned to powerful pharma companies will do the same when a vaccine emerges, and national interests will dominate over the need to give it to those requiring it most.That being said, and acknowledging the case for doing things differently, there are other strategies being born out of desperation – in the form of 10 million cases and 500,000 fatalities and no indication of peak – that are likely to counter that threat.What is the emerging picture on leading vaccine candidates?There are more than 145 candidate vaccines in development, with 17 in human trials. Some have been shown to generate a strong immune response in animals.Those conducting vaccine trials are “chasing the disease around the world”, notably in Brazil and the US. Places where there are high levels of Covid-19 are the best to test efficacy and safety.The extent of that research is likely to mean a range of vaccines of differing type and effectiveness will emerge – the first to come on stream might not be the magic bullet hoped for. But, given the whole world will need protection, a variety of vaccines from different sources is not such a bad thing.Johnson \u0026amp Johnson has indicated, for example, its vaccine appeared so promising in preclinical studies they were able to push up the start for testing in healthy volunteers to later this month.The vaccine uses a common-cold virus to deliver a coronavirus antigen into cells to stimulate the immune system to fight off an infection. This type of “vector” using weakened virus is already proven effective and safe in 65,000 humans.Its chief scientific officer Dr Paul Stoffels outlined to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this week how the clinical trial process is being accelerated in the case of Covid-19 with elements run in parallel, while drug companies are already scaling up manufacture of the vaccine to have it ready in the quickest possible time - much different to traditional approaches of the past.If one element fails, all others are then stopped, he confirmed. The vaccine is already in production in the US and Europe with a view to 1 billion doses being available early next year.Meanwhile, the US government is spending billions of dollars in supporting the five best candidates in the hope of having the best one available in the shortest possible time.Other vaccines continue to make significant progress towards clearing each stage of a robust trials processOxford University is regarded as making most progress, and “offers the best chance of having something protective against the virus as we go into winter”, MPs have been told.It is being tested in Brazil and South Africa, where the case numbers are high. Astra Zeneca, the company partnering with Oxford, is to start a trial with 30,000 people in the US. European countries are lining up behind this project.BioNTech’s vaccine, being developed with Pfizer in Germany, has confirmed positive trial results, generating immune defences in participants that were stronger than those of the average recovered Covid-19 patient. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which is faster than traditional methods.Moderna’s mRNA vaccine trial in the US showed participants developed similar levels of immunity to recovered coronavirus patients, with only minor side effects. Rather than using pathogens to induce an immune response, mRNA vaccines use genetic material that carries instructions for cells to produce proteins that fight disease. However, no marketable mRNA vaccine has been produced to date.China is using a vaccine developed with CanSino Biologics on army personnel though little is known about the type of vaccine involved and extent of deployment.All these factors confirm great progress but there is no clarity on timelines, which underlines the importance of having treatments in the meantime. Uncertainty over the extent to which having the disease confers immunity and protection against re-infection is an added complication pointing to the acute need for Covid medicationstherapies.So what are the promising treatments?Fortunately, the process of finding new treatments is quicker with lower regulatory hurdles to clear, though it has to be said a widely available medication approved for routine use has not materialised yet.Numerous trials are in progress with prompt endorsement of effectiveness or rejection. There has been too much haste on occasion, as in the case of hydroxychloroquine, though some trials are continuing to use this anti-malaria drug and some recent results are more positive.Early indications on dexamethasone – a cheap steroid – suggest it reduced deaths by one-third in patients on a ventilator. A run on dexamethasone ensued as physicians quickly made it part of their standard of care for the sickest patients. This drug, however, looks to be only effective in patients already in a critical state.Remdesivir reduces the duration of infection in hospitalised patients but not mortality. It does not come cheap, costing $2,340 (€2,080) per treatment in the US.Other drugs such as daclatasvir, used to treat Hepatitis C imatinib to treat leukaemia and favipiravir to treat influenza are showing promise. “Cocktails” of these drugs could be deployed as they are no longer patented, meaning they would be easily and cheaply made available.A long-established therapy using “convalescent plasma”, in this instance made from antibodies from people who have had Covid-19, continues to show promise, and it can be manufactured in a laboratory.Likewise, T cells may be sufficient to control infection in the absence of antibodies. T cell responses have been detected in most Covid-19 patients, and first-in-human vaccine trials have reported potent T cell activation. It is possible that T cells’ memory of Sars-CoV-2 may last longer than antibodies.There is also significant work being done on monoclonal antibodies which mimic natural antibodies and can be isolated and manufactured in large quantities to treat patients.When it comes to vaccines, was there adequate preparedness for a pandemic?For scientists and doctors who have had to wrestle with the rapid spread of Covid-19 across the world, it is a game of constant catch-up. The insidious nature of the novel virus compounds their difficulties. The picture is incomplete. That said, on a daily basis revealing details emerge so the medical response is being constantly perfected.The bottom line as of now, however, is a safe and effective vaccine remains the best way to achieve herd immunity on a global scale. The lessons for future preparedness are clear.Immunologist Sir John Bell of Oxford University has criticised the lack of pandemic planning in the UK and particularly the absence of manufacturing capacity for vaccines. It is, however, a global problem that will have to be addressed through sustained funding over many years.This pandemic was “not a one-off” that would not recur for centuries, he told a House of Commons committee.That warning was echoed by Dr Stoffels who outlined the need to have a range of vaccines in place, especially in relation to coronaviruses like Covid-19 and flu, before outbreaks lead to a difficult-to-control pandemic.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Creating \u0026lsquogreen list\u0026rsquo of countries safe to go to is unrealistic, says Prof Sam McConkeyTwo men were injured and several residences were significantly damaged in incidentMinister of Agriculture served three-month ban in 2016 after being stopped for drink-drivingMet \u0026Eacuteireann advisory comes into effect from 9pm on Saturday and extends to 8pm on SundayMajority of pubs in Cork have opted not to re-open until July 20thDiageo confirms it will host Guinness Cork Jazz Festival in 2021Publication of \u0026lsquogreen list\u0026rsquo of safe countries postponed amid fears of virus resurgenceCSO looking at options for 2026 census, marking 100 years since State\u0026rsquos first censusQueues have shortened at Ikea since reopening and Dundrum centre footfall is on the riseLawyer tells Helen McEntee State has obligation to look at issue \u0026lsquoas a matter of urgency\u0026rsquoGarda\u0026iacute to ramp up pub inspections following public concerns over lack of social distancingFans were able to listen with their left windows down, sunroof open or through the car radio3.4kg of cannabis resin which had been on its way to Dublin, Kildare, Cork and WaterfordCatholic archbishop welcomes clarity ahead of first public Sunday Masses in monthsMet \u0026Eacuteireann puts status yellow wind warning in place for areas in the north and westCourt of Appeal orders a retrial amid what judge describes as a \u0026lsquovery unusual\u0026rsquo situationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"bobby storey the ira s planner and enforcer who stayed in the shadows","story":"Nearly 1,800 men and women, dressed in black trousers and slacks, white shirts and black ties, lined up along the black-flag draped Andersonstown and Falls roads in west Belfast on Tuesday for the funeral of Bobby Storey.Behind them stood thousands more as the hearse containing the Tricolour-covered coffin of Storey, a senior Sinn Féin and IRA figure for decades, passed by, applauding as it did. Even with the Covid-19 lockdown regulations in place, they were determined to pay tribute to a man they considered a hero.However, there are others who experienced the brutal side of the 64-year-old, who hold sharply different views about the man lauded in Anderstown and the Falls Road.Storey, who died on June 21st after an unsuccessful lung transplant in a National Health Service hospital in England, may be the “most famous Provo” that most people, with no connection to republicanism, have never heard about, or know little about him, if they had.However, “Big Bobby”, as his closest friend for decades, former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams, generally called him, never wanted to be known by people at large, just by his own.Within the Sinn Féin and IRA family, he was viewed as a top commander – involved from his youth in the Troubles, with years behind bars, and a place at the top table right up to very recently when illness forced him from the scene.The two people he most admired, as he said himself, were Che Guevara and Gerry Adams. “He was grafted on to Adams,” was one well-put portrayal of their relationship.Studying his history, Storey, who was the IRA’s director of intelligence in the eyes of those who knew that world well, was “a planner, operator and an enforcer”.Illustrating that latter side to him, one former police officer, recalled a beating delivered by Storey to another republican who had dared to challenge the Adams-McGuinness leadership at one of key moments in the peace process.“The man was a repeat murderer, with a penchant for cutting people’s throats, but even he was scared of Bobby Storey,” the former officer recalled.Though he rarely took the microphone outside of speaking to usually-private, sometimes public Sinn Féin gatherings, Storey was able to come up with the memorable quote when he had to go to the front of the stage.One such moment came during a west Belfast press conference in August 2015 attended by Adams, the late Martin McGuinness, Mary Lou McDonald and some other leading republicans.Matters were then fraught. Kevin McGuigan had just been shot dead in Belfast in a revenge murder for the killing of senior IRA figure Gerard “Jock” Davison that May.Storey had been arrested for the McGuigan murder, but released without charge. The killing threatened the already shaky Northern Executive. Storey insisted that the IRA had had nothing to do with it.The then PSNI chief constable George Hamilton had said some IRA members carried out McGuigan’s murder, although they had acted without the authority of the leadership. Storey’s denials were treated with scepticism.“I think the chief constable and other perspectives out there see this in terms of the IRA being the caterpillar that is still there,” waxed Storey. “What I think is that it’s moved on, it’s become a butterfly, it’s flew away, it’s gone, it’s disappeared.”The butterfly metaphor, which prompted a smile from Adams, had the colloquial colour and rhythm of a remark from one who could talk softly because they carried a big stick.Storey was a “made man” in the IRA from his teens. In 1979, when in his early 20s, he was sent to London to try to free the late IRA leader Brian Keenan from Brixton prison using a helicopter.It failed and Storey and three others were arrested. He was acquitted but in 1981 was sentenced to 18 years in prison over a gun attack on British soldiers.That led to the Maze prison escape of 1983 and the beginning of Storey making his way into republican legend. Storey and North Belfast Assembly member Gerry Kelly were two of the masterminds in what was the biggest jailbreak in UK prison history, dubbed by republicans, The Great Escape, after the film. In all 38 IRA prisoners made it out of the prison gates in September 1983, half were recaptured but 19 got away.Storey, too, was caught and had another seven years added to his sentence. Prison officer James Ferris who was stabbed during the escape died, although a court later ruled that it was a heart attack that killed him.Storey in a 2008 interview with the republican paper An Phoblacht recalled the escape. “It was a great achievement for the IRA. It showed the degree to which comrades could work together, not just those who escaped but those who formed the back-up inside the jail, prisoners who weren’t going on the escape. Then there was the teamwork of people outside the jail: the drivers, the safe houses. Even getting captured didn’t dampen the event. We shafted Maggie Thatcher.”Storey probably is best known for the 2004 Northern Bank robbery. Adams and the IRA denied that the IRA did the job, and there are people who accept that denial, but not many.Carried out on December 20th, 2004 at the Northern Bank\u0027s headquarters at\u0026nbspDonegall Square\u0026nbspWest\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspBelfast, Northern Ireland, the robbers seized £26.5 m sterling, along with smaller amounts of other currents - the biggest bank robbery in British history.The families of two Northern Bank officials were held at gunpoint on the night before while they were forced the following morning to report for work, as normal. One of the officials was forced to bring out £1m in cash stuffed into a holdall in a test run for the main robbery later that night. The two officials were forced to grant access to the robbers later that night into the bank, which had huge sums of cash in the vault in readiness to fill ATMs. Following the raid, Northern Bank recalled\u0026nbsp£300m worth of banknotes worth £10 or more, and issued new ones with new logos and new serial numbersThe robbery had been months in the planning, coming shortly after a failed attempt to resurrect the powersharing Executive and Assembly which had collapsed in 2002.Intelligence and security services put Storey at the heart of its planning. “The robbery was carried out by the Belfast brigade, and Storey was a key player in the brigade, so he would have been up to his neck in it,” said a former senior Police Service of Northern Ireland officer.It should be remembered that the IRA was on ceasefire at the time and supposed to have eschewed such criminality. The same source recalled how over the years the IRA engaged in numerous bank, post office and other robberies. When Border fuel laundering and other activity was taken into account it all amounted to a multimillion pound criminal empire.It prompted the late and former IRA member Dolours Price to comment at the time about slipping republican “standards” and to wonder: “The war is over, we are told . . . so what is all this money needed for?”It is a question that has never been properly answered.Storey had been involved in major robberies before. Stung by multiple truck hijackings in the early 2000s Gallaher’s cigarette manufacturers in Ballymena began to ship supplies bound for Dublin first to Liverpool by ferry, and then onwards to Dublin.The change soon drew the attention of the IRA to Gallaher’s use of Belfast port. In a raid in June 2001 that never drew the attention of the Northern Bank robbery, the IRA targeted a £4 million consignment of cigarettes bound for Rotterdam in the Netherlands.The planning was impeccable, even in the words today of security sources. The Belfast brigade of the IRA provided the people, the IRA in south Armagh handled the logistics, while Storey was at the centre of the web.“One night about 30 men appeared in Belfast dock. They took over the entire dock. They knew exactly what they were doing, they knew exactly what containers they were looking for, they knew exactly where those containers would be,” said one source.“The only mistake they made was that they were a little bit late and a couple of those containers were loaded by the time they got to the quayside. So they put a gunman in the cab of the crane with the crane driver and made him unload them again.“A fleet of lorries then appeared provided by the south Armagh brigade. The containers were dropped onto the lorries which headed off for the Border. The IRA held up the dock for another four hours, and then disappeared.“By the time the alarm was raised I reckon some of those cigarettes were almost in Cork. Bobby Storey would have been at the heart of that as well.”If the Gallaher’s raid made few headlines, the Northern Bank raid dominated bulletins across the world. Anxious to keep the IRA on board British prime minister Tony Blair’s “peace train” played down charges that the IRA was responsible for the cigarette job.“But it was absolutely obvious who did it. No organisation in Northern Ireland had the capability to do that job but the IRA,” said one security source involved in the investigation.Then there was the St Patrick’s night break-in in 2002 at the PSNI special branch offices at the Castlereagh police complex in east Belfast, supposedly one of the most impenetrable security centres in Europe. Three smartly-dressed men, one reputedly with an Oxbridge accent, almost casually got through the various checks, flashing what appeared to be genuine security passes.It was a Sunday, a quiet night, and the men walked along the corridors of the building, just as IRA men did in the Belfast docks raid, knowing exactly where they were to go.Within minutes, the three men were in the office where information about police agents, their police handlers and other highly-confidential documentation were kept.They got out with that hoard just as easily as they got in, a lone constable in the office being punched in the face and then hooded, bound and gagged as the three carefully and methodically assembled their haul.Millions of pounds were spent rehousing compromised detectives and others whose security was threatened by the break-in.Highly embarrassed, then chief constable Ronnie Flanagan referred to the Castlereagh raid as “an inside job”, giving rise to speculation that this was some sort of faction fight between the different elements of British intelligence. But it then emerged that Flanagan appeared to be referring to someone in Castlereagh assisting the three well-dressed robbers.The IRA denied involvement while senior Sinn Féiners complained of dirty deeds by “British securocrats”, to use a favourite and much-used phrase of Adams.Whitehall mandarin Sir John Chilcot, who later investigated the causes of the Iraq war, conducted an inquiry and found no evidence that any section of the British security agencies was involved.Once more Storey was blamed. Remembering the raid, a former senior police officer has no doubts but that he was central. However, that same source believes that Storey was criticised internally by at least one Sinn Féin leader who, whatever about the haul of information found at the break-in, was unhappy with its timing because it put pressure on the Northern Executive and Assembly.The then Ulster Unionist Party first minister David Trimble was under severe strain at the time for sharing power with Sinn Féin. Allegations that the on-ceasefire IRA had broken Castlereagh did nothing for his temperament, or his position.Storey was seen as a man who had “sleepers” in many sensitive positions who could be used at opportune times. Storey, this inidual believes, had “an asset” with knowledge of Castlereagh and that he decided to “use that asset, rather than lose it”. Not every element of the republican movement was kept in the loop by a man who kept secrets well.Storey was said to run a meticulous, almost obsessive intelligence gathering operation. Every IRA brigade in Northern Ireland, possibly apart from south Armagh which tended to do its own thing, supplied information to him.He carefully collated and stored it, much of it in a large bag, a “bit like a Gladstone bag”, according to the source. It was described in court as a “rucksack”.“Republicans were reporting back intelligence all the time, picking up information on prison officers, on police officers, taking down car registrations, getting family details, where children went to school, getting gossip about people’s finances, who was having affairs – all of it being fed back to Bobby,” he explained.It was around then, said the same source, that the PSNI devised a plan to bring him down. And here the story gets convoluted but it all leads up to Stormontgate in October of 2002.StormontgateThat month a long line of PSNI special branch and regular officers trooped into the offices of Sinn Féin at Parliament Buildings and seized material. Amid allegations of an IRA spy ring operating at Stormont – hence Stormontgate – Trimble could no longer hold his people together and the whole powersharing structure came crashing down, not to be rebuilt for close to another five years – an occasion in which Storey also featured.Sinn Féin’s head of administration at Stormont, Denis Donaldson was arrested, as were two other men, Donaldson’s son-in-law Ciarán Kearney, and William Mackessy. Storey’s “big bag” – stored in Donaldson’s home – was seized during a PSNI raid.They faced a range of charges but gradually some of them were withdrawn. In December 2005, the prosecution case ended, lawyers reporting it was no longer in the “public interest” to proceed with the case – a term that not infrequently is shorthand for protecting undercover sources or agents.The following day, Friday, December 9th, Donaldson posed with Adams and McGuinness on the steps of Parliament Buildings, the three looking rather self-satisfied.That did not last long. The following week a forlorn Donaldson gave a statement to the press admitting that for about 20 years he had acted as a British agent. At Stormont Donaldson came across as a quiet and decent inidual who kept to the background. On that day he appeared pitiful. He went to live a life of isolation in a cottage near Glenties in Co Donegal where he was brutally murdered the following April. One of his arms was almost blown off by a shotgun blast. The Real IRA said it had killed him, but there are still questions over whether that was a genuine admission.The outing of Donaldson allowed Adams and other Sinn Féiners to claim the whole Stormontgate affair was yet another example of a British “securocrat” conspiracy and that there was no republican spying at Stormont.Again some people believe that version of events. The other story, as expressed by a number of security, official and other sources, was that the police were trying to get Storey in possession of that bag of secret documents. Revenge was required for Castlereagh.In fact, said the former PSNI officer, the operation to nab Storey and other senior republicans had run for a long period. It was costly and involved many officers. But they just could not get the bag and Storey together. The PSNI for a long time knew Donaldson had the bag but were hoping for a “pass the parcel” moment when it would be handed over to the IRA director of intelligence.The source explained: “The bag had been left temporarily with Denis Donaldson. It was destined for Bobby and we were trying to catch Bobby with it, with all those intelligence records and CDs, but we couldn’t in the end. Eventually it got to the stage where we ran out of resources and had to move on it and take Denis instead.”One of the explanations for Donaldson’s arrest, even though he was an agent, was that he had not told his handlers about all the secret documentation. Another reason for the police moving in was fear that the material would be transported for safer keeping across the Border.The result was that Storey escaped the net while millions of pounds were spent trying to safeguard the estimated 2,000 or so people, many of them prison, police and British army officers, some of them politicians, named in the documents.The former officer also recalled how police did not get a chance to contact one particular man, an alleged drug dealer, on the list. “He was killed by the IRA, using one of its cover names, before he could be warned.”LoyaltySpeaking after his death, Adams was strong in his tribute to Storey, saying that he was “one of the bravest people I have ever had the honour to know”.“Whether inside or outside of prison, or through the years of harassment and beatings, arrests and torture from the RUC and British army, Big Bobby demonstrated time and time again his enormous personal commitment and courage,” he added.In turn Storey had a fierce loyalty to Adams. In 2014, when Adams was arrested and questioned at Antrim police station for a number of days about the 1972 abduction, murder and secret burial of mother-of-10 Jean McConville, Storey rallied to his cause.“That they would dare touch our party leader, the leader of Irish republicanism,” Storey thundered at a public gathering in west Belfast. At the same meeting Storey repeated a famous line from Adams about the IRA: “We have a message for the British government, for the Irish government, for the cabal that is out there: we ain’t gone away, you know.”During research for this article, several political, security and republican sources have emphasised how critical Storey was to the peace process and strategy pursued by Adams and McGuinness. They provided the strategy, he provided the muscle to ensure they got their way.Following the August 1994 IRA ceasefire, senior Sinn Féiners went to IRA units across Northern Ireland, and in the Republic, to argue for the peace strategy. Encouraged to speak up, a couple of IRA volunteers attending a meeting close to the Markets in central Belfast did so, and expressed their opposition to the ceasefire.“During all of this Bobby sat at the back of the room,” said one well-placed source. “As the crowd were filtering out Bobby took those speakers aside and explained to them in words of one syllable what the consequences would be if they ever challenged the Adams-McGuinness leadership again. Bobby could be vicious, and they knew that.”One very senior security figure was certain that Storey was important in ensuring that those within the IRA and Sinn Féin who opposed Adams and McGuinness never got the upper hand.“We always believed that Bobby Storey was director of intelligence in the late 1990s and early noughties for the IRA,” he said. “He was very much a key player, extremely close to the leadership. His support for them was pretty vital in containing any iniduals within the organisation who were threatening to throw over the traces, because they were all terrified of him.”“I have no doubt that he played a positive role in making sure that any dissent within the organisation was suppressed,” he added.“He would have been fairly free with his fists when he had to. There were many, many people in the organisation who were frightened of him. If he came around and supported the party leadership then there would be very few people who would cross him.”At the funeral Adams quipped that he did not know anyone who knew Storey “who didn’t like him – except for MI5, MI6, the old RUC, the British army, and prison governors”. Still, he was not universally loved, even within republicanism.In addition to those he threatened, there were other Republicans who had little time for Storey. One in particular was former IRA leader Ivor Bell who last year in court was cleared of soliciting McConville’s murder.That case centred on testimony Bell gave on the Boston tapes – the ill-fated oral history of the Troubles – where it was alleged that one night in 1972, Bell, the late Pat McClure and Adams gathered to settle the terrible end of the life of Jean McConville.Adams, who also gave evidence to the court, insisted no such meeting took place and that he had no part in the murder of the 38-year-old widow.But in the tapes, where former IRA man Anthony McIntyre interviewed Bell, mention also is made of Storey. The court heard that when the IRA and Sinn Féin decided to assist in locating the bodies of McConville and others of the Disappeared Adams sent Storey to speak to Bell. This would have been around 1998-1999.Storey’s task, it appeared from the tapes, was to elicit from Bell what he knew about the Disappeared. But it was clear that Bell felt that Adams was being disingenuous, which led to an infuriated Bell describing Storey as a “clown” and an “idiot” – terms that very few people would have used about him.A clearly annoyed Bell said that he told Storey, “What are you asking me about it for, sure my knowledge of it would be second-hand, why don’t you ask Gerry?”“Oh Gerry knows nothing about it,” Storey told Bell with an exasperated Bell saying to McIntyre, “the annoying thing is he actually believed Gerry.”Storey was loved within most of the republican community but as with Bell there were those who despised him.In July 2018, dissident republicans threw explosive devices at the homes of Adams and Storey in West Belfast. No one was injured. A rally there was quickly organised, with Storey telling dissidents they needed to “go back to where they come from”. “They were on a road to nowhere,” was a message he repeated on a number of occasions.YouthFrom teenage years Storey’s whole life was given over to the IRA and Sinn Féin. He joined the IRA when he was 16. Aged 17, he was one of the youngest to be interned in 1973. He served more than 20 years in prison, quite a lot of them on remand on various charges such as IRA shootings and bombings. Several sources said he was implicated in a number of killings but that because he was so long inside that he is rarely linked to some of the even more notorious multiple-death IRA gun and bomb attacks.“Then there was the massacre on Bloody Sunday when 13 people were gunned down . . . The fact that British paratroopers could gun down innocent protesters had a massive impact on me and from that point on I was attempting to join the republican movement.”Through the 2000s and as the IRA, to a relative degree considering the criminality, retreated into the shadows Sinn Féin leaders such as Adams saw the merit of bringing Storey more into the political fold. They tested the waters first by seeing how he would perform. On one occasion The  and other newspapers were invited to an off-the-record briefing where Storey, a little self-effacingly and with some reluctance, offered his thoughts on whatever was the political issue of that day. “I am not used to this,” he said, but then chatted away. There were no other such invitations for sit-down meetings with Storey.Tall, strongly-built, and with a commanding presence, Storey could be affable man, and with a good sense of humour. Equally, it was clear that he was not one to be crossed.His civility did not stretch to all journalists. The Belfast writer and journalist Malachi O’Doherty, who has been a regular critic of Sinn Féin and the IRA, remembers how in the mid-1990s he was tackled by Storey after he had delivered a piece on BBC Radio Ulster’s Talkback programme in which he referred to Storey’s “enforcer” status.Storey was 6ft 5in. O’Doherty is 5ft 2in, or little more. O’Doherty had been attending a lecture in the Felons’ Club in west Belfast when Storey approached him. O’Doherty recalled: “He put me up against a wall and told me I was a slug and not welcome in west Belfast.”“After that incident another journalist went to speak to him and said, ‘Look what’s the score with Malachi?’ And he said, ‘Well, Malachi shouldn’t feel that he is free to just walk into west Belfast given that he has been so critical of us’.”This was not a teasing, semi-jocular act by Storey, says O’Doherty: “Oh, no, it was clear intimidation of a journalist.”Some people have characterised Storey as little more than an IRA hardman who carried out the orders given to him and who could barely think for himself. McIntyre, who spent time in prison with him and who was no friend of the Adams-McGuinness leadership, and who himself took some serious gyp from Storey, strongly contradicts that view.He recalled occasions in prison when inmates were shown films. “I hated sitting beside him because no matter how complicated the plot of the film he’d work it out immediately and ruin it for you,” he said.“He was very competent and very well got. He was absolutely hated by the cops, they absolutely despised him.“He was exceptionally bright. I never found Bobby thuggish or a bully in a personal sense although a whole lot of others did. Whenever he was talking he always carried the authority of the IRA.”“In terms of practical intelligence and practical ability you would meet nobody brighter. People used to say to me, ‘He is stupid’, and I would say back to them, ‘You are stupid for thinking he is stupid’. You don’t put operations like that together if you are stupid.”Journalist Ivan Little while writing about Storey paramilitary past in the Belfast  also had a memory about his “softer” side. “At a talent contest I hosted in west Belfast some years ago he and his mother watched with pride as Storey’s brother Brian who had Down’s syndrome stole the show as an Elvis impersonator,” he recalled.But there are few such anecdotes.Across the Border he was also very well known to senior Garda and Army intelligence officers. “He was certainly on our radar he figured a lot in our intelligence reports down the years, he was an interesting character,” said one former Garda source.And while Storey is seldom mentioned as being on the IRA Army Council a former Army intelligence source said the view in the South was that “he was on the army council, or very close to it”.“Membership of the army council was fluid we think he was on it for a while. Storey was very influential. He mostly stayed behind the scenes but we had him at the very top of the tree,” he said.That 2008 An Phoblacht interview was another example of Storey’s switch from paramilitarism to politics although one security source said that even in his Sinn Féin days “he was somewhere between the two”.He held a senior position for Sinn Féin at Stormont and also served as party chairman for a period. He was a prominent backroom figure at times of political crises and during elections. He could energise the footsoldiers when the vote had to be got out. Perhaps jaundiced by the necessity to deal with journalists it seemed, however, that elected politics was not for him.In his graveside oration Adams spoke about how Storey was devoted to his partner, Teresa, their children, and grandchildren, brothers Seamus and Brian, and sister Geraldine.One of the repeated arguments from senior British security figures and some unionist politicians over the years is that a chief reason for the IRA finally ending its “war” was because it was so riddled with and damaged by informers and agents, some of them operating at very elevated levels such as Donaldson and Freddie Scappaticci, also known as Stakeknife, and some purported high-rankers yet to be exposed.Differing viewsThere are different views of Storey. Most unionists and many others will see him as just another ruthless terrorist who was part of an IRA murder machine that killed up to 1,800 people and badly injured thousands more in an unjustifiable and unnecessary conflict.That view was reflected in a piece in the Belfast  on the day before the funeral by historian Ruth Dudley Edwards which was headlined: “Bobby Storey: a violent thug who played role in the collapse of Stormont on three occasions”.The counter view was offered in that same day’s Irish News where senior republican Jim Gibney wrote: “If it is possible for one inidual to embody the spirit, the dynamic, the duration and durability, the depth and complexity of the republican struggle over the last 45 years then it was Bobby Storey.”But in the often dispassionate warts and all world of the British and Irish intelligence and security services that battled with Storey and his like there remains an objective regard for his nerve and skill.That same former Stormont official had one lasting memory of Storey that acknowledged his place in the republican hierarchy and in the “long war” tussle between the competing forces. It was May 2007, two months after Adams and Ian Paisley after much coaxing from the British and Irish governments, struck their truly historic deal to restore the Northern Executive and Assembly. This was after close to five years of direct rule from Westminster and now finally powersharing was being reinstated.While below in the chamber the politicians went about the business of formally reactivating the Executive and Assembly, in the visitors’ gallery above the likes of taoiseach Bertie Ahern, Blair and other VIPs observed proceedings, enjoying some of the reflected light of a job well done.Just a few seats from them sat three of the most senior IRA figures of the Troubles, the late Brian Keenan, Brian Gillen and Bobby Storey.“This is how central he was to PIRA and also to the peace process – while it would have infuriated unionists, their presence was a vindication of the Adams strategy and the peace process,” said the former official.He said that Blair and some of the other dignitaries “probably wouldn’t have recognised Storey anyway, which again says something about him”.And in a neat encapsulation of Storey’s significant but in many way reticent place in republican history and in the peace process he added: “He was very low profile, as befits an intelligence person – he was an observer.“But I do remember the respect my intelligence colleagues had for his operations. Quite apart from the Maze breakout to have planned the Northern Bank robbery and the Castlereagh break-in was extraordinary: respectively one of the largest bank robberies in history and the single biggest breach of UK national security ever. Quite a CV and he certainly didn’t lack ambition.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4296557.1593879919!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus claims one more life and 11 new cases reported in republic","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Passengers at Dublin Airport prepare for their trips.

Current Government advice is that all non-essential foreign travel should be avoided, and it will be discussed early next week how travel could resume safely by looking at whether overseas countries could be put on a “green list” if they have low levels of infection.In recent days, health officials have said they are “very concerned” by overseas travel, with foreign travel accounting for about 17 per cent of new cases, compared with about 2 per cent of cases in previous weeks.Sam McConkey, from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, said adding a “green list” of countries was an “unrealistic, hypothetical suggestion” because many countries that have eliminated the virus will not let Irish people enter due to the prevalence of the virus in the State.“What does an outbreak look like when it’s over? What is the definition of an epidemic being over in a country? That’s really no cases for twice the maximum incubation period, we know it’s 14 days incubation period maximum, so 28 days with no cases in our country and then we all take a big sigh of relief and then any other country that has reached that we would say we could safely fly back and forth.”The green list had been expected to be published next week but sources told The  this would be postponed until July 20th.The British government on Friday published a list of 59 countries to which people can travel without facing quarantine when they return to England, but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have not agreed to lift the quarantine rules.Prof McConkey used the example of New Zealand which has “controlled this virus”, but will not allow tourists from Ireland to enter the country due to the presence of Covid-19 in the State.He added that giving clarity on what would happen in three weeks’ time was “not realistic” because of how volatile the virus was.Prof McConkey advocated for the idea of a “staycation” this summer for members of the Irish public.“The Department of Foreign Affairs advice is very, very clear and it says no non-essential travel outside the island of Ireland. Heather Humphreys brought this idea of a staycation. I’m booked for west Cork and I think that’s what most of us should be doing,” he added.Speaking on the same programme, Fine Gael TD and Minister of State for Retail Businesses Damien English said the Government was due to meet on Monday to discuss overseas travel.“Around travel and restrictions and quarantine, that’s going to the full Cabinet on Monday. Every effort is being made here for two issues. One is the public health and to give confidence to people from this country and travelling into this country. The aim is at some stage, be it Monday or at a later stage, to have a list of countries that are safe to travel to and from,” he added.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4296523.1593854183!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"only a civil servant could have come up with unenforceable pub regulations","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tClancy’s Bar, Cork City has introduced temperature checks, private snugs and a roof garden. Pictured, Zaida Reyes  cleaning glass in one of the snugs. Photograph: Clare KeoghA publican in Cork has said he is not re-opening under Covid-19 restrictions because they would turn his bar “into a crime scene” and believes he would alienate customers. Con Dennehy, who owns the Venue in Ballintemple, is one of the 60 per cent of Cork publicans who opted not to re-open until July 20th, saying that he didn’t believe the current regulations where customers must book a slot and have a meal were particularly practical.“No, I haven’t reopened -I didn’t want to turn the bar into a crime scene with tape and screens everywhere and I didn’t want to alienate people I know and respect by telling them that they have to leave after 90 minutes or 105 minutes,” he told The . “To my mind, it’s only civil servants who could have made up these regulations because they are totally impractical and totally unenforceable - I’d rather stay closed until September if needs be to open properly for my locals and not end up alienating them with these regulations.”Mr Dennehy said that he expects to open on July 20th and when he does, he trusts his customers to be responsible regarding social distance and keeping one metre apart of their own volition, rather than he or his staff having to go around and asking people to keep apart.“Who is going to police social distancing? The gardaí hardly want to get involved in it, that’s a HSE job and do they have the personnel to police it? I think people should look after their own interest and do the sensible thing and keep their distance without having to be told.“If any fellow is iffy about going into a pub, he shouldn’t go in - I saw fellows coming in March before we closed down and they were taking their pint off the counter and stepping back and they were keeping their own social distance, they didn’t have to be asked so it was working back then.”‘Very co-operative’The majority of pubs in Cork have opted not to re-open until July 20th but those that have re-opened and are serving food in line with Government guidelines are generally expressing satisfaction with business, according to the Chair of the Cork Vintners Federation of Ireland, Michael O’Donovan.Mr O’Donovan said that approximately 40 per cent of the 208 pubs in the city and suburbs re-opened last Monday, serving substantial meals to customers who have to make a booking at the pub and generally it seemed to be working out reasonably well.“A few bars had some teething problems with people coming in and asking for a drink and the bar staff or management having to explain to them that they are really operating as a restaurant and they have to have food and they then can have a drink to accompany it.”Mr O’Donovan said the majority of customers have been very co-operative even though some of the bars are finding the 105-minute limit too restrictive, particularly when they are serving customers a three course meal which is being made to order in the pub.He said there did not appear to be any major problem with people turning up without bookings even though inidual pubs operated different systems with some pubs having set times that people can book while others are allowing the customers to choose a time and then booking a slot at that time.“All the bars have people at the door particularly in the evening so when people come to the door if they have capacity, they take them but if they are full they are moving on - what is noticeable that people are having multiple bookings, some in the same venue or some in other venues.”He said that all bars are operating social distancing and most people are being very co-operative even though he has heard of one or two cases where people have tried to pull tables together but once management explained that this wasn’t allowed, they accepted it.Mr O’Donovan, who runs the Castle Inn on South Main Street in the heart of Cork city, said that he would be waiting until July 20th as he does not serve food in the bar and like many of the 60pc of bars who have opted to wait until July 20th, he does not have a booking service.“We will have capacity for 28 people with one metre social distancing when we re-open on July 20th but if the Government introduce a booking system on July 20th, a lot of bars will remain close because they don’t have a booking engine.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4295881.1593811972!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord s week martin sparks olympian levels of whingeing in fianna f%C3%A1il","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Micheál Martin’s announcement of senior and junior ministers sparked Olympian levels of whingeing in the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party. Photograph: Julien BehalPA WireJobs and who gets them are a serious matter for politicians, as the farcical events this week in Fianna Fáil proved. Noses were hugely out of joint following Micheál Martin’s announcement of senior and junior ministers, sparking Olympian levels of whingeing in the parliamentary party.After the new Taoiseach insulted certain TDs who had been expecting the call to Cabinet by leaving them out, he then followed up spectacularly by bursting the carefully nurtured notions of many others by ignoring them for junior posts too.Michael Moynihan, who has been a TD for Cork North-West for 23 years without bothering the national consciousness too much, had a deliciously public meltdown when he failed to make his leader’s second-string ministerial team. After all his years of loyalty, he was absolutely furious. “Of course I am disappointed. Not alone has he insulted me, he has insulted the entire community of northwest Cork.”We understand the gleefully po-faced reports filed about the deputy’s upset did not convey a true sense of the colourful language employed to fully express his grief.There was much sympathy for the former chief whip among party colleagues who felt that he was shabbily treated. “What was Micheál playing at?” asked one. “Michael Moynihan would have died for him until four o’clock on Wednesday afternoon.”There was similar sympathy for party deputy leader Dara Calleary, who had been expecting a senior ministry only to be floored with a political punch to the solar plexus when given the job of chief whip. “He was shafted for being too nice to the other side,” said an Fine Gael adviser, referring to Calleary’s role as lead negotiator for Fianna Fáil in the government-formation talks. “If that was me I would have told Micheál to shove it up his hole,” muttered an overlooked colleague who wasn’t at all bitter at not even getting the chance to turn something down.The omission of Jim “Legally Bland” O’Callaghan was not as unexpected, as relations between the senior counsel and his leader are said to have cooled in recent months.The Dublin Bay South TD was offered a consolation junior ministry. He told Micheál to stick it where the sun don’t shine and then informed the nation he did this selflessly for the sake of the party, which he wants to help rebuild. There was no mention of his senior counsel’s salary which he would have been obliged to abandon for a piffling junior Minister’s wages. A senior portfolio would have sweetened the pill.Young and upcoming whippersnapper Willie O’Dea had the brass neck to come out and say Limerick had been “grossly insulted” and the Fianna Fáil bigwigs in Mayo were so appalled by the Cabinet choices of Micheál “Cromwell” that they held “an emergency Zoom meeting” on Sunday night. His colleague in Limerick county Niall Collins was on the 16th green in his local golf course when he was told he had a job he had a hole in one at the same spot last year. Fianna Fáil’s James Lawless in Kildare North was not so happy, claiming he was flooded with calls from members of the scientific community who were appalled to see him lose out. Why did so many people take the announcements so badly when they knew the boss had so few positions at this disposal in a three-way coalition?In contrast, while there were many upset hopefuls in Fine Gael and a few among the Greens too, they held their emotions in check. “The Fine Gael lads had to bite their lips because they want to stay in with Leo Varadkar for when he is taoiseach again and hands out the big jobs in 2½ years’ time” explained a Fianna Fáiler. There was also a view that Varadkar had signalled his intentions well in advance – nobody from the class of 2020 would be chosen and the longer-serving “old-timers” wouldn’t be kept.He also sent out a message that people who were strong and willing media performers would be rewarded. So the inclusion of Dublin’s Colm Brophy as a junior minister was no surprise as there is no catastrophe he won’t volunteer to talk up. Kildare’s Martin Heydon is another media stalwart and was duly recognised, while the well-regarded Kerry TD Brendan Griffin, who didn’t have such a high profile, failed to hang on to his junior ministry. Now that the message is out there, expect a few more willing soldiers to step in front of the cameras in an effort to keep up with Neale Richmond and Jennifer Carroll MacNeill, two new TDs who appear to be living part-time in television and radios studios.Meath’s Thomas Byrne was delighted to get the plum job of Minister of State for European Affairs, a role that outgoing minister for education Joe McHugh wanted in lieu of a Cabinet post, and when he heard it was gone he declined “his pick” of any of the other departments.In other job news, apart from the dispiriting lack of women at junior and senior level, the week’s other big winner was Fianna Fáil Senator Mark Daly, who took advantage of a stubborn stand-off between outgoing cathaoirleach Denis O’Donovan and fellow long-serving Senator Diarmuid Wilson to nip up the middle and swipe the coveted title from under their noses. A Senator told reporter Marie O’Halloran that O’Donovan and Wilson “are lifelong friends but were like two bulls in a field and neither would give way and Mark Daly slipped through the gap”.Kerry charmer Daly would not be the most prolific speaker or attendee in the Seanad and is partial to hobnobbing with US politicians on Capitol Hill who like the way he waxes lyrical about the Fourth Green Field. Now that he is “speaker” of the Irish Senate there’ll be no stopping him in Amerikay.Mary Lou McDonald overshadowedWho among us, upon hearing of the death of a much-loved pillar of society, has not rushed to the wardrobe to dig out a white shirt, black tie, black slacks and Tricolour armband? It’s the spontaneous thing to do. In the absence of funeral attendees Mary Lou McDonald and Pearse Doherty, it fell to leading Sinn Féin TD Violet-Anne Wynne to mark the passing of patriot and hero Bobby Storey by reading his name into the Dáil record.The newly-elected deputy for Clare did so on Tuesday. “I send my condolences to the family and friends of our comrade Bobby Storey, who will be laid to rest today. Bobby epitomised republicanism in Ireland and will be dearly missed. I have no doubt but that he would be happy in the knowledge of the strides our party has taken in recent years to get to where we are,” she said, reading carefully from a script. Nobody else echoed her remarks.The Ceann Comhairle didn’t call for a minute’s silence, but then, nobody asked for one.On the Leinster House plinth on Thursday, Mary Lou, bravely bearing up following the sad loss of the lovable enforcer, named her front bench. It’s an impressive line-up. Sinn Féin will give the new Government no quarter. Unfortunately, her big reveal was overshadowed by the continuing controversy over the lack of adherence to social-distancing rules at her dear comrade’s funeral in Belfast. Bobby, she said, was her friend and she will apologise to no one for paying her respects. And there was nothing she nor anyone else could do to prevent people coming out in their droves for the funeral procession.Obviously, mindful of the public-health restrictions and their civic duty, the Sinn Féin organisation in west Belfast would have put the word out that people should stay at home because the funeral guidelines – which have caused such heartache and hardship to so many – apply to their party and supporters in the same way they do to ordinary folk. But since when was Sinn Féin able to tell people what to do in west Belfast? It’s not like HQ on the Falls Road dictates the law in that neck of the woods, is it?As she stood on the plinth and spoke in glowing terms of the personality, if not the acts, of the former IRA commander said to be the mastermind behind the post-peace process Northern Bank robbery and celebrated as the sort of fella you wouldn’t like to cross on a dark night, deputy McDonald drew comparisons with crowd scenes at the funeral of Det Garda Colm Horkan, who was shot dead in the line of duty in Castlerea, Co Roscommon. While not mentioning the slain garda by name she said: “This is the problem when somebody is a public figure or when somebody dies in very tragic circumstances and very difficult circumstances, people will come out to pay their respects.”Party supporters on social media were not so circumspect.It is true that social distancing went out the window at that funeral in Castlerea, as it did along the Falls Road and Andersonstown Road, where black flags flew from buildings. But unlike the choreographed scenes in west Belfast, the scaled-down turnout of politicians and top police officers (the President and taoiseach expressed their condolences remotely) in Charlestown did not pose for photographs and selfies with the public afterwards.Sinn Féin surprise announcementThere was some surprise at the announcement of the new Sinn Féin front bench when Louise O’Reilly, one of the party’s star Dáil performers, was moved from health to shadow Leo Varadkar in enterprise, trade and employment. It’s not that people think she isn’t up to the job – she won’t be going easy on her former colleague in Fingal County Council. But they were recalling her party leader’s words in the Convention Centre last Saturday when she was setting out Sinn Féin’s opposition stall for the 33rd Dáil.“Because of your lack of ambition, this is a Government already on borrowed time. Workers and families know that they deserve so much better and it’s that belief that will drive Sinn Féin’s determination to deliver effective opposition,” McDonald said in her speech after Taoiseach Micheál Martin had appointed his Cabinet.“We have the policies, Ceann Comhairle. We have the team: Pearse Doherty has the plan to shape a fair economy, Louise O’Reilly for a national health service, Eoin Ó Broin has the plan to make housing affordable. We are happy to share those plans with you.” But Louise has a different plan now. Waterford’s David Cullinane is now the spokesman on health.She seemed quite pleased with her new job, although as she made her way back inside Leinster House from the plinth she passed a journalist who happens to be a native of Waterford. “Huh,” she said, “and a blaa is only a bap anyway.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4296549.1593872336!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach disappointed he only learned of barry cowen s driving ban on friday","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Agriculture Barry Cowen said he was ‘profoundly sorry’ about the incident. Photograph: Alan BetsonTaoiseach Micheál Martin has said he is “disappointed” that he only learned on Friday of a driving ban served by Minister for Agriculture Barry Cowen four years ago.In 2016, Mr Cowen served a three-month disqualification from driving after he was found to be driving under the influence of alcohol.He was found to be over the limit and was issued with a fixed charge penalty notice, a €200 fine, and was disqualified from driving for three months.The TD had a provisional licence at the time of the incident, resulting in a driving ban instead of penalty points. The law on drink-driving for learner drivers four years ago meant a concentration 10mg-35mg of alcohol per 100ml of breath was considered over the limit.Mr Cowen’s case did not go to court as the level of alcohol in his system was on the lower scale and did not reach the level required for prosecution.Mr Cowen said he was “profoundly sorry” about the incident, adding that it was “an appalling lapse and one which I have to accept and learn from”.In a statement on Saturday morning, the Taoiseach said he was first made aware of the “issue” on Friday afternoon.“I have spoken to Minister Cowen and I accept that his remorse about this incident is genuine,” he said. “I am disappointed that I learned about it in this way and have made that clear to him.”Mr Cowen was appointed Minister for Agriculture last week by the Taoiseach and was a member of the Fianna Fáil negotiating team in the coalition talks.The Minister has been a TD since 2011 and served as the party’s public expenditure spokesman for the past two years.He comes from a long line of Fianna Fáil politicians, with his brother Brian a former taoiseach and their late father Ber a former TD."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4290693.1593296152!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"who is in the new cabinet members in profile","story":"Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has been elected Taoiseach by 93 votes to 63, with three abstentions, in a historic Dáil vote which has taken place in Dublin’s Convention Centre. Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party deputy leader Catherine Martin is now Minister   for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht.A new Taoiseach was elected on Saturday and a range of new Ministers were appointed. Here’s all you need to know about them:He became party leader in 2011 just weeks before the general election when Fianna Fáil lost 51 seats in the fall-out from the economic collapse. The five wilderness years were spent reorganising the party and its decimated cohort of TDs.In 2016, Fianna Fáil had a mini-revival, regaining 23 seats and in the 2019 local elections won the most seats of any party. The four years since were spent building up a still volatile parliamentary party but Fianna Fáil suffered further losses in the 2020 election and dropped six seats, partially blamed on the party’s confidence and supply agreement with Fine Gael.The 2020 election had become do or die for Martin, whose Cork South-Central constituency will now be home to three Cabinet members - himself as Taoiseach, his party colleague Michael McGrath and former tánaiste Simon Coveney.The first Cork Taoiseach for 41 years since Jack Lynch, he has been a TD since 1989, served on Fianna Fáil’s front bench since 1995 and held four senior government portfolios during the party’s time in office - foreign affairs, health, education and enterprise.Single-minded and driven with a huge work ethic, the pragmatic Martin can be sensitive to criticism. A good media performer he is however seen by some within the party as distant and colleagues are hoping that communications within the party will improve.Health conscious and very proud of introducing the smoking ban in Ireland, he has pushed the Public Health (Alcohol) Act despite the reluctance of rural TDs within the party.Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and EmploymentAfter a terrible election result and what appeared initially to be a guaranteed trip across the Dáil to the opposition benches, Leo Varadkar’s fortunes have been transformed along with those of his party.His calm and assured leadership performance through the coronavirus pandemic combined with a lengthy stalemate over coalition formation talks have resulted in Fine Gael soaring from losers to clear victors in the opinion polls and with Varadkar moving from spent political force back to key player.Nobody has batted an eyelid at the fact that he will preside over the party’s abandonment of its Civil War stance after a century and move into a historic government coalition with Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.Even less remarked on has been his demotion to Tánaiste for over two years as Fine Gael participates in the previously vilified notion of rotating taoiseach. But he also leads his party into an unprecedented third term in office.A social agenda trailblazer, he is Ireland’s first openly gay minister, the State’s youngest taoiseach and is now Tánaiste. The son of an Irish mother and Indian father, his qualification as a doctor helped during the pandemic and assured him of good publicity when he decided to re-register as a medic and said he would do half a day a week on the helpline for people who suspected they had the Covid-19 virus.Never one to shy away from a photo opportunity, the 41-year-old was also the first taoiseach to assiduously use social media to push his message and his carefully cultivated image. And he got into the much discussed habit during lockdown of quoting a variety of books, films and other media in his speeches.He has also used his speeches to throw out provocative messages reflecting his economic views including his oft quoted controversial remark that Fine Gael should represent those who “get up early in the morning”.He previously served as minister for social protection, for transport and for health and now moves into the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. But it remains to be seen if he will innovate rather than merely manage as he was perceived to have done in his previous portfolios.Michael McGrath - Minister for Public Expenditure and ReformWhen political heavy hitter Michael McGrath (43) became Fianna Fáil’s finance spokesman, then minister for finance Michael Noonan pronounced that the accountant had a big future ahead of him in politics.That future has finally arrived for the Cork South-Central TD who has been finance spokesman since 2011, when Fine Gael was in coalition with Labour and again when Fine Gael relied on Independents and Fianna Fáil’s confidence and supply arrangement.First elected to the Dáil in 2007 he has retained his seat at each subsequent election. It has been a long road for the man who will finally take the helm at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.A constituency rival and colleague of his party leader he is seen as a potential successor, is well liked by his party colleagues and has a well-oiled constituency machine.Originally from Passage West but now living in Carrigaline with his wife Sarah O’Brien and seven children, he secured a first-class honours commerce degree in UCC and qualified as a chartered accountant with KPMG in Cork City.A central member of the party’s negotiating team in the government formation talks, he is a low-key, calm and effective spokesman.Stephen Donnelly - Minister for HealthThe appointment of Stephen Donnelly to Cabinet makes it two Ministers for Health in a row for his Wicklow constituency taking the baton from Simon Harris. It is a job often seen as a political crucifixion for the holder.Elected to the Dáil as an Independent on his first attempt in 2011, he went on to form the Social Democrats with Róisín Shortall and Catherine Murphy in 2015 and surged to a poll-topping performance in Wicklow in 2016.Shortly afterwards however, he left the party following disagreements with his co-leaders.In the Dáil he has since had a number of disagreements with the Social Democrats on the much lauded Sláintecare plan and all eyes will be keenly watching how he deals with the much debated health roadmap.After a short second  as an Independent he joined Fianna Fáil in 2017. While party leader Micheál Martin saw his recruitment as a major coup, his arrival left many noses out of joint in Fianna Fáil. Those tensions and the move, appeared to dent his 2020 election chances but he was elected on the 15th count.Darragh O’Brien, Minister for Housing, Local Government and HeritageAnother member of the Fianna Fáil negotiating team to get a seat at the big table Darragh O’Brien (45) becomes Minister for Housing in the new three-party Government.Party spokesman on housing, planning and local government in the last Dáil, he was first elected to the Dáil in 2007. He lost out in the 2011 decimation of the party in the economic recession. He became one of 51 party TDs to be defeated at the hands of angry voters. He successfully ran for the Seanad that year on the Labour panel and became Seanad leader, keeping a place in the Oireachtas.But his Dáil defeat had a salutary effect, resulting in him building up a strong constituency base with his brother as a local councillor. It may have contributed to local party tensions with Dublin Fingal colleague Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee.He went on to top the poll in Dublin Fingal in the 2016 general election.Before entering politics he worked in the financial services sector for 15 years as an area manager with Life Assurance Company.He was elected to Fingal County Council in 2004 before successfully contesting a Dáil seat in 2007.He is married with a young family.Barry Cowen, Minister for Agriculture and the MarineThe no-nonsense Fianna Fáil spokesman on public expenditure and reform Barry Cowen (52) has been appointed Minister for Agriculture. The man who sealed the fate of the water charges in the 2016 government formation negotiations, was again a key member of the negotiating team this time round.The 2016 talks led to the confidence and supply arrangement with Fine Gael but left Fianna Fáil out of government. The intense five-week\u0026nbspcampaign in 2020 led to government and the reward of a seat at the top table for the Clara, Co Offaly native.A brother of former taoiseach Brian Cowen he has been spokesman in a number of portfolios since his election to the Dáil in 2011. As well as spokesman on public expenditure and reform he also held the position of spokesman on environment and local government and on social protection.A married father of four, he was first elected to Offaly county council in 1999, where he served until his election to the Dáil to the seat vacated by his brother.A member of the Cowen family has represented Offaly in the Dáil continuously since 1977. His father Bernard Cowen was elected in 1969 but lost his seat in 1973. He regained it in 1977 and held it until his death in 1984.Norma Foley, Minister for EducationKerry TD Norma Foley, who nominated her party leader Micheál Martin to be Taoiseach has been appointed Minister for Education, five months after her election to the Dáil for the first time.Martin is said to prefer TDs to have done at least a term on the backbenches but the new TD who is a teacher by profession, has shown herself to be an impressive performer and has been effective at the Covid-19 committee in the questioning of witnesses. Calm, courteous and well prepared, she has a great grasp of detail and the bigger picture.The Tralee native took the fifth and final seat in the general election in Kerry, edging out her running mate and outgoing TD John Brassil.It is her second run at the Dáil, having been on the Fianna Fáil ticket in the 2007 election, when she was selected over Brassil.Since 2004, Foley has represented the people of Tralee Municipal District on Kerry County Council, topping the poll in last May’s local elections.She has also served on Tralee Town Council, and held the position of mayor of Tralee on three occasions, most recently in 20172018. In 20182019 she served as mayor of Kerry.She is the daughter of the late Denis Foley, who served as a TD for the constituency for 18 years, broken up by a three-year stint as a senator. He was named as the holder of an undisclosed offshore Ansbacher account.She is married to fellow teacher Denis Maguire.Simon Coveney, Minister for Foreign Affairs and DefenceHe may have lost his role as tánaiste but Simon Coveney (48) has retained the much coveted position of Minister for Foreign Affairs. Greatly admired by departmental staff as probably the hardest working minister in that portfolio, he has received much acclaim for his efforts in dealing with Brexit and is seen as the driving political force in Ireland securing its temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council.Loved by the party’s grassroots and accessible to TDs and Senators, he still retains ambitions to be party leader and is seen as likely to get there. A cautious and moderate politician, his tearaway teenage years when he was expelled from Clongowes school for drinking and partying, before being asked back – are at odds with his later serious image.From Cork’s so-called merchant class and a keen rugby and sailing fan, he has a degree in agriculture and land management and was catapulted into the world of politics following the death of his father Hugh, a TD and former minister, in 1998.He later successfully ran for the European Parliament in 2004 but returned to Ireland for the 2007 general election and he has successfully retained his seat since. He served as minister for agriculture for all five years of the Enda Kenny-led administration from 2011 later adding defence to his portfolio when Eamon Gilmore resigned as tánaiste.From 2016 he spent just a year as minister for housing, when his pledge to end all emergency hotel and B\u0026ampB\u0026nbspaccommodation backfired, before he moved to the hallowed halls of the Department of Foreign Affairs.Seen as open in his approach and meticulous in his work practices, he has risen solidly and steadily through the party’s ranks and his experience in Brexit talks paved the way for his central role in the government formation talks.Paschal Donohoe, Minister for FinanceAs soon as Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe confirmed he was putting his name forward as a unity candidate for the presidency of the Eurogroup, it was clear he was confident of returning to his office in Merrion Street.Ever cautious and highly political he would have been slow to put his reputation on the line without some assurance of keeping his own job while he applied for the top spot in the influential club of finance ministers from countries that use the euro.The deadline for that role came a day before the outcome of the vote on the programme for government.He is highly popular within the party although less so after his poison chalice position as director of elections for both the Dáil and Seanad elections.The electorate proved less than happy with the party’s budgetary and spending policies and Fine Gael lost 12 Dáil seats. It was also embarrassed by the failure to have any women elected to the Upper House.Nine years a TD for Dublin Central, the 45-year-old has held the finance portfolio since 2017. He previously served as a minister of state and then as minister for transport.A central member of the party’s leadership and key to the government formation talks he is viewed as culturally one of the more rounded Cabinet members with an interest in books, film and theatre.The former sales manager with a multinational firm will need all his skills as a party persuader and negotiator to navigate the traumatic economic conditions facing the State while keeping faith with his wary Fianna Fáil and suspicious Green Party colleagues.He will be happy to leave his one stated regret – not managing to control the costs of the new national children’s hospital – to Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath who takes up the re-ided Department of Public Expenditure and Reform portfolio.He is married with two children and lives in Phibsborough, Dublin.Heather Humphreys, Minister for Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the IslandsOne of the Ministers always seen as sure of keeping her seat at the cabinet table, Heather Humphreys fits the criteria for geography, gender and ability.A border-county TD, she was the first woman elected to the Cavan-Monaghan constituency in 2011, when she took over from fellow Presbyterian Fine Gael colleague Seymour Crawford.Now in her third Dáil term and one of three female TDs in the five-seat constituency, she is highly regarded within Fine Gael and viewed as capable and a safe pair of hands.A first-term backbench TD when she was appointed to cabinet in 2011 as minister for arts, heritage and the Gaeltacht she won plaudits for her stewardship of the successful 1916 Rising centenary commemorations.A loyal ally of former taoiseach Enda Kenny she was re-appointed to the portfolio by him in 2016 but was one of the first Ministers to declare her support for Leo Varadkar in the 2017 leadership contest.He promoted her to the Business, Enterprise and Innovation portfolio in 2017 following the resignation of tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald.A business background through her work with Ulster Bank and as manager of Cootehill Credit Union also helped secure her appointment. The coronavirus pandemic brought her biggest political challenge with the crisis facing thousands of businesses and leaving a 25 per cent unemployment rate. Grant and income support schemes, loans and other initiatives have helped cushion the initial blow.The Government will now have to deal with the fallout from a controversial High Court judgment striking out a sectoral employment order and ruling that she had acted outside her powers in making the order for the electrical industry.Her career in finance, experience as minister for business and farming background in Co Monaghan, where she is married with two adult daughters, make her a good candidate for the rural development portfolio.Elected for the first time in the 2011 general election, she lives in Aghabog, near Monaghan town, and her family is from the Cavan-Monaghan border area.Helen McEntee, Minister for JusticeA reserved but smart politician Helen McEntee (33) from Castletown, Co Meath, has been a TD since 2013 when she won the byelection following the death of her father Shane McEntee.Minister of State for European Affairs since 2017, the Meath East TD proved her mettle in the ever present and fraught Brexit crisis, leading the Government’s response on a number of related issues.She has been described as Leo Varadkar’s “secret weapon” and is considered level-headed and a very good negotiator. Former president of the European Council Donald Tusk called her “diligent” and an “exceptional diplomat”. She is one of 10 vice-presidents of the European People’s Party, Fine Gael’s centre-right representative grouping in the EU.Graduating from DCU in 2007 having studied law, politics and economics, she worked briefly in a Citibank subsidiary. She later completed a masters in journalism and communications and worked with her father in Leinster House, first in opposition and then when he was appointed minister of state.A supporter of Varadkar’s from the start she has been by his side throughout the Brexit crisis and has a keen understanding of its intricacies and complexities.Simon Harris, Minister for Higher Education, Innovation and ScienceDespite his increased stature during the coronavirus pandemic as minister for health Simon Harris (33) became a focus of increasing speculation in recent days that he would be demoted from Cabinet.In the fateful 2017 Fine Gael leadership campaign he took sides early on in favour of Simon Coveney as opposed to Varadkar but held onto the health portfolio Kenny appointed him to in 2016.Described as the “teenage” minister when first appointed to the hugely significant but poison chalice department, he has visibly aged in the past three months through the stresses of the Covid-19 crisis.He remained a popular choice in his Wicklow constituency in the election despite concerns about a shortage of hospital beds, the spiralling cost of the new national children’s hospital and the recruitment and retention difficulties around healthcare staff.Those issues disappeared during the pandemic with the unprecedented takeover of all private hospitals and the return home of emigrant doctors and nurses to assist with the crisis.These problems have re-emerged but are no longer an issue for Harris as he moves on from the department described as a war zone.A social media expert, he is one of the party’s top media performers, assured and persuasive in his delivery, accessible and generally guaranteed to avoid political gaffes.He first became engaged in politics while campaigning for his younger brother and other children with autism. He topped the poll in the local elections and secured the highest vote in the country through his social media campaign.While a councillor, he approached then Seanad leader Frances Fitzgerald, became her parliamentary assistant and moved into Leinster House politics from there.Viewed as having an uneasy relationship with his party leader he is far from the inner circle. He is married with one child and lives in Greystones, Co Wicklow.Eamon Ryan - Minister for Climate Action, Communications Networks and TransportIt has been a torrid few months for Green Party leader Eamon Ryan (56) as he enters Government with a deeply scarred and ided party.In all the controversy the spectacular success in winning 12 seats in the general election has been all but forgotten.Now appointed to his long sought role in climate action and transport he will have little time to relish the challenge as he bids to heal the schism within the party.It is a reflection of the party’s isions that when he was mired in controversy after repeating a racial slur in the Dáil that it took a minister from another party, Charlie Flanagan of Fine Gael to publicly defend the Dublin Bay South TD by saying he did not have a racist bone in his body.But through all the accusations, insults and recriminations he has been calm, conciliatory and with party deputy leader Catherine Martin has persuaded the party’s membership to decisively back an unprecedented government with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.He now faces a leadership contest against his deputy leader but has remained sanguine about the prospect.An impassioned speaker prone to gaffes, including a call during the election campaign for the re-introduction of wolves, he nonetheless led a team to rebuild the party after its disastrous first foray into coalition government after which it lost all six Dáil seats.A councillor before his 2007 election to the Dáil he previously ran a bicycle shop and cycling holiday business.He is married to journalist Victoria White and they have four sons.Catherine Martin - Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the GaeltachtDublin Rathdown TD and deputy Green party leader Catherine Martin (47) emerged as a surprising contender for the top job in the party.Her stance on coalition has strained the previously close working relationship with Eamon Ryan but his move to appoint her as lead negotiator in the coalition talks was seen as an inspired move.Cautious by nature, she is said to seek advice widely and does not say things lightly. Some in her party are said to find it hard to gauge where she stands and those on the other side of the negotiating table have described her as an enigma.As an influential voice in the party she will have a significant role in attempting to heal the party’s schism.From her first days in the Dáil she forged good relations across all parties and founded the Irish Women’s Parliamentary Caucus in the Oireachtas, pressed for anti-bullying protocols in the Leinster House campus.From Carrickmacross, Co Monaghan she trained as a classical singer and after graduating from NUI Maynooth, she taught music and English at St Tiernan’s Community School in Ballinteer.Her initial foray into politics was when she was co-opted to her brother Vincent P Martin’s council seat in Monaghan in the 1990s. She returned to politics in Dublin, was elected as a councillor in 2014 and came from nowhere to win a Dáil seat in 2016.Her husband Francis Noel Duffy became a TD in 2020 and took an opposing view in rejecting the coalition deal. The couple has three children.Roderic O’Gorman - Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and IntegrationLong predicted to make the high table Roderic O’Gorman (38) is one of the Green party’s most experienced politicians. His victory in the 2020 general election marked his 10th foray in 15 years including four general elections, two byelections and four local elections. The party’s justice and equality spokesman he was on the negotiating team and insisted in the talks that the coalition must make a commitment to end direct provision.A former chairman of the party he served from 2011 to 2019.From Tyrellstown he lives with his partner Ray Healy in Blanchardstown. A lecturer at the Brexit Institute and School of Law and Government in DCU he is a graduate of Trinity College and the London School of Economics.Close to both party leader Ryan and deputy leader Martin he is courteous, considered and reflective in his deliberations and well regarded across the party. He is a fan of TV shows West Wing, Game of Thrones and Arrested Development.Hildegarde Naughton - Minister of State at the Department of Climate Action, she will be attending CabinetOne of the survivors of the electoral cull of Fine Gael TDs, Hildegarde Naughton (43) has consistently grown in experience and stature since she first arrived on the political stage in 2009.That was the year the former schoolteacher was first elected to Galway City Council, becoming mayor two years later. Mentored and promoted by then taoiseach Enda Kenny, the Galway West TD was appointed to the Seanad in 2013.In 2016 she seized the chance to get on the Fine Gael ticket in the general election after Barry Walsh stepped aside from politics on health grounds.Chair of the Oireachtas Committee for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment in the last Dáil she fought the green fight in an uphill and forthright battle to persuade many reluctant party colleagues to the cause and has been Fine Gael’s leading environmentalist.That role, that experience and her capability has brought her to the Cabinet table - along with the need to have some gender balance at cabinet and take account of geographical considerations.Outside politics she is a talented singer who has performed and won awards for her roles in musical theatre. While a senator she established a group called Bel Canto with two other sopranos, who sang at charity events. She has described her musical interest as “my golf”.Pippa Hackett, “Super Junior” Minister of StateGreen Party Senator Pippa Hackett’s appointment as a “Super Junior” Minister of State is the first appointment of a Senator to Cabinet since the early 1980s.She takes on the role of Minister of State for Agriculture with responsibility for land use and bioersity.Her appointment has taken some by surprise amid speculation that someone among the party’s TDs might be selected.A farmer from Offaly and the party’s agriculture spokeswoman, she was elected to the Seanad in a byelection in November when a vacancy arose following the election of then Senator Grace O’Sullivan to the European parliament.But the move is as much a surprise because it is virtually unprecedented.The last time a Senator took on a ministerial role was in 1981 when then taoiseach Garrett FitzGerald nominated Senator James Dooge as minister for foreign affairs, a portfolio he held for a year.A vocal supporter of the programme for government, Hackett was elected unopposed to the agricultural panel in the Seanad when the other parties opted not to contest the seat.Formerly an Offaly county councillor she lost out in the general election for the Laois-Offaly constituency when she was eliminated in the final round.Originally from Ballandine, Co Mayo she is married with four children and lives in Edenderry, Co Offaly.Dara Calleary - Chief whipNew Government chief whip Dara Calleary has Fianna Fáil in his DNA. The Mayo TD who has been in the Dáil since 2007 and is the son of late TD and former minister of state Sean Calleary who served in the Dáil from 1973 to 1992. His grandfather Phelim was TD for Mayo from 1952 to 1969.Affable and steady, popular with party colleagues he is deputy leader and viewed as a safe pair of hands.He has had a previous taste of government when he served as minister of state for labour affairs and public service transformation from 2009 to 2011 in the Fianna Fáil, Green Party coalition.A graduate of Trinity College with a degree in business and politics he has served as the party’s spokesman on justice, equality and defence, as well as spokesman on jobs, enterprise and innovation.Paul Gallagher SC, Attorney GeneralThis will be Paul Gallagher’s second time in the job, having previously served from 2007 to 2011. During his first term, he was called to offer legal advice on some of the biggest issues ever to face an Irish government, including the bank guarantee scheme, the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency and the International Monetary Fund Troika programme.He is regarded as one of Ireland’s top barristers, with a fearsome work ethic."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"More than 75,000 evacuated in southern region after landslides and torrential rainZheng Yanxiong will work with police to stamp out pro-democracy demonstrationsNorth Korea claims to have no cases of Covid-19 despite links with ChinaBeijing enraged at plan to help up to 3m residents in fallout over national security lawAt least nine charged under Chinese law that critics say strips Hong Kong of rights and freedomsLaw will punish crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusionHot and bothered commuters refuse to wear masks on public transportTesting blitz as recent jump in infections in Australia stokes fears of second waveHistoric move will allow authorities to crack down on subversive and secessionist activityRisks of viruses crossing species barrier into humans in densely populated regions highlightedWashington plans to target Chinese officials undermining Asian financial hub autonomyJustin Trudeau called on Beijing to cease the \u0026lsquoarbitrary detention\u0026rsquo of two CanadiansMany were struck as they were planting seeds across Bihar state in east of countryThe decades-long project sees a constellation of 35 satellites circling the Earth to rival the US-owned Global Positioning System (GPS)Regime rows back on threat to deploy troops near border amid rising tensionsOfficials prepare \u0026lsquoretaliatory punishment\u0026rsquo after anti-North balloons arrived from SouthBan on cruise ships extended beyond June 30th cases increase as more citizens return homeCovid-19 outbreak in staff at Tyson foods in Arkansas sparks Beijing U-turn on policyChina says draft law is aimed at separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion abroadSamira Imin\u0026rsquos father was incarcerated for three years in XinjiangStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Israel\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4294866.1593715662!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the abrupt end to brexit talks is not only surprising but perplexing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBoris Johnson: Has the immediate political scope to move either way on the negotiations. Photograph:   Will OliverEPABut the language on both sides was restrained and Frost’s had none of the belligerence that often characterises his rhetoric towards Brussels. The fact that Barnier chose not to give a press conference was seen by some as another happy augury but it was in fact simply an act of deference towards Angela Merkel and Ursula von der Leyen, who were giving a joint press conference later.Before this week’s talks began, the EU told Britain it was ready to compromise in order to accommodate the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a video conference last month with the presidents of the European institutions.“The EU side had listened carefully to UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s statements in recent weeks, in particular, his request to reach a political agreement quickly, and his red lines: no role for the European Court of Justice in the UK no obligation for the UK to continue to be bound by EU law and an agreement on fisheries that shows Brexit makes a real difference,” Barnier said on Thursday.The Europeans hoped that Britain would respond with a step towards compromise of its own but by the time the talks ended on Thursday, Frost had produced no such offer. During the course of the week, it became clear that unless Britain makes a substantial move within days, there will be no significant progress this month.Judgment callJohnson this week named Frost as his next national security adviser and the chief negotiator’s word carries a rare level of authority in Downing Street. Last October, he successfully urged Johnson to accept the revised withdrawal agreement as the best available deal. He faces a similar judgment call today.The British red lines Barnier spoke about on Thursday are those Johnson identified in last month’s conference call. The two sides are also at odds over the governance structure but Johnson did not mention it on the call and British misgivings about signing up to a single overarching agreement have diminished. Some within the government recognise that it offers opportunities as well as risks.The issue of fisheries is highly charged politically on both sides but neither views a compromise as impossible. Although Britain rejects the concept of binding “level playing field” commitments, it will agree to maintain current employment, environmental and consumer standards.The toughest issue is state aid, with the EU calling for Britain to continue to follow EU rules on a continuing basis. This is problematic for Britain both because it limits the country’s freedom to subsidise indigenous industry and because it would give the ECJ a role in British economic policy.One obstacle in the way of a compromise is the fact that Britain has not yet set out plans for how it wants its own state aid regime to operate after the end of the transition period on December 31st. This leaves the EU unable to evaluate how a system of parallel state aid regimes would work, with both sides agreeing guidelines but regulating separately.While the British accuse the Europeans of being too legalistic, the Europeans complain about British amateurishness. But both sides agree that Johnson wants a deal and that he would like to get it as soon as possible.At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, there was talk around Westminster and Whitehall about how the crisis could reduce – or at least obscure – the impact of failure to agree a deal with the EU. But few now talk about the disruption of a no-deal outcome being lost within the greater disruption caused by coronavirus.Cost of no-dealBank of England governor Andrew Bailey said last week that the British government could have struggled to fund itself if the bank had not intervened with £200 billion of quantitative easing to buy government debt. The cost of a no-deal outcome to the EU talks, on top of the ballooning cost of the coronavirus crisis, would test either Bailey’s patience\u0026nbspor his credibility when he insists the bank is not underwriting the British government’s debt.Donald Trump’s declining political fortunes are also driving Johnson towards an EU deal as he prepares to deal with Joe Biden, a multilateralist whose advisers see Brexit as an expression of right-wing populism. As Suzanne Lynch has reported, Biden and his team are also acutely sensitive to any risk to the peace process and will monitor closely Britain’s implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol.Despite the fall in his approval ratings, Johnson remains in a very strong position with an 80-seat majority in parliament and no prospect of a general election until 2024. He has the immediate political scope to move either way on the negotiations but failure to reach a deal with the EU will make it harder for him to fulfil his government’s domestic agenda and to make a success of Brexit.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

Can I see some BBC researchers waving at the back of the room? Welcome to the world as some of us have known it for a long time.There is nothing at all surprising here: this is just what happens to pretty much any protest that grabs the public imagination. All it takes is a flurry of headlines and a few choice spots on the broadcast news and your cause is a prime candidate for infiltration by the people who attach the same label to everything that attracts socially acceptable opprobrium: all forms of injustice, suffering or potential damage can be attributed to the original sin of capitalism (or imperialism which is just an export version of the profit motive).This process of infiltration has been the deliberate policy of Leftwing militancy since my grandmother’s day. She was a Communist party member in the 1930s. As a sewing machine operator in the Jewish rag trade during the American Depression, she became a trade unionist and then a party activist. When my father was a boy, he was sent along to meetings of book clubs and community organisations with innocent-sounding apolitical names which were actually front groups designed to educate the young in the proper doctrine.He stopped attending, he once told me, when he realised that it was the same handful of people running all these various activities - and that the arguments they were pitching were pretty much identical in every context. Most of these organisations had, almost certainly, once been what their names still proclaimed them to be - promoters of local interests or pastimes - before they were hollowed out and turned into propaganda organs for what was then the Stalinst Soviet regime.By the time I reached my own youthful stage of political activism, the practice was called “entryism” and it was Trotsky who was the hero, not Stalin. But the principle was the same: not only were we advised to join and influence the direction of any influential new movement that appeared on the scene but even, if we were really up for lifelong dedication, to make a permanent professional commitment to the process.In New Left circles in the late 1960s and early 70s, it was commonplace for members of International Socialism (IS) which was the earlier incarnation of the Socialist Workers’ Party, to resign their membership in order to join Labour – because in those days, before James Callaghan changed the rules on entryism, you could not be a member of both at the same time. They would then run for the local council and exert as much control as possible over their borough’s political stance. (You may recall the Vietcong flags that occasionally flew over Labour town halls.)Other IS members we knew took on jobs as trade union officials, some of whom I believe remain in post. But most committed activists just stayed in whatever employment they could find that was reasonably congenial (there were lots of them in the print trades and in academic life) and gave over their spare time to the radical cause in any number of guises. So when I heard that Joshua Virasami, a leader and vociferous spokesman of the UK BLM movement, had declared that capitalism was terrorism, and that the police who represented state terrorism, should be defunded – and further, that he had previously chained himself to fellow activists outside a London airport on the grounds that global climate change was racist, I thought, ah yes... here we are again.Then came the scramble of various organisations that should have been less naive (or might at least have spent ten minutes doing some intensive Googling) to disassociate themselves from the more absurd demands being put forward in the name of BLM. The BBC – obviously – was most prominent, advising its presenters to est themselves of BLM badges on air. Then there were various Premier League football teams and some sports commentators from Sky television... well you know the rest.The whole phenomenon managed in the end to be both ludicrous and sad. It had begun with a genuinely tragic event which was eminently worthy of protest: the killing of an unarmed black man by a white policeman while fellow officers stood by and watched, even though it took place in another country, was so horrifying that public demonstrations of outrage seemed perfectly understandable. There was nothing unreasonable about George Floyd’s death being used as a symbol of bigotry and racial injustice throughout the world.It all went horribly wrong when the agitators moved in and started shooting their mouths off. But stupidity and incoherence and opportunism are always with us. The truly culpable players in this game are the tag-along media and celebrity hangers-on who are so guileless that they facilitate the corrupting of a legitimate protest movement by political manipulation. So what is this all about in the minds of those amateur – or professional – infiltrators?Surely they are not consciously malign: simply subverting good causes for the sheer hell of it? No reader, this is not just nihilism or puerile mischief. If you have bought the Marxist package (or the faux Marxist one that now seems to be the only version available) you actually, sincerely believe that capitalism – the profit motive – is the cause of every social tragedy.Instead of seeing free market economics as a great liberator – having delivered mass prosperity, and the self-determination which follows from it, on a scale that is unprecedented in human history – you regard it as the enslavement of one class (or race) by another. And if you honestly believe that, then you see it as your moral duty to make use of every vehicle available for telling this story to the benighted mob who have been tricked into a state of false consciousness by their exploiters. This is the great lie that made possible one of the most successful tyrannies in modern history. It still needs to be challenged and deconstructed over and over again.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hairdressers start snipping first trims since lockdown","story":"Someone is kneading my scalp, nape and behind my ears: long, masterful, hypnotic strokes that make my shoulders unclench for the first time since March. It’s not erotic, but it is profoundly sensuous in the Miltonic, non-sexual sense. I am Meryl Streep having her hair washed by Robert Redford in Out of Africa.

I’ve been consulting with Government in my position as a board member of the British Beauty Council and have found them very thorough and responsive.” Half of the salon’s chairs have been removed, appointments will be taken online, and payments made by card. There will be longer opening hours, with shift work to reduce staff presence, temperature checks, stringent disinfecting, no cutting of dry hair, no food and drink, and PPE available to all.The result continues to be remarkably civilised once one’s got past the landmine-era Princess Diana visors. And, good Lord, isn’t it incredible to be talking to people, not at home, doing something in the flesh! Not just doing anything, mind, but engaged in that sublime state of being groomed. As Christie enthuses: “Hair is an intrinsic part of our identity. It can perform a magical illusion of transforming us from one person to another. In these times of chaos, control over how we feel about ourselves is so significant.I have been counting the days until I can be reunited with Josh.”So giddy about my appointment was I, I woke at 4.15am.Now, almost 24 hours later, I still can’t believe my luck, feeling slightly sick with excitement. My hair has been okay in lockdown, if by “okay” one means straw-like and restrained in a scrunchie (quests for said item – once scorned in Sex and the City – are up 27pc according to the search platform Lyst). My last professional intervention occurred on January 8.  I scorched off a clump in February when a pair of tongs caught fire, otherwise it has remained untouched. The result is peculiarly stripy – golden at the roots, jet black to my ear, pinky-orange in its parched lengths. “A touch Lego heading towards the Ronald MacDonalds,” as Josh so eloquently describes it.Still, this is better than some of the lockdown horrors he has encountered, be it green supermarket dye jobs, blue tints, or tangerine roots, as customers have resorted to DIY.“First came sourdough, then everyone turned hairdresser,” he eye rolls. Some proved rather good at it – Jo Malone’s son turned out to be a dab hand at tinkering with his mother’s roots. Others, alas, were not.Hence the trend for covering up all mishaps with a shot of hot pink.Wood has welcomed the “greater honesty and authenticity” many have revealed about dying (or “blending,” as men prefer to call it).Demi Moore, Lily Allen and Pierce Brosnan have all shown off varying degrees of silver while social distancing. He predicts that more natural, low-maintenance approaches will become fashionable, not least should there be cases of “pulsed” lockdown. If so, I can vouch for the miraculous nature of his colour-enhancing shampoos and conditioners, the effects of which have to be seen to be believed.No one close to him has been afflicted, while - as owner of the only haute home-colouring service - business has been booming with a 2,986pc increase. Home treatments typically make up about three quarters of all dying under lockdown it was officially 100pc, albeit rumours about rule-breaking persist.Wood’s 80-strong team has provided over 3,600 complementary video consultations.  Still, for the first time ever he has found himself in debt to cover rent, VAT and bills, and has suffered sleepless nights.Many have endured worse.Millie Kendall MBE, chief executive of the British Beauty Council, tells me: “There are so many challenges, not just the cost of PPE, but the new scheduling of staff and clients and longer hours, all of which will reduce turnover. I also think some clients might reduce frequency. Some salons won’t be able to reopen without both hair and beauty. Then you have the mobiles who have not had access to grants or furlough. I would expect to see our industry shrink by up to 30pc.”Kendall has been disconcerted by parliament, central government and the cabinet continuing to dismiss the sector as frivolous, despite its adding almost £30 billion a year to GDP, making it bigger than the car industry. “The sexist perception of the beauty industry is much as it was 50 years ago. Compare Wednesday’s Prime Minister’s Questions when male MPs made jokes about the urgency of reopening, despite our supporting over 600,000 jobs.”The good news for this most tactile of industries is that touch remains very much in evidence, despite being sheathed in a plastic glove. There may be no hugs, but there are a lot of happy tears, not least when I am de-striped and stylist Nicholas Hardwick has given me a cracking cut. As for wild talk about a ban on chat, Wood waves a dismissive hand: “Darling, try and stop me! Many of my clients have been coming for 20 years. I can’t wait to hear their gossip. I mean, come on!”One client confides that she’s had “moments of barely clinging on. However, having my hair back under control will mark the beginning of being back in control”. I am reminded of the immortal truth revealed in Fleabag’s final season: “Hair is everything. We wish it wasn\u0027t, so we could actually think about something else occasionally, but it is.”Wood, naturally, understands this more than most.“Not being able to practice a craft you’ve been doing every day of your life has been really odd. Wielding a comb, taking the fabric of the hair in your hand. I feel like myself again.”As do I - a better one.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.From fashion stylist to farm hand: meet the people helping to harvestThe bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them. They are very comfortable to wear.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease. So put simply, if I wear one I protect you, if you wear one you protect me.Patrick Grant is a star of television’s ‘Great British Sewing Bee’The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort. She said: “Double honour — to be a face in Peter Blake’s awesome collage for the Mandarin and to be a tiny part of helping Help the Hungry. It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes. I’m very glad that maybe my left eyebrow has gone to good use.”Italian actress Caterina Murino, who also stars in the work, said: “The world is upside down. We fight for our life, we fight for the life of our brothers, and this is the feeling I have when I contemplate Sir Peter Blake’s masterpiece! A hundred stars that reflect the ersity of our world fighting to help Help the Hungry.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project,’ one helper saysWhat has it been like to volunteer during the pandemic? Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out.

It has been extraordinary.”How to support our campaignBid on Sir Peter Blake’s artwork in Help the Hungry auction, say stars4.3 million meals to be delivered as Help The Hungry appeal passes £7mJoanne Karbritz, 47, works up to five hours a day, four days a week at OneStonegrove community centre. The former Oxfam shop worker, who has high-functioning autism, said that because of her condition, having a “structured day” is incredibly important. “Without routine, I can’t cope,” she said. “I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project.”Ms Karbritz, who is also anorexic, said working with food had been transformative. “Working to create healthy, nutritious food everyday has changed my relationship with it. I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community.

Fourth July: when the country’s pubs and bars reopened for the first time following 15 weeks and one day of coronavirus lockdown when the government told us: get to the boozer – the economy needs you.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhat have Bowling and his pals got planned to fulfil their civic duty? “No plans at all,” he said, sat in The Sheffield Water Works Company. “Other than it getting messy.”Well, we shall see.‘Super Saturday’ sees pubs and hairdressers reopen – liveAt 1pm in a drizzly beer garden in this South Yorkshire city, things remained relatively quiet. It was the barbers and hair salons where the real action was. Of the early drinkers across Sheffield\u0027s bars, most seemed to be easing themselves in gently. They were happily filling-in contact tracing forms, making liberal use of the free hand sanitiser and staying at their socially-distanced tables.His friend, Mick Lather, a retired hospital porter, had a similar view though put it rather more bluntly. “I could die tomorrow, lad,” he said. “And so could you. I’d rather know I’d enjoyed myself than stayed at home afraid of a virus.”He was drinking Strongbow cider. How did it taste? Fine, said the 71-year-old, but that missed the point. “It’s the company that’s important.Whether Super Saturday remains as civilised as the day wears on, only time will tell.NHS England has already warned A\u0026ampE departments to be prepared for a night as busy as New Year’s Eve, while Boris Johnson – after days of leading government mood music which, to all intents and purposes, told the nation to have it large – appeared on Friday to finally grasp that, in the midst of a deadly pandemic, such advice may have its drawbacks. “Don’t overdo it,” he said. “We’re not out the woods yet.” A tweet by the treasury telling people to go for a drink was deleted.It may, it seems, be a warning that goes unheeded.“What we’re hearing is it’s going to be packed out across the city,” said Tom Joseph, owner of The Wick At Both Ends in the city\u0027s main nightlife area of West Street. “I think, inside pubs, we’ll keep it safe, make sure people are sticking to social distancing and everything. But outside, it’s going to be heaving. People have been at home for 15 weeks. That’s a lot of energy to be released.”He knew, he said, of students who were returning to their university cities especially for this evening. “They’ve been stuck inside with parents since March and tonight they’re going to make up for lost time,” he said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.How schools in England are helping pupils return to the classroomThe task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Lansman, a veteran left-winger, who will remain on Labour’s governing body, the National Executive Committee (NEC), declared in an article in May he was stepping back from the position to make way for a new generation to take Momentum into its next era.But electing his successor will be a relatively easy task. Decisions on how the left-wing group operates, represents its members, and interacts with Keir Starmer’s leadership of the Labour Party, will be critical for its survival and relevance in the coming months and years.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Prior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Coronavirus lockdowns are lifting around the world, raising concerns that it could trigger a new wave of infections.Some countries that experienced a significant drop in new Covid-19 cases in April and May are now beginning to experience an uptick in confirmed daily cases.The concerning trend can be seen in several countries throughout the Middle East, most notably in Iran where new cases briefly dropped below 1,000 in early May but have now more than doubled.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIran was one of the first countries to experience a significant outbreak of the deadly virus, with close to 200,000 total cases recorded.Looking at a smoothed seven-day rolling average for new daily cases, Iran\u0027s second wave came almost exactly one month after the first wave.The data suggests that Iran may have already reached the peak of its second wave and is now on the decline.Other countries in the region appear to be experiencing a more gradual second wave, with official figures from Israel revealing that new coronavirus cases have been rising consistently for the past three weeks.Israel\u0027s second wave remains a long way off the peak of the first wave, and the country remains one of the least affected in the Middle East.In Saudi Arabia, new cases are rising at record rates despite briefly appearing to peak in late May.The false peak means the latest surge of new cases could be counted as a continuation of the first wave, rather than a new second wave.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Prime Minister announced yesterday the reopening of most of the hospitality sector from July , but the days of dragging friends onto the dance floor and yelling to be heard of loud music are over for a while. The guidance tells pub owners to take steps to prevent other close contact activities, such as communal dancing. It adds: All venues should ensure that steps are taken to avoid peopleneeding to unduly raise their voices to each other. This includes, but is not limited to, refraining from playing music orbroadcasts that may encourage shouting, includingplayed ata volume that makes normal conversation dficult.Temptations including live entertainment, loud music and sports broadcasts will all be banned in British pubs to keep people on their best behaviour. The Government warned businesses to stop people taking part in group singing or chanting as well because it carries an increased risk of spreading coronavirus. Dance floors will also be repurposed into table areas and patrons will need to be sat downthey want to be indoors.

Once Britain leaves the Brexit transition period and the European Single Market next January, the Government plans to implement a new IT system to manage the additional border checks that will be needed.The new # and untested # system is known as the Goods Vehicle Movement Service, or GVMS.It means UK companies exporting into the EU will have to wait for permission from the taxman before they can move their goods.According to a document circulated by HMRC, lorries will only be able to move loads into the EUthey have a valid reference from GVMS.Hauliers will need to file the correct customs paperwork electronically in advance in order to get approval # and the Government plans to bar trucks without clearance from reaching ports.Chancellor Rishi Sunak has called on Brits to eat out to help out as the coronavirus lockdown restrictions ease today.He says a generation of young people risk being #lost# unless the public starts spending in pubs and restaurants.He told The Times: #This is a consumption-driven economy people used to, three months ago, go out with their friends or family to go and have a meal.#Mr Sunak said that the public had to “relearn what it’s like to go out again” and added, in what may become his new slogan: “Eat out to help out”. Image: WmediaBritish businesses are increasingly worried that the UK governments planned system to check goods heading to the European Union wont be ready in time for when the Brexit transition period ends in .The Government plans to bring in an entirely new IT system to help check goods heading to the EU from January .But leading UK business groups have told Business Insider that the government has failed to confirm to them how the system will work and whether it will be fully al in time.One senior figure who is in close contact with the government about its Brexit plans says Government officials #just dont know# how the new arrangements will work.Royal Dutch Shell is not ruling out moving its headquarters from the Netherlands to Britain, the oil companys chief executive Ben van Beurden said in an interview with a Dutch newspaper.Anglo-Dutch consumer products giant Unilever said last month it plans to ditch its dual Anglo-Dutch legal structure and create a single entity in Britain.Van Beurden did not explicitly say Shell wants to move its headquarters, het Financieele Dagblad said.#You always need to keep thinking,# Shells Van Beurden told the newspaper. #Nothing is permanent and of course we will look at the business climate. #But moving your headquarters is not a trivial measure. You cannot think too lightly about that.#A Shell spokesman confirmed the CEOs comments to Reuters and said the company was looking at ways to simply its dual structure, as it had been doing for many years. The England and Wales Cricket Board has approved an increase in overseas players in domestic cricket from next year and will now allow two per side in four-day and -over cricket.Teams are currently allowed to field only one imported player, though foreign-born players with British passports and those on Kolpak registrations have not counted towards the allocation.The effects of Brexit mean Kolpak deals will be terminated at the end of the postponed  campaign meaning those players # as well as those who have had deals cancelled this summer due to the coronavirus pandemic # will now have a greater chance to earning deals.The move was recommended by the performance cricket committee, chaired by Sir Andrew Strauss.An expert says the dferences on fishing could prove to be too dficult to resolve # because Whitehall doesnt have enough expertise in fisheries laws to extricate the UK from European rules.According to iNews, Andrew Oliver said it is unlikely the industry will be free of European control before  and that it “might never happen”.He said that it may eventually be possible to wrestle back some of the quota and fishing rights taken by European fleets # but that it would probably cost billions of pounds in compensation.He said: “I think it will take up to  years before we are completely orced and have our own stand-alone statute book.#One of the big disagreements between the EU and the UK is over fishing.During the referendum campaign in , Brexiteers argued in favour of Britain ditching the Common Fisheries Policy.The agreement opens up UK fishing grounds to European vessels.The calls to get rid of it has left many British fishermen furious.And the EUs chief negotiator Michel Barnier has told Boris Johnson and David Frost thatthe UK wants access to European markets, the country must open up its fisheries.The UKs top civil servant, Sir Mark Sedwill, revealed plans to step down from his role in September earlier this week.In a letter to Boris Johnson he said that he believed it was the right time to leave as the UK moved into the next phase of the governments coronavirus recovery plan.But there was alleged tensions between Sir Mark and Dominic Cummings, the Prime Ministers most influential aide, and cabinet minister Michael Gove.No sources said Dominic Cummings thought Sir Mark was a barrier to #Whitehall reform,# with the agreement of Mr Johnson and Michael Gove, reports .His departure is part of an overhaul of the civil service spearheaded by Nos top adviser Cummings.Brexit adviser David Frost will step in as national security adviser.News organisation Bloomberg is reporting that the Brexit gang is back in charge in Britain.Writers say Boris Johnson has #little time for conventions#.#Despite being a product of the English establishment # educated at Eton and Oxford # he has surrounded himself with the band of brothers who upended the existing order with their  Brexit campaign and are bent on continuing the revolution in government.#The tight-knit group of trusted aides is determined to reshape the country, bringing investment to depressed areas and overhauling how the government is run. #After three months battling the coronavirus pandemic, which nearly killed Johnson and damaged his reputation for competence, the premier and his team of revolutionaries are now re-asserting their reforming agenda.#Michael Gove says a no-deal Brexit could lead to UK business being #adversely affected#.He made the admission after being questioned by former Shadow Chancellor Michael Portillo on Times Radio.Mr Portillo said: #Its possible that well reach the end of the Brexit transition period and leave without signing a deal with the European Union.#I think that before the general election you were very worried about a no-deal Brexit. #What changed #Mr Gove admitted that he was #worried# that the UK would not be #sufficiently prepared# for an exit without a deal.#Id much rather that we secured a free trade agreement with the EU,# he said.The home shopping tycoon who was among the most prominent business backers of Britains departure from the EU has put his company up for sale.Sky News reports that John Mills has instructed Cavendish Corporate Finance to contact prospective buyers of JML, a multichannel retailer of consumer products.It comes just months before the end of the Brexit transition period.The process is at an early stage and is not expected to result in a deal for several months, according to a source.Earlier this week, the deadline passed for the UK and the EU to extend the Brexit transition period.It means theres no going back # and were leaving the EU, with a deal or without one, at the end of the year.Now Boris Johnson has suggested thatthe UK and EU could not reach an agreement with the bloc, then an “Australia-style” arrangement with the bloc would be a “very good option”. Australia does not have a comprehensive trade deal with the EU. While specic agreements are in place for certain goods, much EU-Australia trade takes place on World Trade Organisation terms. French fishermen could create blockades in the Channel after Brexit is finalised, the Express is reporting.An expert told the newspaper European fishermen are unlikely to be happy when fishing quotas are renegotiated.Barrie Deas, the CEO of the National Federation of Fishermens Organisations, said fishermen have blocked the Channel #for much lesser reasons than the UK becoming an independent coastal state#.#I think it would be naive to expect they will be happy about this or do nothing about it,# he said.#Theres a long history of those kinds of blockades.#Good morning.In England, its Super Saturday # the day pubs and hairdressers can finally reopen after more than three months.Whether youre heading out for a pint or a perm today, here are some of the things youll need to know: A Scottish Conservative councillor has pledged Brexit Britain will take back control of fisheries and give preference to Scottish fishermen, Tony Miklinski said: #As the Conservative Party promised when we take back control of the North Sea as a nation-state independent from the EU then we will obviously be in a position to negotiate so that fishing doesn’t take place in our waters.#We will give preference to UK fishermen, Scottish in particular.#I have no doubt that a deal could be struck to have access to their markets, to the European markets for our fish products that are so popular in the UK.#Issues of this nature are best settled through negotiation that is good for both parties.#Self-interest never lies andit is in the European interest to sell us their cars and receive our fish products then there is a deal to be struck and it is a matter of getting that done.#The UK has signed a £million global satellite deal with India.The deal will boost the UKs influence and manufacturing industry outside the EU.Business secretary Alok Sharma said: #This deal underlines the scale of Britains ambitions on the global stage.#Our access to a global fleet of satellites has the potential to connect millions of people worldwide to broadband, many for the first time, and the deal presents the opportunity to further develop our strong advanced manufacturing base right here in the UK.#The Prime Minister has been urged not to compromise on Brexit.A poll from The Express found nine out of ten Brits believe UK negotiators should stand their ground with Brussels.A total of  per cent of those surveyed said the Prime Minister should not seek a compromise with the EU.A plan to launch cheap ultra-fast internet across the UK has had a £million boost.Ministers hope the scheme will compensate for the loss of access to the EUs Galileo programme in the wake of Brexit.The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the UK and mobile operator Bharti are each investing million , with Britain acquiring a #signicant equity stake# in the company.Officials said the deal would put the UK at the #cutting-edge of the latest advances in space technology#.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Until his recent election the Tories had it easy, confronted by an opposition led by Marxist radical Jeremy Corbyn, whose incompetence was matched by his extremism. But Sir Keir is a far more formidable opponent. He is sharp where Corbyn was dim, pragmatic where Corbyn was dogmatic.Corbyn constantly pandered to the left-wing fringe because he was part of it. But Sir Keir has just proven his toughness by sacking leadership contender Rebecca Long Bailey from the shadow cabinet, after she expressed her support for actor Maxine Peake who used a newspaper interview to peddle conspiracy theories about the Israeli secret service. Corbynista zealots were appalled, moderates celebrated.Furthermore, the dismissal of Long Bailey was just part of a systematic removal of hard Left influence in the party.Much to the fury of left-wing agitators, Starmer yesterday dismissed calls for the police to be “defunded” in the wake of anti-racism protests. Emphasising his past work with the police as Director of Public Prosecutions, he labelled such demands as “nonsense”. Out are Corbyn allies like Jennie Formby, the former General Secretary. And in comes the new chief David Evans, described by admirers as “a stanch opponent” of the hardliners.According to the latest polls, the British public is warming to the new Labour leader. In one survey last week,  per cent expressed a preference for him as Prime Minister, two points ahead of Boris Johnson.Interviewed by the BBC on Sunday, former leader Ed Miliband joined in the cheer-leading, saying: “I never had his approval ratings. I think he has made a great start.”Yet it would be wrong for Labour supporters to be carried away. Sir Keir might be a better leader than Corbyn and Miliband, but those two set the bar very low. The truth is that Labour still has a mountain to climbStarmer is to become Prime Minister. His party is still a deluded rabble, dominated by the worst kind of toxic identity politics, contempt for Britain and student union dogma. Labour is ready for neither victory at the ballot box, nor for the governance of our country.Parallels are sometimes drawn with the situation now and that of , when John Major’s Government was engulfed by the financial crisis of Black Wednesday five months after winning the General Election against Neil Kinnock’s Labour. But the huge dference is that Labour was on the advance, having won a further  seats at the election. Power was almost within the party’s grasp, given that Major only had a tiny majority. But today, Labour is still reeling from the humiliation it suffered last December, when it lost  seats, the biggest loss for any opposition in a century. Moreover, the party is in the wilderness in Scotland. Once Labour’s Caledonian fortress, the party has just one MP there.In total, the Conservatives have no fewer than  more MPs than Labour.That means the job that now faces Starmer is daunting. To be the biggest party, Labour would have to make  net gains from the Tories on a swing of  per cent. Even in the phenomenal landslide of , the swing to Tony Blair was only . per cent.And there is not the slightest sign of that happening at the moment, in spite of all the Government’s recent problems. It is a remarkable fact that the latest two opinion polls both show that the Conservatives, after ten years in office with a very mixed record, are still seven points ahead of Labour.Indeed, there is even a danger that Labour could slip back further. A recent internal review by the party into the disastrous  defeat warned that a further  seats in Labour’s heartlands could be vulnerable on a very small swing to the Tories.The central problem for Starmer is that his party, fixated by fashionable theories of social justice, has alienated its traditional voters. It will take more than the sacking of Rebecca Long Bailey or reassuring words about the police to bring them back. As the sensible former MP Natascha Engel wrote this month, Labour must recognise how far it “has shted from it core. If it wants to sht back again, the party will have to find the right road and prepare itself for a very long walk.” But the journey has barely begun. A party that is willing twice to elect Jeremy Corbyn as its leader is not going to change overnight.In reality, Labour remains gripped by far Left ideology, as shown by its eager embrace of the cultural revolution. Decent, patriotic working-class voters, once the bedrock of the Labour movement, are bound to be repelled by the endless posturing against Britain or the police or family le or even common sense. Despite the change of leadership, the insanity remains. At the weekend, Labour front-bencher Lloyd Russell-Moyle was forced to apologise after disgracefully attacking JK Rowling for using her own experience of domestic sexual assault as “a justication for discriminating” against transgender campaigners.In the same vein, senior Labour MP Dawn Butler recently declared on Good Morning Britain that “a child is born without sex”, a piece of biological nonsense that is about as sane as saying the Earth is flat. The atmosphere of a cult still hangs over the party. The lunatic Left has certainly not gone away, as reflected in MP Richard Burgon’s celebration that teaching unions thwarted “Tory attempts to force schools to re-open. When the row about statues was at its most hysterical, Lisa Nandycalled for imperialist murals to be removed from the magnicent interior of the Foreign Office. Similarly, the Nottingham MP Nadia Whitthome, sounding asshe lived in an occupied country, expressed her thrill at the movement to topple monuments of the past: “I celebrate these acts of resistance.”Sir Keir is not the figure likely to win back the traditional working-class, particularly not in the Red Wall seats of the Midlands and the North. This is, after all, a figure who used to edit a radical magazine called Socialist Futures, who built his reputation as a metropolitan-based human rights lawyer, who presided over the Crown Prosecution Service when it gained notoriety for its failure to take a tough stance on crime, and who battled ferociously for a second referendum on Brexit. For all the ordinariness of his upbringing as the son of a toolmaker and a nurse, he is now the personication of the North London liberal elite. Moreover, he lacks both authority and charisma. With his strangulated vowels and permanently anxious expression, he frequently sounds like a teacher who is surprised at this promotion to be head of department.The political landscape could have changed dramatically by , when the next election is due. Britain may have enjoyed a strong economic recovery. The culture war may have petered out. Public services may have been reformed. Mrs Thatcher was in desperate trouble in , battered by riots and rising unemployment. Two years later she won a landslide. It is perfectly possible that Boris Johnson could enjoy the same fate – especiallyLabour fails to change.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Using your skill and ingenuity, you have to predict which town or city will be the next to be put on special measures .⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesTowns and cities where people haven’t been behaving themselves.Right now, it’s Leicester in the sin bin. They are a very community-minded bunch and couldn’t resist going out to meet each other. So there’s a Covid spike.Experts reckon the next place to cop it will be Doncaster. They’re a friendly bunch there, too. But I reckon there’s a decent outside chance it will be Bournemouth or Brighton. Or maybe Cardf is worth a flutter.The people of Leicester are confused, as well they might be. They don’t know what they’re allowed to do any more. I don’t blame them.But it will be as nothing to the confusion across the country which comes as a result of Super Saturday.July  is the day the Government has said we can shake off our chains and go out and get wrecked. Or something.Have you got any plans for the weekend  Going to a rave  Or just down the pub to breathe over as many people as you possibly can. Here’s my big worry. That Super Saturday will be followed, five days later, by Terrible Thursday.Five days is the average time it takes for the Covid virus to make itself known to the person it has taken up home in. That slightly ticklish cough. Bit of a temperature. Uh-oh.Restaurants, pubs, campsites and children’s playgrounds will all be open for business from Saturday. Oh, and hairdressers. Remember them Obviously, it is right that the UK must emerge from what the Prime Minister called its long hibernation. But I think these things need to be done gradually, rather than all at once.Frankly, I would have started with our schools. Teachers have proved themselves to be just about the only people in the country who can’t work from home. Most kids have enjoyed painfully few virtual lessons, and reopening schools first would have shown where our priorities lie.But it’s not a good idea, in my book, to release the bats all in one go. Many people will have taken from Boris’s announcement last week that, after July , lockdown is effectively over.And some of the Government’s guidelines make it easy to be confused.  The two-metre social-distancing rule has been relaxed to something called “one metre-plus”. I haven’t a clue what dference that makes.And the whole thing is very dficult to monitor. The police say they don’t know how they will deal with it.The virus has been dying out because, by and large, we have been abiding by lockdown. The summer sun has helped, too. The best thing we can do to keep that curve plummeting is to do much as we have been doing so far.The last thing we need this summer is a sudden second spike.If you use that phrase you’re supposedly signalling you’re vulnerable. And need attention. But what about the ones who really did have pasta and liked it  And aren’t at all messed up but just want to share their evening meal experiences in a very real sense  They are strange creatures, the young.THE country is on course for a wonderful, “V-shaped economic recovery”, according to a bloke at the Bank of England.I don’t know what that means. A month or so back, the Bank of England was saying the economy was in ruins for ever, mass unemployment, bankruptcies – giant mutant crabs marching across the country eating our children. Or something.Never believe an economist. You’d be better off talking to Mystic Meg.THE latest historical figure to be attacked by people with no sense of history is Charles Dickens.A former Green Party councillor, Ian Driver, sprayed graffiti on a museum to the author, with the inevitable word “racist”.I supposewe were to ban Dickens, it would bring cheer to millions of schoolkids.Great Expectations can be a bit of a grind to get through when you are young.But this tearing down of history has to stop.Was Dickens racist  Yup. He lived in Victorian Britain. Almost everybody had views which wouldn’t go down very well today.But he was also a brilliant writer and a philanthropist.We are all better than our worst acts.The Chinese authorities are reportedly sterilising these people now – taking a leaf out of Hitler’s book. Yet this outrage raises barely a flicker of publicity. Even other Muslim countries don’t complain too much. That’s because they don’t want to upset the third worst country in the world . And what does the United Nations say  Nothing. Just like it says nothing about China’s occupation of Tibet, or its bullying of democracy campaigners in Hong Kong.A GOOD plan from the Prime Minister. Boris wants to turn the deserted shops in our high streets into homes for people.If he did that, he’d cure half of our housing problem very quickly. Without paving over the entire country for new estates.Many of our high streets are decaying. People now go to out-of-town shopping centres for an afternoon of misery with the missus.But here’s another idea for BoJo. Offices.Lockdown proved we don’t need offices like we used to. They were invented because we needed places to shuffle paper around. But we don’t use paper any more. And during lockdown people worked perfectly well from home.Imagine how many homes we could create by changing offices into flats.And how much rent businesses would save.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That now looks like a very unfortunate explanation. He has straightforwardly shot himself in the foot.It was Maxwell who introduced Andrew to Epstein.

And it was Maxwell whose house was the venue for the infamous photo of Andrew with his arm round the bare midrf of young Virginia Roberts who says she was a sex slave for Epstein and a bit of flesh to service his important friends.Andrew told the BBC he went all the way to New York to break off his friendship with Epstein, by then a convicted paedophile. And then stayed for four days at his swanky Manhattan house where he was given a dinner in his honour.Oh, and shortly afterwards Epstein handed over £, as his contribution to the Help The Fergie Fund. It’s a very odd way to end a friendship.Epstein may have died in prison – no doubt very conveniently for lots of famous and powerful people – but it has not stopped the calls for prosecutions of those connected with Epstein, and the calls for justice from Epstein’s victims.The FBI have made it plain they want to talk to Andrew. But he seems determined to keep as far as possible away from them.Geoffrey Berman, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, told reporters earlier this year that Andrew had so far given zero co-operation.Lisa Bloom, representing the women who say they were abused by Epstein, called Andrew’s refusal to answer questions ‘a slap in the face’ for the women.Yet the pariah prince was at it again yesterday, insisting he has in fact offered to co-operate.Well there is a very simple way of finding out who is telling the truth. Let him publish the letters and emails he has sent to the US law enforcement agencies and we can judge for ourselves.Overall, Andrew has done more to undermine the British royal family than any other living person. He is the gt that just keeps on giving for those who want to replace the monarchy with a republic.When local councils earlier this year were told to fly the flag for his birthday there was uproar. The Sun captured it perfectly in its front page headline: Union Joke.Meanwhile a Yougov poll revealed that only  in  have a favourable opinion of him. The only surprise is that it was that high.Horrendous as all the Epstein and Maxwell stuff is, that is just one item in the charge sheet against Andrew.There is the calamitous way he damaged Britain’s image abroad over many years as our trade envoy as he went round the globe insulting those he came into contact with and belting out his saloon bar views, views very often the exact opposite of agreed government policy.Diplomats called him His Buffoon Highness for his mixture of arrogance, rudeness, ignorance and stupidity.There is his outrageous use of helicopters, often to get to golf courses, and private jets when commercial flights would do - all charged to the taxpayer.There is all the dodgy company in dodgy countries he has kept – nasty dictators, outright crooks, alleged torturers, even a convicted gunrunner - some of whom he has accepted gts from, and some he even weaselled into Buckingham Palace, so tainting the Queen with his dubious associates.There is the wealth he has amassed from questionable sources, whether through shady offshore companies, using a  name, Andrew Inverness, or direct from his dodgy friends.What a stroke of luck that he was able to offload his old house, Sunninghill Park, which had been on the market for years at £ million, to Timur Kulibayev, the billionaire son-in-law of the Kazakh dictator, for £ million.Mr Kulibayev never moved in, the house sat empty for a further nine years before being demolished. Why would he pay well over the asking price for a house he never intended to live in And how astonishing on a grant from his mum of £, each year and a tiny naval pension of £,, he has been able to spend £.m refurbishing the property in Windsor Great Park AND get hold of a £m ski chalet in Switzerland.Then there is the appalling boorish behaviour to his protection staff. On at least one occasion he threw stuff on the ground and told them to “f---ing pick that up.”Or there is the casual racism, using phrases like “n----- in the woodpile” which he denies though plenty heard it, or making a jaw-dropping and hugely tasteless joke about camels at a state banquet for the Saudi royals. How to win friends and influence people!Even Donald Trump, who has played golf with Andrew, met him many times, and once lent him a plane, now say:s “I don’t know Prince Andrew.”We’ve all had enough of the obnoxious prince. He is a national embarrassment. When Princess Diana orced from Charles, she was immediately stripped of her HRH status yet the Prince of Sleaze keeps his. He should have his taken away without any further delay. Let him be Andrew Inverness, since he likes that name.The victims of Epstein will be scarred for le. If he has a scrap of decency left inside him, he will travel to the United States and tell the FBI all he knows.This is one trip for Air Miles Andy that the taxpayer would be prepared to pay for - especiallyit is a one-way ticket.       Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And Scotland has a long-standing reputation of being an open and welcoming country.The UK is publishing the list of countries that English people can travel to later today.They had to restrict it just to England after Ms Sturgeon insisted that Scotland would have its own rules.She added it is very likely the Scottish Government will be able to agree the low-risk countries on the air bridge list over the next few days.Government sources had suggested there could be some overlap of the nations.Countries will be graded greenthey are safer than the UK, amberless safe, or red which means all passengers ing will have to isolate.The US will be on the red list, meaning self-quarantine measures will be required when ing to the UK.This morning the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps explained the list of countries was finally ready and the nation could finally plan to get away.He told Sky News: There will be a list of -plus countries. If you add in the overseas territories-something-or-other that will be announced later today.The Sun earlier revealed the new rules will not apply to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland who have decided to assess countries’ safety using dferent measures.Evencitizens fly out from England, their devolved administrations will require they quarantine on .This morning Mr Shapps revealed he still hoped the devolved nations would come around to the plans.He said: At the beginning of the week I said this would be announced by the end of the week, I was hoping to be able to do it earlier, but unfortunately we have not been able to get the devolved administrations to sign up to it yet. People have been waiting for this list all week, and thats why we delayed putting the list out there, to seethe devolved nations wanted to announce at the same time.Its not coming in until th of July, the end of the quarantine, so there is still time for other parts of the four nations to join.  To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Unseasonably strong winds are expected to affect large swathes of the UK on Saturday night and during Sunday, potentially bringing some localised travel and power disruption, the Met Office warned.The unsettled weather is due to a low pressure system entering the UK from the west.Met Office spokesperson Nicola Maxey said: Saturday will see more unsettled conditions, with showers beginning in the west during the morning which will begin to move across to the east.While it wont be unusually wet for the time of year, some areas in the east could become particularly heavy for an hour or two in the mid-morning to early afternoon.Pushing in after that will be a spell of drizzly downpours and some low cloud which will hang over the UK for the rest of the day.It will remain humid across the country, with maximum temperatures of C in London and the South East, while central and northern parts of England will reach highs of C.Ms Maxey said this is due to a low-pressure weather system near the UK.Although the rain will lessen during Saturday evening, low cloud and drizzly conditions will continue through to Sunday.Weather fronts will bring further cloud and rain at first but clearing to sunshine and showers, the Met Office said.The poor weather comes as pubs, bars and restaurants begin to reopen in England on July , having been closed since March to slow the spread of Covid-.But Saturdays wet weather means pubs and indoor venues could struggle to implement social distancing measures as people may ditch beer gardens and outdoor spaces to move inside out of the rain.A spokesman from JD Wetherspoon, which plans to reopen all  of its venues on Saturday, said: The weather is out of our control, but our pubs tend to be three times larger than others so we are not worried about people being inside our venues.We cant predict what the weather will be like in England, but we have faith that our customers and staff will be as safe as possible.A spokesperson for Stonegate Pubs, which owns The Slug and Lettuce chain, said: Throughout our pubs and bars, we are implementing clear, safe socialising measures both inside and across our outside spaces.We are encouraging customers to pre-book and all bookings work on a time-limit which enables us to manage capacity and customer expectation.Should the weather be inclement, we will work with our customers on a common-sense approach, accommodating where we can those that have had to move from outside areas.Most customers are likely to check the weather and be prepared for the expected short spells of rain or drizzle.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We’re stumped.The ball poses little risk but there are concerns about teams congregating in changing rooms and clubhouses.The England and Wales Cricket Board welcomed the news, tweeting: “We are delighted that the UK Government have given their permission for recreational cricket tofrom next weekend.“We will shortly be publishing our approved guidelines to help clubs and players prepare for crickets .”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This results in excessive strain on the neck, a rounder shoulder and often counter strain in dferent parts of the body such as increased lower back pain and shortened hamstrings.Staring at screens all day can cause computer vision syndrome, otherwise known as digital eye strain.This results in dry, inflamed and bloodshot eyes, as well as eye irritation, redness and blurred vision.Over time, it can negatively impact our eyesight.A lack of physical exercise and too much time spent with poor posture in front of a screen can result in a hyper-extended neck, rounded shoulders and a hunchback that develops over time.Bashing away on a keyboard over long periods of time can lead to repetitive typing strain in your hands and wrists that can signicantly worsen and result in poor posture in other parts of the body.Vitamin D is mostly absorbed from sun exposure, so working indoors all day can leave the body deficient which can cause hair loss and new hair growth can be signicantly stunted.Staring at multiple screens while working all day can cause dark circles to form in the skin under your eyes, leaving you looking tired and haggard after prolonged periods.Squinting at a screen all day can increase the onset of premature lines forming beneath the surface of the skin, leading to wrinkles.Working inside and lack of sunlight can result in pale, dull and malnourished looking skin.Working from home often means less human contact than in the office that can lead to increased levels of the stress hormone cortisol, which raises blood pressure and has harmful effects on physical health.Overworking leads to chronic stress producing high levels of adrenaline and cortisol, associated with chronic health conditions and cardiovascular disease.

Pubs, hairdressers, hotels, campsites, restaurants, cinemas, museums and galleries can all open on July  in England. There are also changes to gatherings and the two-metre rule, allowing you to becloser to those you love. Then on July , thereaposll be big changes to quarantine for people wanting to go on holiday - plus, aposshieldingapos people can hug and kiss relatives for the first time. But nightclubs, gyms, swimming pools, nail and tanning salons, tattoo studios and bowling alleys stay shut. All the venues allowed to open will look dferent to before - with screens, social distancing and booking systems. But so-called aposSuper Saturdayapos - held appropriately on US aposIndependence Dayapos - will still see far more venues open at once than many people thought would ever happen. And Downing Street has refused to say whether itaposs expecting the changes to push the crucial aposRapos rate of infection above one. That has triggered fears that debauched scenes in pubs and bars could trigger new outbreaks of the virus.  The government has already had to enforce a local lockdown in Leicester, where the below measures wonapost happen - and schools and non-essential shops have shut. Boris Johnson has urged people to stick to the rules and not turn into a roiling, bacchanalian mass. So what can you do from July , evenyou donapost want to  And what is still off the table  Hereaposs a complete guide for England. Please note Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all have separate rules. Things you can do already  Non-essential shops, schoolsand other premises like car showrooms and outdoor markets have already reopened in England. People are now allowed to gather in groups of up to six outdoors in a park or garden, with social distancing. The .million most vulnerable people, who are aposshieldingapos, have been allowed to go outside alone or with one other personfor walks. And people can form a support bubble, joining two households together permanently to hug, kiss, stay the night and share childcare. However, indoor gatherings of two or more people not in the same household or bubble are still banned. And people are still banned from staying overnight away from where they live. From July , much of those laws are being abolished in England and replaced with guidance. Things you can do from July  Venues that CAN reopen in England from July  All these venues can reopen in England providing they can show they are aposCovid-secureapos:Hotels and BBs Holiday apartments or homes Cottages or bungalows Campsites Caravan parks Boarding houses Places of worship Libraries Community centres Restaurants, cafes and workplace canteens Bars Pubs Cinemas Bingo halls Theatres and concert halls - but on the basis it’s not a live performance. They can only screen past performances for example Museums and galleries Hair salons and barbers Outdoor playgrounds Outdoor gyms Funfairs Theme parks Adventure parks and activities Amusement arcades Other indoor leisure centres and facilities - including indoor gaming, social clubs, model villages, and indoor attractions at aquariums and zoos.You can visit friends and family indoors - but you canapost hug  People in England can have people round their house, including to stay overnight from July  - but they can’t hug. For the first time since March, indoor gatherings will be allowed between two households who havenapost joined together in a “bubble”. This applies to all indoor gatherings, be they in private homes or in places like pubs . When you are indoors, your household will be able to meet with one other household at a time. There is no limit on the size of either of the households which can meet. And unlike with bubbles, ’exclusivity’ is not required. So you can have one friend round for a meal one weekend and another friend round another weekend. But dferent households should continue to remain socially distant from one another when they meet. That means following the m or ‘m plus’guidance, and also following other advice such as regular hand washing. You can meet more people outdoors  There is a slight change to the rules for people meeting outdoors from July . Currently up to six people from up to six households can meet in a park or garden,they maintain social distancing. This limit will continue, but it will change from a legal restriction to guidance, plus there will also now be another option. Two households of any size - for example, two families of four - can now also meet outdoors, as long as they maintain social distancing. So you can either meet five friends from dferent households, or an unlimited number from one household. The two-metre rule is changing  The -metre social distancing rule in England is changing from July . Where it’s not possible to stay  metres apart, people are instead advised to keep to a distance of “one metre plus”. This means staying one metre apart - plus mitigations which reduce the risk of transmission. On public transport, it means people stay one metre away but with a face covering. In other spaces it will likely mean having screens between tables, making sure people face away from each other, putting in hand washing facilities, minimising amount of time spent with people from dferent households., and being outdoors where possible. Government officials say mitigations at one metre have a “broadly equivalent impact” as staying two metres apart. But the risk of catching the virus from someone is still much higheryouaposre one metre away from them, compared to two metres away. If you can stay m apart, you should.  Pubs, bars, restaurants, cafes and workplace canteens can all reopen in England from July  - both indoor and outdoors. But thereaposs a catch -youaposre indoors, you can only meet with people from one other household. And you should still maintain social distancing rules. That means staying either two metres apart, or one metre apart with mitigationyou canapost manage two metres. Loud music, dance floors, propping up the bar or standing in groups are all banned, and pubs will be encouraged to have table service where possible. All venues are expected to keep a record of people who visit, to enable contact tracing. But landlords aren’t expected to police which household customers belong to, or check ID of everyone coming in. Hairdressers and barbers are allowed to reopen in England from July  with protective measures - including face visors for those cutting hair. Millions of Brits can finally get a haircut after more than three months of having their locks chopped at home. But they will be appointment-only, use disposable gowns and in many cases use a one-in, one-out system. Nail salons, which involve people sitting face to face, will remain shut for the foreseeable. And eyelash extensions are largely ruled out because of the amount of face-to-face contact. You can go on staycation - but not to hostels  Hotels, BBs, holiday apartments or homes, cottages or bungalows, campsites, caravan parks and boarding houses can all reopen to paying guests in England from July . Again, they must follow Covid-secure guidelines - but people will be able to stay overnight away from their home. Despite concerns over shared facilities, campsites will be able to reopen in England from July . This includes showers and washing-up blocks. But hostels with shared bedrooms cannot yet. This is dferent to Wales which is keeping both campsites and hostels shut. You can get married - but not have a proper reception  Church services - including weddings - are allowed from July theyaposre done in a socially-distanced way. But only up to  people can attend including the couple, officiants, guests, photographers, security and caterers. And limits still apply on indoor gatherings, meaning there wonapost really be a chance to have a reception. Ceremonies should be concluded in the shortest reasonable time and hands should be washed before and after and the rings are exchanged. Brides can be walked down the aisle - but not arm-in-arm, unless the escort lives in the same household. Books, service sheets and prayer mats should be removed - with single-use alternatives provided as long as they are removed by the person attending the wedding.  You can go to church - but not sing Places of worship reopen in England from July , as above. But not full singing services, due to the risk of spreading the virus. You can visit cinemas, galleries and museums  Saturday  July is the date cinemas, galleries and museums can reopen in England. Guidance includes one-way systems, spaced queuing, increased ventilation, and pre-booked tickets. A No source said: We are only able to move forward this week because the vast majority of people have taken steps to control the virus. But the more we open up, the more important it is that everyone follows the social distancing guidelines. We will not hesitate to reverse these stepsit is necessary to stop the virus running out of control. Things you can do from July  Shielded people can meet groups of friends outside  Shielding will be eased for .million vulnerable people in Englandfrom Monday July . They can go out and meet up to five friends - andthey live alone, form a aposbubbleapos with another household. From August , the advice to shield ends completely. But Statutory Sick Pay and direct food parcels for the shielding will also end on August , prompting alarm. Thereaposs also anger at the failure to have a legal safeguard against people being forced back to work. What about travel  Can I go on holiday  From Saturday, the Foreign Officeaposs warning against all but essential international travel will be lted for some countries.And from  July, people ing to England from certain countries will not need to self-isolate. The countries that England has exempted from the quarantine rule are here At the time of publishing th UK government has not published the list of colour coded countries setting out the risk of travelling to certain countries.  Things you still canapost do from July  Venues that CANaposT reopen in England from July  These venues are still banned from reopening and have no confirmed date:Nightclubs Bowling alleys and skating rinks Indoor play areas including soft play Spas Nail bars Beauty salons Swimming pools Tattoo and piercing studios Massage parlours Water parks Indoor fitness and dance studios Gyms Conference centres, other than for people who already work there.You canapost go to the gym  Government sources said gyms remain shut because there is a “far greater risk of infection” due to people breathing harder and touching surfaces. That outraged the gym industry, which demanded a date. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden later insisted: Subject to public health, our aspiration is to reopen gyms  leisure facilities in mid-July. You canapost send your child to school  Only years R,  and  are allowed back to primary schools in England at the moment. The government wants all children back in September - but was forced to drop plans to do it earlier.  You canapost see a live theatre show Theatres and concert halls can reopen in England from July  - but onlyit’s not a live performance. Instead theatres and concert halls can screen past performances. Government sources said theatres have an issue with ensuring the actors themselves can move around the stage in a safe way.

Pubs will be told to keep lists of everyone who comes in for  days in case there is an outbreak - with more outdoor seats and tape to mark distance on the floor. Many toilets will need to be one-in, one-out and bar staff hidden behind screens to prevent the spread of the virus. Bar managers will be told to work with their rivals on the same street to make sure they stagger their opening times. And punters are being warned they canapost shelter insidea rainstorm - otherwise they could cause an outbreak. If youaposre in the beer garden, you can sit in a group of up to six - socially distanced - or in a group of two households of any size. Butyouaposre indoors, you can only sit with one other household - and even then you should be socially distanced. Here are  key ways pubs will look dferent, including the new rules they must follow.  Loud music or loud broadcasts like football will be banned to stop people shouting at each other. Guidance says all venues should ensure that steps are taken to avoid people needing to unduly raise their voices to each other. This includes, but is not limited to, refraining from playing music or broadcasts that may encourage shouting, includingplayed at a volume that makes normal conversation dficult. This is because of the potential for increased risk of transmission, particularly from aerosol transmission. It also says loud background music, communal dancing, group singing or chanting should be prevented. Pubs are allowed to screen football matches, but only quietly and there canapost be any chanting.. Live music and dance floors are banned  Guidance says venues should not permit live performances, including drama, comedy and music, to take place in front of a live audience. This is to stop aerosol transmission - from either the performer or their audience. Theatres are likewise allowed to open but onlythey donapost put on a live show. Dance floors in pubs and bars are also banned. You should take steps to prevent close contact activities, such as communal dancing, the guidance says.  Pubs and restaurants should provide cutlery and condiments only when food is served. And the days of the communal ketchup or mayonnaise bottle are numbered - as pubs and restaurants should provide only disposable condiments. Communal bottles are allowed but onlythey are cleaned after every single use. . Youaposll likely need to book - and you have to give all your names to staff  Venues are being advised to control numbers through a book-in-advance system. But itaposs also because all pubs, bars, restaurants and more are being told to assist with the NHS Test and Trace programme. That means keeping a temporary record of your customers and visitors for  days. The guidance doesnapost say how this should be done but lists visitor books or bookings records. Pubs will need to assist NHS Test and Trace with requests for that dataneeded in order to contain clusters or outbreaks. . You must obey the rules on gatherings  Gatherings are still limited in the following ways: Inside the pub: No more than two households can meet at any one time. Even then they must sit two metres apart, or one metre with social distancing. Outside in the beer garden: Groups of up to six can meet, or a group of two households of unlimited size can meet, in a socially distanced rule. That means no big parties, no long tables and no hugging and back-slapping and kissing, evenyouaposre tipsy. Bar managers are being asked to remind people of the limit on gatherings when they book. . Bar staff will stand behind screens  Guidance recommends using screens or barriers to separate workers from each other, and from customers at points of service. That could mean bar staff serving from behind a perspex screen to avoid transmission. Staff are also asked to use back-to-back or side-to-side working possible. And staff rotas will need to be redrawn so each person only has contact with a fixed number of others on their team. Tables will be spaced further apart and floor tape or paint will be used to mark areas to help people comply with social distancing. They should be two metres apart - or one metrethere is risk mitigation in place like screens, back-to-back seating or face coverings. . Some toilets will be one-in, one-out  The guidance recommends one way flow systems to stop people bunching up - such as using one door as an entry and one as an exit. Pubs should also arrange one-way travel routes between transport hubs and venues, it says. But thataposs a problem when it comes to pub toilets, many of which are cramped with narrow entrances. On toilets, the guidance urges pubs to use a limited entry approach, with one in, one out. . Youaposll get more outdoor seats, table service - and use apps to order your drinks  Pubs are being encouraged to put in more outdoor seats - with changes coming down the track to let them use car parks as beer gardens. Outdoor table service should also be encouraged, the guidance says - and table service should be followed as a rule to stop people queues. Where bar or counter service is unavoidable, people should be stopped from staying at the bar or counter after ordering, or leaning on it. Pubs are also told to encourage use of contactless ordering from tables where available - for example, through an ordering app. . Youaposll be banned from propping up the bar - or sheltering from the rain  Pubs are warned they have to plan for keeping the -metre or aposone metre plusapos rules eventhere is a thunderstorm. They need to be clear that customers cannot seek shelter indoors unless social distancing can be maintained. . Indoor spaces will have to be massively below capacity  Sitting indoors will be allowed - but numbers are strictly limited. New coronavirus laws from July  in England will make it illegal for groups of more than  people to form. Pubs, restaurants, cinemas and other venues will be exempt from the aposgroup of apos law, which exists mainly to prevent things like raves. But even so, the guidance warns pubs may have to lower capacity even further than it would bethey had all tables two metres apart. The guidance explains: Evenit is possible to safely seat a number of people inside a venue, it may not be safe for them all to travel or enter that venue. . Youaposll see this sign in the window  Pubs should work with their customers to tell them about the restrictions on gatherings. That means not gathering indoors with more than one other household. And it means not gathering outdoors with more than either one other household, or six people in total from any number of households. In , firms should also display a notication in a prominent place to show a risk assessment has been carried out and theyaposre following the rules. A picture of the notice is above. . Nearby pubs must work together to open at dferent times Inidual businesses should consider the cumulative impact of many venues re-opening in a small area. This means working with local authorities, neighbouring businesses and travel operators to assess this risk and applying additional mitigations. This might have to include staggering entry times with other venues and taking steps to avoid queues building up in surrounding areas.

He said: “People from Wales, we are very dubious about that. We have had to take full addresses.

The pub boss, who himself lives over the border in Wales, added: “It’s a testing time for pubs at the moment. I couldn’t sleep last night – I was awake at quarter to four. “It’s a surreal feeling. We’re reopening but it’s not the same – like a new version of the pub.  “It’s been a worrying time for all business owners, especially in the hospitality industry.

Frank, who carved out a successful career in the textile trade before taking over the pub from mum Mabel, who died in , said: Iaposm putting myself on the lineI do and itaposs just too much of a risk at my age. A stranger coming in could easily infect me so itaposs not worth it at this stage.  Iaposve put a notice on the door. I have had three months off so a few more wonapost go amiss.

The smiling punter, in a Wetherspoons pub in Central London, grinned at the camera before the necking the drink. One Twitter user voiced her approval, writing: I love the fact he casually downed a jägerbomb live on the BBC at am in the morning. It comes as boozers brace for their busiest night of the year, with businesses allowed to open their doors for the first time since March. But with the R rate now feared to be above  in London - meaning the number of new Covid- cases could be rising - experts have called on boozers to be careful. Professor Chris Whitty yesterday warned that reopening pubs and other businesses on aposSuper Saturdayapos is aposabsolutely not risk freeapos as lockdown is eased in England. Drinkers voiced their excitement after being served their first pints. One Manchester pubgoer named Jimmy said his first Carling was like an angel p***ing on the tip of me tongue, while north London punter Andrew Slawinski said first pub pint was like winning the [Premier] League. Builder Ben Clark, from Newcastle, and two friends queued outside the Briar Rose in Birmingham city centre before it reopened at am. They were covered in dust after a night sht at a building site as they stood on social distancing markers. Mr Clark, , told BirminghamLive: Weaposve just finished night shts. Iaposve been watching the pubs since am this morning, when we came and reserved our tables ready for the pub opening ready for a pint of San Miguel and a breakfast.  Pubs were given the green light to reopen from am, but many boozers waited until am to throw open their doors. Most didnapost see an immediate rush of customers and some chains decided to remain closed. The reopening has been welcomed by customers, but it comes with a stark warning of the danger pubs present in superspreading Covid- and criticism of Boris Johnsonaposs easing of the lockdown.  Amid fears the reopening could fuel trouble, West Midlands Labour police and crime commissioner David Jamieson said it was very bad timing by the government to pick a Saturday night and admitted he was praying for rain. He had suggested that it would be more appropriate to open pubs on a Monday. Police forces across England were planning to deploy additional patrols.

The former steel town of Merthyr Tydfil in the Welsh valleys has a weekly infection rate of  compared to  in the Covid hotspot of Leicester. Public Health Wales say the high rate in the Welsh town is due to a cluster of  cases among workers at a meat-processing plant. They say the cluster is under constant review - and it is a dferent situation from the spread among people in the Midlands city. This does not mean that there has been a signicant increase in the level of infection in the community, said a PHW spokesperson. The former industrial town of Merthyr has a population of just , compared to over , in Leicester. It has large pockets of poverty and is often at the bottom of employment and economy ratings in Wales. Health officials says the rise to the weekly infection rate of  is due to testing after confirmed cases at the Kepak meat factory in the town - and not that it is spreading outside.

We wanted that date, we just wanted to get married – evenwe could only have five people we said we would go ahead. If we pushed it back a month or a year we could be in the same situation. It was a roller coaster of emotions. Originally the couple were going to have  guests in the church and  for the evening reception. “A lot of people who are coming are involved in the ceremony as in ­bridesmaids, ushers, people doing readings and family.So we have only got an extra couple of friends coming. In the end it was quite easy as there were only a few spaces.” Hospitality consultant Sarah, , and Richard will still say their vows in Ingestre Church near Stafford. Their reception venue is closed, but they have been allowed use of the gardens for photographs. And they have booked a table at a pub for drinks. Richard says: “Sarah’s dad is in her bubble so he is able to walk her down the aisle. We have still got the wedding suits and Sarah has her dress. “We just want to be positive about the day.” Amanda Thorne and Paul Smith had their wedding cancelled twice due to coronavirus so were determined to go ahead at the first available date. The couple, of Huntingdon, Cambs, were supposed to get hitched in Gretna Green on April , in front of  guests.  When that was cancelled they asked their local vicar but then the country went into complete lockdown. HR adviser Amanda, , says: “We wanted April  as it is his parents’ wedding anniversary and Paul’s dad’s birthday. He lost his mum a few years ago. “We spoke to the vicar on March  and he saidthere was any sign of a lockdown he could bring the date forward. That night Boris gave his speech.” As soon as they heard weddings were to restart they set the wheels in motion. “We will be the last wedding our vicar does before he moves parishes. There are going to be  of us – our grown-up kids and their other halves,” Amanda says. “We’ll have to do the disinfecting but all that matters is we’re getting married. At our age you realise le is too short.” Fiona Sharples and Chris Fisher had planned a hippy-style festival wedding with a joint christening for their daughter Mallory for  guests.

It was only when he checked his balance months later after setting up internet banking that he saw hundreds of transactions, some as low as p. He has blasted game makers, saying that children are being trapped into spending cash not realising what theyaposre doing. Mr Cumming said his daughter thought she was spending monopoly money on the game and was shocked to find out what happened. Roblox, which is advertised as free-to-play, is used by more than  million people worldwide. It is a  where people can create and join hundreds of games. After Mr Cumming contacted BBC Radio aposs The Jeremy Vine Show, Roblox agreed to refund him.  He said initially he thought nothing of it, but when he set up online banking during the lockdown he was stunned. Mr Cumming told the BBC: I couldnapost understand it. I thought Iaposd been scammed. He said his daughter thought she was playing with monopoly money, and fumed: How can these companies be allowed to trap minors in these games  The game generates cash through in-app purchases.  After seeing the vast sum missing from his account, Mr Cumming contacted HSBC to cancel his card - but claimed a further £, later left his account to be paid to Roblox through Google Pay.

The first of its pubs and restaurants will reopen on Monday July , Yorkshire Live reports. A spokeswoman for the company said: We welcome the news that pubs, alongside other hospitality venues, can reopen from next month. Pubs play an important role at the very heart of their communities and have been sorely missed by customers as well as those who work in them. We look forward to welcoming back customers to our pubs and providing that great hospitable pub experience we all love. Wetherspoon is set to reopen hundreds of its UK establishments on Saturday despite fierce debate.But Greene King says it wants to ensure its restaurants have safe socialising layouts. The spokeswoman added: Not all our pubs will be viable to open immediately, even with the reduction in social distancing guidance to one metre alongside additional measures, but we expect to open ,, over two-thirds of our managed estate in phase one. We are working on the re-opening date for the second phase and will confirm it as soon as we can. The safety of our team and customers is our top priority and we are confident the measures we are introducing outlined in our PUBSAFE promises will mean our pubs will operate safely for both customers and team members.

The pubgoer, named Jimmy, couldnapost wait to get down to his local, The Shiredale in Manchester this morning. Boozers were allowed to reopen from am today. Jimmy, who worked a night sht tarmacking roads, shunned sleep in order to get his first pub-served pint since March. After opting for a Carling, he told the Manchester Evening News: Itaposs brilliant being back. I was on nights, finished my sht...went home had a shower and came in.

Earlier today a man celebrating theof pubs in England today said cheers as he downed a jagerbomb live on BBC at am. The smiling punter, in a Wetherspoons pub in Central London, grinned at the camera before the necking the drink.One Twitter user voiced her approval, writing: I love the fact he casually downed a jägerbomb live on the BBC at am in the morning.It comes as boozers brace for their busiest night of the year, with businesses allowed to open their doors for the first time since March.But with the R rate now feared to be above  in London - meaning the number of new Covid- cases could be rising - experts have called on boozers to be careful. North London punter Andrew Slawinski said first pub pint was like winning the [Premier] League. Builder Ben Clark, from Newcastle, and two friends queued outside the Briar Rose in Birmingham city centre before it reopened at am.

Users of EncroChat were left reeling after it told users that international crime fighting agencies had cracked the encryption.The Dutch phone messaging company charges around £,-a-month for a service that was thought to be impenetrable to investigators, reports the Liverpool Echo. But this assumption was shattered when customers were told too turn off and dump their phones after police managed to breach the system for around  minutes.Sources who spoke with the Liverpool Echo also veried the message to the which reads: Today we had our domains seized by government entities. They repurposed our domains to launch an attack to comprise carbon units. With control of our domain they managed to launch a malware campaign against the carbon to weaken its security. Due to the level of sophistication of the attack, and the malware code, we can no longer guarantee the security of your device. We took immediate action on our network by disabling connectivity to combat the attack. You are advised to power off, and physically dispose of your device immediately. Period of compromise was about  minutes. Encro phones, used by iniduals involved in organised crime, offered a range of features designed to keep messages secret from police even when the handsets were seized during raids.  Customers could easily wipe their phones and only a complex series of passwords allowed entry to the actual encrypted phone where sensitive messages were stored. The NCA has said that EncroChat was used by criminals to sell drugs, guns and organise murder. The alert warning has sent panic and alarm through the cityaposs underworld. The breakthrough has presented the cityaposs crime bosses with a massive dilemma. The man who sent the message to the Liverpool Echo said: Now is not a good time to be a grafter. Sleepless nights for a lot of lads out there.  Yesterday the National Crime Agencyand local forces launched a day of unprecedented action as a direct result of the EncroChat hack. Operation Venetic eventually saw  arrests, £ million in criminal cash seized along with  firearms and more than two tonnes of drugs. On Merseyside police have made  arrests over the last month and seized around £m in cash,  kilos of Class A drugs,  cannabis plants,  kilos of Class B drugs and . tonnes of mixing agents and three firearms and ammunition. The penetration of the phone network has let to one of the biggest days of action against organised crime in modern history. Crime hubs in Liverpool, Birmingham and London have been smashed, and some of the biggest names in UK crime are now feeling the pressure. It has also emerged that Operation Venetic has led to the discovery of plots by criminals to kill rivals across the country, including on Merseyside. Yesterday Ian Critchley, Assistant Chief Constable for Merseyside Police, said the force had been able to prevent executions and kidnaps on the city streets. He said that the force had been able to target iniduals involved in the highest levels of criminality.

An area of low pressure is expected to develop over the Atlantic and track eastwards across central Scotland during Sunday with strong winds developing across a large swathe of the UK. Gusts of - mph are most likely over and to the east of high ground, particularly the Pennines which may lead to some travel disruption, the Met Office website reads. With trees in full leaf, fallen branches and damaged trees may cause some localised travel and power disruption. While there is high confidence in the development of the low pressure system, there is the potential for a much deeper system with stronger winds and a risk of severe gales around coasts and through the Central Belt. The weather warning is in place from midnight until pm on Sunday. Temperatures will struggle to exceed C during this period, around C lower than the average for this time of year in the areas affected.  Coastal areas will be worst hit by the gales. Durham, Northumberland and Tyne and Wear in particular are braced for the strong winds. The Met Office website adds: There is a slight chance of some damage to buildings, such as tiles blown from roofs. There is a small chance of longer journey times or cancellations as road, rail, air and ferry services are affected. There is a small chance that some roads and bridges could close. There is a slight chance that power cuts may occur, with the potential to affect other services, such as mobile phone coverage. There is a small chance that injuries could occur from large waves and beach material being thrown onto sea fronts, coastal roads and properties.While the weather warning is in place for West Yorkshire, North Yorkshire, Lancashire and Cumbria, it is understood the winds will be weaker in the west. The Met Office says areas in Central, Tayside  Fe, Lothian Borders and Strathclyde should prepare for the gales too. Theyaposll also affect County Antrim and County Londonderry, but to a lesser extent. Although the weather warning is only currently in place until pm on Sunday, itaposll remain windy into the week.

Large parts of the UK will be overcast today, and a weather warning is in place on Sunday - with a mph aposweather bombapos set to hit. The Met Office says there will be rain today across Western England and Wales, but areas in the east will avoid the worst of the rainfall. London, Birmingham and the North East are expected to stay mostly dry, which will be a relief to those taking advantage of beer gardens for the first time since March. In the South East, where it is expected to be cloudy but dry, the Met Office says. Some parts of the country will reach C as experts warn of a disappointing summer to come. The North West, expected to be cloudy all day, will see highs of C. In the North East it will be slightly warmer, but could see some rain. The Midlands will see some drizzle, but will nevertheless be humid, while the South East will see some bright spells and highs of C.  Tomorrow yellow weather warnings are in place, with gusts of up to mph in the north and mph in the south. A “mediocre” July was forecast by The Weather Outlook. The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze told Blowing Hot and Cold videochat: “Bad weather as lockdown eases is ironic after a great spring with people indoors. July looks mediocre.” Ex-BBC and Met Office forecaster John Hammond of weathertrending said: “The Atlantic is expected to dominate until mid-month, with approaching the end of July seeing longer drier spells and transient heat before fresher Atlantic air s.  “Frost would not be a surprise in the most prone Scottish Glens early this coming week.” A Met Office forecaster said: “Cool, blustery conditions on Monday for all follow Sundayaposs wet and very windy weather clearing the North. “A North-South split is then most likely, with rain and strong winds in the North, possibly spreading to other areas, with the South drier.

Theme parks, bingo halls, museums and galleries are also reopening their doors. The easing of the lockdown cannot come soon enough for the many businesses who desperately need our custom.

Nor should we forget that the virus has so far taken more than , lives, including , in care homes. That is why this is a moment of appreciation, rather than celebration. It is a chance to enjoy simple pleasures we once took for granted and show support for local firms hammered by the lockdown. While today is an important milestone, we should not forget the virus is far from beaten. Medical experts have warned there remains a real possibility of a second wave. If we wish to keep others safe and avoid more lockdowns, we must act responsibly.  Pay respects This weekend we will remember those who have died from Covid- and give thanks to the NHS on its nd birthday. We will mourn friends, relatives and strangers lost to the virus, including hundreds of staff whose sacrices must never be forgotten.

The chain, which is reopening the majority of its  premises from this morning, has admitted price increases will apply to beer, spirits and wine, as well as the food on offer. Drinks will go up p, while food will increase by p, although prices will y across the UK depending on location. But itaposs not the only chain of boozers to ramp up the cost of a pint. The cost of lager and bitter in Samuel Smith pubs will be hiked by as much as £ from today. Favourites like Taddy Lager will also rise from £. to £. and a pint of Sovereign Bitter will go up in price from £. to £..to get the Mirror’s daily coronavirus briefing email at mirror email -after the press conference every evening.  Wetherspoon spokesman Eddie Gershon told The Sun: “Prices will go up on beer, spirits and wine, by approximately p a serving and by approximately p on a meal. “All we can say in this area is that we try to keep prices as competitive as possible. From time to time there will be price rises but we always try and minimise them. “Even with price rises, the entire pub industry, including Wetherspoon, will be less profitable than before pubs closed, because costs will be so much higher.” From today, customers can expect a dferent drinking experience in Wetherspoons. Queuing outside, depending on numbers inside the pub, and using hand sanitiser on entry will become the norm. Disposable aposone-useapos menus with the new list of prices will be recycled after being given to a customer. Punters will be asked to order food and drink on the Wetherspoons app and they will not be allowed to move tables around, which have been set out by staff to observe social distancing rules. As well as these changes being made to ensure the pubs are COVID-secure, Wetherspoons has also said that it will be asking customers to provide contact details and information before they are served.  Wetherspoons punters will be asked to hand over their contact details every time they visit a pub when they reopen from Saturday. While itaposs not a legal requirement to provide this information, itaposs part of the NHSapos Test and Trace initiative which means you will be contactedsomeone during your visit has been diagnosed with COVID-. You will only be allowed to visit with one other household, and Spoons says it will be enforcing it from Saturday, alongside encouraging small groups only.  Children will still be allowed to visit family friendly pubs in the daytime, but parents must make sure that that are seated at all times. If you turn up in a large group, or you start to gather once inside the pub, staff will ask you split up. And If the pub begins to become overcrowded, you may be asked to leave.

She had received a notication through her Nest doorbell while she was out that somebody had been to the door, and the device also sends her footage for home-monitoring and security. The video she was sent had no audio, but when she ed home she reviewed the full clip to work out why the driver had fled so quickly after the aposweirdapos incident in Delaware. And she quickly learned her young son had been behind it, having snuck a very unique set of delivery instructions onto the Amazon order. Before the order went out for delivery, under a box titled aposDo we need any additional instructions to find this address apos, her son had written: No but knock on the door  times and scream abra cadabra as loud as you can and run super fast away. Incredibly, the clip shows the woman place the package on the porch before banging on the door and screaming the magical phrase before jumping down the steps and sprinting back to her van - exactly as instructed.Itaposs had more than two million views and , shares after Lynn posed it on Facebook, along with a screenshot of her sonaposs instructions, with the caption: Thank you to this great Amazon delivery woman! Apparently, my youngest son had put some aposadditional instructionsapos for delivery and she went along with it. It made us smile even though my son should not have done that so I apologize for that.I do appreciate that the driver looked closely enough at the instructions though because I know a lot of people wouldnapost. Thousands of people praised the driver for her full commitment to the job, with many suggesting she had earned a raise and promotion.

The body of Willow Dunn was devastatingly found in an aposadvanced state of decompositionapos when police entered the house in Brisbane, Australia. Police said she had been partially eaten by rats and was lying in her own filth. The child, who had Down syndrome, had a number of injuries, according to a post-mortem. The little girlaposs father Mark James Dunn, , and stepmother Shannon Leigh White, , have both been charged with her murder. So distraught by Willowaposs death, last Saturday strangers gathered to mourn her. Butterflies, a symbol of Down syndrome awareness, were released at a public memorial in Brisbaneaposs Cannon Hill Park. The heartfelt and emotional gathering was organised by T Mum Australia Network and Down Syndrome Queensland who shared poignant photos. One caption read: I was absolutely honored and happy to do this for beautul little Willow. Fly high sweet angel and be comforted in your mumaposs loving embrace for eternity.x An image from the memorial shows a table full of baby photos of Willow, candles and gorgeous flowers. Four butterflies were released to honour Willow, while a fth butterfly was released in honour of her biological mother who died after giving birth. Children also blew bubbles.  One of the organisers Kathy Dillon told the Daily Mail: Every child deserves love and support. I am happy now she is with her mummy, safe as she should be. Kellie Rainbow also told the gathered crowds the toddleraposs death was a painful experience for so many. She said: The passing of Willow hurts so much because her le was short and her story incomplete.  Meanwhile, as we previously reported, haunting photos show childrenaposs toys and a pram abandoned outside the home where Willowaposs body was found. Dunn alleged he found his daughter face down in her cot. He was later arrested. Heartbreaking pictures show the little girlaposs teddy bear dressed in a Parramatta Eels rugby team jersey in the window of the home. An abandoned pram was left outside the front lawn as forensic teams scoured the scene for more clues about her death.  A train set, teddy bears and a childaposs pink play castle were among toys left by the roadside. An investigation is underway to determineWillow starved to death and was denied medication. A post-mortem examination concluded Willow was experiencing serious malnourishment and other health issues that indicated sustained mistreatment. It also alleged she had scalp burns and bone-deep infected hip sores.  Dunn was charged under a new definition of murder in Queensland aimed at child-killers, which includes reckless indference to human le. Two ambulances and multiple police cars were seen parked at the home following the discovery, with a crime scene established. The following day investigators ed to further examine the home and gather forensic swabs, it is reported.

We will need all possible teaching resources at our disposal over the next year to compensate for any loss of learning suffered during lockdown, as well as to bring much needed resilience to the education system at this challenging time.#We are working with local authorities to establish what additional staff are needed.

That was something a lot of us considered.“Given everything that has gone clubs will just be glad it’s happening atall.“The fact things have improved over the last few weeks is allowing us to still have this competition.“But it is still a long way to go yet before we get to August .“Hopefully things keep moving in the right direction so that we can play the tournament.”With the first three qualying rounds up to the play-offs now one legged the Reds will need the luck of the draw to land a Pittodrie tie.Home advantage in the all or nothing tie will be determined by the first team out of the hat in the draw.Aberdeen had initially been scheduled to kick off their Europa League on July  but that entry has been pushed back seven weeks due to Covid-.McInnes and his squad, along with Motherwell, will discover their first qualying round opponents at the UEFA draw on Monday August .The draw for the second round, where Premiership runners-up Rangers enter, will be made on Monday August .The Europa League second round will be played on September  with the third round on September  and play off on October .McInnes recently said he hoped there would be some financial assistance from UEFA for clubs drawn away from home in the one legged ties.Away trips will bring the expenditure of flights and hotel stays without the chance to offset that spend by home gate income.Any home games in the qualiers for Aberdeen will be played behind closed doors.Aberdeen hope to have as many as , supporters back to Pittodrie in October, after the Europa League qualiers,the Scottish Government’s easing of lockdown restrictions allow.However Scotland’s Fist Minister Nicola Sturgeon has urged caution over October for the phasedof fans.McInnes said: “One legged ties is something that was mooted a few weeks ago.“Obviously the Europa League has still to be concluded from last season.“There is also the fact that games that are normally played in June and July will now be in the back end of August.“One legged ties kind of makes sense and was expected to be honest.“It will be a dferent competition in the early stages because of that.”McInnes will attempt to lead Aberdeen into the group stages of the Europa League for the first time in seven attempts next season.In the previous six years the Reds have fallen at the third qualying round five times and exited at the second qualying stage once, to English Premier League Burnley.In preparation for the new season Aberdeen signed winger Jonny Hayes on a two year contract following his exit from Celtic.A deal for Hayes, , could only be completed because the Republic of Ireland international offered to defer his wages for a year.Due to the Covid- pandemic and predicted £m losses McInnes is for now unable to bring in new signings.It could be a case of one out for one to come inthe Reds sell a player although the club are adamant there will be no fire-sale despite the losses during the coronavirus shutdown.McInnnes is confident he will have a strong squad next season.He said: “With a clean bill of health I feel we can go and compete and achieve what we want to this season.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again.

Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

It shows contempt for those in the NHS who have risked their lives to save others. It shows contempt for those who have died without their loved ones by their side. It shows contempt for all of us who have stuck by the rules to protect our lives and the lives of others.Boris Johnson has asked us to #move on# but this issue will not go away. This is a wound that will continue to fester.Dominic Cummings continues to be a major player in government decisions and rules, those rules he so shamelessly flaunted without even an apology.

Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

moves through the faint, outer part of earths shadow.A lunar eclipse happens when the Earth comes between the sun and the moon, therefore blocking some or all of the sunrsquos light from reaching the moon.Therefore, the moon cannot shine ndash because its surface is not reflecting the sunrsquos rays.The eclipse will be visible over ScotlandAccording to TimeAndDate, a penumbral lunar eclipse occurs when the sun, earth and moon are imperfectly aligned.When this happens, the earth blocks some of the sunrsquos light from directly reaching the moonrsquos surface, and covers all or part of the moon with the other part of its shadow.People in Scotland are urged to find an unobstructed area with a free sight to the southwest for a best view of the eclipse.Unlike solar eclipses, which can only be seen along a narrow path from a small part of the earth, eclipses of the moon can be observed all across the night side of earth when the eclipse happens.According to TimeAndDate, these are the local

estuary.In particular, dogs off the lead persistently disturb feeding and nesting birds and I believe that dogs should only be allowed in the area of the country park west of the car park and toilet blockthey are on a lead.At present the only coastal area on the East Lothian coast where there are restrictions on dogs is the Aberlady Bay nature reserve .We owe it to our citizens and visitors, both

Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown.

Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media.

On the other side, you have the virus deniers.

It may just be the run of great weather through the spring, or the slightly slower pace meaning we can all take the time to enjoy it that bit more. Maybe it is the quieter streets helping us hear the birdsong better, but many folk canrsquot help thinking the reduced traffic and less mowing ndash just less interference all round ndash makes for a much healthier relationship between us and the wildle with which we share our towns and country.For me, the most striking thing is quite how vibrant and green everything has become in a single season without feet tramping over plants or mowers chopping through them. It is almost asnature is just waiting in the wings when we are gone the world around us will recover in the blink of an eye. Thatrsquos one of the most powerful things about the living word, and plants in particular. They donrsquot need us, but we definitely need them. Plants provide us with food, drink and medicines, they clothe us, provide building materials, shape our myths and give us the very oxygen we breathe.Modern society often fools itself into feeling removed from plants, but the vast majority of humanityrsquos cultures are profoundly shaped by the green world around us, and Scotland is no exception. Its rich heritage of plant lore shows how the countryrsquos flora has shaped our history, from the earliest inhabitants right through to the present day. Hints come from archaeological finds ndash ancient log boats hewn from huge, single trees show the importance of the coast and rivers to hunter-gatherer and early settled communities. This is understandable when much of the interior was covered in deep forest. These forests evidently harboured some huge trees,the boats are anything to go by.Millennia of exploitation, climate change and \"land management\" mean there are very few trees as large and straight as these left in Scotland, so we have to imagine these early post-Ice Age times as a primal world, where hunting and gathering were the fundamentals of le. Modern foragers find there is a huge wealth of interesting botanical fayre out there ndash a topic wersquollto later.Plant pollen found in ious Bronze-Age cups and beakers suggest a culture where honey, mead and beer were important aspects of either daily or ritual le, with many of the plant finds potential flavourings for the drinks. Interestingly, brewers and distillers have turned to many of these same species in making modern concoctions, supporting the huge growth in artisan beers and gins.Another wonderful find is the lsquohair-moss caprsquo found in the defensive ditch around the Roman fort of Newstead, near Melrose in the Borders. Woven from the tough stems of the woodland-dwelling hair-moss, Polytrichum, this enigmatic artefact prompts many questions ndash who made it  A Roman soldier, camp attendant or member of a native tribe  Why was it literally lsquoditchedrsquo  Is it a cap, or something   The now peat-blackened stems form a frill of hair around the cap, so my pet theory is that it was the forerunner of the lsquosee-you Jimmyrsquo wigs you can buy in tourist shops. Or maybe not.One of the big issues with archaeological botany is how to interpret these botanical finds. The fact that hazel shells pop up in ancient middens all the time might reflect hazelnutsrsquo popularity and value as nutritious foods or the fact they remain fresh for months. Or it might just be because the hazel shells are tough and survive through to the present while softer fruits, leaves and other parts of the hunter-gatherer diet rot away, giving us a  impression of people who appeared to eat nothing but hazels and shellfish ndash sounds quite posh actually.In more recent times, we are very fortunate that people had the foresight to research and record many fascinating uses ndash one of the champions of this was Sir Robert Sibbald. A th century physician, botanist and eventually Geographer Royal to the Scottish Crown, his passion for plants and their uses led him and friend Andrew Balfour to establish the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. This year is the Botanicsrsquo th anniversary and from a small plot of land behind the Palace of Holyrood House, this institution has grown into a pioneer of international research and collaboration on plant ersity and conservation.Sibbaldrsquos pamphlet entitled Provision for the Poor in Time of Dearth and Scarcity was an attempt to list all the edible things in Scotland in case crops failed and famine reared its head again as it had in the \"Seven Ill years\" of the s. Provision for the Poor lists a great many edible plants that could be foraged, as well as many fish, fowl and other animals including wildcat and pine marten ndash essentially the bat or pangolin of their day in Europe. More than one hundred species of plants are listed in the book, although with names such as ldquothe small hemlock chervil with the rough seeds it could be a bit of a lottery trying to identy the correct plant. Chervil would be tasty, while hemlock would be deadly. This one sounds most like bur-chervil, a relatively rare plant which has been eaten in the past. Strangely, Sibbald does not mention a single mushroom, reflecting the Scottish and wider British dread of a fatal error while mushroom hunting.Sibbald does, however, reserve space for seaweeds. Coastal communities across Scotland ate plenty of this nutritious resource, and it was likely on the menu for those earliest settlers millennia before. Martin Martin, a native of Skye was commissioned by Sibbald to document the land, people and natural history of the Gaelic-speaking parts of the country through the late s. His renowned account A Description of the Western Islands of Scotland mentions many uses for seaweeds as fertilisers, snacks and medicines. Carrageen pudding was made from carrageen seaweed and is still made widely today. It needs plenty of flavouring ndash traditionally lemon, pepper or vinegar. Reminiscent of a supernaturally bland cregraveme caramel it was thought particularly good for invalids recovering from stomach problems. The jelly-like chemicals in the seaweed help to set the milk for the pudding. Called carrageenans, they can be found in a host of modern products as gelling agents.Seaweeds are fascinating group. As dferent from most land plants as we are, these marine algae are abundant and wonderfully erse. The burned ash of some of the big brown seaweeds was the basis for Scotlandrsquos kelp industry in the th and th centuries. Thousands of tonnes of mineral-rich seaweed ash were produced annually and made many of the lairds in coastal areas very wealthy men. The same could not be said of the crofting families that were set to making the pits on the beach, hauling the weed and tending the fires as they smouldered. Parts of the Orkney archipelago were likened to volcanoes because of the smoke billowing up day and night from the shores. The kelp ash was very versatile ndash as a fertiliser, for bleaching linen or use in glassmaking. Inevitably, cheaper replacements were found over time and the bottom had fallen out of the industry by the s. The lairds who had grown comfortable on the profits of the industry looked straightaway to the next big thing ndash sheep. The failure of Scotlandrsquos kelp industry went hand-in-hand with the Highland Clearances.Tracing where these ideas about plants and their uses come from, and how they change on their journey, is fascinating. Plant medicines are a great source of such stories. St Johnrsquos Wort is an excellent example ndash it appears in classical Roman literature as fuga daemonum ndash the chaser of demons. It was widely used as a medicine throughout Europe from Classical times ndash the idea possibly spreading with the Romans, although one of its names in Gaelic suggests a strong connection to the Celtic god Lug who filled a similar role to St John as a shining, heroic sort. Of course, in Gaelic Christianity, the plant became St Columbarsquos plant and was known by one curious name reported by Alexander Carmichael: \"armpit package of St Columba\". Pieces of the plant were tucked into the oxter, where the sweat and hair would presumably break up the plant and allow the active \"demon-chasing\" principle into the thin skin of the armpit. This is a beautully elegant interpretation of the plantrsquos antidepressant compounds. If you were beset by devils, an interpretation of psychiatric issues such as depression, then surely the power of a saint or a god working through the plant would vanquish those demons.We still do not understand how St Johnrsquos wort works as an antidepressant and it can have signicant, dangerous interactions with other medicines, but it is just one example of a rich folklore building up around a real-le bit of biochemistry. How  would people have interpreted this seemingly magical property of the plant  The sinister associations of foxglove with witches, the dead or fairy-folk reflect a poison still used as a medicine in heart conditions today. There are many other examples of intriguing tales where a botanical story might hold the key to a new medicine, and many where the story is seemingly just that ndash a story. Why, for example, do witches supposedly fear rowan trees  Is it the red berries or some other property lost to time ndash and has anyone actually done a proper double-blind scientic research study on it  Of course it doesnrsquot matter why, but just take a look at how many gardens have a rowan tree by the gate and you can see that these stories run deep in the cultural psyche.As well as the ideas and stories, our flora also contains many plants that were brought here by humans, either intentionally or by happy accident. These are the lsquonon-nativersquo flora and actually make up about half the species we find in Scotland today. The vast majority of these are rare, often limited to the port towns where they arrived, or the gardens they were cultivated in. A very few of them can be invasive, but they have all contributed to ersity of our new flora. In the face of climate change and globalisation, the flora changes all the time, and many species, both native and non-native are hugely adaptable. Watch this spaceas the sweet cicely brought by monastic communities from central Europe as a flavouring and strewing herb evolves into a unique new iety or species cut off from its original populations.Many traditionally useful plants are important parts of Scotlandrsquos ancient native habitats. These are precious and unique places with global signicance for bioersity. The incredibly rich Atlantic oakwoods ndash our local \"west-coast rainforest\" ndash have a profusion of lichens, mosses and ferns, but are potentially threatened by development. The pinewoods of the north west and mountains are hemmed in by vast tracts of heather moorland while the looming threat of climate change is never far from the headlines. However,you fence off the heather moorland, excluding grazing deer and sheep, the recovery is nothing short of miraculous ndash within a matter of a decade you have a beautully rich young pine woodland emerging. Once again, we see how resilient plants and habitats can be.Scottish Plant Lore, an Illustrated Flora, explores the wealth of versatile plants on a tour from the seashore up the mountains to the city streets. The beautul illustrations are the work of over  wonderfully talented artists which interpret the Scottish native flora in watercolour, acrylic, pencil or even the ink from the ink-cap mushroom tap.Dr Gregory J Kenicer is a research botanist in the education department at the Royal Botanical Garden Edinburgh.

Food factories and meat plants in the US, Europe and the UK have become Covid- hotspots. Most recently, a chicken plant in Anglesey, Wales, had to shut down when  employees tested positive out of a total workforce of .Expect the usual ldquoI told you so interpretation of this phenomenon from vegan propagandists who seize any opportunity to frame their usual suspect: meat production. But itrsquos not the type of food ndash animal or plant-based ndash these factories handle that creates the problem.One suspected cluster of cases, for instance, has occurred in a Chinese factory that manufactures crisps. Itrsquos the physical set-up.Food factories donrsquot do Doors Open Days, and for good reason. If we saw how the products we buy, so slickly presented on supermarket shelves, were produced inside such places, it would kill our appetite for them.When I was researching my book Swallow This, which investigates the processed food industry, I inveigled myself into several factories that supply the major multiples, and take it from me, itrsquos no mystery why people get ill working in such environments, or why they have such high staff turnovers. They are horrible places to work in. Food manufacturers want us to think that these factories are just like a scaled up version of a domestic kitchen. But they more resemble car plants and oil refineries, or even the missile-launching pad at the end of Dr No, where James Bond sabotages the efforts of a small army of operatives, lost and almost robotic-looking inside their bulky protective clothing.Whether theyrsquore turning out packs of chicken pieces or vegan lasagna, chilled food factories operate in similar ways. To inhibit the growth of dangerous food poisoning bacteria, such as campylobacter and listeria, the ambient temperature in most zones of food factories is bitingly raw and cold. It chills you down to the bone marrow. Covid- appears to love such conditions. So therersquos problem number one.Thanks to the sheer scale and heft of the machinery in these factories, the noise is deafening. Staff usually get given ear plugs, but when they do have to communicate, they have to shout. Shouting appears to increase the risk of spreading coronavirus problem number two.Problem number three  Letrsquos call it inadequate physical distancing because therersquos nothing sociable about standing closely on a factory line arranging vegan nuggets on trays, or checking that each jalfrezi barbecue skewer has the stipulated four chunks of meat.I wouldnrsquot last an hour in one of these places, let alone get through the demanding shts that workers typically put in ndash  hours isnrsquot unusual, sometimes nightsht. Thatrsquos problem four right there: factory workers have protracted exposure in circumstances where coronavirus flourishes.And that includes sharing tables in the canteen. The one I saw was small and intimate compared to the factory floor. Its dish of the day was bigos, the Polish meat and sauerkraut stew.Housing presents us with problem five. Staff often share living quarters ndash basic accommodation is frequently part of the employment package ndash and workers are bussed from there to the factory and back again after their sht. The Unite union says that staff often struggle into work when they feel sick because theyrsquore scared of their pay being docked.Bottom line  Yoursquod need a very strong immune system to work in one of these factories at the very best of times, let alone when coronavirus is around.This should give us pause to think. The industrial food system didnrsquot create Covid-, but its workplaces are a vector for it. Surely an essential requirement for any sane food economy should be that it creates safe jobs for the people who work in it "},{"url":null,"title":"tv-preview-coleen-maureen-nolan-open-loss-family-feuds-dating","story":"Coleen Nolan was certainly dubious about making a TV show with her sisters.In the past, there have been public feuds between the siblings, who found fame as a hugely successful Irish girl group, The Nolans .And -year-old Coleen - the youngest of the family - was worried they wouldnt get on as they travelled the Mediterranean together for The Nolans Go Cruising, which will air on Quest Red.\"Youre together  , for two weeks, which we havent done since we were kids,\" notes the witty, no-nonsense Loose Women host.\"I thought, We could end doing this show and end up getting off this cruise and not ever speaking again.\"But, luckily, the opposite happened, and she feels she has reconnected with Maureen, Linda and Anne.\"I feel closer to them now, I think, than ever,\" she gushes, before adding with a chuckle: \"I mean, dont get me wrong, they still get on my nerves...\"The eight-part series finds all four sisters single for the first time in their adult lives, as they embark on two cruises on board the MSC Grandiosa.We will also see them prepare for a performance of their hit Im In The Mood For Dancing in front of their fellow passengers, on the final night of the trip.\"We were all really nervous and wary about doing that because obviously Bernie sang the lead in Im In The Mood For Dancing,\" reflects Maureen, .Throughout the show, the foursome mention their sister Bernie, who died of breast cancer in , a lot.Do they find it therapeutic to talk about their memories of her \"Its very cathartic to talk things out, whatever it is,\" Maureen suggests thoughtfully.\"She will never be forgotten.

Speculation over testing or quarantining travellers between England and Scotland has been raised as part of a discussion of how to prevent infection from a neighbour with a higher incidence of Covid  than here. As a result, almost overnight the Border has begun to assume a signicance it has not held for centuries.:Thousands back petition to close Scottish border to all but essential trafficThis pandemic might one day be viewed as a textbook illustration of the geopolitical fault lines across the UK. What was once a united front has splintered into four distinct nations, each with a dferent solution to the same problem. Nothing more starkly demonstrates the gulf between the laissez-faire ethos of the Westminsterrsquos panjandrums and the commonsensical attitude at Holyrood than the ways in which they have eased restrictions.The increasingly relaxed English regime appears to be fuelled by wishful thinking rather than science the Scottish situation, meanwhile, is characterised by caution. Long before talk of checkpoints, this was already causing tension. When Englandrsquos routemap out of lockdown was weeks ahead of Scotland, John Lamont, Conservative MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, said those of his constituents close to Borisrsquos bailiwick were confused. Why did one rule apply to their very near neighbours, and another to them The answer seemed obvious ndash it was far too soon to relax ndash but the question vividly demonstrated the nature of this area. Many who live where Hadrianrsquos men boldly marched have a foot in both countries. They might work in one, and live in the other, hail from this side and have relocated to that. They could have family and friends in either camp, who remained out of reach for so long as the Scottish government prohibited meeting.Those Border villagers who defied lockdown to visit a garden centre in Berwick were making a political rather than a horticultural statement. In this, they echoed attitudes since the days of the great reiving clans, who roamed freely on both banks of the Tweed. The Scottish and English kings were so appalled at the regionrsquos lawlessness that, despite being sworn enemies, they worked in tandem to subdue it.Given the way Borderers were treated by their lieges, itrsquos no surprise they thumbed their noses. These days, towns and villages are awash with folk from both sides, thereby creating a unique and strongly bonded region. Little wonder Unionism still pertains hereabouts.:Tourists from England could face -day quarantine in ScotlandCovid- cases flareThat there have been no deaths from Covid  in Scotland for the past few days suggests we are heading in the right direction. But there is a long way still to go. The First Ministerrsquos aim is to eradicate the virus, not merely contain it. Seeing the daily tally of new cases and deaths in England, she seeks confirmation that the Prime Minister has the same objective. But, as she said earlier this week, without such assurances she fears Englandrsquos strategy is ldquoletting it circulate at higher levels as long as it doesnrsquot threaten to overwhelm the NHS.If that is indeed the case, then monitoring passage between the countries is in some respects no dferent from policies implemented by a place like New Zealand. It initially imposed an outright ban on entry, followed later by quarantine on new arrivals. The problem is, as a devolved nation within a union, the consequences of such a step are potentially inflammatory. Some will view it as independence by stealth, a confrontational declaration of autonomy, or simply authoritarianism run rampant. Yet with a summer of staycations approaching, the repercussions of allowing untrammelled travel could be dire.Before the prospect of imposing controls was mooted, people around where I live in Roxburghshire have been scowling at visitors from only a few miles away, let alone the depths of the English shires. When a couple of walkers dared ask a neighbour directions over the hills last week, they narrowly avoided a tirade.The idea of the Border ing to its roots as a frontier inevitably creates a troubling sense of Them and Us, or Friend and Foe. Affront will be taken at any restriction on free transit between south and north. Presumably residents of Scotland who visit England will also be tested or quarantined on their , making it a two-way injunction. Suddenly a weekend break in Northumberland looks a lot less appealing.:YouGov Poll: Half of Conservative voters in England support English independenceYet how exactly would it work  Is it only tourists who will be checked, or will those travelling back and forth for work, be they lorry drivers or business reps, also be subject to testing  Will every road, rail and sea route across the Border from Berwick to Workington be patrolled  Might we see a surge in midnight crossings over no-manrsquos land and rivers, four-by-fours finally justying their existence and canoes retrofitted to ferry families plus their luggage across the Tweed As things stand, there have been no new cases of the virus in the Scottish Borders in two weeks. This beautul, windswept district is starting to feel like a cordon sanitaire, a buffer between the haves and,not precisely the have-nots, then a population beginning slowly but steadily to paralyse the disease.Given our reputation as one of the sickest countries in Europe, we need to take every precaution to protect lives. Reimposing the Border as a barrier and guard would not be popular, and the war-time and military resonances are unsettling. Yet, in light of the high risk of contagion still posed by parts of the south, in the short term it would make sense.

I wonder what he would think of Cullen Skink now being served in some of the countryrsquos poshest restaurants The village lies on the Moray Coast, an area of north-east Scotland that enjoys one of the mildest climates in the UK. The village is dominated by vast railway viaducts, two of which are now part of the Sustrans national cycle network.

Chances are you will get a glimpse of a crossbill, the Scottish lsquoparrot of the pinewoodsrsquo, and you are more than likely to spot red squirrels. If you are really lucky, you might even see a pine marten, one of the most beautul creatures of the pine forest. There is a temptation to think that dense woodland like this is bereft of fauna but glimpses of any wildle is dependent on patience, being observant, and keeping as quiet as possible.The walk begins up the main track and the last time I was here we were fortunate enough to spot a crossbill almost as soon as we started walking.

The objects of ire are campervans.I would agree there are issues to be resolved, but the character of tourism has changed dramatically in recent times.Many campervanners donrsquot want to stay in campsites because they lack the flexibility the modern tourist wants. Traditional holidays on campsites were planned in advance and people spent the entire holiday in one place. That doesnrsquot suit todayrsquos active travel market.Campervans offer people the chance to visit and explore areas of Scotland. They just need somewhere to safely park for the night ndash a non-muddy, level stretch of ground.Many campsites are now charging upwards of pound-pound a night and these five-star set-ups are greatyou want all the facilities on offer. Better to have a network of -star budget campsites ndash the corner of a farmerrsquos field, for example.Also, most campsites only open between Easter and September.There are a number of alternatives to campsites already in existence and more enlightened communities have set up overnight parking areas for campervans for a small fee. I have used such facilities in Kinlochbervie, Findhorn, the Glen Coe ski area and throughout the Western Isles.Rather than suggest \"banning\" camper vans from overnight parking can I suggest community councils look at ways of helping to create an infrastructure that will provide safe, low-cost overnight parking whilst creating a source of income for the communities themselves  We only have to look at the success of the Aires network in most European countries to realise that here in Scotland we are decades behind in how we treat this kind of tourism.Campervans already provide a considerable amount of money to rural economies. Owners buy fuel for their vehicles, eat and drink in local restaurants and pubs and buy supplies from supermarket and small village shops. In a country that claims to be progressive I find it extraordinary that community councils should actively oppose camper van tourism.Making informal camping by camper vans illegal would require a major change to UK traffic law, so that is extremely unlikely. Far better for community councils to work together with organisations like the Campervan and Motorhome Professional Associtionto develop a more positive, welcoming and beneficial way forward, to Scotlandrsquos benefit.Cameron McNeish, Newtonmore."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-view-time-braver-easing-lockdown","story":"Only cautious and provisional, though, not just because those have characterised the moves out of lockdown, and there are economic reasons to be pessimistic about their effects, but because even for the health results ndash which look much more heartening ndash we need to bear in mind that much is still unknown.On current evidence, it looks asthe Scottish Government has handled the urgent issues, those literally of le and death, reasonably well,far from perfectly. It may be that it has done so more effectively than the UK Government it has certainly looked more competent, and deserves to be commended for that.But until we can realistically compare international data, reliably test the rate of infection, and have information about levels of immunity , it is too early to say so definitively.There is still no cure, no vaccine, and no indication of whether a second, even worse, spike is likely. It is even theoretically possible that countries with what look like the worst results now will fare best in the long run, though to pin hopes on that would certainly have been an unreasonable basis for government responses. The trouble is that no one knows, so the precautionary principle ndash what scientists lean on when the science is uncertain ndash is the obvious approach to the medical risks.The damage wrought by coronavirus is not merely to health, however: while it is understandable, and correct, that the Government should have made that the immediate priority, it also has to consider other costs and risks.In education, employment, the economy ndash particularly tourism, hospitality, arts and retail sectors ndash welfare, taxation and other issues, excessive caution has produced devastating, measurable costs, not all economic. Some, including poverty, home care for the vulnerable and the impact on non-covid medical treatment, from transplants to chemo to mental health, threaten lives and qualities of le as seriously as the coronavirus.It was always impossible completely to eradicate risk from le , and accepting that is still true in the age of coronavirus should inform the Governments approach to emerging from lockdown. Some firms cannotat all under current restrictions the solution is to listen to business leaders and find ways of mitigating risk, with clear guidance.Some of Scotlandrsquos distinctions ndash the need for face masks in public, or easing open pubs and restaurants from Monday by beginning with outdoor spaces alone, proposals for reducing distancing , for example, screens are installed ndash look perfectly sensible and proportionate, though greater clarity in specying the rules is still needed.Others ndash a delay of a couple of days or tiny distinctions in numbers at gatherings ndash raise the suspicion that theyrsquove been created for the sake of dference. Thatrsquos perhaps unworthy , but itrsquos a complaint critics ndash not just political opponents, but those desperate to get back to work or see their families ndash are bound to make.And there are areas where such minuscule distinctions are not merely petty, but pointless and unworkable. Holyrood shouldnrsquot be bounced into decisions by Westminster, but ndash when mutual arrangements have been made among all the major European countries ndash itrsquos absurd to maintain a travel ban when air bridges are in place, especially since plenty of holidaymakers travel from and back to English ports and airports. Caution may have contained the virus, but it canrsquot constrain all of le."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-kevin-mckenna-know-can-rebuild-economy---not-bosses","story":"If we are to have a real conversation about how Scotland stages a sustainable recovery post-coronavirus it would be a good idea to ditch the delusions. Scotland did not invent the modern world. At best, we were one of many small nations whose people contributed some of the ideas and ingenuity that improved our shared human experience. The Declaration of Arbroath did not inspire the fathers of American independence. Can we not just appreciate it for what it is without making extravagant claims on its behalf Perhaps Irsquom being too unkind. Unlike many successful entrepreneurs who are content to enjoy the fruits of othersrsquo endeavours without paying anything back, Sir Tom seems like a caring chap whorsquos sincere about leaving the world better than he found it. His foundation has helped many iniduals and groups to grow wings and fly. When it comes to blowing smoke up our fundaments, though, hersquod be advised to leave it to the politicians who can do it without thinking.Yet, when you eventually did drill down to the essence of his homily there were some sound conclusions, evenit was a little light on specics, a charge he levelled at Benny Higgins. Mr Higgins is the Scottish Governmentrsquos new best friend and he had also issued us with his roadmap to recovery. Mr Higgins says he is no fan of paying everyone a fair universal income. This is hardly surprising as the mere prospect of this would have caused his former employers at Tesco to reach for the Diocalm.Sir Tom rightly concluded that Scotlandrsquos small to medium enterprisesheld the key to recovery over the next five years, though he ought to press for a more nimble and adroit approach to public sector procurement. He also wrote passionately about the need to consider ideas from a wider arc of talents.ldquoDo not have the civil service or your agencies write an implementation plan for a customer they donrsquot really understand, he urged Nicola Sturgeon. ldquoLet us in business take this on, trust business to do it and work with you on this, he added.Yet, while I may be inclined to trust an entrepreneur with a veriable track record of making ladders rather than pulling them up, Irsquod demur at ceding signicant influence to the wider business community. Were it not for the sharp practices, profiteering and predatory instincts of large corporations wersquod be looking at the future with a shade more optimism.The biggest weakness in Sir Tomrsquos diagnosis and cure was the absence of anything resembling collectivism. It was all top-down when it needs to build from the shop-floor. The key to a well-managed and fair route away from the privations of coronavirus lies not in giving rich businessmen the idea that their ability to make money is the golden mean of a healthy economy.Any prescription that omits the trade union movement and the Living Wage Foundation simply wonrsquot work. The stagnation in the wages of our poorest-paid workers prevents them from supporting small businesses and building local economies. The tilt towards the tyranny of zero-hours contracts by the High Streetrsquos new cartels erodes the confidence of young people to make long-term financial and emotional commitments.Predatory behaviour such as this happens when trade unions are discouraged and the workforce is dehumanised and measured only in their profitability. No one is denying you the right to turn a reasonable profit but when you sacrice the right to dignity and respect in the workplace for it you arenrsquot running a business but a sweat-shop.The reasonable and fair deployment of capital permits all sections of society the chance to contribute. When this is distorted by greed and aice it quickly descends into unfettered capitalism. At times of mortal peril it begets disaster capitalism where billionaires feed on pestilence, war, famine and death and invest in those governments who specialise in making these happen. They have feasted on coronavirus.During these wretched months we have been at our best when those with very little have risked everything to maintain the lestyles of affluent people. The very worst of us was observed in the actions of Tim Witherspoon, Richard Branson and Willie Walsh, head of British Airwaysrsquo parent company IAG who, despite decades of massive profits instinctively sacriced their lowest-paid staff at the first hint of trouble.Itrsquos a template now being followed by those further down capitalismrsquos food-chain as tens of thousands of jobs disappear. Yet, no-one it seems is prepared to ask why our financial system always demands that those who are least able to cope with an economic challenge are the first to be jettisoned. Each Thursday we stood to applaud them and our NHS workers for their daily sacrice. Now that they are being fed to the wolves the applause must be ringing hollow in their ears.The myth of the lsquowealth-creatorsrsquo travels on the lie that an enlightened group of capitalist necromancers is solely responsible for their own success and that only through their natural beneficence are the rest of us blessed with a job. The truth is that the workers are the real wealth creators. If large corporations could discover a way of making profits without having to employ actual people theyrsquod escort us all from the building personally.By all means, Sir Tom ldquoengage the best brains from around the world your ldquojob-creators and entrepreneurs.

This is laid out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.Each of the rights contained under these articles contains limitations when there is a genuine societal need to restrict expression. However, offence against religious sentiment does not feature in any of these restrictions. In fact, in , the UN Human Rights Council said \"prohibitions of displays of lack of respect for a religion or other belief system are incompatible with the Covenant\". This principle applies to all forms of expression, including statements which are critical or disrespectful of religion.Furthermore, it is generally accepted that forbidding dissenting speech against religion promotes religious intolerance rather than protecting adherents. The UNrsquos Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, Dr Ahmed Shaheed, made this case strongly saying in  \"when governments restrict freedom of expression on the grounds of ldquoinsult to religion, any peaceful expression of political or religious views is subject to potential prohibition.\"Fraser Sutherland, Chief Executive, Humanist Society Scotland, Edinburgh EH.IS political correctness going to stamp out all satire at the expense of religion in Scotland  No more Billy Connollys. No more Dave Allens. No more Le of Brian. The threat is there in the Hate Crime Bill, which the SNP Government has placed before parliament.Someone isnrsquot a victim of a hate crime because their religious sentiments are hurt or offended. Many people found the jokes of Billy Connolly and Dave Allen \"offensive\", but the law did not rush in to prosecute the offending comedians. Likewise with the film Le of Brian. The right to freedom of speech was considered more important than any injured feelings caused by the satire.In England and Wales, the Racial and Religious Hatred Act  is the counterpart of the Hate Crimes Bill now at Holyrood. In that Act, there is a clear and unambiguous defence of free expression in relation to religion: ldquoNothing in this [legislation] shall be read or given effect in a way which prohibits or restricts discussion, criticism or expressions of antipathy, dislike, ridicule, insult or abuse of particular religions or the beliefs or practices of their adherents, or of any other belief system or the beliefs or practices of its adherents, or proselytising or urging adherents of a dferent religion or belief system to cease practising their religion or belief system.We need the same safeguard written into the Hate Crimes Bill. The law should concern itself with protecting people from hatred, threats and vilication, but it should not extend that into protecting ideas and beliefs. On the contrary, the law should uphold freedom of expression and the liberty to criticise and mock all sorts of ideas and beliefs. That freedom has been hard earned after centuries of censorship and repression. Surely we shall not cast it lightly aside in pursuit of some politically correct virtue-signalling Les Reid, Edinburgh EH."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11550356.jpg?type=article-full","title":"powerleague-take-online-bookings-alleged-lockdown-breaches","story":"The football chain, which has articial pitches in over  sites across the UK, opened on Wednesday night at their former headquarters in Paisley to allow people to exercise during lockdown.In a Facebook post that has now been taken down, Powerleague Paisley wrote that they were taking bookings as a part of a lsquotwo week trialrsquo before evaluating the safety of the small sided games.However, concerns were made over the legality of this during stage  of lockdown in Scotland where contact sports are not yet permitted.Currently only members from the same household and people who have formed a lsquosocial bubblersquo can have physical contact.So unless participants are playing human football, a competitive match with people from outside your own household would prove dficult.Powerleague CEO, Christian Rose, said:ldquoWe know the benefits of playing sports and getting put to have a kickabout from a mental perspective.ldquoWhen people are playing on our pitches they must observe two metre social distancing unless they sign a disclaimer saying they are from the same household.ldquoIf itrsquos a mixture of people from outside your social bubbles then distancing must be maintained.However, when asked about the several games of v which were happening Wednesday night at the site in Paisley, Mr Rose added:ldquoWeare asking people to sign a disclaimer to say that they are from the same householdthey want to play full contact football.ldquoWe are also hearing from governments in England and Scotland say that it is about the responsibility of iniduals to take when following the guidelines.lsquoIf we are breaking the rules of the Scottish government then wersquoll take actionrsquoldquoOur pitches are being broken into on a regular basis and people are playing full contact with no protection on pitches which arenrsquot being sanitised.

One day I randomly saw an advert for a baker, required one day a week, so I decided to apply. I got the job and gave up my career.

Like-for-like sales for the six weeks to September ,  were up .%.\"The outspoken Wetherspoon chiefhad faced criticism for once playing down the risks of people gathering in pubs during the pandemic at the time and insisted that the government was wrong to shut them down.In March, in the aftermath of Boris Johnson announcing the coronavirus lockdown, it emerged the pub chain denied it was ldquoabandoning its , staff and insisted it could not afford to pay them during the Covid- crisis until the company was reimbursed for their wages by the government.Details of the loan which were confirmed onJune .He angered workers and MPs after sending a video message to staff a few days before the official lockdown indicating they would no longer be paid while the company works out details of a ldquofurlough scheme under which the government will pay % of wages.He hinted they could seek work in Tesco, which was hiring staff to help it meet the countryrsquos need for food delivery and distribution,they needed employment in the meantime.Mr Martin, who donated pound, to Boris Johnsons General Electon campaign said at the time: ldquoCompanies like Costa, owned by Coca-Cola, and McDonaldrsquos, being owned by large multinationals, can afford to retain staff and commit to paying them, before details of the government furlough scheme are published.ldquoHowever, they are in a minority in the pub and restaurant trade. Most companies, including Wetherspoon, do not have the resources, while pubs are shut, to make this commitment and need to see details of the scheme in order to retain and pay staff, as the government has sensibly requested, rather than instigating large-scale layoffs.ldquoThat may seem stark, but thatrsquos the economic reality of the unprecedented situation in the UK today.But in a separate statement, Wetherspoon had blamed a ldquocomplete misinterpretation of its message to staff, although it did not dispute that they would cease to be paid after Friday while details of the furlough scheme were finalised.ldquoAs we understand it, tens of thousands of hospitality workers and others have already lost their jobs, but Wetherspoon is retaining all its employees, using the government scheme for the purpose for which it is intended, said a spokesperson.ldquoWetherspoon chairman Tim Martin said to employees in a video that supermarkets were urgently looking for staff, since all trade from pubs, restaurants and cafes had transferred to supermarkets in the last few days.ldquoWetherspoon has had urgent calls from supermarkets asking for help in recruitment. Tesco alone urgently needs , staff, we understand. Tim Martin said in the video that staff who wanted to work for Tesco should do so and they will be given first priority when Wetherspoon pubs reopen.ldquoWetherspoon believes that the actions it has taken are responsible and sensible in the dficult circumstances.Mr Martin, who played a leading role in campaigning for Brexit and as the Citys most outspoken critic of the EU, had been hoping for forecast sales for the year to July  to rise to pound.billion, up from pound.billion.Post lockdown, the Mr Martins pub chain took the unusual step on May  of publishing corrections the business magazine Forbes had made to the stock exchange about its actions post-lockdown.In it it said that articles published online on March  and May  , made a number of what it called \"factually incorrect statements\" regarding the company.It said it was alleged that the company told the \"workforce that not only would they not be paid, but they can trot off to get a job in a supermarket\".The pub chain said: \"As regards pay, a company video, recorded on Sunday March  actually said, all our endeavours are going to be on trying to make sure that you get your money and that the pubs reopen.\"Wetherspoons published the transcript.The pub chain stated: \"An email, sent out with the video, said: All hourly paid employees will be paid as normal on Friday March  for all hours worked up to, and including, Sunday  March .\"Staff were paid on that Friday and have been paid on every Friday since.\"The statement in Forbes that staff were told they could trot off to get a job in a supermarket is misleading.\"The video actually said,  youre offered a job in a supermarket, many of you will want to do that. If you think its a good idea, do it...I promise you, well give you first preferenceyou want to come back.\"Forbes also said that the company announced that... pubs WILLopen sometime in June. That is also incorrect.\"In a stock exchange announcement on  April, Wetherspoon said, the companys current assumptions are that its pubs will remain closed until late June .\"The assumptions related to the modelling of two financial scenarios, for the benefit of investors, which necessitated an estimated opening date.\"The date was only an estimate and the company made clear that it would only open when permitted by the government.\"The video transcript published by Wetherspoons.Hi everyone, Im very sorry about the situation thats occurred with our pubs, theyve been shut, as you know, unprecedented in the last  years and it puts everyone in a terribly dficult position. I know youre all sitting there wondering what the hells happening. Over the weekend Ive had lots of phone calls with dferent people and were trying to sort it all out as best we can in this highly unusual situation.The good news is that the government has undertaken to underwrite peoples wages for an indefinite amount of time, which is great as we have no money coming in through the tills, which is not something that we ever planned for as you can appreciate. The governments promised to pay about % of wages, they will probably be pretty slow about paying it so there may be some delays, for which I also apologise, but I feel sure theyre going to come through on their promise.Our main aim and my main aim is to reopen. We employ over , people so its very important for them, just as important perhaps for the country is Wetherspoon, you, thanks to you, pays ,th of all taxes, so its very important to the country that we reopen. It might be weeks, it might be months, tremendous pressure on us all because of the uncertainty, apart from all the practical considerations, so all our endeavours are going to be on trying to make sure that you get your money and that the pubs reopen and I know that almost all of our trade now has gone to supermarkets, not only our trade but the trade from cafes, leisure centres, restaurants etc.Weve had lots of calls from supermarkets, Tesco alone want , people to join them, thats half the number of people who work in our pubs. If Im being honest I say you can get the furlough payments and stay at home,youre offered a job in a supermarket many of you will want to do that,you think its a good idea do it, I can completely understand it. If youve worked for us before I promise you, well give you first preferenceyou want to come back. We will obviously completely understand that you dont want to wait around for us to reopen.Deeply appreciate your work, Ive just so much enjoyed talking to you in my pub calls."},{"url":null,"title":"super-saturday-thousands-flock-pub-hairdressers-lockdown-restrictions-ease-england","story":"Business owners have taken a range of measures to comply with Government restrictions but the easing of lockdown measures has prompted concerns about a possible rise in coronavirus cases."},{"url":null,"title":"half-pubs-england-not-reopened-super-saturday---camra-chief","story":"Speaking after raising a pint of Marstonrsquos Pedigree to mark the end of Englandrsquos -day pub shutdown, Camrarsquos Nik Antona said many licensees had done a fantastic job to manage to reopen in the face of insufficient notice from the Government.After being greeted by Steve and Katy Boulter, who run the Royal Oak in Barton-under-Needwood in Staffordshire, Mr Antona said one-way systems, protective screens and other measures had made pubs safe.:Super Saturday Thousands flock to the pub and hairdressers as lockdown restrictions ease in EnglandHe said: ldquoI think itrsquos going to be dficult for pubs.ldquoThey are opening up under uncertain circumstances.

It has taken some time to reach this decision.#But as we all start to interact more, it’s vital that we take all reasonable steps to reduce risk and we know that face coverings can help reduce the risk of transmission indoors.#Also in shops, as on public transport, contact tracing is more dficult because we usually don’t know the people that we have been contact with. So a face covering provides an additional layer of protection. It is therefore for all of these reasons, that face coverings in shops will be compulsory from the end of next week.#But please do not wait until then — get into the habit now. This is an important way for all of us to help protect each other and to display that sense of solidarity that has helped the country so well over these past months.#From Friday, July , Children who are  years old or under will now be able to play normally with friends outdoors.Distancing should still be adhered to by children while indoors and there is no change to the guidelines for adults.Other rules will remain the same — you should continue to meet in groups of eight or less, and to meet no more than two other households at a time.For young people aged  to , the limit on the number of meetings you can have in any one day has been lted, meaning that dferent groups of friends can meet at dferent times of the day.However, meetings should still take place outdoors and should be no more than eight people — from no more than three households — at any one time.Ms Sturgeon also announced that the two-metre distancing requirement will be relaxed for some key sectors — with the appropriate mitigations in place.The government will work with those in the hospitality, retail and public transport sectors initially to agree the mitigations that will be required, which will allow sectors to operate a one-metre distance ruling.It is hoped that these exemptions for specic sectors could be agreed and in place by the time phase three comes round, potentially from Thursday, July .Mitigations could be improved ventilation, perspex screens, regulation of customer flow and seating plans that reduce transmission risk.However, Ms Sturgeon recognised that the guidance will be change between sectors.The First Minister said: #In my view, this represents a balanced and proportionate approach to what is a genuinely dficult issue. It allows businesses to cater for more customers — and we know that for some that will be the dference between staying in business or closing.#However, it also continues to minimise risk — which, for some iniduals, and with no exaggeration, could be the dference between le and death.#Obviously,infection levels were to rise again, we reserve the right to re-impose a strict two-metre rule, either nationally or locally, and to take other public health measures that are necessary to keep us safe.#Conversely, though,we continue to make progress, we may be able to consider a more general relaxation in later phases.#Outdoor hospitality, such as pavement cafes and beer gardens, can re-open from Monday, Ms Sturgeon confirmed, and although tourism will not open fully until July , self-contained holiday accommodation — for example holiday cottages, lodges or caravans with no shared facilities — can reopen from tomorrow.An additional five positive cases were confirmed yesterday, taking the total now to , in Scotland.One COVID- death was registered in Scotland in the past  hours, taking the total number of deaths, of people who have tested positive for COVID-, to ,.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After eating far too many patisseries, she enrolled at the Alain Ducasse cookery school to learn how to make macarons. She said: “They’re just so pretty. They’re so delicate. And they’re quite hard to make because there’s a lot that can go wrong.”Once Rachel ed to Edinburgh and noticed a gap in the market, she decided to set up her very own macaron business.She said: “I wanted to have that little bit of Paris with me. I focused on taste bud tourism, so when you eat these macarons you’re transported to the Champs-Élysées.” After nine months of trading from home and going to food markets, Rachel set up her first bricks-and-mortar store.She said: “It was in the centre of Edinburgh, it had a view of the castle. It was beautul.” vw, px\"  But since launching their online store in , and realising that they could send macarons across the country, plus the fact that they had large bookings from both wholesale and wedding customers, the bricks and mortar became unnecessary.The company, which employs eight people, lost all their wholesale customers overnight due to Coronavirus.Rachel said: “It was really scary. All the weddings, all the wholesale customers, and the bulk of our production disappeared. And then, of course, you have phone calls from people wanting to cancel future orders and refunds.“We entered the cash flow situation whereby the wholesale customers stopped paying the invoices. And we’ve now got over £, worth of overdue invoices.”But, it’s not all doom and gloom, as Mademoiselle Macaron has started to see an increase in online orders. It’s thanks to the UK Government’s furlough scheme that her business has kept afloat. Rachel said: “The furlough scheme has been a real leline in this time of crisis. I asked people to volunteer for furlough. So the people who wanted to and were happy to, they were the first ones to go. I cried.“I just felt like I was stuck in this moral quandary. Do we keep going and safeguard the business, so there’s a business for everyone to come back to  Or do I shut down because I can see that this is causing people severe anguish  We managed to recall stock that was sitting in hospitality clients freezers. That is the only reason we survived. What you make, you keep in the freezer and you use when you need to. It’s not like it’s a cupcake,we were perishable goods we would never have survived.”“We have a big kitchen so the space isn’t the issue. It’s more that we wanted to keep the team safe,” adds Rachel.Mademoiselle Macaron’s online sales have increased so much that they’re potentially in a position to hire more people on temporary contracts. Ideally, Rachel would like to help younger people and develop a training program with a college. “They’ve been so much more affected, and it’s just something close to my heart,” she said. vw, px\"  But when the Covid- pandemic struck, the managing director of Wales-based The Seren Collection required urgent assistance from the UK Government’s support schemes to pay his creditors and maintain supplier relationships.Mr Kedward and his we Zoe entered the hospitality industry almost by accident in .He said: “We just happened to come home to South Wales for the weekend and stumbled across The Grove. It was a calamitous trip with lots of wrong turns and family arguments, but we found the owner in, made our offer and that was that.“Our aspiration was much smaller than that, in fact we just wanted to convert the six outlying buildings into self catering units – now we’re a  bedroom hotel.”Neil and Zoe went on to open two restaurants in Saundersfoot and Oxwich on the back of the success of The Grove.Asthat weren’t enough to keep the team busy, he also spotted a gap in the tour operator market.Neil said: It struck me that there weren’t enough tour operators bringing people into the country. So we started a business called routescape, which had a hugely encouraging start, launching at World Travel Market before a big business development trip in . We had built up all our bookings for this financial year.“And then of course the whole project was wiped out by the virus. We lost every single booking. Not just for Routescape, but for The Grove too.”Neil added: “The loan from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme has allowed us to pay off all our creditors and we will be able to relaunch owing nobody any money.”When Covid- struck, one of Northern Ireland’s leading providers of tyres and automotive services, had just invested £.m in a new head office and distribution centre in Antrim and cash reserves were low.But thanks to their ability to adapt, ersy as well as the invaluable support from the UK Government, Kerr’s Tyres  Auto has been able play a vital role in servicing and keeping the province’s key workers on the road.Managing director Norman Kerr said: “The Antrim site used up our cash reserves and had a big impact on our cash flow.“Unfortunately the coronavirus kicked in three months later, when we still didn’t have a chance to build up any cash reserves that we would normally have. So it had a massive impact on ourselves.“But the problem was we had to continue trading because we supply the food sector and the white delivery van man.“So our business had to continue. We had to pay suppliers, we had no choice in it.”However thanks to a UK Government Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme loan of £, through the Ulster Bank, as well as the furlough scheme, the family-run business was able to remain solvent and save over  jobs.Norman said: “Had we not been able to get the UK Government loan scheme, it would have had a huge impact on our business. Our business, in essence, dropped probably  per cent within the first month.“Thankfully that has grown steadily back since then.”Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers.Details of the support available to businesses across the UK can be found at gov.uk coronavirus business-supportcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The GREAT Inspirations campaign will recognise companies that have gone above and beyond to continue to operate for their employees, serve their customers and contribute to their local communities. Here are some examples of the many thousands of companies that have proved to be an inspiration.Rooms and pamper packages for NHS workers away from their families, prepping more than  meals a week for vulnerable people in the community and projecting light shows every week for Clap for Carers are just some of the things one hotel team has done during the coronavirus outbreak.The team at the Queens Hotel in Southsea have been working hard since lockdown began in March to support everyone in the community across Portsmouth.Duty manager Megan Lockyer has been working with the small team who have welcomed more than  NHS workers to the hotel, which during the Second World War served as a hospital for recovering servicemen, for a place to rest away from their jobs.She said: “I watched the NHS workers come back to the hotel after a challenging day and I really wanted to let them know how much we appreciate what they are doing.“I came up with the idea of making hampers for the NHS workers who are currently with us at the hotel.“I shared my idea with the Facebook group and it was amazing how the community responded.“The NHS staff had told us how sore their hands were due to constant washing and we were able to include aloe vera hand cream along with items such as face masks, relaxing bath gels, slippers and Easter eggs.”Staff also worked with Medusa Hairdressing in Southsea to create more hampers which were distributed to key workers in local nursing homes.The hotel’s managing director Farid Yeganeh said: “I am delighted with the small team we have working at the hotel who have ensured it is clean and safe for our NHS guests.” vw, px\"  More than , meals have been sent out in lockdown to vulnerable people around the city thanks to a collaboration between the hotel, a collective of voluntary organisations called Portsmouth Hive, Portsmouth City Council, NHS Portsmouth CCG, the charity arm of Portsmouth Football Club called Pompey in the Community, as well as Anghel Niko Nedelcu, head chef from Portsmouth’s Brasserie Blanc and Royal Beach Hotel head chef Paul Playford. The initiative received two £, anonymous donations, as well as food donations from local businesses including butchers Buckwells. Farid said: “We got an email from the council at the start of lockdown about whether any businesses had any stock that was going out of date. It just snowballed from there really and we teamed up with the Hive to get meals distributed and it means so much that we could help our community.”Each week for Clap For Carers, projections showing support for the NHS were displayed on the Edwardian era hotel as part of the team’s commitment to supporting local health workers. Farid added: “I have always been aware that we have a really special team working at the hotel and this just underlines it. I look forward to being able to welcome back the whole Queens Hotel team once the lockdown is over.”When coronavirus started appearing in Inverness, care home manager Victoria Connolly was determined no one who worked or lived there would fall ill.So she asked the staff of the Isobel Fraser home in Invernessthey’d be prepared to live onsite and was thrilled when  said they would.But then came the problem of where to put them.The -year-old said: “There are a couple of rooms upstairs I could fit six people into. But then I thought, ‘Where am I going to put everyone  ’”“I have a friend with a campervan so I phoned her and askedwe could use it. She agreed but I needed more so she suggested I hire one.”Victoria got in touch with Highland Auto Campers whose owner Mark Jarratt, , immediately agreed to hire her three vehicles for cost.While they’d normally charge £ a night for their practically-new fleet, the care home got them for just £ each a week.Mark says: “We’ve only been going two years but earlier this year, things were going well – March was picking up and April and May were fully booked.“But we only get an eight-month window to make our money because of the tourist season so lockdown came at the worst time for us, the start of our season and was a complete disaster.“Then around April , we got a call from the Isobel Fraser home. Stories were, by then, beginning to emerge that some care homes had been really badly hit by coronavirus.“They said that while the home was free of coronavirus, they knew they needed to take steps to keep both staff and residents virus free and by providing accommodation for their staff on site.hey wanted to rent three of our vans to do this.“We were surprised to get the phone call – there are a lot of similar companies in the area – but quite pleased and we immediately agreed to assist in any way that we could. We just wanted to help.“It was also a win-win situation for us. The campervans hadn’t been used for a few weeks, they were just sitting quarantined and this was income – not a great deal of income but better than nothing.“Even though they hadn’t been used for weeks, and one was so new it had never been used, we gave them a thorough clean before driving them over and setting them up.“The staff and some of the residents were quite excited when we arrived and were looking out of the windows.”Six care home staff slept in the vans for between three and five weeks. Manager Victoria said: “They really enjoyed it – they were warm and comfortable. Most have said they’d take them out on holiday!”The care home, which has  residents, hasn’t had a single case of coronavirus. Mark said: “We were really proud to have been able to help. It’s good to do something for the community.”Newtownards-based company Shnuggle ersied into making PPE when the coronavirus pandemic hit the firm’s core business.Sinead and Adam Murphy were building the company into a leading name among parents with products such as an air bedside crib, air flow mattress, rocking stand, toddler baths, bath stands and many other creations.But the growth was interrupted when Covid- arrived in the UK, and the country went into lockdown.Although UK sales remained strong, imports were hit and Shnuggle’s owners turned their attention to designing and creating a face covering that would help save lives.Adam and Sinead quickly realised that they could help make a dference in the national effort to provide Personal Protective Equipment items. After taking measures needed to sustain the business, including taking advantage of UK Government furlough and business loan schemes, they set about creating and growing not-for-profit business Hero Shield.Adam said: “We had seen a few initiatives that had popped up all around the world.“A lot were printing D face shields so we kind of sat down with our head of design who was on furlough and said, ‘can we come up with a design here that we could start producing at rock bottom price and we’d prefer it to be a reusable one rather than a disposable one ’.“We came up with designs over the course of a weekend, by Monday we had done  dferent designs and D printed them on our prototyping printer and we’d put out a call on LinkedIn to local companies who wanted to get involved and within a very short space of time we had about  dferent businesses all saying, ‘Yep, we can do that bit and we’ll do it free of charge or we’ll do it at cost’.“We said that we weren’t doing it to make money. We were trying to help the NHS and other care workers so we founded another company which was Hero Shield Ltd and we set it up as not for profit so nobody could take any money out of it. Alongside that we did a crowdfunder to cover the costs so we raised £, in the end.“We managed to produce and ship out about , face shields in about six weeks.”Adam and Sinead are working to secure charitable status for Hero Shield Ltd, which is still running on a non-profit basis, and is now focussing more on charities and care services that don’t have the funds for whatever PPE they might need to get back up and running.Sinead said: “The businesses that were actually producing the face shields, we passed the orders to them and they have turned it into more of a commercial venture because we got a massive order from the NHS.“It was worth shy of £m and we needed to focus back on Shnuggles, so we passed it over to them and they pay a royalty into the Hero Shield charity for every one that they make.”So having helped the NHS in Northern Ireland, Adam and Sinead are now focused again on their core business – creating and marketing clever products for babies and children.Read about more inspiring GREAT stories at greatbritaincampaign inspirationscopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, ideas such as an offshore wind farm east of Shetland, and the creation of hydrogen from natural gas or electrolysis, are some of the ideas being suggested.Smaller scale community projects would also be developed through the hub project.Mr Irvine#s report to the council said the hub could generate pound billion of revenue for the region, remove carbon emissions by eight million tons, and create , jobs.He said the formative phase would look at which options are viable commercially and which were not.While the council has already committed pound, to the project, Mr Irvine said funding from the Scottish and UK governments as well as the Highlands and Islands Enterprise would be needed.He also said private sector investment was ldquocore to the project ndash and a steering group was working on that.Lerwick North councillor Stephen Leask had questioned how strong the council#s position # and how much financial risk it could face.Mr Irvine said most of the risk would be taken by the major investors from the energy industry, rather than the SIC.Martyn Tulloch, who leads the Net Zero Solution Centre, at OGTC, told the meeting that while other regions were advancing hub projects, with one in Humberside said to be the furthest advanced, he was not aware of any that had received Scottish government funding.#We have been approached by other regions but this is very much our sole focus at the moment,# he added.SIC leader Steven Coutts said the hub was a #crucial# project to Shetland#s future # and one that the council could not progress alone.He added it would need to bring #signicant community benefits# .#We want to see people thrive in Shetland with a strong and resilient community,# he added.Councillors agreed to progress the project into its #formative phase#, which will see the project team work with the energy industry and government agencies to identy next steps, including research projects and trials.Consultations will also take place with the community, businesses and other relevant interestsA funding application is expected to be submitted to the Scottish government next month...The SIC will make a decision later in the year about the outcome of the public holiday that traditionally follows the Lerwick Up-Helly-A# festival.Andrew Moorhouse, who had been missing since early Thursday morning, was traced safe and well on Friday evening.

DaoineThe study of areas like Staffin, Tiree and the Western Isles has been labelled as the most comprehensive social survey on the state of Gaelic communities ever conducted.The findings conclude that the language is in crisis, and that within remaining vernacular communities of Scotland the social use and transmission of Gaelic is at the point of collapse.Researchers from the University of the Highlands and Islands Language Sciences Institute and Soillse, a multi-institutional research collaboration which includes Sabhal Mòr Ostaig in Skye, outline the findings in a new book published todayThe authors of ‘The Gaelic Crisis in the Vernacular Community: A comprehensive sociolinguistic survey of Scottish Gaelic’ urge a radical new agenda and strategy for Gaelic revitalisation in the islands.They argue for the creation of a community development trust for Gaelic-speakers that is island based and under the direct control of the community.Professor Conchúr Ó Giollagáin, Professor of Gaelic Research at the University of the Highlands explained the motivation behind the new book.He said: “It is important that we are clear about the immense scale of the challenges involved in reversing the ongoing decline in the use of Gaelic in these areas.“Our statistical evidence indicates that the Gaelic vernacular community is comprised of around , people, of which a majority are in the  years and over age category.“The decline of the Gaelic community, as especially shown in the marginal practice of Gaelic in families and among teenagers, indicates that without a community-wide revival of Gaelic, the trend towards the loss of vernacular Gaelic will continue.“We found a mismatch between current Gaelic policies and the level of crisis among the speaker group which must be addressed to face the urgency of the language loss in the islands.“The primary focus of Gaelic policy should now be on relevant initiatives to avert the loss of vernacular Gaelic.”In order to make Gaelic policy viable, the researchers called for a re-aligning of national policy to address the decline in the use of Gaelic as a community language.Whilst some elements of national policy have had some success, such as the numbers of primary pupils in Gaelic Medium Education, without an overarching revitalisation approach, as outlined in their research, the authors believe the decline in the Gaelic vernacular community will rapidly continue.Iain Caimbeul, research fellow at the Language Sciences Institute in the University of the Highlands and Islands added: “If Scotland is to continue to give practical expression to its commitment to sustaining cultural ersity, it is vital that strategy for the Gaelic group is rooted in the broader context of community revitalisation.#We hope this research will be valuable to those interested in seeking to sht public policy assumptions from a sole dependence on the school system for creating the next generation of fluent Gaelic speakers.“It is vital that we change the basis for allocating resources to protect against further decline.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience

successful running of the ‘machinery’ of administration we all take for granted.Maybe I was naive to expect we’d all be on the same ‘side’, trying our collective best to maximise the opportunities for the people of these Western Isles.I guess too naive.Cue SNP leader, Councillor Gordon Murray’s latest dog-whistle, resulting from last week’s meeting of Comhairle nan Eilean Siar.For those who remain oblivious to the frequency at which Facebook Barbara Woodhouse wannabes broadcastMr Murray sometimes operates with an economy of factual accuracy which leaves those who are unprepared to dig # even just a little bit further in pursuit of the truth # salivating in the best Pavlovian traditions.There will never be a time, certainly not in the foreseeable future, when there will be ‘spare’ money floating around Sandwick Road.The halcyon days of having underspent budgets and of looking for projects on which to lavish ‘leftover’ cashare but a twinkle in old Convenors’ eyes.So any refurbishment of the council chambers, shamefully overlooked by at least the last five incumbent collaboratives, was always going to be moderately controversial.It certainly didn’t require a Molotov cocktail lobbed in its general direction, especially not one fuelled by completely unsubstantiated innuendo and inferences, designed to ignite ‘public’ opinion.An uncaring, out-of-touch majority of elected membershad decided to refurbish the council chambers in the middle of the Covid- crisis, ignoring the more pressing needs of the local economy.The comfort of our bums on seats was of greater signicance than the struggles of inidual businesses trying to survive a devastating economic downturn.Balderdash.The decision to refurbish the council chambers was about much more and, in any scheme of things, needed doing.That Councillor Murray knew it and had commissioned a report to explain it to him, was neither here nor there.He went with his simple narrative and the howling began.The decision was actually taken some  months ago and, despite some robust discussion, it was agreed that what was planned was necessary and overdue.The seating in the chamber was, after  years of wear and tear, burst at the seams.Its tangerine hue had now assumed a week old, orange peel in the sun, frayed facade.It stank a bit and was, even to my own initial impressions three years ago, a bit of a tawdry embarrassment.Especially so when it doubles as a civic reception arena for visitors of every gravitas and distinction.They say thatyour IT infrastructure is five years old, then it’s probably  years out of date.When you cannot, in today’s modern world, reliably communicate with your ‘satellite’ offices in Castlebay, Balivanich and Tarbert, far less those at Marybank, Cromwell Street and Creed Park then the chances of joining in with anyone further afield may be remote.When, in a hugely changed modern meeting landscape, everything is getting done on Zoom or Microsoft Teams, then you need to be able to do so efficiently, effectively and with stability.Of course, nobody could have predicted this  months ago which is why, retrospectively, we should be ‘selling’ the notion to the public as the excellent news it is. other offices will be upgraded to the same standard of communication technology.Nobody will have to rely, embarrassingly, on a decent mobile signal and having to ‘put you on speakerphone’ to continue a discussion when the smoke signals have failed.Sensible people understand this.People from Gordon’s own party understand this.The ones who inhabit the real world anyway and some have already commented.The fact that an improved connectivity infrastructure might just re-invigorate our democracy hasn’t been lost on the more astute.Going back to ‘how we’ve always done things’ should never be an option again, given this new, exciting opportunity.Of course, there’s much that can be achieved by face-to-face contact and the physical intimacy of ‘actual’ meetings are still important.But that landscape will be vastly altered by the new normal.Hopefully, this will mean that a whole raft of possibilities might open up.The current format for being a councillor makes it dficult for many people to commit to even considering the election process, far less the minimum time required to attend all the meetings.Maybe being able to do so from the comfort of their own homes, raising their ‘virtual hands’ on a large screen in the chambers when they wish to speak, might just persuade more people that it’s time for our elderly, male-dominated, ‘democracy’ to change Which might just make for an influx of fresh thinking and constructive debate.Opposition for opposing’s sake is still the stuff of the primary school classroom.When you know you can propose the most fancul notions without any fear that they’ll ever get beyond the debating arena, you can always tell an incredulous audience that, but for the bad guys in the Comhairle, you could also have had ‘jelly and ice-cream’ in your ‘land of milk and honey’. local members know that successive national government failures have taken away most of the cows and bees, so why the continued deflection from reality by our local group on CNES Because they require to have a purpose, albeit a mostly destructive one.It has generally been accepted that our council workers, officers and directorates have done a pretty decent job in the midst of what have been exceptionally trying circumstances.But when you talk ‘council’ up here, you generally mean the whole kit-kaboodle.You throw everyone under the same bus when # in order to get a massive negative reaction for your own political ends # you allude that the Comhairle are spending a large sum of money on new chairs.Four months of exemplary work down the drain so someone can appear as some sort of martyr.Quite shameful behaviour, and quickly seen through by even his own acolytes, many of whom had spoken passionately in favour of a refurbishment , before adding their names to a list of dissenters when the motion was rejected as incompetent.Incompetent because the procurement processhad already begun, and had been explained, in great detail, several months previously.What has been hugely fortunate these past few months is the resilience which the Comhairle has been able to demonstrate as a result of having ‘balances’ at hand to deal with emergency situations such as Covid-.Balances which, had they embarked on a spree of imprudence as appealed for by the SNP group when budget setting was being undertaken, would have disappeared into the ether.Combine with their insistence on asking for meaningless, time-consuming report after report in an effort to undermine what’s already been decided and the wasted saved money could have us all bedecked in ermine.When you insist on portraying yourself as Roy Rogers in a white hat, consistently battling against the bad guysmaybe it’s time that you listened to Tonto.Hopefully, someone close will volunteer to be that side-kick, and soon, eh kemo-sabe Gordon is essentially a decent guy, but in his aspirations to undermine the credibility of his fellow councillors he undermines the hard work of every single council employee and misses his target spectacularly.The disconnect between the success of his party at national, and at local government level, may be partly down to perception.A degree of maturity, purposeful intent, willingness to participate and collaborate to be serious about their proposals, would go a long way.I like to think of myself as a reasonable fellow and, as I’ve previously stated, I will support any sensible suggestions, no matter their origin.Three years later, Gordon I’m still waiting.And it’s not due to any political or philosophical opposition.When it

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

He said: “Robin is a remarkable man who runs a successful business as well as sitting on Council and taking an active role in several organisations across the Province. EXPERTISE“Robin has given up his time willingly to do whatever he could to ensure Chamber supported our local businesses.“ I am glad to say that Robin will remain as a Management Committee member and that Eugene, Leigh and the rest of the Management Committee will continue to have the benefit of Robin’s knowledge and expertise and of course his array of jokes which always help cheer up the most dficult of meetings.” Tom noted that both Eugene and Leigh have been members of the Management Committee for some time and have already shown that they are eager to do whatever they can to sustain and promote business in the local area. “I am looking forward to working with our new officials and cannot wait for normality towhen we can hold our AGM in safety and be able to meet our members in person.“ In the meantime I hope everyone stays safe and wish all our businesses good fortune as they begin to re-open and get back to some type of normality.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3210337.jpg--.jpg?1593777214000\n","title":"shop local and shop safe is message to customers as town re opens","story":"Mid and East Antrim Mayor, Cllr Peter Johnston, is calling on shoppers to show their support for local retailers as they join in the  Retail NI Independents’ Day on  JulyBallymena’s retail centre is gradually starting to look busier with more people willing to venture ‘downtown’ for a taste of the new normality.To be honest, it’s not perfect at the moment with queues for shops and toilet facilities causing frustration but as protocols hopefully change and the COVID threat recedes there will be a real need to back local stores and bsuinesses.And to help that cause, Council is branding Independents Day UK as a chance for local people e to show support for the independent retailers they value most in the local community.Independent business owners account for around % of the approximately , retail outlets in the UK.ies.The Mayor hopes shoppers will give their backing to the campaign and support retailers now and throughout the year.He said: “Mid and East Antrim is open for business, and I hope our community will show their support for our smaller, independent retailers as we continue to move out of the lockdown restrictions.Many of our businesses have been there to support us when we needed them.

From this date passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations. There will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of . Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  googletag.cmd.push The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said:“As we move throughthe Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety ofpassengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. googletag.cmd.push “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued:“We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is alsoimportant that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe. You have been the leaders in Northern Ireland fighting Covid- and I am asking you to keep it up and we will beat this together. “By acting together and thinking of each other we can reduce the risk of transmission.” Further information is available on nidirect at:https:www.nidirect.gov.uk  coronavirus-safer-travel- guidanceandhttps:www.nidirect.gov.uk  face-coverings  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Commission revealed that it received a late notication from The Glendermott Valley Flute Band. It will march in the Waterside area of the city on the Tullyally Road and Ardmore Road on July . The Pride of Orange and Blue Flute Band from Newbuildings will also march with  members registered. Other bands from Coleraine and Limavady have also applied to march. It is anticipated that more could follow in the coming days. The Twelfth is the annual Protestant celebration held every year on July . googletag.cmd.push However, it is being celebrated on July  this year because the twelfth falls on a Sunday. It dates back to a  when the last British Catholic monarch King James II was defeated by Protestant King William, formerly Prince of Orange in Holland, at the Battle of the Boyne. Each year, members of the Orange Order - named after the victorious king and founded in  - carry banners and flags in parades acrossNorthern Irelandaccompanied by marching bands. The Orange Order cancelled events in April due to the Coronavirus pandemic and asked bands not to parade this year. Harold Henning, Deputy Grand Master, said: This year will be a dferent Twelfthbut just because our parades and gatherings are cancelled, does not mean that we cannot celebrate King William’s momentous victory.Quite the opposite, our challenge is to ensure this Twelfth is marked in style online, in your home, at your door, with families and neighbours. Together we can make it a fun-filled, extra-special - socially distanced th - that will be talked about for years. googletag.cmd.push He added: So begin by planning to suitably decorate your home, street, village or town - fly the flag, proudly and respectfully. Encourage children and grandchildren to watchour craft videos and create Orange Liliesand buntingor brush up your history by reading about William’s Generals. However, during our celebrations let us be mindful that the priority in  is to look after everyone’s health this Twelfth as we continue the battle against Coronavirus.Please ensure you comply with the lockdown regulations in existence over the period. But the Parades Commission has now received around  applications for marches to celebrate the Twelfth. The sudden influx has been attributed to the easing of restrictions on outdoor gatherings whereby up to  people are able to gather outdoors, provided social distancing can be observed. Among the areas where applications have been made are Belfast, Ballymena, Newtownards and Enniskillen. SOLDIER F BAND At this stage no applications have been submitted for the annual ‘Relief of Londonderry parade’ which traditionally takes place on the second Saturday of August. On August  last year there was controversy in the city when a loyalist band wore parachute regiment insignia accompanied by a soldier F symbol. It was deemed to be an intentional act aimed at inciting the nationalist community in the city. The ex-paratrooper known as soldier F is being prosecuted for the murders of James Wray, , and William McKinney, . He is also facing four attempted murder charges, plus an additional support count in respect of the attempted murder of a person or persons unknown.

Since the first official announcement of the post-graduate facility in  , a catalogue of failures has been allowed by the university and decision-makers within government. Impediments almost too numerous to list have acted to frustrate,not block, delivery of what is agreed is a much-needed facility. googletag.cmd.push The responsibility and willingness to bow to problems readily rather than resolve them lies at many doors, not least: politicians, internal university committees, government committees, health officials, Stormont officials, UU officials, other universities, and the Northern Ireland Civil Service. Is there an underlying and more pernicious problem that has its roots in decision-making by UU that is seen to favour other places over Derry  Why are our public representatives facilitating this  Since its establishment in Coleraine by the Stormont government in the s, the university has been allowed, and encouraged, to run an unfettered and unchallenged agenda, whereby major development decided upon by university authorities, based in Belfast, has been centred on Coleraine, Jordanstown and, more recently, North Belfast. googletag.cmd.push The post-GFA era has seen little change and, effectively, Belfast and Stormont, acting as a city-state, exercise a veto on every major development in Derry or the North West. This is the continuation of an unfortunate and deliberate policy which we thought had been consigned to a troubled past. Derry has been patiently lobbying for proper and deserved university provision for the region for  years. It is the last remaining grievance of the Civil Rights era, and the failure to provide a modern university in the North West sustains the injustice practiced by the Unionist government, now long gone, of the time. For almost  years, Direct Rule and devolved governments at Stormont and UU have favoured other localised priorities and broken promises to Derry. In , under the Ilex One Plan, UU and government gave a commitment to have , full-time students at Magee by . The actual number – under , – didn’t change at all over the decade. Most recently, a commitment, endorsed by Dublin and Westminster, to have , students at Magee by  was made in January as part of ‘New Decade New Approach’. Just weeks later, Stormont handed a poundm off-the-books bailout to UU for its well over-budget North Belfast campus, while simultaneously putting a freeze on Derry development. The city and the region are either the collateral damage of flawed strategic planning or dismissive indference to any regional equality and provision. It has to be one or the other and when you dismiss a region, you dismiss the people who live there. Given the inequitable outcomes flowing from policy-making pursued by a university with government money for almost  years now, it would, in a normal society, merit a full public inquiry. Local representatives and most worryingly, nationalist politicians, who would have traditionally questioned the policy, are failing to alter what is undeniably UU’s ‘Belfast-first’ agenda - to the huge detriment of northwest Ireland which has still, by far, the lowest Higher Education provision on these islands. Derry University Group figures recently put the HE uptake in Derry at fty percent lower than the next lowest in Ireland. The medical school,and when it arrives, is barely a fig leaf to cover UU’s embarrassment, and Stormont’s shame, at how they have treated Derry. It will house just  students – and the capital costs will be financed not by the university, nor central government, nor Stormont, but by the city-region itself from its City Deal package. Despite having failed utterly, and consistently, in its responsibilities to this region, UU stands to become the biggest single beneficiary of the City Deal. Stormont will not, however, underwrite the on-going running costs of the new Derry facility, on the grounds that UU – having spent all its money, and much more besides, in Belfast - is now for all intents and purposes, insolvent. In recent years, following lobbying by the Derry University Group and others, the Dublin government has stated that it is prepared to help lead university development in Derry and northwest Ireland – a promise, indeed, that is reinforced in its new Programme for Government. It is time to make good on that promise. Representative democracy and investment cannot be the trickle-down preserve of just one geographical area or one demographic community. Such presents as unbalanced economic, educational, social and cultural polarisation. It is a poor and failed model for regeneration especially now, given the possible economic and social repercussions of Covid-. The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, a constituent college of the National University, is ideally placed to develop and deliver a medical school in the North West, and can do so rapidly. RCSI currently runs two medical school campuses in Malaysia and another in Bahrain. A new cross-border facility in the North West, operated by RCSI and overseen by the Irish and British governments directly as part of the North-South institutions, would short circuit the bureaucratic and financial logjams at Stormont and UU. It would also provide a starting blueprint for a new, autonomous cross-border university for Derry and Donegal, which ultimately is the only viable solution to the HE crisis here. It is time to put the North West first and allow us to develop our higher education sector independently, away from the grip of centralised decision-makers.

Kelly, who has coached Derry to back to back Celtic Challenge titles and a Nicky Rackard Cup success, feels the main problem with the Ulster championship is the window of opportunity to get it played. In  and , the Ulster championship was played off in two groups. Derry were relegated in  when they conceded the relegation play-off to Down, after defeat to Antrim in the Ulster semi-final. It also followed a winless Division A league and Christy Ring campaign. googletag.cmd.push Donegal were promoted for winning the shield. Derry were the shield winners in , when the competition was played between the league and the Oakleafers successful Nicky Rackard winning campaign. The decision to shelve the Ulster championship completely was taken early in . Ulster official Oliver Galligan conveyed the message to the Antrim and Down teams at the Conor McGurk final. “The restructuring of the national competitions aims to provide a high number of games for Ulster counties at their own level while the apathy towards the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship in recent times has been obvious,” Ulster Secretary Brian McAvoy later told delegates at the Ulster convention at the time. googletag.cmd.push “Therefore, with a heavy heart, the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship has been discontinued for a three year period .” Kelly outlined four options available to the deployment of the Ulster senior hurling championship. The first one was to play it after the league and before the Christy Ring Cup and other tiered championships. Kelly pointed to the need for counties to vote on moving thechampionships back to allow time. The majority of the counties hail from Leinster and Connacht, who would have to restructure their club scene accordingly, to accommodate the Ulster counties. With the hurling league finishing before the football league and with dual players almost defunct, the Ulster championship would need to fit around the club window “That one is the best option,” Kelly points out about slotting the Ulster championship into mid-season. “Thats the gold star one. The next one would be to play it after the Christy Ring is played. We have tried that and it didnt work,” he added, referring to the  season. “Option C is to play it before the National League, which means the Conor McGurk Cup would become the Ulster championship. You could have the Liam Harvey Cup and the Conor McGurk Cup could become the shield of that competition. Thats not degrading it, it is just saying there is an option.” Kellys fourth option would be not to have the Ulster championship, with the current schedule providing enough games and there is no window to play it. “To me, they are the four options and I dont see anything ,” he concluded.

As more and more companies continue to get back to work, we look at how the financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. CASE STUDY KERR’S TYRES  AUTO When Covid- struck, one of Northern Ireland’s leading providers of tyres and automotive services, had just invested pound.m in a new head office and distribution centre in Antrim and cash reserves were low. googletag.cmd.push But thanks to their ability to adapt, ersy as well as the invaluable support from the UK Government, Kerr’s Tyres  Auto has been able play a vital role in servicing and keeping the province’s key workers on the road. Managing director Norman Kerr said: “The Antrim site used up our cash reserves and had a big impact on our cash flow. “Unfortunately the coronavirus kicked in three months later, when we still didn’t have a chance to build up any cash reserves that we would normally have. So it had a massive impact on ourselves. “But the problem was we had to continue trading because we supply the food sector and the white delivery van man. So our business had to continue. We had to pay suppliers, we had no choice in it.” googletag.cmd.push However thanks to a UK Government Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme loan of pound, through the Ulster Bank, as well as the furlough scheme, the family-run business was able to remain solvent and save over  jobs. Norman said: “Had we not been able to get the UK Government loan scheme, it would have had a huge impact on our business. Our business, in essence, dropped probably  per cent within the first month. Thankfully that has grown steadily back since then.  ON THE RIGHT ROAD: Norman Kerr, of Kerr’s Tyres  Auto “We also had to furlough  per cent of our staff in month one. As business picked up again and things moved forward, by month two we were probably down to  per cent. “Month three was  per cent working and we hope within the coming weeks we will have nobody left on furlough. But againit wasn’t for furlough, this would have also had a huge impact on cash flow. “Honestly, when you have  staff, it’s a big bill at the end of every month. We would have had no option but to have laid off around  staff and there was nothing we could have done about that. “So the schemes that the UK Government has introduced have been very helpful.” With  branches, including four in the Republic and seven in Northern Ireland, plus a workforce of over , the UK Government schemes also gave Norman and his team the freedom to ersy and keep some of the leading supermarkets and delivery firms up and running. He said: “We had to ersy dramatically in our business. Collection and delivery rather than customers coming to us. “We had to operate a night sht. So we put four breakdown fitters on our night sht rota. That was to cover the likes of Tesco, Asda and the white van man. “The delivery men have been working   because everything is getting delivered at home. So we found the need to have to serve them on a night sht rota.” With over  years business experience, Kerr’s also adapted to ensure Government guidelines were adhered to. Norman said: “Because we did ersication and received the UK Government help we were able to continue to do business and can look forward to the future.” ‘A real letime in this time of crisis’ CASE STUDY MADEMOISELLE MACARON Rachel Hanretty, of Mademoiselle Macaron, fell in love with macarons while living in Paris. Once Rachel ed to Edinburgh and noticed a gap in the market, she decided to set up her very own macaron business. After nine months of trading from home and going to food markets, Rachel set up her first bricks-and-mortar store. She said: “It was in the centre of Edinburgh, it had a view of the castle. It was beautul.” But since launching their online store in , and realising that they could send macarons across the country, plus the fact that they had large bookings from both wholesale and wedding customers, the bricks and mortar became unnecessary. The company, which employs eight people, lost all their wholesale customers overnight due to Coronavirus. Rachel said: “It was really scary. All the weddings, all the wholesale customers, and the bulk of our production disappeared. And then, of course, you have phone calls from people wanting to cancel future orders and refunds.  TASTY TREATS: Rachel Hanretty, below, has used the furlough scheme to keep Mademoiselle Macaron going  “We entered the cash flow situation whereby the wholesale customers stopped paying the invoices. And we’ve now got over pound, worth of overdue invoices.” But, it’s not all doom and gloom, as Mademoiselle Macaron has started to see an increase in online orders. It’s thanks to the UK Government’s furlough scheme that her business has kept afloat. Rachel said: “The furlough scheme has been a real leline in this time of crisis. I asked people to volunteer for furlough. So the people who wanted to and were happy to, they were the first ones to go.”   ‘We paid creditors and maintained relationships’ CASE STUDY THE SEREN COLLECTION With plans for a new spa at his five-star hotel, a Michelin-star chef in his restaurant and the launch of a tour operator business underway, Neil Kedward was looking forward to a good year in . But when the Covid- pandemic struck, the managing director of Wales-based The Seren Collection required urgent assistance from the UK Government’s support schemes to pay his creditors and maintain supplier relationships. Mr Kedward and his we Zoe entered the hospitality industry almost by accident in . He said: “We just happened to come home to South Wales for the weekend and stumbled across The Grove. It was a calamitous trip with lots of wrong turns and family arguments, but we found the owner in, made our offer and that was that.”  FINANCIAL AID: Neil Kedward, of The Seren Collection Neil and Zoe went on to open two restaurants in Saundersfoot and Oxwich on the back of the success of The Grove. Asthat weren’t enough to keep the team busy, he also spotted a gap in the tour operator market. Neil said: “ It struck me that there weren’t enough tour operators bringing people into the country. So we started a business called routescape, which had a hugely encouraging start, launching at World Travel Market before a big business development trip in . And then, of course, the whole project was wiped out by the virus. We lost every single booking. “The loan from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme has allowed us to pay off all our creditors and we will be able to relaunch owing nobody any money.” Help available to companies and workers Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

Despite not yet being built, the futuristic eco-house, which is called The Qube, has gone up for sale in the Prehen area of the Waterside with a price tag of pound,. The five-bedroom property called The Qube will be built on land beside the Everglades Hotel. It has been advertised as one of Northern Irelands only passive houses, which means it will use very little energy and leave a small ecological footprint. The three-story dwelling will also be a smart home and the lights, heating and blinds can all be operated from a tablet or smartphone. googletag.cmd.push  The , sq ft building will be locatedon a triangular piece of landat the junction of Prehen Road andHazelwood Avenue. This heavily-wooded area is home to a number of mature trees which arecovered by a Tree Preservation Order . Although work on the property is yet to begin, it has full planning permission. However, the journey to obtaining this was not a smooth one. In Northeern Ireland, local councils are responsible for most planning decisions. Each council has planning officers who make recommendations about planning applications. However, the Planning Committee, which is made up of councillors, has the option to reject these recommendations. googletag.cmd.push The planning application for The Qube first came before Derry City and Strabane District Councils Planning Committee last September. Council planners provided councillors with a detailed report which recommended that planning permission be refused for the building.  The meeting was also told that  letters of objection had been sent by local residents. Among their concerns werethe destructionof ancient woodland and mature trees and the suggestion that the buildingis out of character and proportion with theexisting neighbouring properties. The report said thatthe building went ahead it would have adversely affected thecharacterandenvironmental quality of theof thesurrounding area through the loss of an important and well establishedurban woodland greenspace. Councillors agreed to defer the decision for a site visit, which took place on September  last year and which was attended by seven councillors. On September , the Planning Committee voted not toaccept the recommendation to refuse the planning application and agreed to reconsider itfurther information on the Tree Protection Order was provided. The council sent out additional notications to all neighbours, objectors and supporters ofthe scheme in January this year and  more letters were received, with six in objection to the application and  in support. The letters in support said the site was an eyesore and the owner of the proposed building would have a vested interest in maintaining it. On March  this year, the Planning Committee met again and was told council planners had not changed their position that planning permission should be refused. The Principal Planning Officer told elected members an Arboriculture Impact Assessment had been carried out which broadly agreed with the initial recommendation that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the proposed scheme would not have a detrimental impact on the Tree Preservation Ordersite. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock, who attended the site visit, told the meeting she did not believe the protected trees would be affected by the proposed building. She proposed to overturn the decision of the planning officer and for approval to be granted subject to conditions provided by planners. The proposal was seconded by SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins and was passed after seven votes for, three against and three abstentions. On Friday, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council confirmed that that an application for the Prehen building came before the Planning Committee in September  with a recommendation to refuse as it would result in the loss of a valuable urban woodland green space and the applicant had failed to demonstrate that this dwelling would not have an adverse impact on existing trees. The recommendation was not accepted by elected members and the application came back before the committee on March of this year as a reconsidered application, following a visit to the site by elected members and the submission of further information, said the spokesperson. Whilst the officers presented an unaltered opinion to refuse, elected members voted to approved the application.” The sale of The Qube, which was designed by architect Gerard McPeake, is being handled by McGuinness Fleck Estate Agents   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The championship was put on hold for three seasons, at the start of the  season. Derry won back to back titles in  and , but have not contested a final since the the  final at Owenbeg. Goals from Ruairi Convery and Paddy McCloskey had Derry well in the hunt. Convery, who scored -, levelled the game before Daniel McKernans winner. Antrim have won the last  in succession, with Down not lting the title since . Armagh reached the final in  and , losing to the Saffrons, before the competition was paused for three years, given the new tiered All-Ireland structure which has saw Derry play at Nicky Rackard and Christy Ring level. googletag.cmd.push The  season was the final year of the experiment with the Ulster hurling championship.  The County Derry Post contacted Ulster GAA for clarication of the future of the competition andthere were any further developments. “No decision has yet been taken on this matter. Its a matter for CCCC and Coiste Bainisti and we dont have any detail as to when it will be discussed,” read a statement from Ulster GAA PRO Declan Woods. In a special feature this week, we get the thoughts from Derry, Antrim and Down on the Ulster championship and where it could fit into the calendar. googletag.cmd.push “A provincial championship is a provincial championship. I think there could be a window for it before the Christy Ring,” felt Derry senior manager John McEvoy. Kevin Kelly, a former Derry selector, is on the Ulster Hurling Development committee feels there are four options available, but the best option would be after the league. Antrim captain Conor McCann said the Saffrons would welcome it back, but there needed to be the reward of an automatic spot in the All-Ireland series for the winner. Down boss Ronan Sheehan hit out at the Ulster Council for not having a championship in place.“I make no bones about this, I think the Ulster Council are reneging on their responsibilities by failing to have an Ulsterchampionship,” he said.

Ciaraacuten McShane died last Monday as a result of a road collision on a stretch of the M motorway in County Louth. On Sunday, mourners at the Church of St John the Baptist heard how the -year-old father-of-two had been working to establish a family home for what he called his ‘wee unit’. Fr Charles Kearney told those gathered for his funeral that the former Crossroads PS and St Paul’s pupil had a great sense of humour. googletag.cmd.push “The fourth and youngest of his family, he turned out to be great craic, very quick-witted,” he said. “He had many, many friends. He was a good son and brother. When he began to go out and about, he ended up in Maghera, in Walsh’s Hotel, where he met the love of his le. “They were together for eleven years, and six, of course, as man and we. They have two beautul children, Conan and Carina.” The congregation heard how Ciaraacuten, a plumber by trade, lived for a Sunday, which he designated as a day to be spent with his young family. googletag.cmd.push “Another important thing for Ciaraacuten was a Sunday,” said Fr Kearney. “Sunday was his family day and he played with the children. They watched movies and had great fun together. He adored them and they adored him. “He had built his own house and was working to establish a good family home for his ‘wee unit’. He was a real family man and he is going to miss so many firsts. “One was coming up very soon, when Conan starts school just across the road in September. In his short le, Ciaraacuten McShane brought so much love, joy and goodness to people. “He most certainly will be rewarded for all of that.” Local Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councillor, Sean Bateson, described Ciaraacuten as a ‘proper gentleman, one of the good guys in le’. Pearse’s GAC, Kilrea, where Ciaraacuten played football in his younger days, said they were ‘deeply saddened’ by his passing. “Ciaran played underage with the club and then came back to kit out for the reserves on many occasions. “One thing that everyone will tell you about Ciaran was that he always had a big smile on his face and his sense of humour was infectious.” Ciaraacuten will be sadly missed by his we Shauna, their children Conan and Carina, his parents Bertie and Patricia and siblings Siobhaacuten, Damian and Odraacuten and all his wider family and friends. Fr Kearney summed things up by telling mourners to look back on all Ciaraacuten achieved. “Sometimes bad things happen accidentally, and we know that’s part of le, but it’s devastating when it happens. “We should look back at his years among you and see what he achieved, and it was much.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The supermarket giant wants to build a new store in the Buncrana Road area of the city. The company first applied for planning permission for the proposed store on a vacant site at the junction of Buncrana Road and Springtown Roadin .  The Derry News has learned that planners at Derry City and Strabane District Council have recommended that planning permission be granted for the store. The final approval for the development now rests with councillors on the council’s planning committee. If the new supermarket gets the green light from local councillors, Lidl says it will close its current store at Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push However, the company would retain its current building for storage purposes. In its planning submissions, Lidl said that they wanted to build a new larger store in Derry because of the lack of expansion space at its present store. The proposed new store would have much more parking facilities. The entrance to the new store would be via the Springtown Road which would reduce the traffic pressure on the busy Buncrana Road. Traffic entering and leaving Lidl’s current store creates a frequent bottleneck on the Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Marie Lindsay is to step down as principal of St Marys College. Among those to pay tribute to her work was a spokesperson for St Eugenes Cathedral. A parish spokesperson said Mrs Lindsay had a great impact on the lives of students and staff through her leadership in St Marys College. She has also directly advanced the mission of evangelisation of the Church here in the Diocese of Derry. As an educator and leader, Marie has made an exceptional contribution to Catholic education here in the City and beyond. Marie, on behalf of everyone in the St Eugenes Parish we wish you very well in your retirement, the spokesperson added. googletag.cmd.push Mrs Lindsay joined St Marys in  and taught science for  years before being appointed principal in . During her time as principal, St Marys were involved in the first formal Shared Education Programme with Lisneal College. In , the school was awarded Specialist Status in Science and continues to promote STEM subjects and career paths. In , Mrs Lindsay was named Principal of the Year at the Foyle Blackboard Awards and in April  she was inducted into the Business Excellence Hall of Fame. Derrys Mayor Brian Tierney said Mrs Lindsay had done so much for education within the city. googletag.cmd.push Its with great pleasure that I offer my congratulations to Marie on her retirement, and with great admiration that I look back on everything that she has achieved both as teacher and, later, as a principal at St Marys College. Marie perfectly captured everything that teaching is about as she went above and beyond every day to put the needs of her students first. She was incredibly active within the community, including on our Council Education and Skills working group, to ensure that those not just within her own school, but across the district also,were receiving the best education they could. With two of her daughters recently welcoming a set of twins each Im sure she will certainly be kept very busy, and I look forward to welcoming Marie, her husband Collie and her family to the Mayors Parlour to celebrate her career when the guidelines allow it. I wish Marie a healthy and happy retirement, and offer my sincere thanks to her for everything she has done for theeducation sectorin our district.

The call comes as bars and restaurants who can provide food on site prepare to open from tomorrow. Among the bars who have grouped together is The Dugout Bar in Maghera, and manager Una McReynolds says those making the rules are out of touch with reality. “The reason we can’t open is because we’ve been told we’re too dangerous,” she told Derry Now. “I would say % of the people making these decisions have never been in a local pub. They’re seeing what goes on in the Cathedral Quarter on a busy Saturday night, but that’s not real le. googletag.cmd.push “If we get four people through the door on a weekday, it’s like Christmas to us, we think it’s great. Even at weekends, we probably still wouldn’t be shoulder to shoulder. “Our customers can’t understand why we aren’t open. People don’t read into the specics of it, so everybody just thinks that all the bars can open tomorrow.” The online petition was launched by the owner of McKenna’s Bar in Armagh and has found support in many quarters, with pubs in Newry and Ballymena voicing support along with The Dugout. With the bigger establishments in a position to open their doors, Una feels the regulations show the inequality and discrimination at play. googletag.cmd.push “Hospitality is hospitality. It’s like saying the barbers can open but the hairdressers can’t, because women sit in the hairdressers longer than a man sits in the barbers,” she said. “We’re completely left alone. There is discrimination and inequality. Local pubs are never going to be able to survivethis continues. “All the big establishments are now allowed m social distancing, we’re not even allowed m. We can’t open our doors at all. “Who’s going to fight for us  I sent a message to a junior minster last week, but he couldn’t answer any of my questions. All he could say was ‘scientic evidence’. “Well, show us the scientic evidence that says sitting at a table, eating a burger and having a glass of wine is okay, but sitting at the same table just drinking a glass of wine is not.” The pressure has been exacerbated by dferences between the ious jurisdictions, and the recent political crisis sparked by Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neills presence at the funeral of veteran republican, Bobby Storey. “Now Sky TV are pushing the small bars to give them an update by July , when they’re going to reinstate charges,” said Una. “They just see that in the UK, the bars are open again. England are open on Saturday, Scotland have a date, the south have a date and the north of Ireland have nothing. “We now are in the situation where those in power have decided to throw their toys out of the pram over the weekend. “We’re in the middle of a pandemic, everyone waits to hear about a date and now they won’t even give press briefings. “Small pubs are the hub of the community. Some people would love to go out and have a pint, but they can’t afford to have a meal with their pint. “We have no one to turn to, because no one is responding. We’ve been left high and dry, nobody is making a decision for us and we are extremely frustrated.” The petition can be viewed here.

In an anonymous poll conducted by the County Derry Post, with  responses,  of John McEvoys squad indicated they would play for Team Ulster, yet only eight of the squad would see it as a benefit to hurling in the county. As part of the survey comments were sought. One said it was a good idea but it wouldnt be easily organised. All the rest spoke out against it, citing a range of reasons. googletag.cmd.push The combined Ulster team wouldnt compete with Top  teams for the McCarthy Cup, hence it would be a waste of time and resources should be used to get the Ulster championship resurrected. Another respondent pointed to Derrys ability to compete in the Joe McDonagh Cupall the best players in Derry were playing. With more publicity, the current tiered structure was the better solution. Team Ulster would paper over the cracks was another comment, with the already considerable training load also offered as a reason to oppose the concept. On the topic of bringing back the Ulster senior hurling championship,  players indicated it should be ed after its three-year absence. googletag.cmd.push One respondent, who commented at , felt Team Ulster was nice to chat about but would only serve players who felt they needed to be playing in the Liam McCarthy Cup. Full commitment to the Derry jersey, from all the best players, full backing from the county board and supporters, was the way forward, something he felt was happening. Of the squad,  felt it should be played after the league and before the tiered hurling championships, such as the Christy Ring and Joe McDonagh Cups. The remainder opted for a window in pre-season, before the leagues. One respondent felt that Antrim would be so far away from the rest of the pack, but a combined rest of Ulster team playing the Saffrons would diminish the competition.

July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Ambitious cafe plans for to boost Comber centre  ","story":"PLANS for an exciting new lsquocafe culturersquo in Comber have been unveiled.A meeting to discuss the way forward was held in the town on Monday morning, with Ards and North Down Council officials joined by Chamber of Commerce representatives and local councillor Deborah Girvan.Work has been ongoing to develop a strategy on the way forward for Comber as coronavirus lockdown measures continue to ease, with more and more businesses reopening after being closed for four months.News of Mondayrsquos meeting comes ahead of the reopening of the hugely popular Comber Farmersrsquo Market tomorrow which also coincides with its sixth anniversary.A special cake will be cut by council chairman Trevor Cummings who will be joined by Northern Ireland Officer Minister of State Robin Walker.The market has been closed for the past three months as a result of Covid- with its reopening viewed as a boost for existing traders who will benefit from the increased footfall.Alderman Girvan mdash who arranged Mondayrsquos meeting in conjunction with Comber Chamber of Commerce mdash said cafes, restaurants and pubs have been among the hardest hit industries during the coronavirus pandemic.And with the hospitality businesses able to open their doors to the public this Friday, she thought that it would be beneficial to meet with the council to see what support it give to catering businesses to allow food to be served outdoors on pavements.ldquoEven though the two-metre social distancing rule will be halved, it will still be dficult for hospitality businesses to increase their capacity unless they expand outdoors, said Mrs Girvan.ldquoComber is the perfect place to introduce a cafeacute culture as there are wide footpaths on three sides of the town square and,permission for this is granted, it will create a kaleidoscope of colourful tables, chairs and umbrella shades.Mrs Girvan hopes that it will also attract more shoppers, cyclists and visitors to Comber as it slowly emerges out of lockdown.She also recognises that before anything happens, there are many issues to consider and for consultation with residents and businesses, describing Mondayrsquos meeting as a ldquofirst step to explore the opportunities and possibilities of reconfiguring footpaths to ensure the safety of visitors, shoppers, and cyclists.News of the cafe culture plan comes just days after the local council agreed to help hospitality businesses back on their feet by waiving the pound fee for a so-called pavement cafeacute licence fee, initially for nine months.Comber Chamber of Commerce chairwoman Laura Bradley, who is also director of the Indie Fude delicatessen, described the past few as

There are over , megaliths in Europe alone but the one outside Killyleagh is quite possibly the most recent of them all.It was erected in  with one thousand young people raising the so-called Strangford Stone using only their bare hands and a lot of scientic know-how.Joe speaks to the people involved in the original design and installation of the stone which was a feat in civil, mechanical and electrical engineering.Safety was a massive consideration, given that , young people were to be on site pulling the stone upright by hand into position.It is certainly a very special monument, not only because itrsquos a Millennium Stone, but also because of the remarkable way in which it was erected.Among those whom Joe talks to are Saintfieldrsquos Martyn Todd, who was heavily involved in the megalith project. His daughter, Katy, one of the volunteers who helped pull the giant stone into place.The tallest megalith in the British Isles faces the Mourne Mountains from where it was excavated.After being quarried in the Mournes, the huge stone was transported by road to the country park and was described by the Millennium Commission as ldquoone of the simplest and most directly appealing of all the year  projects.Four years before it was hauled into place, a group of people decided to bring , young people together to celebrate the start of a new millennium by pulling up the stone.They hoped, as the peace process was gaining momentum, to involve young people from all backgrounds in Northern Ireland to create a lasting testament to a shared future.In November , the Millennium Commission awarded pound, to the Strangford Stone project, with the remaining costs donated as contributions in kind by all the people who worked on it.The former Down Council gave permission for Delamont to become home to the stone which is located on an elevated site which boasts superb views over Strangford Lough and towards Slieve Croob and the Mountains of Mourne.The McConnell family quarried a single block of granite weighing over  tonnes mdash the largest ever-quarried in Ireland mdash trimmed it along the grain of rock, using the ancient plug and feathers technique, to its smallest natural size, twelve and a half metres long.However, during the trimming, a weakness in the granite was discovered, resulting in the stone being split into two parts and then rejoined with three stainless steel dowels.A special steel cradle to support the stone during the pull was designed, as were special low-stretch ropes, a hydraulic safety system and the three metres deep concrete foundation for the stone. Others recruited and trained the teams of young people or provided legal, financial and insurance support for the project.Anyone unable to tune in next Monday night can watch the programme on www.itv utvprogrammes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"MP calls for Ancient East tour region to include Down  ","story":"MARKETING a large swathe of East Down on an all-island basis would help produce a signicant boost for local tourism, according to South Down MP Chris Hazzard.He has asked Stormont tourism minister Diane Dodds to work with tourism agencies on either side of the border to extend Irelandrsquos Ancient East Tourism region to include a large part of Down District.Mr Hazzard was responding to the publication of the tourism ministerrsquos lsquoeconomic recovery strategyrsquo and believes that such a move would help the South Down tourism industry recover from Covid- and help mitigate ldquothe looming Brexit shock.Mr Hazzard argues that itrsquos ldquoludicrous that Failte Irelandrsquos lsquoAncient Eastrsquo tourism region stops in Louth, excluding the historically signicant north-east region of the island.He said that a large part of East Down was the playground for Cuacute Chulainn and Fionn Mac Cumhaill ldquowith the landscape forever marked by St Patrickrsquos legacy, surrounded by shoreline that welcomed Vikings, Planters and the Normans.The MP said that in Downpatrick, there are the graves of the patron saint and Viking King Magnus.He continued: ldquoWe have the impressive Downpatrick and Co Down Railway Museum, the only working heritage railway in the North which stretches out to the historic Inch Abbey.ldquoUnder the shadow of Down Cathedral, we have the only St Patrickrsquos visitor exhibition in the world, with the nearby Down County Museum located in the historic buildings of the th century gaol where United Irish leader, Thomas Russell, was executed in .Mr Hazzard said the northern side of Downpatrick was surrounded by the Mound of Down, Finnebrogue Wood and the stunning Quoile Nature Reserve, with Delamont Country Park completing the short journey to the shores of Strangford Lough where the Vikings first landed.ldquoTo the east lies Struell Wells and St Patrickrsquos first church at Saul, a unique site known widely as the cradle of christianity in Ireland, the MP continued, insisting it is ldquosimply unacceptable that this rich heritage would be a victim of partitionism of the very worst kind.Mr Hazzard said local tourism providers had been hit hard by the Covid- pandemic, with many very worried about the impact of Brexit and ldquoneedless bureaucratic hurdles.He continued: ldquoUndoubtedly, they need to be supported in the years ahead and I have have written to the tourism minister asking her to look seriously at this opportunity.ldquoNow is the time to extend the lsquoAncient Eastrsquo region and also the Wild Atlantic Way coastal route into the north to encompass all that is worth seeing on the island of Ireland.He added: ldquoQuite simply, it is the best way to successfully mitigate the impact of Covid- and Brexit on the local tourism industry..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"New president appointed at Downpatrick Lions Club  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK Lions Club has appointed Raymond Crea as its new president.Mr Crea succeeds Mr John Dennis, who presented him with his chain of office during a socially-distanced handover.Reflecting on his year in office, John said that while it was disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, it was nevertheless rewarding, thanking his fellow club members and wider public for their enthusiasm and support.Mr Crea said he was delighted to take over an important role at the helm of the organisation.He said he looked forward to finding new ways to raise funds in what he described as ldquochallenging times for numerous charities that Downpatrick Lions support..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Newcastle man Paul  climbs world’s toughest peaks  ","story":"FOR most of us sleeping on a narrow bed suspended hundreds of metres high off El Capitan, Calorniarsquos famous vertical rock wall in Yosemite Valley, would be utterly fear-inducing.Not so for mountain guide and expert rock climber Paul Swail, who first discovered his love of mountains growing up in Newcastle at the foot of the Mournes.For the  year-old, itrsquos the best nightrsquos sleep ever.ldquoYou get the most amazing nightrsquos sleep in one of those, said Paul, referring to a piece of equipment called a portaledge where rock climbers sleep and eat in during a long climb.ldquoWe spent six days climbing one of the El Cap routes and we didnrsquot want to get out of our beds in the morning.ldquoYes, we were knackered but itrsquos the comfiest thing you will ever sleep on. With all the fresh air and seeing the stars at night, when you wake up, all you can see is the ground hundreds of metres below you, itrsquos just amazing.Paul now lives in Chamonix at the foot of Mont Blanc in the French Alps with his English we, Ellie, and toddler son Luca. Luca was only weeks old when his parents climbed Slieve Donard on a trip home with him safely tucked inside a sling on his fatherrsquos chest.Hersquos enjoying his time lsquorestingrsquo from his day job of guiding people on challenging climbs of the Alpsrsquo highest peaks of Mont Blanc, the Matterhorn and the Eiger to spend time with his son.Depending on the mountain, he guides either one or two people up the peaks and safely down again.Paul explained: ldquoThe people who hire me are time poor but money rich. They can afford to employ a mountain guide like me. Doing the Matterhorn and Eiger are much more technical guiding as it on a one to one ratio.ldquoMont Blanc is mostly snow and ice and really exposed with some sections of scrambling where with the Matterhorn, you are pretty much on your hands from the start all the way to the top and all the way back down.Mont Blanc at , metres is the high European peak outside Russia and a mountain that Paul has come to know very well. He prefers to take his clients up later during the day, descending near sunset, to avoid the growing numbers of commercial climbers.Supported by the French government during lockdown from March , Paul has been able toto guiding over the last six weeks but he was still hampered by the fact says that British and Irish people were unable to fly.Born in Vancouver to Northern Ireland parents who emigrated to Canada to escape the Troubles, Paul was  when the announcement of the first IRA ceasefire came in . A year later the family moved back and decided to settle in Newcastle.He was one of the first students to attend Shimna Integrated College at its current King Street site in Newcastle and within years Paul showed his love of the outdoors, particularly mountains.ldquoMy dad and I used to walk in the Mourne mountains, he said. ldquoI had skied in Canada, but really got into the mountains back home.ldquoMy first experience of rock climbing was being taken to Altnadue Quarry just outside Castlewellan by a family friend and I just loved it.ldquoWhile I had played soccer and done a bit of running for the school, I wasnrsquot really into sports. It was around my fth year that I really veered to be more interested in outdoor pursuits. I really didnrsquot knowI wanted it as a career but after getting into climbing, it did shape what options that I was interested in.Paul went on to do a degree in outdoor education at the University of Central Lancashire and made the Tollymore National Outdoor Centre his second home when he ed home during holidays and post-college.Once he completed college, his time was split between taking climbing and outdoor pursuit courses back home. While working in France, he would ski and climb during the day in the Alps and work in bars at night, with the sole focus of funding trips such as climbing El Capitan twice or climbing in Patagonia.He went on to become a guide with the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations, which is the highest recognised mountaineering qualication in the world and the only qualication valid to work outside the UK and Ireland for climbing and off-piste skiing on glaciated terrain.Paulrsquos only salaried job to date was as a youth development officer for Mountaineering Ireland for four years from  based out of Tollymore where he taught young climbers the importance of enjoying the mountains responsibly and safely.Paul said: ldquoI worked every minute I could freelancing to fund the next trip and when I ran out of money, I came back home to work again. Up until my late s, I never thought much about the future, it was just living for the moment.ldquoIrsquove never really had a secure income until I had the Mountaineering Ireland job and it allowed me to buy a house in Castlewellan.While his responsibility to provide for his family is uppermost in his mind, Paul is not yet finished with his need to climb and explore mdash although, interestingly, the worldrsquos highest mountain, Everest, is not on his wish list.ldquoTherersquos a letime of climbs that I would love to do, said Paul. ldquoI love to go back to Patagonia in Argentina to climb Cerro Torre, which for me is the most beautul mountain in the world every climber dreams of standing on top of it. Or the Blasket Islands innorthern Canada would be quite high on my list.ldquoEverest has never appealed to me to go and climb as itrsquos not very dficult technically now. Itrsquos a challenge due to the seriousness of the weather and acclimatising to the attitude makes an extremely serious mountain because of its height.ldquoBut I donrsquot think you need a huge amount of skill to get up Everest and I donrsquot believe you actually have to be a rock climber. You do need to be fit and to be able to acclimatise your body to altitude and you need to have a lot of money.His friend and mentor Dawson Stelfox mdash who became the first Irish man to ascend Everest on his own in May,  mdash is something of a trailblazer to Paul.ldquoI didnrsquot realise that in , when Dawson made the summit on his own, there were no fixed ropes as there are today, there wasnrsquot the support from Sherpas and so on, said Paul.ldquoThat would appeal to meEverest was like that now, then I would love to go. But I donrsquot want to and sit and wait in a queue of  people to get to the top of the mountain.ldquoI really like to explore and there would need to be technical challenge to it as well, apart from overcoming the physical challenges and altitude.ldquoIf you were to take El Cap and put it somewhere a bit remote where it would take you a couple of days to get to it and very few people have climbed it, you would have about , metres of vertical rock to climb. Now that would be really rewarding..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"October next National League date for Down  ","story":"IT has been over  weeks now since Down last played a league game mdash against Offaly on March .The next league game is due to take place against Leitrim on Saturday, October , or the following day,the Covid- virus continues to fizzle out.

George and Casehill Woods near Dinas Powys, has resulted in success.National Resources Waleshad proposed constructing a dam m wide and .m high in the meadow at the Woodland Trust site in Dinas Powys.NRW proposed the dam as one option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal case for this option, it is therefore clear that we will not be pursuing an upstream storage scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is

while the council takes steps to mitigate further issues.A meeting with residents and the local community council was held on Tuesday, June  to explain the steps the council would be taking, in the

From this date, passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations. There will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of . Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said: “As we move through the Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety of passengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued: “We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is also important that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe. You have been the leaders in Northern Ireland fighting Covid- and I am asking you to keep it up and we will beat this together. “By acting together and thinking of each other we can reduce the risk of transmission.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fefaecaabafbdbc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ccbabaecbfafa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
