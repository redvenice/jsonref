The number of virus patients in ICU was 58, up nine from Wednesday.‘Unsafe’Earlier, the president of the Irish Association for Emergency Medicine Dr Fergal Hickey warned the healthcare service was not coping with the latest wave of Covid-19 and said steps must be taken to “flatten the curve”.Dr Hickey, who is also an emergency medicine consultant at Sligo General Hospital, told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland the situation in emergency departments was “unsafe and intolerable”.“We know, for example, that if you have to wait for more than five hours for a decision to admit in an emergency department, an additional one in 82 patients will die as a direct result,” he said.“We know that if you are in an emergency department that is overcrowded there is an increase in 30-day mortality from all causes for all patients. They are things which are potentially preventable by some action.”Dr Hickey said hospitals were not looking for a return to draconian restrictions, but “relatively simple interventions”, which he said could mean the difference for inidual patients between “life and death”.“We don’t see politicians, we don’t see senior figures within the HSE visiting emergency departments at the moment because they would be afraid of what they might find,” he said.Latest waveOn Wednesday the Health Protection Surveillance Centre was notified of a further 5,381 PCR-confirmed cases of Covid-19. In addition, 7,127 people registered a positive antigen result through the HSE’s online portal on Tuesday.There are signs the current wave may be peaking. The combined number of positive results from PCR and antigen tests each day, though an underestimate of the real number of infections, has started to decline. Hospitalisations are rising more slowly and ICU numbers are holding steady.Mr Martin confirmed on Wednesday that pandemic emergency powers to restrict travel and stop public gatherings , which were signed into law in March 2020, were due to expire at midnight on Thursday.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"cold snap brings a sharp end to spell of sunny weather","story":"Walkers enjoying the Sun and Dun Laoghaire Pier over the weekend. Photograph: Nick BradshawColder temperatures are expected over the coming days, putting an end to Ireland’s recent sunny and hot weather.The warm spell in recent days - with temperatures hitting 20 degrees - is not uncommon for March but it did last longer than is usual for this time of year, according to Met Éireann forecaster Paul Downes.Mr Downes says temperatures will feel quite cold today and will average between five to nine degrees, with the north of the country experiencing the lowest temperatures.“Fresh northerly winds will make it feel much colder. We are reaching the harsher end of March, but there will still be sunshine,” he said.In the afternoon, there will be occasional showers of rain, which will become more widespread across the northern and eastern coasts from tonight.“There will also be a hard frost, with temperatures dropping between minus one to four degrees,” said Mr Downes.Friday morning will be clear and bright but clouds will build up over the north throughout the day, making it colder than the rest of the country. “The south will experience the most sunny spells. Rain will arrive in Ulster and north east Leinster in the late afternoon.”Temperatures will average between six to nine degrees. “The winds from Thursday will have eased back to light to moderate.”WeekendThis weekend’s weather will be a mixed bag, with rain expected on Saturday. It will be a rather cloudy day, with frequent showers, but some sunny spells will also break through, Mr Downes said. “It won’t be overcast.”Average temperatures will be between seven to 10 degrees, and light north-westerly breezes are also expected. “The winds aren’t as much of a factor over the weekend.”Sunday will be mainly dry and slightly warmer than the previous few days. Sunny spells will be interspersed with some showers and average temperatures between eight to 11 degrees are expected.However, more organised rain from the north west will arrive on Sunday night.Next week is set to be milder, according to Mr Downes.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"fees for new auto enrolment state pensions criticised","story":"The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection said it was anticipated that fees charged would ultimately come in below the 0.5 per cent cap The Government is facing criticism over fees for its new auto-enrolment pension scheme, with claims it is too “generous” to pension funds, and that users could be charged thousands more than in a British equivalent over the lifetime of a plan.The criticism relates to a cap placed on the fee levied on the total value of a pension pot by pension funds involved in the scheme – which the Government has set at 0.5 per cent. While the British cap for auto-enrolment fees is higher, at 0.75 per cent, a state-backed operator there charges 0.3 per cent annually on the value of a pension pot.The Government has argued there are fees that bring this rate up. Dr Laura Bambrick, head of social policy with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, said the cap was “generous”, and called for it to be lowered. “The 0.5 per cent maximum management fee is excessive. The cap is a good idea but it has to be reduced,” she said.Dr Barra Roantree, an economist with the Economic and Social Research Institute whose work focuses on taxation, welfare and pensions, said “a difference of 0.2 per cent in fees makes a huge difference compounded over the lifetime (of investment) – they look small, but over decades they really matter”. He said higher management charges “would mean savers keeping less of their pension pot, especially if their investments yield a high return”. He said the difference could potentially amount to tens of thousands. “It depends on the size of the funds, but it really does add up. It sounds small, but it is large, and particularly for guys who might not have a huge fund,” he said.“What’s crucial is that those automatically enrolled are given access to a product with the lowest possible fees,” he said. UK schemeThe Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection defended the scheme, saying it would not be accurate to say investors in the UK scheme would only pay 0.3 per cent in fees. It argued there were other fees levied by the British equivalent plan, including a fee of 1.8 per cent on contributions. Jerry Moriarty, chief executive of the Irish Association of Pension Funds, said overall the fee structures were “broadly equivalent” due to the charges made on contributions into the British scheme. The department said it was anticipated that fees charged would ultimately come in below the cap. It said it was important for participants, employers and the State that its scheme costs are kept low and transparent.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"higher energy costs are here for the longer haul says taoiseach","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin played down fears of a shortage of fuel this winter. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireTaoiseach Micheál Martin has played down fears of a shortage of fuel this winter, but said that concern about energy security and costs is something that will be an issue beyond the short-term.He said that there was “no need” for panic buying, but higher energy costs were here for the “longer haul”.Asked by RTÉ’s Claire Byrne about reports that Mr Martin had warned Fianna Fáil TDs last night about winter fuel shortages, Mr Martin said:“I never said that. That is not the phrase I used at all. I simply used the phrase energy security is an issue the Government is focused on and also that will mean we have to look at demand reduction strategies as well.”“I am not responsible for the headline,” Mr Martin said. “That phrase was not one I used at all. I simply said that energy security is something we have to focus on and prepare for over the next winter period.”The Taoiseach and his ministers have been warning in recent days about the impact of the war not just on prices but on the resources available to the Government for future spending decisions, as the costs of accommodating and helping tens of thousands of refugees become clearer.Mr Martin also warned that food security is also an issue for the Government.“I made that point last evening at the parliamentary party that the knock on from war in terms of grain, in terms of food issues, nutrition, there could be further problems in developing countries which creates further migratory flows and further potential conflict in developing countries.”Mr Martin stressed that the Government was now resigned to dealing with the cost of living issue as a long-term challenge.“We have to look at this over the twelve month perspective. It is not something we can respond to on a week to week basis. It needs a longer time frame. So in that context, not just in Ireland but right across Europe, energy security and security of supply is a key issue,” he said.Mr Martin said around €2 billion had already been committed in trying to alleviate the impact of inflation and that the Government would continue to target resources towards those people and sectors which were hardest hit.He added one clear policy shift emerging from the war in Ukraine was new urgency around the need to accelerate the provision of renewable energy.He said while Ireland was not as dependent on Russian gas and oil as others, “nonetheless we do have to adapt” and he said the Carbon Tax, which has been criticised for increasing fuel costs, was to allow the country to reorient away from a reliance on fossil fuels."},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics ivana bacik on labour s past present and future","story":"Ivana Bacik’s uncontested election as Labour Party leader came after the swift removal of Alan Kelly from the role and her own relatively recent appointment as a TD in the Dublin Bay South by-election.

Image: Tayfun Salci ZUMA Press Wire REX ShutterstockByAletha AduPolitical Correspondent:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |commentsThe Home Office has been blasted for exaggerating the progress made to sht its internal culture in the wake of the Windrush scandal. The Home Secretary boasted she is “proud” of the efforts made to make her department more compassionate - despite a critical report blasting the lack of progress. It comes after a damning review led by Wendy Williams found the Windrush scandal was “foreseeable and avoidable”. A report published by Ms Williams in  found victims were let down by “systemic operational failings” at the Home Office. The departmentaposs “institutional ignorance and thoughtlessness” towards the issue of race and the history of the Windrush generation were heavily criticised and Ms Williams made  recommendations for change.  But only eight of the  recommendations have been fully implemented in the last two years. Ms Williams has said she is “disappointed” by the lack of “drive to achieve cultural changes”. “Much more progress is required in policymaking and casework, which will be seen as the major indicators of improvement. “I have seen limited evidence that a compassionate approach is being embedded consistently across the department.” She acknowledged some progress made by the department but concluded the Home Office is at a “tipping point”. “The next stage will be crucial in determining whether it has the capacity and capability to make good on its ambitions ‘to build a Home Office fit for the future, one that serves every corner of society…[with] a long-term focus on wholesale and lasting cultural change’.” The department was urged to appoint a migrants’ commissioner to “sign post systemic risks”. This has not been completed. Despite the criticisms, Ms Patel said: “I am pleased with what we’ve achieved in the last two years and that Wendy Williams has recognised this is a dferent department from the one she originally saw. “I have laid the foundations for radical change in the department and a total transformation of culture. We have already made signicant progress.” Last week, another report found the Windrush compensation scheme – which offers payouts to victims affected by the scandal – has “structural weaknesses” and needs reform so it can be “efficient and effective”. Martin Levermore, the Government’s independent adviser on Windrush, acknowledged there had been criticism of the scheme from a “iety of quarters” but said overall that it is “delivering”. The latest figures show the Home Office had paid out more than £ million on  claims by the end of February, out of a total , claims submitted so far. Some  claims have been made for people who have already died and only  have currently resulted in payments so far.

While MPs are encouraged to use public transport, their parking has been free since at least , and Parliament has an underground car park. MPs and their staff can also claim parking for work in their constituency on expenses, with  such claims totalling nearly £, paid out last year.And senior ministers such as Chancellor Rishi Sunak or Health Secretary Sajid Javid can be chauffeured in taxpayer-funded ministerial cars. It comes after Mr Javid announced NHS staff free parking introduced as a result of Covid will end. Parking fees were waived in March  - but Mr Javid said the pandemic had moved to a new stage.  Rachel Harrison, national officer at the GMB union, said: “If itaposs good enough for MPs then it should be good enough for NHS workers. “Our members will be appalled by the hypocrisy of Ministers pushing this through who enjoy free parking at their own place of work. “Nurses, cleaners, porters and more have run themselves into the ground keeping people alive during this pandemic. Now we’ve got the worst cost of living crisis for a generation. “Health workers need help and support to stop them either leaving the profession or burning out. “Instead they’re getting a real terms pay cut and car parking charges - this is not levelling up, this is a downright disgrace.” Union chiefs warned NHS staff face a multi million pound car parking bill from Friday. The GMB said official figures for the financial year   - the year before charges were lted for the pandemic - showed that health workers paid £. million in car parking fees.Unison and Labour warned the charges could trigger resignations.The union’s head of health Sara Gorton said: “This is no way for the NHS to hang on to staff in the current job market. “Parking charges will add hundreds of pounds to the massive cost pressures already facing health staff and reduce their morale even further. “Those already on the brink of leaving the NHS may well see this as the final straw and head for the exit. Keir Starmer ’s spokesman added: It seems a very odd way to thank NHS staff for their efforts over the pandemic, to increase the cost of living crisis and take away free hospital parking at this time.“This could be yet one more thing that forces people to quit roles that we need to boost. Figures from before  suggested around half of MPs had a permit to park on the Parliamentary estate. But parking is not guaranteed for Parliament’s staff, who can only applythey have to be on the estate at overnight or have a ersity-related need. Free parking for NHS staff was already being scaled back in the wake of the pandemic. St Thomas’ Hospital - opposite Parliament on the other bank of the Thames - charges £. an hour for the public, and much less for staff. Staff who drive to the central London hospital pay a “competitive” £. to £. for a whole sht. However, they are only eligible for free parking while working nights. A spokesperson for the hospital Trust said: “Otherwise, we encourage staff to use public transport, cycle or walk to our central London site, where possible.” Boris Johnson ’s official spokesman defended the move, saying: “You’ll know we took that approach at the height of the pandemic and clearly that comes with a cost to the taxpayer. We are ing to the pre-pandemic position.”The spokesman pointed to the Tory election pledge to give free parking to blue-badge holders people with long-term health conditions parents of sick children staying overnight and staff on night shts. Boris Johnson’s spokesman said % of NHS Trusts are implementing free parking for those who need it most. He added: “We do want more NHS staff to be able to benefit from free parking but clearly there are limits on what inidual trusts can provide.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON UnisonNHSConservative PartyGMB unionRachel HarrisonBoris JohnsonHospitalsCar parksPublic transportPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Sir Keir said: He told the House no rules were broken in Downing Street during lockdown. The police have now concluded there was widespread criminality. The Ministerial Code says that ministers who knowingly mislead the House should resign. Why is he still here  Boris Johnson scoffed hang on a minute! and accused Keir Starmer of being a human weather vane after the Labour leader stopped short of repeating his call for the PMaposs resignation last week.  The PM said the Met Police - whoaposve warned they could issue more fines beyond the  anonymous ones so far - must “get on with their job” adding: We are going to get on with our job.But Keir Starmer said: There are only two possible explanations.“Either he’s trashing the Ministerial Code, or he’s claiming he was repeatedly lied to by his own advisors and that he didn’t know what was going on in his own house and his own office. “Come off it! “He really does think it’s one rule for him and another rule for everyone  - that he can pass off criminality in his own office and ask others to follow the law.” Labouraposs leader added: When is he going to stop taking the British public for fools  It came after Boris Johnsonaposs deputy today finally admitted  staff broke the law over Covid lockdown parties - after No bizarrely tried to avoid saying they did.Dominic Raab also confirmed ministers like Rishi Sunak will inevitably disclosethey get fined. So far, No has only pledged to name Boris Johnson and Cabinet Secretary Simon Case.Scotland Yard yesterday said it would hand out  fines to people over parties in Downing Street and Whitehall.Yet the PM still appeared to be in denial. Pressed over Mr Johnson’s view, his spokesman said: “It’s for the Met to make that judgment, rather than the Prime Minister.”Today Mr Raab, who is the Justice Secretary and once prosecuted war crimes, accepted the  fined people broke the law saying: Clearly there were breaches of the regulations - that’s the only thing that could warrant the  fixed penalty notices”. Last night Boris Johnson threw a glitzy bash for Tory MPs, hours after the Met confirmed Downing Street lockdown parties had broken the law. The PM hosted around  MPs for dinner at a central London hotel as he attempted to bolster his leadership and draw a line under the Partygate scandal. Politicians were set to dine on salmon tart, chicken thighs and a chocolate praline dessert, washed down with fine wines. Top Tories walked past families who lost loved ones to Covid, who held a candlelit vigil in protest outside Londonaposs Park Plaza hotel and shouted at MPs: Off to another party, are we  One Tory MP, Michael Fabricant, told the waiting media the party would be a lot of fun adding: Itaposs great, we had a photo taken, it was absolutely super. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford blasted: Last night millions of families will have been desperately trying to figure out how they will possibly afford the £ energy price hike that will hit them this Friday. At the very same time, Tory MPs were gathering across the street for a champagne bash in the Park Plaza. We all know the Tories partied during lockdown and now they’re partying through this cost-of-living emergency. Earlier Keir Starmer blasted the PM and “cynical” Chancellor Rishi Sunak for putting the  Tory re-election campaign over and above helping people pay their bills by promising a p income tax cut. The PM insisted he was still a “tax-cutting Conservative” - but Keir Starmer told Mr Johnson to “cut the nonsense and treat the British people with a bit of respect”. He said the Tories were imposing  tax rises, bringing the tax burden to its highest for  years and for every £ taken in tax rises, £ is given back. “Is that cutting taxes or is it raising taxes ” he mocked. Boris Johnson fumed: “I don’t know where he’s been the last two years…. “Even for Captain Hindsight, to obliterate the biggest pandemic for the last century from his memory, to obliterate the £bn we’ve had to spend… is quite extraordinary.” But Keir Starmer said: “I can only hope that his police questionnaire was bit more convincing than that. This year British people face the worst fall in living standards on record. While they are counting every penny, the Prime Minister is hitting them with higher taxes.“But in  when there just so happens to be a general election, they will introduce a small tax cut. That is not taking dficult decisions, itaposs putting the Tory re-election campaign over and above helping people pay their bills. How did he find a Chancellor as utterly cynical as he is  Prime Minister Boris Johnson replied: What we have is a Chancellor who took the tough decisions to look after the UK economy throughout the pandemic, who protected people up and down the land with £ billion worth of support. And by the way,we had listened to them,we had listened to Captain Hindsight, we would not have come out of lockdown in July last year. We would have stayed in lockdown over Christmas and New Year, with the result that the UK economy would not be growing in the way that it is. And so we would not be able to make the investments that we now are and under Labour we would have to tax more and borrow more and they cannot be trusted with the economy.

But the plans have already been criticised, with unions saying ministers have not gone far enough and the British Ports Association pointing out ports cannot enforce wage rules. Mr Shapps also outlined plans to close minimum wage loopholes and clampdown on fire and rehire practices. He will ask the Insolvency Service to consider disqualying PO chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite from acting as a company director, after the boss brazenly admitted to MPs the firm broke the law by not consulting with unions or notying the government. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “This plan has gaping holes. It won’t deliver a fair outcome for the  sacked workers, and it won’t stop another PO-style scandal.  “Closing the legal loophole which lets companies pay less than the minimum wage is a start, but we need much more from the Government. “Ministers must do everything they can to ensure PO reinstate staff on their previous pay – a union-negotiated rate that is signicantly higher than the national minimum wage. “That means severing all ties with DP World, including lucrative freeport contracts. “Andministers really want to stop companies firing at will, they must go further than a feeble statutory code and finally deliver the long-promised Employment Bill to boost worker protections. “Without stronger employment legislation, bad bosses will continue to trample over workers’ rights.” British Ports Association, Richard Ballantyne, added: While itaposs right the government and the ferry industry look to improve employment rules and standards, the expectation that port authorities will need to enforce minimum wage rules in the shipping sector could be unworkable. This will place ports in a dficult legal predicament, especially before any legislation is in place. DP World-owned PO Ferries sacked its crews and replaced them with agency workers on March . The minimum wage in the UK for people aged  and over is £. per hour. Mr Hebblethwaite, whose basic annual salary is £,, told MPs on March  that the average pay of the agency crew is £. per hour, but insisted this was permitted under international maritime laws. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Shapps said: “Where new laws are needed, we will create them. Where legal loopholes are cynically exploited, we will close them. And where employment rights are too weak, we will strengthen them.” Mr Shapps said HM Revenue  Customs will dedicate “signicant resource” to ensure all UK ferry operators are “compliant with the national minimum wage, no s, no buts”.Employers will be prevented from using “ fire and rehire tactics”they fail to make “reasonable efforts to reach agreement through consultation”, the Transport Secretary said.Mr Shapps added of the proposals: “It’ll send a clear message thatyou are using British waters and British ports to ply your trade then you must accept British laws.” Shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh told the Commons that the steps announced by the Government to “insist on the bare minimum cannot come a moment too soon”. PO Ferries has accused the Maritime and Coastguard Agencyof operating with “an unprecedented level of rigour” after it detained two of its ships. European Causeway was held in Larne, Northern Ireland, on Friday, while Pride Of Kent was detained in Dover, Kent, on Monday.  Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, was also unimpressed with the plans, saying: “Despite all the bluster, Grant Shapps has failed to grasp the opportunity to adequately stand up to the banditry behaviour of PO. “The Prime Minister repeatedly said to Parliament that the Government would be taking legal action to save British seafarers’ jobs, but he has failed to keep his word. “This continued lack of action and courage has meant a ferry company owned by the Dubai royal family has been able to break our laws and disrupt our ports and ruin people’s lives with impunity, and we will keep pressing the Government to ensure justice for our members. “What has been announced today is far too little, too late, and we are calling for urgent action for speedier, more radical reforms to save the UK seafarer from oblivion.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON \" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He said the UK didnapost want people in rubber boats, referring to rising numbers of people making the perilous Channel crossing in dinghies. More than , people have been brought to the UK since the start of the year, according to figures collated by the PA news agency. The comments came as the Prime Minister was grilled by the powerful Commons Liaison Committee over the plight of Ukrainian refugees. Sir Bill urged the prime minister to look at the other “end of the spectrum,” telling him: “We have, on at least three occasions, promised the Qataris visa-free access. “These are very wealthy people who are unlikely to stay. And yet, despite saying we do it three times, we still haven’t delivered.” The North Herefordshire MP said he was worried the PM wasnapost delivering on his promises, adding: The only people who are turning up are turning up in rubber boats. Why canapost we get the right people through our immigration system, rather than the wrong ones  Mr Johnson pressed him to clary, to which the MP replied: We want Ukrainians, we want Qataris, we donapost want people in rubber boats. The PM said the new Nationality and Borders Bill would help to end the cruel trading in people across the Channel. The controversial legislation is expected to penalise people seeking asylum in the UK.  He also promised a much more fluid system for Qatar and said he had told the Emir of Qatar that progress was likely on the issue. Liberal Democrat Home Affairs Spokesperson Alistair Carmichael blasted Sir Bill for playing Top Trumps with people. He told the Mirror: It must be comforting to be a Conservative MP who thinks people can so easily be sorted into aposrightapos and aposwrongapos. But the real world is a bit more complicated than that. The truth is, the Conservatives have given us a broken immigration system that stops UK employers recruiting the people they need - no matter which country they come from. The Governmentaposs two tier approach is wrong both practically and on principle.Instead of playing Top Trumps with peopleaposs nationality, we need an immigration system that works for our economy and treats everyone with dignity and respect. The PM came under pressure during the hearing over the chaotic response to the spiralling Ukrainian refugee crisis. More than  million people have fled the Russian onslaught, according to UN estimates.Only , Ukrainian refugees have been put up by Brits under the Homes for Ukrainescheme despite more than , families offering to help.Some , people have applied for a visa, the government confirmed on Tuesday. The separate scheme for refugees with family links to the UK has had , applicants, with the Home Office issuing , visas.

The latest names added to the governmentaposs sanctions list include Colonel-General Mikhail Mizintsev, propagandist Sergey Brilev and Kremlin funded TV-Novosti, which owns the Russia Todaynews channel. Aleksandr Zharov, chief executive of Gazprom-Media, Alexey Nikolov the managing director of RT, and Anton Anisimov, the head of Sputnik International Broadcasting, were also sanctioned. Mizintsev, who is chief of Russiaaposs national defence command and control centre, has been responsible for planning and executing the siege and bombardment of Mariupol . The Ukrainian port city has been devastated by heavy Russian shelling, including the bombing of a maternity hospital which shocked the world.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: Putinaposs war on Ukraine is based on a torrent of lies.  Britain has helped lead the world in exposing Kremlin disinformation, and this latest batch of sanctions hits the shameless propagandists who push out Putinaposs fake news and narratives. We will keep on going with more sanctions to ramp up the pressure on Russia and ensure Putin loses in Ukraine. Nothing and no one is off the table. Britainaposs regulator Ofcom stripped RT of its broadcast licence earlier this month. Downing Street said the UK was continuing to further ratchet up the pressure on Vladimir Putinaposs regime. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: We know that countries can adapt to sanctions over time so itaposs right that we keep moving forwards on this. Itaposs equally right to to place sanctions on those who are are seeking to misinform people at a mass scale and thataposs who the sanctions are targeted at today - famous TV anchors on state-owned TV who push forward the hoods that are misleading some of the Russian people into not understanding the situation in Ukraine and some of the wanton destruction and killing of civilians that weaposre seeing. Asked whether the UK believes Mizintsev was guilty of war crimes in Mariupol, the PMaposs spokesman said: I think no one can doubt in looking at whataposs happening in Mariupol there, on the face of it, appears to be evidence of war crimes. Formally, that is not a distinction that we can rule on. But clearly, no one can be in any doubt by looking at the situation that it is a horric thing.

Laura Jordan said her son Zac, now five, has spent so much time in the house that heaposs now scared to go outside. She was shocked to discover that councils are not required to get kids back into schoolthey are expelled before their fth birthday. The boy was booted out of Holly Hill Church School, in Rubery, Worcs, in October after a number of behaviour problems, including attacks on other pupils and staff.But his mum, , believes he has undiagnosed special educational needs that canapost be dealt with in mainstream schools.Worcestershire County Council has since apologised for failing to find a suitable school for Zac and said it is working with his mum to get him back into education. Laura, from Redditch, Worcs, told The Mirror: Zac started reception in September and within five weeks he had been permanently excluded.Ever since heaposs been out of school as he was only four and the compulsory school age is five. Itaposs very rare for this to happen to a child his age.Itaposs pure discrimination, the whole thing. I donapost think itaposs morally right heaposs out of school when people the same age as him are able to go to school. Heaposs been left behind because heaposs been excluded and offered no alternative schooling provision.Heaposs missed out on his education. This is going to affect him for the rest of his le.Laura said Zac has become increasingly isolated following his exclusion last October.  She added: I canapost even get him to leave the house. I have to force him to leave just to go to the shops. He used to be happy outside the house. Now he doesnapost want to leave and thataposs because heaposs not mixing with kids his age.The mum-of-two does not deny that her son has issues, accepting that he attacked other children and staff at his school. However, she believes he has autism, ADHD and speech and language problems which make certain situations aposoverwhelmingapos for him. Laura added: He was excluded because heaposs got special educational needs and the school was not able to meet his needs. They couldnapost keep him and others safe. But they couldaposve done other things before resorting to excluding him. This wouldaposve involved a possible managed move or alternative provision.  Ultimately, they didnapost give him chance or time to adjust to his environment or the new staff in his classroom.She added that Worcestershire County Council has to find Zac a new school by April after he turned five in February. The mum said: Itaposs down to the local authority to find an alternative school for him. They have requested two special needs schools but they said they are full. The council now want him in a local mainstream school. If the school accepts him, he will have no choice but to go there.I fear he will be excluded againhe is chucked into another mainstream school and we will be on this never ending cycle of him going to schools and getting excluded. Laura now thinks the UKaposs compulsory school age should be lowered to four-years-old so children cannot be expelled and left at home once they have started education. A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Suspensions and permanent exclusions should only be used as a last resort, but we back headteachers to suspend or exclude pupils where it is necessary and helps maintain calm classrooms. “We are consulting on changes to behaviour and exclusions guidance to make sure this is used in a fair way, and the cross-government SEND Review will further consult on how children with special educational needs and disabilities are supported by the system, including in alternative provision.” Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Local authorities are responsible for arranging full-time education for excluded pupils once they reach compulsory school age.Worcestershire County Councilaposs cabinet member for education Marcus Hart said: “Parent carers have a statutory right to ask for a particular educational setting and support for their child but it can at times be challenging to find the right place that has capacity and can meet a child’s inidual needs. The law requires all children to start full-time education by the beginning of the term following their fth birthday and we are working with Ms Jordan to find a suitable and appropriate school that meets Zac’s assessed needs, ready for him to start school in April. We are sorry that we have been unable to source an educational provision for Zac that has been able to meet his needs for this period and we acknowledge this is unacceptable for Zac, indeed for any child. We are continuing to work alongside Ms Jordan and relevant healthcare providers and partners to ensure that we have a high quality, lawful Educational Health and Care Plan in place for Zac, that will help to ensure he receives the tailored help and support he needs at all stages of his educational journey.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Children SchoolsSchools\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Dave Stubbs discovered he had a brain tumour after suffering head pains which he was convinced was long Covid.The -year-old was diagnosed with the growth after describing an aposexplosionapos in his head while he was quarantining, StokeonTrentLive reports. Police say Covid- saved his his le after doctors said he was aposweeks from deathapos when the cancer was found.He found out his symptoms were actually caused by a tumour and he is facing two years of therapy to improve his le-after surgery on his brain Dave had been a police officer for  years and tested positive for the virus last June, after two of his colleagues caught it.He told StokeonTrentLive : I had no symptoms but I was very paranoid about Covid because I have vulnerable family members, so I went for a test, and it was positive.Two days into self-isolation I had what I can only describe as an explosion in my head. It was like I was  metres underwater, the pressure was immense. I couldnapost put my head down or rest as it was so bad.  This continued for a number of weeks and at this point I decided to contact my GP as I was concerned I may have long Covid. At this point I had also lost strength in my right arm, I was unable to lt my arm up over my head and I was struggling to clench my fist.Daveaposs GP sent him for an urgent CT scan and in July, he and his we Rachel - who is also a Staffordshire Police officer - were given the devastating news that he had a large tumour at the rear of his brain. It was too big for treatment and the only hope of saving his le was high-risk emergency surgery.He said: The thought of a brain tumour never even crossed my mind. My whole le was turned upside down. I had gone in a split second from a hard working guy with a whole future mapped out to realising that my le would never be the same again for me, or my family. I have three grown-up daughters and a son Elijah, who was nine at the time. We couldnapost keep it from him and it was horrible having to tell him. Dave, who was based at Hanley CID, underwent surgery at the Royal Stoke University Hospital in September. Following the operation, he was told that the tumour had been slowly growing for between nine and  years and had become wrapped around the main vein in his brain, which meant surgeons had not been able to completely remove it.I was months,not weeks, away from a fatal collapse.All the symptoms I had put down to the stress of my job were related to the tumour. I would have regular headaches, I gained a large amount of weight and had problems with my vision. I felt tired but still struggled to sleep. My personality changed as well. I became fixated on things like work. My blood pressure was also really high.Covid saved my le. I think it aggravated the tumour causing the bad headaches. If I hadnapost have caught it I would have continued to ignore my symptoms. The tumour has had serious consequences for Dave, but he says he feels lucky to still be here. He said: Later in the day I start to struggle with my words. I get a lot of brain fog and I struggle to read. I get absolutely exhausted, but Iaposm still alive so I canapost complain. Iaposve never suffered with my mental health before but now I suffer from anxiety and get agitated. Itaposs frustrating that they couldnapost get all the tumour out. Iaposm on aposwatch and waitapos - Iaposll have to go back for regular scans to monitor it. If Iaposm lucky it will stay dormant for a long time. If not I will have options for treatment. Although he will not be able toto front-line duties, Dave is hoping he will still be able to have a career with Staffordshire Police and - together with his family - has thrown himself into fundraising for brain tumour charities. The neurosurgery team at the Royal Stoke were amazing and saved my le, he said. I could not have got through the trauma of having the tumour without the wonderful support of three brain tumour charities, and brain tumour research receives just one per cent of cancer research funding. I want to raise money and raise awareness.

The monstrous killer, who is being held in Wakefield Prison, has already spent  years living in solitary confinement in a glass cage after he was deemed too dangerous to be around other prisoners. But although heaposs previously complained his interment reminded him of a traumatic childhood, it has been reported heaposs now quite content living in the underground box. Speaking in a new documentary aposHMP Wakefield: Evil Behind Barsapos Maudsleyaposs nephew Gavin said his uncle is perfectly happy.  He added his softly spoken, well-read uncle would kill againhe was ever released back into society. Maudsley, from Toxteth, Liverpool, was just  when he committed his first murder in .  For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here The serial killer, who had been working as a rent boy at the time, butchered one of his clients, John Farrell. The murder was so violent, cops named him blue because of the colour of his face. Maudsley was arrested and eventually convicted of murder. He was jailed with the recommendation he should never be released. When he was first locked up Maudsley was sent to Broadmoor Hospital, which houses some of the UKaposs most violent prisoners. After three relatively quiet years behind bars, the serial killer seized an opportunity to attack child molester David Francis in , with the help of fellow prisoner David Cheeseman. The pair barricaded themselves in a cell with Francis before spending the next nine hours brutally torturing the sex offender to death. During the attack, Maudsley shoved a spoon so far into Francisaposs ear, it wedged into his brain.  After the killing, for which he was convicted of manslaughter, he was deemed too dangerous to stay in Broadmoor and was transferred to Wakefield Prison. But Maudsleyaposs streak for vigilante violence continued and after heaposd settled into his new cell the following year, he strangled and stabbed we-killer Salney Darwood and hid the body under his bed. Thirsty for more blood, he hunted prison corridors for his next victim - Bill Roberts, who had been jailed for sexually abusing a seven-year-old girl. He stabbed Roberts to death before hacking at his skull with a makesht dagger. After the bloodshed, Maudsley calmly walked up to a prison guard and chillingly said there would be two fewer people at dinner that night. His rampage rung alarm bells for prison bosses who deemed him too dangerous to mix with the general prison population and a special cell was constructed to keep him in. The cell, which was completed in , was dubbed the glass cage - as it resembled Anthony Hopkinsapos cell in Silence of the Lambs. At .mx.m, itaposs surrounded by bulletproof glass which prison guards peer into to keep a close eye on him.  The only furniture is a table and a chair, which are both made of compressed cardboard, while his toilet and sink are bolted to the floor. The door of the cell is made of solid steel, which opens into a cage just inside. Maudsleyaposs bed is a concrete slab. The see-through walls contain a slit, through which guards pass him meals and other things he needs. Spending his days entombed in the cell, Maudsley is allowed one hour of exercise per day. When he goes to the exercise yard, heaposs escorted by six guards and he never has access to other inmates. When interviewed, Maudsley said he felt tortured in solitary confinement and claimed his speech has suffered from never speaking to anyone. He said: I feel no officer takes any interest in me and theyaposre only concerned with when to open the door and then to make sure I get back in my cell as soon as possible. I think an officer could stop and talk a bit but they never do and itaposs these thoughts that I think about most of the time. But in a letter to Gavin, , he claimed he is happy and content in the box and has warned killing will be on his mindheaposs ever released. Maudsley has claimed the confinement has given him flashbacks to his childhood, when he was regularly locked away and beaten. The serial killer had an abusive childhood at the hands of his father. After being dumped in an orphanage as an infant, his parents brought him and his  siblings home when he was eight. He was regularly hit and often took extra beatings to protect his siblings. Once, he was locked in a room for six months, with his only human contact coming from beatings from his dad. In the year  Maudsley asked for the terms of his imprisonment to be relaxed - begging for a pet budgie or,that request was denied, a cyanide capsule so he could end his le. Both requests were turned down, leaving him to live out his days in the glass cell underneath Wakefield Prison.

Sources revealed the Duke of York has been accused of manipulating his positionThe Queen walked into the church with Prince Andrew Image: POOL AFP via Getty ImagesByRussell MyersRoyal Editor:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar  The Queen defiantly overruled heirs Prince Charles and Prince William to allow her disgraced son Andrew to have a special role at the Duke of Edinburgh’s memorial service, it can be revealed.The Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge “on more than one occasion” raised their concerns over the optics of allowing the shamed Duke of York to accompany his mother to the Westminster Abbey service on Tuesday. The future kings were “absolutely united” that it was “simply unnecessary” for Andrew to position himself as the only family member to escort the Queen to the church. But well placed sources have confirmed the -year-old monarch told them it was “her wish and final decision” that Andrew should chaperon her into the Abbey. The Duke, who just weeks ago reportedly paid £million out of court to settle a civil sexual assault case with a woman he said he had never met, has since been accused privately within the family of “manipulating” his position, sources have revealed.  Senior royals believe he still holds ambitions of staging an unlikelyto front line royal duties, despite being banished by the Queen over allegations he in  sexually assaulted Virginia Giuffre, when she was a -year-old former sex slave of his paedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew has always strenuously denied the allegations.Prince Charles and Prince William were left “shocked” and dismayed” as Andrew emerged front and centre at Prince Philip ’s memorial service, attended by  guests and streamed live by the BBC.Due to her recent ill health and increasing frailty, The Queen’s attendance was not confirmed until less than two and a half hours before the .am ceremony. It was Her Majesty’s first major official engagement outside one of her homes for nearly six months. She last appeared to open the Welsh Senedd in Cardf on October .  Andrew was in the memorial order of service to arrive with other members of the family and his daughters at the West Door. But he travelled in a Range Rover with the Queen from Windsor Castle to Buckingham Palace, before changing cars into the State Bentley to the Abbey. There he walked arm in arm with the monarch, supported by a walking stick, before the Duke helped his mother to her seat and sat himself in the front row on the opposite side. One well placed insider said: “Both the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge reluctantly accepted that hewould travel with the Queen to the Abbey as they both live in Windsor.  “It was arguably palatablesimply down to logistics, but it goes without saying that most of the family were absolutely dismayed to see him walking the Queen up the aisle in full view of the entire congregation and broadcast cameras.” Charles,  and William, , have previously held private talks on how they deal with Andrew moving forward, both seemingly aware of his wish not to retire. Sources close to Andrew have suggested he “still believes he has much to offer the family and public service in general”, opening up the possibility he is aiming for a role for the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations this summer. Senior royal sources say that while Charles and William do not want him at official engagements, one insider added: “Ultimately as this episode shows, it’s up to the Queen - andshe wants Andrew there he will be there.”The possibility means there is scope for Andrew to attend the Jubilee service of thanksgiving in St Paul’s Cathedral on June , which will be considered a family occasion. Joe Little, of Majesty magazine, suggested: “I think he will be there. “Although the Queen is head of state, she is also head of the family as well and in that capacity all her children should be with her.” Clarence House today declined to comment on whether the Prince of Wales was supportive of the decision for Andrew to walk alongside the Queen, and Kensington Palace has yet to comment on where the Duke of Cambridge stands on the issue. Andrew has spent a considerable amount of time with the ailing -year-old monarch, who has suffered from a series of health problems in recent months as well as recovering from Covid. The Duke of York, who lives on the Windsor estate, has also been ever present at his mother’s Windsor Castle home after the death of her beloved husband Prince Philip, who died last April aged . Another source said: “There is definitely a hand being played. “Hewas straight out the blocks in front of the cameras when the Duke of Edinburgh died, which was seen within the family as being completely inappropriate. “Now this situation has unfolded, a fair few hold the view that heis manipulating his position for his own gains.  “The Duke of York’s reputation precedes him and he’s made no secret that he’s not ready to fade away into the background, as much as everyone may want him to.” A source close to Prince Andrew said: “In his mind the situation with the allegations and the court case is firmly closed. “There is no case to answer, he settled for the good of the family and that’s that. “He’s very much of the view that he is a young man and has plenty to offer. “He’s not going to just sit at home and do nothing until the end of his days.”  Andrew had been banished from royal le, first bowing out of royal duties in  after his disastrous Newsnight appearance over his friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. This January, he was stripped of his honorary military titles and patronages by the Queen, and forced to relinquish using his HRH style amid his legal battle. Virginia Giuffre, now , was suing him for allegedly sexually assaulting her when she was  after being trafficked by Epstein. At the time, Buckingham Palace said: “The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending this case as a private citizen.” Andrew remains in the line of succession, and is also still a Counsellor of State. In the event the Queen cannot undertake her official duties as sovereign on a temporary basis due to illness or absence abroad, two or more Counsellors of State are appointed by Letters Patent to act in her place. Buckingham Palace did not comment. A spokesperson for the Duke of York was unavailable for comment.

The family-run firm, based in Wrexham, produces textiles including T-shirts and printed bags – and they’ve been keen to attract younger people to roles. “One of the issues we have is the perception of manufacturing as being something we used to do in the Victorian age but no longer,” says director Ben Bristow. “Of course that’s not the case – but it made it hard to attract young people. Working with Jobcentre Plus gave us the ability to get more young people into the business and provide them with a good grounding in print and textiles.  “Our staff collaborated really well with the team at Jobcentre Plus, who gave excellent support and deserve high praise indeed.” HR manager Lee Dixon, , agrees: “The people who work there have done a fantastic job. It’s not been easy through Covid and the fact they’ve managed to help people into work is great. “It’s also massively helpful to us as an employer, given there are loads of jobs but not enough people to fill them. Through working with the team at Jobcentre Plus we’ve built up a great rapport. They’ve been first-class. “Our recruits have been a massive help in bringing in valuable skills to our business,” says Lee. “We’ve had them working in packing, admin, sewing and sales. Another guy has got a position in sustainability after he joined us from university. We’ve also had people with additional learning needs and disabilities.”apos My team made me feel very welcome and supported me apos “When I left college in January  I didn’t finish my A levels because I wanted a change, but then obviously the pandemic happened. I didn’t particularly know what I wanted to do, but I knew I would be good in a computer-based job because it’s something that I’ve gravitated towards. “Then I saw JD Sports was advertising opportunities and I thought I’d go for it because it was an administration role in a big company. It was actually the first that I applied for and everything went through really quickly – and I got the job. “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel very welcome and supported me. Day to day I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me pretty much a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since. “I’d always had an interest in HR, but after working for six months I realised it was what I wanted to do. “There was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD and CIPD Level  in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year and I’m really enjoying it. Starting work was quite tough, but I’ve got so much support from my team. It’s a lot more friendly than I expected it to be.“Now I’m learning about dferent parts of HR, building on what I was doing before. I was struggling to find any job with noexperience, but now I’ll just keep going.”Peter Cowgill, executive chairman of JD Sports, on how the company has forged links with Jobcentre Plus. “We are proud to have worked with Jobcentre Plus to provide much-needed employment and learning and development opportunities at a time when competition for job positions has been at an all-time high. Social inequality has only been exacerbated during the pandemic, so it has never been more vital to give young people a chance to succeed. “Our relationship with the DWP now covers all three nations across the UK and gives our stores, head office and distribution centres access to new talent pipelines and initiatives, which not only facilitates our future recruitment needs, but also allows us to support candidates facing social barriers, an area we are hugely passionate about.” “When I was developing my start-up in the renewable energy sector, working with Jobcentre Plus allowed me to recruit new graduates. “We’re part of the Edinburgh Business School incubator, where we get office space, mentoring and support. Since the graduates joined, we’ve moved to the stage of building a prototype.“If it wasn’t for the scheme, recruitment would have been years away –and having a few more minds to work on the concept has given us a competitive edge.“The candidates knew when they joined that they wouldn’t just be working on their own tasks and would be learning something every single day. If you’re looking for experience, it’s a great way to get it.”apos It’s important to personalise our service apos “Our service helps employers and our customers meet each other face to face, which is crucial. Employer advisers speak to both employers and the Work Coaches, who’ll send customers over who are ready for work. “We can also help employers st through CVs and hold training events to get people work-ready and match them up with the role they’ve got available. “I’ve been working closely with Lee at Paul Bristow Associates, who came along to events at the jobcentre where groups of young people could come and speak to him about what roles they had available. “A lot of employers weren’t aware of all the great services we offer, but the feedback we’ve been getting has all been really positive. Every employer’s needs are slightly dferent, so personalising our service is really important. “There are lots of sectors that are struggling to fill places, so we can help companies find a pool of candidates. We have large manufacturing areas in North Wales that are struggling to recruit people.

I realised how amazing it was on fuel reaching an average of mpg and that it was really nice to drive, he said. Although the estate agent already has a car he loves, he thought he could use this one for long motorway journeys to avoid adding miles to his main vehicle, and with a few tweaks, he could use it as a camper. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. He said: Iaposve always wanted to do a van build but theyaposre just too expensive for me so I improvised with a car. As the car was originally a budget buy, getting it painted or wrapped was going to cost a lot more than he had paid in the first place. So, he decided to do it himself - using a home sander and some basic wall paint. He said: A professional respray was going to be about £ and a wrap-around £ which was way more than the car was even worth. It was summertime so evenings were light so I thought aposWhy not. If it doesnapost go to plan it wonapost be a huge loss andit pays off it might look pretty cool and be a little project to keep me busy!apos  He headed to Wickes to have a look for his options, keeping it as cheap as possible. He said: I didnapost know anyone that had done this before so asked the employees at Wickes for advice. They were very worried and doubted the idea but I went ahead anyway and just bought some normal wall and ceiling house paint. After choosing a tin of the Wickes own brand walls and ceiling paint in midnight black for £, he also bought a sander for £ and a roller for £, bringing the total to £. Jordan spent a day sanding the surface of the whole car to make it rough, helping the paint stick. And the next day, he was ready to paint.He said: I got my roller brush out and began rolling the paint onto the car asit was my bedroom wall at home! I remember it being so hot at the time and the paint was drying instantly on the car. My parents and neighbours were worried the paint would come off as soon as it rained and ruin the driveways with matt black paint. It got me thinking maybe this was a bad idea but it was too late to go back. After applying two coats over the course of a day, the red was completely covered. Jordan said: I finished painting the car and it looked awesome! Then it was an anxious wait until the rain came down to seeall my hard work would turn into my car going back to its original colour and an invoice from the neighbours for a new driveway. Luckily, when the rain came, the paint all stayed on the car.He said: All the paint was completely stuck to the car. There was a really good hold Iaposm guessing because I sanded it down first. There were a couple of gaps I couldnapost get to with the brush that I filled in with black spray paint. It was all done and ready to decorate with some stickers and put the original badges back on to make it look like a factory finish. I wasted no time and the next day the car was packed and ready for my first car camping trip. To make it more comfortable, he picked up a foam mattress, window covers and a TV from Facebook marketplace for a total of around £. He put the seats down and cut the foam mattress to fit, then attached the TV between the front seats, facing the back. And this way everything can be folded up when driving. Jordan has already made use of it with trips to the Lake District, Peak District, Wales and Broadstairs. He also made sure to noty the DVLA of the caraposs colour change, which is a legal requirement. Now six months on, the paint has held up well and Jordan is pleased with the outcome.He said: I have had a few knocks and scrapes but I just got my roller out again and rolled straight back over it and itaposs good as new again. After posting videos on TikTok, Jordan has had thousands of views, with one being watched by over . million people. One said: Mateeee that looks so class, and for £! [sic] Another added: Looks good. I have always wanted to do this to a car but never had a car were the paint work is bad enough to justy it haha. A third wrote: How did the paint come out so well for a £ job. This man needs to paint full-time. Someone  said: First time Iaposve seen a car transformation that isnapost sh*t. A fth explained: The sanding made all the dference you done a fab job. Jordan said: I posted the video online nearly six months after I had painted the car as I didnapost think anyone would really care about it!However I was wrong, the video instantly started soaring with nearly k views in the first couple of days. Five days later it has reached over  million views with hundreds asking me how I did it, what steps I took and what paint I used! I guess they all want to attempt it themselves! My advice to people wanting to give this a go would be Prep is key, sand the car first and mask off areas you donapost want paint on! e.g windows and lights. Be patient, cars are big canvases and it does take a bit of time. Pick a car that has paint imperfections so it doesnapost matter as muchyou do a bad job. Put a clear coat on top. I didnapost do this and everything clings to the paint so easily so it does get dirty fast!Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

However the Sussexes decided not to attend and also opted against releasing a statement or a tribute to Harryaposs grandfather to mark the day. The announcement came amid a row over his security in the UK, with Harry saying it wasnapost safe for him to bring his family here. Royal expert Ingrid Seward, author of Prince Philip Revealed, tells The Mirror she believes their silence speaks volumes.She said: The wall of silence was as loud asthey had shouted from the abbey rafters. The normally verbose duke and duchess of Sussex said nothing. No spokesperson spewed out long sentences of undecipherable wordage. There were no flowers with the florists name proudly displayed. No comments from Archwell. Nothing. Not even a word from their supporters on ious social media accounts. Harry used his Archwell website to share a moving tribute to his grandfather after his death last year, describing him as master of the barbecue, legend of banter, and cheeky right ‘til the end.Sheaposs also criticised Harry and Meghanaposs decision not to attend and says fears that their appearance would overshadow the event were not accurate.There has been a great deal of criticism about Prince Harry ’s absence from his grandfather’s memorial service. But no reason given as to why he chose not to attend from Harry himself.A couple of weeks ago he instructed his spokesperson to say he wouldn’t be going. That was it.  What a missed opportunity it was not to bring Meghan and the children to join the extended royal family, European cousins and of course Archie’s contemporaries. Their appearance would not have erted attention away from the Queen. It was her day and no one could take that away from her not even her favourite son the Duke of York who guided her to her seat. The only explanation is that neither one of them wanted to go. There would have been no security problems. The whole Abbey was bristling with secret service men to guard the biggest gathering of royalty, politicians and top army brass since the London wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Harry must have known it would look petulant and rude. Andhe did not Meghan would have. If it was a pointed snub to the whole royal family and it went sour. Of course, the Queen would have been told well in advance. Harry keeps in constant touch with his grandmother for many reasons. I am sure he spoke to his father too. But nothing excuses his absence evenMeghan and the children stayed away. He will not get another opportunity to pay his respects in public to the grandfather who always supported him. He has upset too many influential people too many times. It is something he will live to regret.

An octagonal spiral staircase with small windows sits at the corner of the property and leads owners to each floor of the stone building. And potential buyers will be able to relax on the rooftop terrace and look out onto stunning panoramic views over the River Tay to the Lomond Hills.Would you live here  Have your say in the comment section The castellated tower was built in the centre of a deep forest close to another historical landmark, the A-listed Kinfauns Castle. It has recently undergone some repair work, including the replacement of joists and the addition of a roof to make it watertight from the top. Estate agents Thorntons are hoping potential buyers will be able to transform the historical landmark into a family home after seeking planning permission.  They described the sale as a truly rare and unique purchase opportunity, adding: The B-listed Binnhill Tower is a stone-built, four- storey, Gothic tower with a stunning hilltop location in the picturesque village of Kinfauns, surrounded by mature woodlands, and with spectacular panoramic views over the River Tay to the Lomond Hills. This prominent landmark represents a truly rare and unique opportunity for anyone seeking a historic and romantic building that is ripe for a Grand Designs-style transformation.  The castellated tower was built by Francis Gray, the th Lord Gray, as an observatory and focal point within the luscious estate grounds of Kinfauns Castle, an imposing A-listed Gothic mansion. The tower has lapsed planning permission to be restored and converted into a dwelling, and it comes with a small footprint of land. There may be potential to negotiate with the Forestry Commission the purchase of additional land as well.  Thorntons announced the new listing on social media this week, saying: Have you ever dreamt of owning your own fairytale property  Perhaps wondered what it would be like to live in a tower, guarded by a dragon, waiting to be rescued by a mighty hero  Well, wonder no more. As the phenomenal Binnhill Tower has come to market, ready to make your property dream come true.  Hundreds of followers have liked the posts, which has garnered almost  comments and dozens of likes and shares. Tracy Smith said: I am sure there is a Rapunzel out there. Gill Smith wrote: A wee fixer upper. Ruthana Duncan commented: This screams archery house to me. Youaposd have a whole forest for target practice. Binnhill castle was commissioned by Francis Gray, th Lord Gray and completed by prominent architect William Mackenzie.  Lord Gray was a member of the House of Lords in  - . He used the tower as an observatory and talking point to discuss policies with his peers. Thorntons listed the property earlier this week for offers over £,.

Free testing for the general public ends on Friday as part of the Living with Covid plan which last month set out the government’s strategy to live with and manage the virus.From  April, updated guidance will advise people with symptoms of a respiratory infection, including Covid-, and a high temperature or who feel unwell, to try stay at home and avoid contact with other people, until they feel well enough to resume normal activities and they no longer have a high temperature, the Department of Health and Social Care says.Until this date, people should continue to follow the current guidance. Children and young people who are unwell and have a high temperature should also stay at home and avoid contact with other people, where they can. They can go back to school, college or childcare when they no longer have a high temperature, and they are well enough to attend.  From April , anyone with a positive Covid- test result will be advised to try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people for  days, which is when they are most infectious. Advice will be provided for iniduals who need to leave their home when they have symptoms or have tested positive, including avoiding close contact with people with a weakened immune system, wearing a face-covering and avoiding crowded places. Dame Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said: As we learn to live with Covid, we are focusing our testing provision on those at higher risk of serious outcomes from the virus, while encouraging people to keep following simple steps to help keep themselves and others safe. The pandemic is not over and how the virus will develop over time remains uncertain. Covid still poses a real risk to many of us, particularly with case rates and hospitalisations on the rise. That is why it is sensible to wear a mask in enclosed spaces, keep indoor spaces ventilated and stay away from othersyou have any symptoms of a respiratory illness, including Covid.  Vaccination remains the best way to protect us all from severe disease and hospitalisation due to Covid infection. If you have not yet come forward for your primary or booster I would urge you to do so straight away – the NHS vaccine programme is there to help you and the sooner you are vaccinated the sooner you and your family and friends will be protected.Under the plans set out free symptomatic testing will be provided for: Patients in hospital, where a PCR test is required for their care and to provide access to treatments and to support ongoing clinical surveillance for new iants People who are eligible for community Covid- treatments because they are at higher risk of getting seriously ill from Covid-. People in this group will be contacted directly and sent lateral flow tests to keep at home for usethey have symptoms as well as being told how to reorder tests People living or working in some high-risk settings. For example, staff in adult social care services such as homecare organisations and care homes, and residents in care homes and extra care and supported living services, NHS workers and those working and living in hospices, and prisons and places of detention , where infection needs to be identied quickly to minimise outbreaks. People will also be tested before being discharged from hospital into care homes, hospices, homelessness settings and domestic abuse refuges. Asymptomatic lateral flow testing will continue from April in some high-risk settings where infection can spread rapidly while prevalence is high. This includes patient-facing staff in the NHS and NHS-commissioned Independent Healthcare Providers, staff in hospices and adult social care services, such as homecare organisations and care homes, a small number of care home visitors who provide personal care, staff in some prisons and places of detention and in high risk domestic abuse refuges and homelessness settings.Testing will be provided for residential SEND, care home staff and residents during an outbreak and for care home residents upon admission. This also includes some staff in prisons and immigration removal centres.

This means he could join the Queen at St Paulaposs Cathedral on June  as she officially celebrates her th year on the throne. It comes after Andrew controversially walked Her Majesty into Westminster Abbey for her late husbandaposs memorial service. The Queen reportedly overruled William and Charles by allowing her second son to chaperone her on Tuesday. It was his first public appearance since settling Virginia Giuffreaposs civil sex abuse claim. Prince Andrew denies all allegations related to the case and the settlement was not an admission.  Plans for the Duke of York to travel to the service alongside the Queen were made at the last minute, although he was expected to stay behind her as they entered St Paulaposs, it is claimed. However, in a sign of support for her son, the monarch held his arm as she walked into the cathedral. Although Andrew has been stripped of any official role in the Queenaposs Jubilee, a royal source told The Times he is not ruled out from attending family events.The Queen reportedly told Prince William and Prince Charles it was her “final decision” that Andrew would accompany her front and centre of her late husband’s memorial service.Both royals went out of their way to warn the Queen that being seen publicly with Prince Andrew might not go down well after the accusations he faced - despite him denying all accusations made against him. Both senior Royal Family members reportedly warned her about the optics of such a move “on more than one occasion”.The two future kings were “absolutely united” against Andrew having a prominent position in the ceremony. They thought it was “simply unnecessary” for Andrew to position himself as the only person to escort the Queen to church. But, regardless of their protests, and accusations against Andrew, the -year-old told them that it was “her wish” that he chaperone her into the Abbey.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Prince Andrew looked “defiant” as he walked through St Paulaposs alongside the Queen, a body language expert is reported to have said.. Body language expert Judi James said Andrew was blanked by all the royals apart from the Queen.She told the Daily Mail: “Taking his place next to Edward he cut an isolated but defiant-looking figure, but there were no glances or even nods of greeting and no discernible eye contact.The eye-avoidance looked deliberate, with most of the Firm staring pointedly ahead as though barely even aware of him.”She pointed out how Edward and Sophie have been used by the Royal Family as buffers on other occasions but there was no “warmth” this time. And she honed in on the closeness of the relationship that the Queen has with Andrew. Ms James said: The message from the Queen about her prodigal son Andrew looked unequivocal today. As her eldest son Charles is fond of saying, this is now clearly a aposnon-negotiableapos relationship.

He has let the Queen down once again, says Polly HudsonThe Duke of York, right, with his late father Prince Philip and mother Queen Elizabeth Image: Getty ImagesopinionByPolly Hudson:,  Mar |comments It doesn’t feel that controversial an opinion to say that I never want to see Prince Andrew again.Hard not to assume that most people feel the same way. So it seems impossible that Andrew, and those around him, aren’t aware of that. They must know exactly how popular he is, and that there is nothing that will ever change that.Of course Andrew is entitled to go to a memorial service for his father – but it is utterly tone deaf of him not to have read the room. He clearly should have slipped into the building quietly, sat somewhere discreet, tried to be as invisible as possible. To instead arrogantly rock up front and centre stage, even travelling in a car with the star of the show, is appalling behaviour, even by his standards.If his mother needed assistance on the journey, and down the aisle, there are plenty of other family members who could – who should – have been by her side instead.Andrew has let the poor Queen down, yet again, on what was already a testing day for many reasons. He shouldn’t have put her in that position, he should have insisted on travelling alone, being seated separately, definitely not in the front row, of all places.Sitting smugly in the hot seat makes it seem like he doesn’t understand the seriousness of what has happened, the cloud over him that will never go away – or that he simply doesn’t care. In reality it’s hardly a shock that Andrew hasn’t done the right thing –he was man of honour and integrity he would have nothing to apologise for. Which, let’s never forget, he never has. Palace insiders believe that after today he will effectively disappear from public le. Good riddance.

The ceremony, which saw , people pack into Westminster Abbey, remembered Her Majestyaposs husband of  years and his incredible legacy. The event was in stark contrast to his funeral, held just over a week after his death aged  last April.It came at a time when the UK was in the grip of a coronavirus lockdown with restrictions meaning the funeral had to be vastly scaled back. Only  guests attended and one of the most heartbreaking images from that day was seeing the Queen having to sit by herself in St Georgeaposs Chapel - away from any of her family members.  However, it seems that in her handbag that day, she carried around two rather personal items in order to give her comfort. One of those items was said to be a photo of the couple as newlyweds that she carried in her handbag. The photo is believed to have been one of her and Philip in Malta which had a special place in their hearts.

Philip was stationed on the Mediterranean island from  until  as a naval officer with HMS Magpie. The then-Princess Elizabeth was able to live a more normal le in Malta and it was one of the happiest times for her and Philip before she became Queen.Meanwhile, according to the Daily Mail, another item she took was a white handkerchief made by Savile Row tailors Kent  Haste that were a Philip trademark. He would have them folded into squares in a classic style and put into his breast pocket.Meanwhile, on Tuesday, the Queen made a sweet tribute to her husband at his memorial service. She had been actively involved in the planning of the fitting memorial service and she ensured there were plenty of personal touches at the event. And among the sweet tributes that were made to Philip at the event was one dated back to the day Her Majesty married Philip in November  - in the same Abbey. Thataposs because the flowers in the church for the memorial service were in shades of patriotic red, white and blue, with larger arrangements featuring blue eryngium – known as sea holly – a nod to the duke’s career in the Royal Navy, and his lelong affection for the sea. Meanwhile, the smaller posies included white dendrobium orchids - the flowers that appeared in Princess Elizabeth’s wedding bouquet when she married Philip in .

The Duke of York, her favourite son, remains promoted despite stomach-churning behaviour that shouldaposve seen tainted Andrew seated out of sight at the back behind a pillar. Perhaps age and frailty are distorting her judgement because this was a colossal mistake by a declining monarch. She put her son and family before decency, trying to sell a leper to the country at a service commemorating her husband. Knee-bending courtiers will struggle from now on to argue sheaposs principled and does what is right in the service of the country.  She held on to Andrewaposs arm but it was her parading him. He continues to deny the claim but embracing the humiliated sex case settler damaged her own reputation. After the disastrous royal colonial relic tour of the Caribbean, the head of the creaking institution also undermined a family business suddenly feeling very out of date.

And it appears she overruled her eldest son Prince Charles and grandson Prince William to allow Andrew to perform the special role at the ceremony.It came just weeks after Andrew, who has stepped down from public le, reportedly paid a £million out of court to settle a civil sexual assault case with a woman he said he had never met. The future kings were “absolutely united” that it was “simply unnecessary” for Andrew to position himself as the only family member to escort the Queen to the church. But well-placed sources have confirmed the -year-old monarch told them it was “her wish and final decision” that Andrew should chaperone her into the Abbey. Itaposs long been thought that Andrew is Her Majestyaposs favourite son, and sheaposs said to have had a far more hands-on relationship with him when he was a child than his older brother Charles.Royal expert Penny Junor once said: I think the Queen has always had a bit of a blind spot when it comes to Prince Andrew. But given his fall from grace in recent years, the Queen has had to make some dficult decisions when it comes to Andrew - despite seemingly having a close relationship with him... No more public duties Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.One of the first times the Queen had to take action against Andrew was in  after he gave a car crash interview on BBC Newsnight about his association with Jeffrey Epstein.Andrewaposs royal role diminished as his mother approved him stepping back from public le and reportedly cancelled a milestone birthday party.In the days after the interview, Andrew said in a statement: It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support. Therefore, I have asked Her MajestyI may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission. I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein. Bombshell decision Meanwhile, another seemingly dficult choice the Queen has made when it comes to Andrew was dealing the blow of stripping him of his honorary military titles and royal patronages. It came when it looked as though his civil sex case was heading to a trial - before he settled with his accuser Virginia Giuffre.Andrew was said to be utterly devastated by his mother’s bombshell decision, which came after the Sunday People exclusively revealed Her Majesty would reluctantly strip her son of his prized roleshe did not resign.A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said in January: With The Queen’s approval and agreement, The Duke of York’s military affiliations and Royal patronages have been ed to The Queen. The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending this case as a private citizen. A royal source said: All of The Duke’s roles have been handed back to The Queen with immediate effect for redistribution to other Members of the Royal Family - will notto The Duke of York. The Duke of York will no longer use the style ‘His Royal Highness’ in any official capacity. Ever-present at Her Majestyaposs side  However, despite overseeing her sonaposs withdrawal from public le, it has been reported he has remained close to her in family le. Andrew has spent a considerable amount of time with the ailing -year-old monarch, who has suffered from a series of health problems in recent months as well as recovering from Covid. The Duke of York, who lives on the Windsor estate, has also been ever-present at his mother’s Windsor Castle home after the death of her husband, who died last April aged .According to the Daily Mailaposs Richard Kay, his brothers and Princess Anne were grateful for his attentiveness and that his proximity to the castle meant he could spend time with their mother.Special role  But his special role at Philipaposs memorial service on Tuesday appears to have shocked other Royal Family members. Andrew was in the memorial order of service to arrive with other members of the family and his daughters at the West Door. But he travelled in a Range Rover with the Queen from Windsor Castle to Buckingham Palace, before changing cars into the State Bentley to the Abbey.There he walked arm in arm with the monarch, supported by a walking stick, before the Duke helped his mother to her seat and sat himself in the front row on the opposite side. One well placed insider said: “Both the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge reluctantly accepted that hewould travel with the Queen to the Abbey as they both live in Windsor. “It was arguably palatablesimply down to logistics, but it goes without saying that most of the family were absolutely dismayed to see him walking the Queen up the aisle in full view of the entire congregation and broadcast cameras.” Jubilee  So could Andrew now take part in Jubilee celebrations later this year in June  It has been reported that Charles,  and William, , have previously held private talks on how they deal with Andrew moving forward. Sources close to Andrew have suggested he “still believes he has much to offer the family and public service in general”, opening up the possibility he is aiming for a role for the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations this summer. Senior royal sources say that while Charles and William do not want him at official engagements, one insider added: “Ultimately as this episode shows, it’s up to the Queen - andshe wants Andrew there he will be there.” Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Prince Philip, Duke of EdinburghPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal FamilyQueen\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Having paid off his accuser Virgin Giuffre with a reported £million just three weeks ago, his brother Prince Charles and nephew Prince William had made their opinions clear to the Queen, over Andrewaposs role in Prince Phillipaposs memorial. They did not want Andrew to be the one to accompany Her Majesty into the service on Tuesday, and reportedly spoke to her more than once to raise their concerns. The Queen went ahead and her so-called favourite son was the one seen across the world helping her along the aisle at Westminster Abbey, as the service was broadcast live on the BBC. The two heirs to the throne were said to have been “shocked” and dismayed” as Andrew emerged front and centre. A source close to the Palace told the Mirror: [Andrew] was straight out the blocks in front of the cameras when the Duke of Edinburgh died, which was seen within the family as being completely inappropriate. “Now this situation has unfolded, a fair few hold the view that he is manipulating his position for his own gains.  “The Duke of York’s reputation precedes him and he’s made no secret that he’s not ready to fade away into the background, as much as everyone may want him to.” While a source close to Andrew added: “In his mind the situation with the allegations and the court case is firmly closed. “There is no case to answer, he settled for the good of the family and that’s that. Get the latest royal news and gossip you want straight to your inbox.toone of the Mirroraposs newsletters“He’s very much of the view that he is a young man and has plenty to offer. “He’s not going to just sit at home and do nothing until the end of his days.” Andrew has spent a considerable amount of time with the ailing -year-old monarch, who has suffered from a series of health problems in recent months as well as recovering from Covid.  The Duke of York, who lives on the Windsor estate, has also been ever present at his mother’s Windsor Castle home after the death of her beloved husband Prince Philip, who died last April aged .It is believed he still holds ambitions of staging an unlikelyto front line royal duties, despite being banished being stripped of all his royal titles over Ms Giuffreaposs allegations that he sexually assaulted her in , when she was a -year-old former sex slave of his paedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein.. Andrew has always strenuously denied the allegations.

However, in order to see the light show, the skies will need to be clear enough.  It comes after a Geomagnetic Disturbance Alert was issued this week, meaning an M-class solar flare caused a coronal mass ejectionon March . A CME can cause tangled magnetic fields and result in geomagnetic storms when they reach Earth. Although largely harmless, they cause temporary disturbance to the Earthaposs magnetic field. This can lead to problems with GPS, power system bugs and high-frequency radio signals, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Northern Lights are predicted to go across large swaths of the UK, but the Met Office has forecast an unsettled week of weather.This means there will be a lot of cloud cover across most areas, making it dficult to see the light show. In parts of Scotland, specically Dumfries and Galloway, the skies should be clear tonight.  In Northern Ireland, skies will also be clearer tonight than Thursday night. In England, it is not as promising as the next few days are expected to be cloudy in Leeds, Middlesbrough, Newcastle, and much of Northumberland. Those one Manchester and Carlisle will have a better chance tonight as the skies are expected to be clearer. Solar activity has been rising and falling naturally every  years, according to scientic observations.  Although the pattern is not quite like clockwork and astronomers believe we are now entering a period of increased solar activity that could peak in . In , a new family of sunspots was found on the surface of our star. This produced the biggest solar flare seen by astronomers since . Such storms have also caused the Earthaposs atmosphere to warm and expand in the past. But the current flares are not expected to cause major disruption.

Oregon Department of Transportation compared the incident to the Disney Pixar film series, joking the toys may have been on their way to Pizza Planet. Don Hamilton, DOT spokesperson, said one lane was closed to the cartoon creatures, but said most of them were already to the side of the road. “It’s not often we get several hundred stuffed animals visiting our highways,” he added. It was not immediately clear where the toys came from. Hamilton claried they had, however, been taken to the North Portland maintenance yard for care and feeding.In a tweet, Oregon DOT said: This Toy Story was found on SB I- at Burnside Bridge. We think they may have been on their way to Pizza Planet, but weaposre not exactly sure how they got there. Crews have taken them to our north Portland maintenance yard for care, cuddles and feeding. Anyone missing approximately  colourful stuffed animals were encouraged to contact the department. Twitter users were keen to get in on the joke, with one replying: Be sure to check under any traffic cones!He was referring to the scene in Toy Story  in which some of Andyaposs toys hide under traffic cones as they cross a busy road on their way to rescuing Buzz Lightyear. Another said: Some poor kid got to the find out stage of fooling around in the back seat whilst mom was trying to drive. A third hypothesised the toys probably fell off a truck that was for a vending machine and suggested they be donated to a local childrenaposs hospital.It comes days after police in the UK were alerted to a tiger on the loose, only to find it was a stuffed toy.  GMP Oldham Police posted a photo on Facebook of the oversized cuddly toy - which they named Tony the Tiger - laying in some grass.They explained a concerned member of the public had called  after spotting what they thought was a live wild predator prowling around a garden area. The pageaposs administrator joked that officers at the scene asked Tony for a comment and he said: Theyaposre grrrrrrrreat!

Ivy Adelle was eventually diagnosed with a rare blood disorder after experiencing gruelling symptoms.The -year-old estate agent from San Francisco, US, first began feeling unwell as a teenager. At  she became very weak and noticed her stomach starting to swell. She ignored the signs of illness despite experiencing frequent nausea and seeing her urine change to the colour of cola. Ivy got her period at the beginning of that school year but two months later she realised she hadnapost had another. Have you been through a similar experience to Ivy  Let us know at webnews@mirrorEventually, she became so fatigued she would often fall asleep during lessons. She only began to panic when she had a period at the end of the school year and the blood was a blackish colour. “I was fearful, I thought I had cancer or something was really wrong with me,” she said. Ivy was scared to go to the doctors because it was expensive and she didnapost want to burden her parents, in case she was actually fine and just overreacting. She put her struggles to focus at school down to her own lack of care or that she wasnapost trying hard enough.Ivy knew that girls sometimes stop having periods due to amenorrhea and because she was a little underweight assumed that was the reason.“I felt like I had sandbags all over my body, as well as severe headaches and bouts of mood swings, loss of appetite and some minor pains, she explained.Her stomach also became somewhat large and felt stf and continued to get worse until she was hospitalised four weeks later. That summer - June  - Ivy fainted in front of her parents and she was rushed to hospital via ambulance.At first, she was told that she had an eating disorder as she was pale and her blood sugar was low. But doctors soon found that she was actually suffering from organ failure and was at risk of dying. Ivy said: “I was shocked to realise I was dying and this is what slow death felt like. She described herself as very much out of it due to her low blood levels and the news was pretty terrying. Doctors told Ivy to call her closest friends and family but she felt upset and angry as well as numb due to the severe pain.  She said: “I felt like I was being punished by le and I wanted to enjoy my friends and family - I was so young. Ivy was diagnosed with auto-immune haemolytic anaemia along with cold agglutinins disease and antiphospholipid syndrome.But at the time, they didnapost realise it was caused by systemic lupus, as testing can take several years.Finally, in June , Ivy was diagnosed with lupus - where the immune system attacks healthy tissues and organs.Auto-immune haemolytic disease is a rare red blood cell disorder that produces antibodies to destroy these cells and is coupled with cold agglutinins – the onset – as well as antiphospholipid syndrome, which causes the antibodies by mistake. It is believed that the blood disease was a result of Ivy’s undiagnosed lupus, coupled with severe amounts of stress. As she needed a blood transfusion immediately, she was flown to a hospital in Sacramento, Calornia, which has specialists in the disease. Ivy said it was a race against time to find a blood match.  Usually blood for a transfusion is heated up but there was such a rush they had to put it in cold. Her best friend brought Ivyaposs mum and sisters to visit her in the hospital - an act of kindness Iaposll never forget, she added. Constant testing and drugs continued, but Ivy said sometimes this didnapost even touch it. “I wouldn’t laugh or smile because my body was in an immense amount of pain, but my brain hurt far worse than my body, she said. Ivy went on to do a lot of deep digging and cognitive behavioural therapy to help her cope. She felt it was important to have mental clarity and seek forgiveness for the things that have affected me. Her blood disease has stayed in remission, though Ivy did fall ill again around four years ago and it has taken a long time to recover again. Her lupus flared up severely and she was treated with the wrong drug which caused her to go into anaphylaxis, she explained. She couldnapost breathe and was put on an intense treatment programme. Ivy still suffers from chronic pain and has since developed fibromyalgia – a long-term condition which causes pain all over the body – after a car accident. As this causes sensory issues for her skin, she has to be careful about the clothes she wears and as she also has many food allergies, she is very mindful about the food she eats. “My goal is to figure out all the factors that trigger this and share my journey with others, she said.

Maria Sylvia said she first noticed the dark brown mark ten years ago - but thought nothing of it, as she was in and out of doctors all the time due to being an athlete.The Tik Toker - who has more than , followers - shared the news online after finding out it had probably been cancerous for the last three years. Doctors tol her it was subungual melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer that takes hold in the skin under your nails She said on her page @invrfoundwaldo : No one really noticed it until one time a doctor did notice it. This was probably circa , and they were like, aposoh, thataposs oddapos. But you donapost really fit the demographics. Maria, from the US, was offered surgery in which doctors removed her nail and part of the bone. She said: “Melanoma can sit in a stage called in situ, which is kind of like stage zero, for up to  years. “So itaposs very likely that this has just been sitting for  years and itaposs been maybe cancerous for the last three, itaposs kind of hard to tell.” When she woke up she had a cast covering her entire hand and stopped her thumb from moving as it recovered.Mariaaposs thumb was given a skin graft, with doctors taking flesh from her arm. Sheaposs now waiting to see what the final result will look like. He video, which has reached  million people, has left viewers worried about their own similar streaks. Medical advice warns that you should go and see a doctoryou see a change in size, colour, or shape of the nails. If your nail separates from the nail bed, bleeds, thins or cracks or has a bruise that wonapost go away - it could be a sign something is wrong. Melanoma is the worst form of skin cancer and is usually caused by eexposure to UV rays.

According to experts at language-learning app Babbel, there are nine names in particular that may sound perfectly pleasant to English ears, but may well have less than adorable, or even downright offensive, meanings outside of the UK. As previously reported byThe Sun,language experts have urged parents-to-be to make sure theyaposre aware of what meanings and connotations these names take when translated into dferent languages.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The linguists continued: This can tell you more about where the name is from culturally and what it means in the context of this culture. Additionally, while this can often result in funny coincidences, occasionally the results can be a little awkward, so itaposs good to do your research beforehand. With this in mind, a list of nine names has been compiled which illustrates the sort of awkward scenarios parents may well find themselves inthey donapost conduct their all-important research.  First up is the name Mark, which will of course appeal to parents wishing to instill confidence and leadership attributes in their child. This is because it originates from the Latin name Marcus - as in Marcus Aurelius - meaning ‘warlike’.However, over in Norway, the name Mark may not exactly reflect such courageous qualities, given that it sounds rather like the Norwegian word ‘mark’, which quite literally means worm. Not exactly the sort of animal many parents would want to be associated with their baby.Next is Todd, a name derived from the Middle English word for fox, and which will naturally appeal to fans of Disney classic, The Fox and the Hound. However, over in Germany, the word ‘tod’ wonapost sound nearly as cute, given that it means death.Originating from Old Norse, Eric means ‘eternal ruler’, and for many would feel like a strong choice for a new son. However, to Turkish ears, the name will sound similar to the far less mighty aposerikapos, which means plum. Nick, a popular abbreviation of Nicholas, is a powerful Ancient Greek name that combines words meaning ‘victory’ and ‘people’. Sadly, it also sounds quite similar to the present tense of the French verb ‘niquer’, which translates as aposf**kapos. No doubt this has caused some embarrassment over the years for Brits holidaying in France.A commonly used shortened version of William, Bill is a name of Germanic origin that means ‘vehement protector’. Unfortunately, in the Dutch language, it also sounds much like the word for buttocks, ‘bil’. The Hebrew meaning of Kayla is ‘crown, laurel’, which evokes a majestic feel, but this name is also quite similar to the Urdu word for banana , which really isnapost anywhere near as regal. The name Camilla is another one that has Latin origins, coming from the word for an acolyte - or a person who assists a priest - during a religious ceremony. However, it also sounds noticeably similar to the Greek word for camel . Lola is originally a sweet shortened version of the Spanish name Dolores. However, in Filipino, ‘lola’ means grandma, meaning some might regard it as quite an unusual name for a newborn baby. Possibly the most awkward of the bunch has to be Cara, a name of Latin origin which the beautul meaning ‘beloved one’. However, in Arabic, the similar-sounding word ‘khara’ quite literally means s**t.Do you have a baby name-related story to share  We pay for stories.

The miracle baby has been admitted to a hospital in the nearby city of Indore to be monitored by medics.  Mum Shaheen remains in the district hospital in Ratlam. It is unclear from reportsthe arrival is being treated as conjoined twins or one child. Local reports describe it as a baby but the condition is considered a rare form of partial twinning. One of the doctors, Dr. Lahoti, said: These kinds of cases are rare and the condition of babies remains uncertain, especially in the initial days. Due to this, we have kept them under observation. We have not planned for any surgery on the patient.  The doctors had told the parents that they have twins after conducting an ultrasound but were not aware of this condition.

Ukrainian officials say a new Freedom of Russia legion has been formed for demoralised troops turning their backs on the Russian invaders. It comes amid reports of plummeting morale among soldiers fighting the Kremlinaposs war - with some said to be refusing orders and even shooting down their own planes.The Russian armed forces personnel have already started training to fight alongside their new comrades, it is claimed. Pictures purportedly show Russians training alongside their new Ukrainian comrades. Yesterday the Ukrainian Defence Ministry said on its Telegram channel that commanders have been visiting captured and surrendered Russian troops in order to select those who wish to serve.  In a follow-up post it said that the first volunteers had already started inidual additional training. The ministry stated: Today the legionaposs personnel, under the guidance of Ukrainian Armed Forces instructors, studied a NLAW grenade launcher. In addition, the commanders of the legionaposs subisions got acquainted with the operational situation on the fronts. Members of the new legion have expressed a common desire on behalf of all the volunteers to conduct the first battle against the guard dogs of the Putin regime - the Kadyrovites. Kadyrovites refers to Chechen fighters loyal to Putin ally Ramzan Kadyrov, who has backed the invasion with troops. Ukrainian news site Bagnet says that several hundred Russians of all ranks had signed up for the legion.  It says that prisoners need to apply in writing, and are vetted by security and counter intelligence services. It is claimed that more than , troops Russian troops have been killed since the invasion was launched five weeks ago, with several top-level commanders among the dead. In a rare public address the head of Britainaposs GCHQ spy agency said Putinaposs advisers are scared to tell him the truth about the progress of his Ukraine invasion. But Sir Jeremy Fleming said the extent of the Russian leaderaposs misjudgements must be crystal clear to the regime. He said: Itaposs clear he misjudged the resistance of the Ukrainian people. He underestimated the strength of the coalition his actions would galvanise. He under-played the economic consequences of the sanctions regime. He over-estimated the abilities of his military to secure a rapid victory.  Weaposve seen Russian soldiers - short of weapons and morale - refusing to carry out orders, sabotaging their own equipment and even accidentally shooting down their own aircraft. And even though we believe Putinaposs advisers are afraid to tell him the truth, whataposs going on and the extent of these misjudgements must be crystal clear to the regime.He added: Itaposs become his personal war, with the cost being paid by innocent people in Ukraine and increasingly, by ordinary Russians too.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON GCHQRamzan KadyrovVladimir PutinSoldiersRussia Ukraine war\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He was formerly the director of LetterOne, a company that owns shares in health food company Holland  Barrett, before he stood down from the position earlier this month. Mr Fridman, who has lived in London for eight years, told Spanish news outlet El Pais that UK authorities should give him a “certain amount” to enable him to buy food and ride in a taxi. He acknowledged this would be a “very limited amount” in relation to the cost of living in London.  I can’t even pay in a restaurant,” he said. I have to eat at home and I am practically under house arrest. I’ve been in London for eight years, I’ve invested billions of dollars in Britain and other European countries and the answer to this is that they confiscate everything and throw me out.” Mr Fridman said the people who have been sanctioned would have toto Russia, where they would have “no choice but to be absolutely loyal”. There, they would continue to work, and would start businesses and create jobs, he said.Mr Fridman had previously expressed his views opposing Putinaposs invasion of Ukraine in an email to LetterOne Staff.He wrote about how the war would “cost lives and damage two nations”.  He wrote: I do not make political statements, I am a businessman with responsibilities to my many thousands of employees in Russia and Ukraine. I am convinced however that war can never be the answer. This crisis will cost lives and damage two nations who have been brothers for hundreds of years. While a solution seems frighteningly far off, I can only join those whose fervent desire is for the bloodshed to end.” He said he was “sure” his partners would share his view. The UK’s Foreign Secretary Liz Trus last week announced  further sanctions, including the one imposed on Alfa-Bank. Earlier this month the UK hit iniduals, businesses and banks with sanctions in response to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Truss said: These oligarchs, businesses and hired thugs are complicit in the murder of innocent civilians and it is right that they pay the price.  Putin should be under no illusions – we are united with our allies and will keep tightening the screw on the Russian economy to help ensure he fails in Ukraine. There will be no let-up. All those sanctioned today will have their assets in the UK frozen which means no UK citizen or company can do business with them, and iniduals subject to travel bans are also prohibited from travelling to or from the UK. Today’s sanctions will bring the total global asset value of the banks the UK has sanctioned since the invasion to £billion and the net worth of the oligarchs and family members in excess of £billion.

In a rare public address during a visit to Australia, the head of Britainaposs GCHQ spy agency said Putin had massively misjudged the situation. And he warned China not to become too closely aligned with the Kremlin. He said: Itaposs clear Putin misjudged the resistance of the Ukrainian people. He underestimated the strength of the coalition his actions would galvanise. He under-played the economic consequences of the sanctions regime. He over-estimated the abilities of his military to secure a rapid victory.

On China, he said the countryaposs long-term interests are not well served by an alliance with a leader that wilfully and illegally ignores the international rules of the road. His intervention comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson last week directly confronted President Xi Jinping over Beijingaposs stance on the conflict in Ukraine in what was described as a frank and candid discussion. On Thursday, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss will urge Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to work with other democracies to counter Mr Putinaposs aggression in Ukraine amid reluctance to publicly condemn the actions of Russia - a long-standing ally dating back to the Cold War.India, which is heavily reliant on Moscow for arms imports, has abstained in a series of votes in the United Nations on the issue. At home, the Prime Minister defended how quickly Ukrainians fleeing the conflict were being offered visas, as he was warned of the danger of refugee schemes turning into Tinder for sex traffickers.  Mr Johnson said it was important that checks both ways were being carried out before Ukrainian refugees could come to the UK - both to ensure those in need were who they said they were, and also that those offering help were fit to do so. Appearing in front of the Commons Liaison Committee, Mr Johnson said there had already been cases of people coming from that war zone who may not be entirely who they say they are after it was revealed just , visas have been granted to people wanting to come to the UK under the Homes For Ukraine scheme, despite applications reaching ,. The UN refugee agency said four million people have now fled Ukraine since Russia launched its war on February . Mr Johnson said: What I wanted was a system that was as light touch as possible and would enable people to come here, but would enable us also to do checks. We are outside the Schengen system, we have the advantage of being able to clary peopleaposs status,theyaposre bona fide - thataposs not a bad thingyou want to have a programme that really works and commands confidence.  Dame Diana Johnson, the Labour chair of the Home Affairs Committee, told Mr Johnson that some anti-slavery and refugee groups had warned that the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship risked operating as Tinder for sex traffickers. He said: I think that is one of the reasons why it is important to have as light touch as possible, but to have DBS checks and checks both ways to make sure we have a programme that is really working. Defending the rate of progress in resettling refugees, the Prime Minister added: These numbers are climbing. New laws were also announced on Wednesday which aim to prohibit the maintenance of aircraft or ships belonging to sanctioned Russian oligarchs or their businesses. The Foreign Office said the new powers, which have been laid in Parliament via a statutory instrument, had been used immediately to sanction Russian businessmen Eugene Shvidler and Oleg Tinkov. Meanwhile, the finance, trade and shipping sanctions imposed in relation to Crimea have been expanded to the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll boosts oban ahead of slockavullin final","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA group of five young Mid Argyll rugby players were in action last weekend as part of Oban Lorne under-s in the semi final of the West Youth Shield.The result of the match on Sunday March  didn#t go their way, as opponents East Kilbride ran out  #  winners, but it was a good contest and close game until Oban players sustained a few injuries and East Kilbride scored a couple of breakaway tries.Oban Lorne and the Mid Argyll contingent # Rhys Coffield, Murray MacDonald, Vinnie Buckley, James Campbell and Sorley Self # have had a great season, winning their West under- development league, so there is plenty for the lads to be proud of.If anyone would like to enjoy some rugby this weekend, Mid Argyll under- boys will be playing on Saturday March  in the final of the West Youth Chairman#s Trophy against Kilmarnock RFC at Slockavullin.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

settings such as places of worship and wedding or funeral ceremonies, however.Nicola Sturgeon said continuing to require facemasks by law for a further two weeks struck a \"sensible balance\" amid signs that the BA. Omicron wave in Scotland is beginning to peak or stabilise.The number of people in hospital with Covid fell from , to , in the past  hours The Covid threat level is expected to be reduced from medium to low during Spring, said the First Minister.Ms Sturgeon said: \"This phased approach strikes a sensible balance between our desire to remove this one remaining legal measure, and the common sense need for continued caution - not least for the sake of the NHS - while this wave of infection subsides.\"I recognize that face coverings are an inconvenience. However, given all the sacrice of the past two years, and in view of the current pressure on the NHS, I believe the vast majority of people will accept that for a further two weeks this is a proportionate precautionary measure while we pass the peak of this latest wave.\"It also provides some further protection to those who are most at risk from the virus.\"Compulsory face coverings have already come to an end in all other parts of the UK, with England - which briefly reintroduced them in December as part of its Plan B response to the Omicron wave - becoming the first to drop the requirement at the end of January.  #COVID infections continued to increase across England, Wales and Scotland in the most recent week, but decreased in Northern Ireland.These high infection levels are driven by the Omicron BA. iant https:t.co zjZZxROXBX pic CSjbiIxM In February, Northern Ireland switched facemasks from law to guidance, but still strongly advises the public to wear them in enclosed public spaces such as shops, bars, restaurants and public transport.Since Monday, people in Wales have no longer been required to wear facemasks in shops and on public transport, but they are still mandatory in health and care settings. The latest surveillance by the Office for National Statistics  indicates that the prevalence of Covid is highest in Scotland - with one in  people infected - despite the ongoing mask law. The next surveillance figures will be released on Friday.Surgical and cotton masks are known to be less effective against the highly transmissible BA. Omicron strain than previous iants, although FFP and FFP masks remain protective. Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish Governments decision to delay the lting of the mask law across the board from Monday was taken to protect the NHS. She said: \"We have taken account of the very high level of infection and the pressure on the NHS, and the fact that face coverings do provide an important layer of protection against transmission of the virus from one person to another.\"However, we are also mindful that the data may now be indicating a peaking of this wave of infection which should hopefully become more pronounced over the next couple of weeks.\"Source: Public Health ScotlandIt comes as weekly data showed a dip in Covid hospital admissions for the first time since the BA.

As music fans lost their gigs at the height of the pandemic, avid readers also lost their author events and book festivals. And like musicians, authors lost that valuable connection with their audiences and the opportunity to promote new releases.When Case Study, the latest novel by Graeme Macrae Burnet was released last October, things were looking up – Omicron was yet to come.“Of course events are the leblood of getting a book in front of the public and I did get a chance to do a few,” says Graeme. “Some of them were very last minute, however, because people weren’t really committing – they didn’t know how many people could be invited. For events like Waterstones in Glasgow, the restriction in numbers meant we split the event over two nights.” Case Study is Graeme Macrae Burnet’s fourth novel. His first, The Disappearance of Adèle Bedeau in  is set in small-town France and introduced the detective Georges Gorski. It is far from the typical detective novel.His second, from , is the book that thrust Graeme into the public eye with its shortlisting for the Booker Prize. The backdrop to His Bloody Project is a brutal triple murder in a remote Scottish Highland community during the s. The third, in , saw theof Georges Gorski The Accident on the A in the same setting as Adèle Bedeau.Case Study, which is published in paperback on April , heads to London in the s and what could be described as the “anti-psychiatry” movement. A woman who believes a psychotherapist has driven her sister to suicide becomes a patient of his under a  name to seeher suspicions are true. The novel is told through notebooks and observations, drawing the reader deeper into this world and the relationship. It’s much more amusing, in places, than this makes it sound. What’s clear, however is Graeme Macrae Burnet isn’t an author who can be stuck in any genre’s pigeonhole.All of Graeme’s books have been published by Saraband , a company that formed in Connecticut in the s, relocated to Scotland in  and moved to Salford in .The attention that a book like His Bloody Project brings an author will inevitably be a large blip on the radar of much larger international publishers, but as Graeme explains there are many factors to take into consideration when choosing a publisher.“It was absolutely the right decision to stay with Saraband for this book,” he says. “In any author’s career there’s a time to test the waters with other publishers. This was my juncture, and I did get a really fantastic offer from one big London publisher and from another big indie. Saraband also made a great offer.“I tried to take the emotion out of making the decision, but with the long-standing relationship that we have and the amazing marketing plan they had for the book I knew we could work well together. They were collaborative about aspects like cover design, so in the end it was really a very easy decision to make. It’s so important to have a strong independent publishing sector and even though Saraband is now based in Manchester, I think that Sara Hunt, the publisher, still thinks of Saraband is essentially a Scottish publishing company.”Working with a successful smaller publisher also meant that there was no pressure to become a “genre” author. There has been no pressure to follow up any of the books with more of the same. From a sort-of detective novel set in a small town in France, to a th-century murder story in the Highlands, then back to that small town in France and now s London. “I’ve only acquired an agent relatively recently and I told them that all I really want to do is write books. I think it can make it dficult for publishersyou’re not a brand in some way. I think there are some similarities between all my books. There’s a familiarity of approach of how you express things and inevitably you bring your own sensibility to whatever the raw material is.”Graeme is currently back in small town Franceand working on the final book of in the Gorski trilogy, but there are also plans to venture deep into Central Europe.As an English teacher, Graeme spent time living in France, Spain and the Czech Republic and it’s his time in pre-stag heaven Prague that might well inform that journey further east.He agrees that location can be another crucial character in a book and as a writer there’s a tendency to be hyper-aware of surroundings.“As a writer that’s a gt isn’t it  I lived in Prague for a year and I learned some Czech, but not enough to have a serious conversation. This was back in , before the advent of cheap flights and at the time there weren’t many foreigners living there.“It was a really formative experience and so interesting to be in a place at the moment of genuine transition things were changing on a weekly basis. To get there I had to go to London to get a visa from the Czechoslovakian Embassy. The Iron Curtain had fallen of course, but a lot of the structures were still in place. It’s probably changed so much but in my mind are the winding medieval streets in winter. Dashing between bars, getting a little grog in each. Everything looks like an old sort of Sherlock Holmes film really.”What he will write he says isn’t even a half-formed idea and it might be a fictionalised central European destination but it’s clear his memories of the time are vivid. “It’s still in my imagination and I’ve just finished re-reading The Trial by Franz Kafka so it’s at the forefront of my mind.”For the moment, however, it’s planning to get out and share the paperback of Case Study at events, including ato the Highlands for the Ullapool Book Festival in May. He spent time as a child at his grandmother’s house in Wester Ross so it’s another area he knows well.“I think we’ve all been glad to get away from our own front doors recently. I spend so much of my time alone, it goes with the job of course, that I like being among people. Let the conversations begin.” Case Study is released on paperback on April , published by Saraband."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-scots-self-funding-private-treatment-68-per-cent","story":"Official figures from the Private Healthcare Information Networkshow that the number of people paying for operations, tests, and other procedures at private hospitals climbed to , during July to September , up from , for the same period in .The surge in \"self-funding\" patients comes as the number of people paying for private healthcare through an insurance policy fell by % over the same period, from approximately , in  to , last year.This can be a slower process than self-funding.: Is two-tier healthcare now inevitable Although the Scottish figures do not provide a breakdown of what treatment patients were funding, a separate release earlier this week found that there had been a % increase in people self-funding hip replacements across the UK in  compared to , along with a % increase in self-funded knee replacements in the private sector and a % increase in self-funded cataracts procedures.It comes amid spiralling waiting lists for elective care on the NHS, with data showing that one in  people in Scotland currently on lists for an inpatient or day case procedure have been waiting over two years.: Spire Healthcare reports unprecedented demand from patients funding their own operationsMatt James, chief executive of PHIN, said: “Our data shows that a greater number of people in Scotland opting to go private are paying out of their own pocket to do so.“PHIN’s role is to help people make sure they are fully informed, so they make the choices that are right for them and avoid any nasty surprises.\"This is especially important for anybody who is new to private healthcare and paying themselves, as they do not have an insurer to help them.“It’s important to know what questions to ask, and to choose hospitals and consultants that are transparent about their costs and clinical performance.

It can no longer be ignored and the amendment that I am moving today asks us to do three things to acknowledge, apologise and to act. We have long known much of the source of the wealth of which Glasgow was built. We knew but up until recently didn’t think much about what it really meant and we brushed aside the voices trying to tell us.“In our recent era when other cities were sincerely grappling with their role in chattel slavery, our city was still glorying it naming the Merchant City barely a decade before Liverpool issued an apology for the type of things we are her discussing today.“Follow the Atlantic slavery money trail and its tentacles reach into every corner of Glasgow. The predecessor organisation of this very council borrowed and invested money to the equivalent of millions of pounds that directly came from and contributed to chattel slavery. It’s clear what this report tells is that the blood of trafficked and enslaved African people, their children and their children’s children is built into the very bones of this city. Glasgow’s history to the present day echoes to the crack of the plantation overseers lash. Chattel slavery stands as one of the most heinous crimes in human history and Glasgow was complicit and for that we apologise today, unreservedly, without excuses, justications or attempts at self-congratulation of the type we have too often employed in the past.”Read more:  Glasgow street names and areas with links to slave tradeShe said many will ask what good an apology will do, adding that it can’t change the past and no one alive today took part in chattel slavery.“Many who are alive today still live with the legacy of racism whose roots can be traced directly back to what was white supremacy codied in law and the country’s whose populations were stolen and enslaved suffer still. An apology tells them that finally we are trying to understand,” she added.The ammendment was seconded by Councillor Graham Campbell, chairman of the councils cross party working group on slavery, who said: \"This is a historically unprecedented statement and I am in the position of being both able to support this ammendment to make this offer of an apology on behalf of the city, but also to partyly accept the apology on behalf of African and Caribbean descedants as the first one present in this chamber.\"Perhaps the  Lord Provosts mentioned in the report who got their wealth from ill gotten gains would never have anticipated someone like me would be here. Why are we remembering and what is the purpose of doing this  We have had organised forgetting of the record of Glasgows involvement in chattel slavery. We have now got the historic evidence and it is now up to us as citizens to see what we can do with that information - how we teach the legacy of chattel slavery. \"Slavery and colonialism are the origins of the racism we face today - how people think, the stereotypes and prejudices are derived from that time.\"Councillor Campbell said the  Black Lives Matter protest shows that there is a racism problem in the city which is why measures have had to be taken. This apology is just a first step and is part of the journey not the end.\"Labour group leader, Councillor Malcolm Cunning said there had been decades of denial of the citys slave trade connections and that it was given little mention in the school books of the past.He said: \"It has taken far too long to realise that deep-seated, interwoven legacy of slavery in Glasgow. We now need to say how do we go foward, what do we do now and how do we make our apology and acknowledgement in the st century.\"Greens Councillor Kim Long said they welcomed and supported the report, adding: \"It is especially important for us to note the impact and the leadership of the first black councillors elected to this chamber. It is crucial for us as a city to move from the stance of we didnt know, to we do know.\"The city council commissioned report, led by Dr Stephen Mullen, an academic historian with the University of Glasgow, singled out eight Glasgow statues of iniduals with connections to the slave trade. It added that gts from those linked to the trade amounted to more than £ million in today’s money, with a bequest that would amount to £m for the Mitchell Library in .The monuments to Colin Campbell, William Gladstone, John Moore, David Livingstone, James Oswald, Robert Peel Jnr, James Watt and King William III are all highlighted in the reportThe report also highlights  Glasgow streets and locations with connections to Atlantic slavery.

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for. This remains the most important thing any of us can do to protect ourselves and others.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We did not expect the extremely positive and proactive response we received from the jobcentre. The team was very helpful,# said Jordan.The support Elite got from the jobcentre was invaluable in streamlining and accelerating its recruitment process which would take up to five weeks.#Now, the jobcentre advertises our vacancies via a sector-based work academy.#Candidates attend a two-week course at Weston College, Yeovil, to gain their Scaffolding Operative Training Scheme and Health  Safety Certications, as well as to prepare for an interview. Now when we interview candidates, they already have a scaffold labourer trainee card and the basic knowledge and understanding of the scaffolding industry. What’s more, all this support via the jobcentre comes without the additional fees of private agencies.#Out of seven candidates, six were offered jobs and five have remained with Elite which has  qualied operatives.#The process was seamless and effective, providing quality candidates who were keen to learn.#Working with the jobcentre is a no brainer! As well as alleviating the burden of interviews that don’t progress into jobs, the savings in cost and time to get candidates suitably qualied are a bonus. It takes the pressure off our own resources and provides top quality candidates in the process.#‘Delighted’: Simon, Employer Adviser, Yeovil JobCentreOnce approached by Elite Scaffolding, also based in Yeovil, he set up a meeting with one of its office managers and worked out a bespoke recruitment package.As part of the programme, he contacted the local Weston College and together they “built” the course content.At the end of the two-week course, six candidates were offered a place on the apprenticeship scheme at a starting salary of £,.#Elite had exhausted all other channels to recruit and were delighted with the outcome#, he said.Moreover Elite referred other local employers to the jobcentre and Simon is running another sector-based work academy with a local roofing company.#The jobcentre has an incredible pool of talent.

Everything went through really quickly.#Continued the  year-old: “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel welcome and supported me. I spent six months on the placement and I got paid, too. It’s a proper job which was exactly what I needed. Day to day, I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since.“After six months, there was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD. Once I’d finished with the placement I got started on a qualication – CIPD level three in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year.

And I hope, and I assume, that those who have been fined by the police will pay their fines and that will be the punishment that they have accepted.”Pressed on whether  fines being issued meant there were  instances of people breaking the law, she said: “Well, that’s right. They’ve broken the regulations that were set in the Covid Act and police deem that that was what they did, and therefore they’ve been fined accordingly.”Asked why the PM would not say this, she said: “Because, as I say, he wants to wait until the whole process of the police review has been done.”At the Liaison Committee, SNP MP Pete Wishart asked Mr Johnson to accept “there has been criminality committed”, given Scotland Yard’s decision to issue FPNs.The Prime Minister said: “I have been, I hope, very frank with the House about where I think we have gone wrong and the things that I regret, that I apologise for.“But there is an ongoing investigation… I am going to camp pretty firmly on my position.”He added: “I won’t give a running commentary on an ongoing investigation.”Mr Johnson sidestepped questions about whether he would be “toast”he was issued with an FPN orhe would resignhe broke the Ministerial Code.The FPNs being issued by the Met relate to investigations into a series of around a dozen events in Downing Street and Whitehall while England was subject to coronavirus lockdown restrictions – including one in the Prime Minister’s flat.Although Mr Johnson is not expected to be among the first group to be hit with fines, the Met have indicated they expect to issue more fixed penalty notices as their investigations continue."},{"url":null,"title":"heat-pumps-mean-home---wallet  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Here are answers to some key questions about the technology.– What is a heat pump An air source heat pump looks like an air conditioning unit on the outside of buildings. It works a bit like a fridge in reverse, using electricity to extract energy from the outside air to provide heating for homes and hot water.There are also heat pumps that draw energy from the ground or water.Because they are extracting heat from the environment – which they can do even at low outside temperatures – they produce around three times the energy they use, making them much more efficient than a gas boiler.British electricity is increasingly powered by low carbon sources such as wind, making heat pumps a clean alternative to burning gas while they also cut local air pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide, that boilers emit.– How much are they Installing a new air source heat pump costs more than £, on average, with a ground source heat pump costing more than that.The Government grant will provide £, for an air source heat pump and £, for a ground source heat pump, for homes in England and Wales that are sufficiently insulated.VAT is also being removed for installations of the clean tech, along with insulation to make homes cosier, which will further bring down the cost.Energy company Octopus has confirmed that with the £, grant, it will offer heat pumps at a similar price to gas boilers.\" data-title\"Installing loft insulation \" data--holder\"PA Wire\" data--notice\"PA Wire PA Images\" data-credit\"Philip Toscano\" data-usage-terms\"FILE PHOTO\" srcset\"https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production fdeeaeeccdefYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQODANDQ ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production fdeeaeeccdefYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQODANDQ ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production fdeeaeeccdefYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQODANDQ ..jpg w w\" sizes\" vw,vw,px, px\"Installing loft insulation will make heating systems more efficient – So you need a well-insulated home to run one All heating technologies – including gas boilers – work more efficiently and save you moneyyour home is well insulated and improving insulation to save energy is a key part of cutting emissions from buildings.A recent Government study found all homes in the UK, from Victorian mid-terraces to s blocks of flats, are suitable for heat pumps.Energy experts estimate that nearly a fth of homes, some . million, are suitable for a heat pump today while another %, or . million, need minimal changes such as loft and cavity wall insulation, which will also cut bills.– Will I have to make other changes to my house to install a heat pump Because radiators on heat pumps operate at a lower temperature than with gas you might need to swap a few of the oldest single  radiators your home might have to ensure they are big enough to heat the room sufficiently.They can normally be replaced with double or triple led radiators that fit in the same spot.Underfloor heating works very well with heat pumps as it operates at a lower temperature than radiators so it will continue to workyou have it, oryou are doing a wider refurbishment you could think about putting it in. It is not necessary to install it, however.Currently, you need a water tank for heating up your hot water. vw,vw,px, px\"A Government study found all types of houses were suitable for heat pumps – How dferent are they to run The main dference is you do not get that immediate boost you can get with gas, when you feel cold and you fire up the boiler.That is because a heat pump heats water in the radiators to a lower temperature than a gas boiler so it warms a house more slowly.But with a heat pump, the system works out the most efficient way to keep the house to the temperature you want it and gets on with it.You can programme changes such as being away for holidays and yourtime, so the house will be warm for when you come back.– Do you save money from running one It depends on gas and electricity prices. With the energy price hikes coming in this April, the % spike in the price of household gas will push up the cost of running a gas boiler above the cost of running an electric heat pump, even though electricity prices are also climbing.Experts estimate that households which have switched from a gas boiler to a heat pump could shave £ off their annual energy bills from April.Overall, the new grants, VAT cut and the high gas prices mean installing and running an efficient heat pump is approaching cost parity with gas boilers over their letimes, though have not reached it yet, analysis by Jan Rosenow of the Regulatory Assistance Project finds.– If I don’t want a heat pump are there other technologies that could be used to heat my home Prime Minister Boris Johnson has acknowledged that people are “worried about having to replace their boilers at vast expense”.While he said he believed costs will come down very fast, he has also pointed to hydrogen as an alternative way of heating homes.The gas could be put through the gas pipe network to heat homes with new boilers that can use hydrogen instead of fossil gas.But hydrogen, made from fossil gas with technology to capture and store the carbon dioxide that would be produced, or through using renewable power to split water, is currently an expensive option.In cities there is a role for district heat networks, which pipe hot water in underground pipes to bring heat from a central source, such as energy from a waste plant, rivers, or even former mines, to a heat exchanger in homes to provide heating and hot water.You can choose to install a heat pump when you’re ready, while other technologies may involve whole neighbourhoods or towns having to make the sht at the same time."},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-284-march-30-wordle-word-hints-todays-answer  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Council remains strongly committed to ensuring Mid and East Antrim is an accessible, safe, welcoming and inclusive place for every person living in or visiting the Borough. In , it was awarded the prestigious ‘Autism Impact Award’ for six of its venues in recognition of “going above and beyond” to create accessible and ‘autism-friendly’ environments – including Seven Towers Leisure Centre and The People’s Park. These award accreditations were presented by Autism NI, in partnership with the Northern Health and Social Care Trust .Pamela, Manager of The Fun Factory, commented: “The Fun Factory is very much behind Council’s ambition to be as accessible and inclusive as possible for every person of every age, background and ability living in or visiting our Mid and East Antrim – it’s something we very much strive to achieve in our own business. “We passionately believe that every child deserves the chance to have a fun and enjoyable experience in an environment in which they feel safe and comfortable.

In January , the island’s other landmark, the fisherman#s cottage, which dates back to the s, was granted listed status.It had been hoped with the easing of Covid restrictions, the bridge would reopen this year.However, the Ballycastle Chronicle has reported the planned Easter re-launch is unlikely unless an industry-wide recruitment crisis is resolved.In a statement to the paper, a Trust spokesperson said: “The National Trust is preparing for the reopening of Carrick-a-Rede following its closure for over two years.“Despite our keenness to open we are struggling to recruit a full-time team and therefore cannot give a definitive date for when the site will be open to visitors.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up According to the Chronicle, management were “genuinely concerned” there may no reopening at all in the next few weeks.The spectacular high crossing regularly attracted over half a million annual visitors pre Covid.The Trust encouraged anyone interested in seeking work to search ‘careers’ on its website.Back in January , the bridge was closed for a short period following a small landslide.Three years previously, vandals attempted to cut the part of the rope, sparking a police investigation.The bridge was first erected by salmon fishermen in  and sits at almost ftabove sea level. In  the bridge was replaced as part of regular conservation works.

Credit: Andrew Milligan FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueCeltic and Rangers fans at an Old Firm game. Credit: Andrew MilliganMark BainTwitterEmailMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThousands of Rangers and Celtic football fans have been left with tickets for big matches in Scotland with one of their main routes of travel no longer possible.The impasse at PO Ferries means the regular sailings from Larne to Cairnryan are no longer operating, and fans who have paid out hundreds of pounds for season tickets, and who travelled every couple of weeks to Glasgow, have been left high and dry, unless they fork out for plane tickets or a secure a spot on a Stena ferry.And there’s a major problem looming over Easter weekend, with fans of both clubs hoping to travel at the same time for the Scottish Cup semi-final between the two Glasgow giants.This weekend, the North Ulster Federation of Rangers Supporters’ Clubs had been due to travel with several coaches to the Rangers v Celtic Scottish Premier League match at Ibrox Stadium — but there plans are in disarray.Charlie Connor, from the Limavady Rangers Supporters Club, said plans to travel this weekend have been abandoned by many.“There were several buses booked on PO this weekend but we got the call that the ferries would not be running and that it would be some time before they were.“All we could do is try to sell on our tickets. Some who had tickets for games have managed to get their cars booked onto the Stena service, but they’re few and far between.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “We haven’t had any further information and simply can’t think what solution there is unless ferries start running again.”Colin Scott, from Lisburn Glasgow Rangers Supporters Club, said the issues with the PO sailings had caused a major headache.“It’s not just the lack of routes,” he said. “The cost is too much for many supporters and this weekend it’s virtually impossible to get a flight that can get you to the match in time for the noon kick-off.“We will have a major issue when Rangers are in the quarter-final of the Europa League against Braga on Wednesday, April . We have tickets, but we can’t get there. We usually travelled by PO for the midweek games.”Stena Line has introduced extra sailings from Belfast to Scotland to help facilitate higher passenger numbers, but said the sailings have been booking up quickly.“We have brought in an additional vessel, the Stena Nordica, to run in conjunction with our existing two vessels on the Belfast-Cairnryan route,” the ferry operator said. “This has increased the number of daily sailings from  to  every day.“Understandably, all our sailings are currently busier than usual. We ask that all passengers ensure they book in advance online and check-in for their sailings within plenty of time before departure.”Rangers fans will by hit most by being unable to attend this weekend’s Old Firm derby, with local clubs getting more tickets for the home fixture than Celtic’s away support. But unless PO are operating against by Sunday, April , Stena could be faced with a headache as fans of Celtic and Rangers will all be trying to travel for the Scottish Cup semi-final on Easter Sunday.“Plans are yet to be finalised and will be discussed with Group Travel on how that will work,” Stena said.Related topicsRangers FCCeltic FCMore On Rangers FC PremiumViewpointOpinionChoppy waters are ahead for NI’s Old Firm fansWatch: Paul Gascoigne caught on camera tripping up child before Rangers challenge match PremiumStephen CraiganOpinionSteven Davis’ Rangers future is in the air, but it makes much more sense for Giovanni van Bronckhorst to keep him at IbroxSteven Davis determined to prove his fitness and take place in Ian Baraclough#s first Northern Ireland squad of  PremiumStephen CraiganOpinionAfter Rangers’ latest European high, Giovanni van Bronckhorst must get it right for Scottish CupMost ReadWandering Castlewellan child ‘confirmed as safe’How Coronation Street actor Charlie Lawson saved the day at BBC broadcaster Emma Vardy’s weddingMan ‘ashamed’ to be from Belfast after auntleft lying in street for four hours waiting for ambulanceNorthern Ireland weather: Cold snap set for awith snow showers possibleSinn Fein slammed for election launch at Belfast’s Europa Hotel which was repeatedly bombed by IRATop VideosPlayThe third and final series of Derry Girls starts Tuesday th AprilPlayWomanlatest arrest in connection with Carrickfergus reservoir murderPlayVideo: Blaze breaks out on Belfast Hotel bar roofLatest Northern IrelandPork chops thief found hiding under bed in Rathcoole avoids jailMacmillan says NI healthcare system is failing cancer patientsJoe Kernan slams Armagh trio banned after Donegal brawl: ‘Players should have absorbed lessons’Belfast Casement Park ‘key to hosting Euro ’, says Sinn Fein’s John Finucane and sports pundit Joe BrollyNorthern Ireland man who threatened to kill New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern is jailed - Michael Cruickshank given one year in prisonLatestPork chops thief found hiding under bed in Rathcoole avoids jailHome Office must change or next Windrush may only be a matter of time – reportOwen Farrell’s comeback stalls as concussion rules him out of Sale clashBoots sales jump despite Omicron as owner considers saleAmbulance handover delays highest since start of winter,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit :Sinn FeinGarrett HarganTwitterEmailMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA victims’ campaigner has questioned the use of the Europa Hotel as the setting for Sinn Fein’s election launch, saying it’s a venue the Provisional IRA “systematically bombed”.On Tuesday, Michelle O’Neill gave a speech at the Great Victoria Street hotel, which was bombed  times during the Troubles.She outlined Sinn Fein’s priorities ahead of the upcoming election including the cost of living crisis and “fiercely defending” the Good Friday Agreement.“The facts are that the balance of power at Stormont has shted irreversibly and political unionism must come to terms with the fact the world is moving on fast,” Ms O’Neill said.“So, while the DUP and the TUV are trying to take us backwards, our message is clear, we are only moving forward.”Commenting on the choice of venue, Kenny Donaldson, spokesman for Innocent Victims United said: Sinn Fein clearly don#t do irony, to bleat on about upholding democracy at the very venue which the Provisional IRA systematically attacked again and again, making it the most bombed hotel in Europe is brazen to say the least.However, due to the intensity of the Provisional IRA#s bombing campaign — and that of other terrorists, few hotel venues across Northern Ireland have come away unscathed by the Troubles.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up TUV South Belfast candidate Andrew Girvin said Sinn Fein’s campaign launch at the Europa was a “grotesque spectacle” given the setting.“Here we had the political wing of the terrorist organisation which repeatedly bombed the hotel in which they met daring to ponticate about democracy and respecting the will of the people.“There is nothing undemocratic about refusing to operate the Belfast Agreement structures which could foist a Sinn Fein First Minister upon Northern Ireland.“The choice of venue for this republican jamboree underscores the fact that no unionist should ever agree to take up the position of deputy to a Sinn Fein First Minister.“Yet just weeks out from the election both the DUP and UUP are dodging this vital question.Will they act as bridesmaid to Michelle O#Neill  Why is there reluctance to be open and honest with the public on this point ”The DUP#s Gordon Lyons said Sinn Fein#s election launch demonstrates their priority lies on holding a border poll rather than on helping families or rebuilding Northern Ireland’s economy.The party#s director of elections said: Sinn Fein#s rally was a show of strength for a border poll.“Whilst the DUP has a five-point plan to build a better future for Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein wants to win the election to implement their plan for a border poll.“There is a clear choice on offer to people whether they want a future focused on fixing our health system, tackling the cost of living crisis and replacing the protocol, or one fixated on a isive border poll.“When Michelle O#Neill talks about making history, we know it isn#t record levels of investment into our hospitals she is referring to. Now is not the time for ision and uncertainty.That is why this election is so important.Sinn Fein has been contacted for comment.Speaking at an election launch, Ms O’Neill said that Sinn Fein will defend but not renegotiate the Good Friday Agreement.The former Deputy First Minister said those who hanker for the past need to realise that there is no going back, only forward.Sinn Fein#s Stormont leader also described the DUP#s collapse of the Executive as political vandalism, although her own party also brought Stormont down in the same Assembly mandate.She said: When the Assembly, Executive and North South Ministerial Council were restored in January  it was with a shared commitment to deliver the public services, societal reforms and future that our people need and deserve.It was ambitious to form a five-party coalition Executive, but it was achieved, getting us back to genuine power-sharing, and thankfully so, because while everyone knew there would be challenges ahead, no one could have predicted that in only a matter of weeks that our Executive would be dealing with a global pandemic that would have such devastating impacts on every part of society, community and people#s lives and livelihoods.It is to the credit of all ministers from across the five parties that they responded and have worked with a unity of purpose, and unity of leadership for the past two years.This is what the public want to see more of — co-operation and delivery.Ms O#Neill added: Sinn Fein will be defending, not renegotiating the Good Friday Agreement now, or in the time ahead.Ms O#Neill said the May  election was the most important in a generation.Related topicsSinn FéinMichelle O#NeillIRACost of LivingTraditional Unionist VoiceGordon LyonsThe Executive OfficeMore On Sinn FéinCriticism as Electric Ireland customers facing nearly £ rise in annual bills PremiumJust £k spent as multi-million pound Northern Ireland football stadiums scheme lies idle PremiumRepublic of Ireland should maintain its military neutrality, say three quarters of Sinn Fein voters PremiumSam McBrideOpinionDUP gains ground, but overall support drops for ided unionismBelfast man in court accused of threat to kill MP John FinucaneMost ReadWandering Castlewellan child ‘confirmed as safe’How Coronation Street actor Charlie Lawson saved the day at BBC broadcaster Emma Vardy’s weddingMan ‘ashamed’ to be from Belfast after auntleft lying in street for four hours waiting for ambulanceNorthern Ireland weather: Cold snap set for awith snow showers possibleSinn Fein slammed for election launch at Belfast’s Europa Hotel which was repeatedly bombed by IRATop VideosPlayThe third and final series of Derry Girls starts Tuesday th AprilPlayWomanlatest arrest in connection with Carrickfergus reservoir murderPlayVideo: Blaze breaks out on Belfast Hotel bar roofLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election Irish Republican Socialist Party accuses electoral chiefs of preventing it from standing in Assembly pollSDLP election candidate Paul Doherty says he will not be deterred after being menaced by group of men on Shankill RoadSinn Fein will ‘defend, but not renegotiate’ Good Friday Agreement: O’NeillSDLP leader Colum Eastwood condemns attempts to intimidate candidatesProtocol does not represent the best of both worlds for NI, DUP leader tells NI Chamber of CommerceLatestNational Trust can’t reopen Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge due to staff shortageStarmer urges voters to respond to cost-of-living crisis during local electionsYellow weather warning for snow and ice extended to South East‘Facts not in dispute’ over whether fines mean laws were broken – No Ralph Hasenhuttl insists top-half finish would be crucial for Saints’ future,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Irsquod just broken up with my first girlfriend and I think it was me subconsciously expressing stuff about that.Confirming the sci-fi influence, Tim mdash who recently became a dad for the first time mdash said Girl From Mars mostly revolves around the verse and chorus.ldquoI wrote them as a slow little strummy thing and then when we worked on it as a band we rocked it out quite a lot. My little brother Pat was always my first port of call of seeinga song was good and then Irsquod bring it to [bandmates] Mark [Hamilton] and Rick [McMurray].ldquoI used to love going and knocking on his bedroom door and playing him ideas and I remember that he flipped out about the song and loved it. He had the idea for the quiet verse after the guitar solo and it was great.Tim said as soon as the band started playing it they got a really good reaction from their friends.ldquoI used to play stuff before Irsquod even fully written the lyrics wersquod play stuff at shows and Irsquod mumble my way through it. I donrsquot think I wrote the second verse until we actually recorded it two years later.ldquoI wasnrsquot too worried about lyrics back then, maybe because I listened to Nirvana so much and could never really understand them. Our manager and the record label were sure it was going to be a hit, so we put it aside until wersquod be able to promote it. We put it out as a single two weeks after leaving school and it just blew up.Meanwhile, as part of the Church Street investment plan in Downpatrick, around pound, has been earmarked for a shop front improvement scheme with the emphasis on painting and repairing existing facades.Elsewhere, it is proposed to spend pound, on what is being described as a ldquoconcept design of Church Street with the work due to be carried out by a consultant, with pound, earmarked for improving shop fronts in Bridge Street.Fteen thousand pounds has been earmarked for De Courcey Place in English Street to replace a number of heritage-style lamps and signposts, alongside the provision of new litter bins and planting out existing granite water troughs.Just over pound, is to be spent on other planting and landscaping schemes in the Church Street area, while there are also proposals for a new bus stop and power washing the area outside the former telephone exchange, with new safety railings installed outside  Church Street.There are also plans to invest pound, on new interpretation material highlighting the Tower Bell at Down Parish Church and the grave of United Irishman Thomas Russell in the church grounds.Last Christmas, new festive lighting was provided on the side of the Down Arts Centre and on trees in De Courcey Place.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has praised everyone involved with the work in Church Street, in particular, the talented artists responsible for the murals.ldquoCongratulations to everyone involved in the project designed to breath new le into this part of the town. Given the fact that it has missed out on major funding over many years, the pound, investment initiative is particularly welcome, he said.ldquoThe money will help property owners revitalise their respective businesses at a key part of the town where there are a number of family-owned businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynagross make it past Castlewellan  ","story":"BALLYNAGROSS progressed to the final of the Harry Clarke Cup after defeating Castlewellan Forest by way of penalty shoot-out at Ballyhornan on Friday night.Ballynagross arrived at the match looking for a fourth Harry Clarke final in a row, but Castlewellan Forest had momentum following a close win against Ardglass in the quarter-final.Ballynagross got off to the best start they could have hoped for after a great attack from their defence through the field found Philip Doran, who easily finished to put his side one up in the first seven minutes.Castlewellan stepped it up a gear when a throw-in close to the box found Aidan Dornan, who headed just wide.Castlewellan had an appeal for hand ball ruled out closely after in the Ballynagross box, with the referee having none of it.Ballynagross responded to the pressure from Castlewellan with a pass from Philip Doran to Shea McComiskey out on the right wing. McComiskey saw team-mate Joseph Burns in the mouth of the goal and looped the ball in, but Burnsrsquo effort goes just wide.Castlewellan had their first real chance on the th minute when their corner-kick met the head of Donagh Steele. However, the ball went just over the bar.Ballynagross got their second goal on the th minute after a throw-in from Ryan Tumelty to John Shields allowed the attacker to spray a pass to the right wing to find team-mate Doran. The lively lsquoGross forward found Joseph Burns and the chance was duly converted into a goal.With half-time nearing, it looked like Ballynagross would be going into the interval with a comfortable lead, but an error when clearing the ball from the defence enabled Castlewellanrsquos David Gilmore to close the lead to just a goal as the referee blew his whistle.Castlewellan came out in the second-half with an all out attack approach and it paid off through a corner kick in the st minute.This time Donagh Steele ensured the ball was going into the back of the net and the game was level. It was not to stay this way for long as the Castlewellan goalkeeper clearly took Ballynagrossrsquo Shea McComiskey down inside the box and a penalty was awarded.Connor Marron stepped up to take the penalty and finished well into the top left corner of the net.Castlewellan continued to push forward, but Ballynagross defence of Corey Davis, Connor Marron, Ryan Tumelty and Tom McNeill were holding strong.For the next  minutes it was pretty even, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan took a chance on the edge of the box but Cathail Arnold easily saved. Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick close to the Ballynagross net, but David Gilmorersquos effort was straight at the goalkeeper.Ballynagross had a chance from a corner but it was well cleared by Castlewellan.Forest striker Shane Mooney found himself booked for his comments to the referee in the rd minute.Castlewellan were very much seeking out a goal to level and it came in the th minute after a scrap for the ball in Ballynagrossrsquo box resulted in Shane Mooney scoring with the last kick of the game to send the tie to extra-time.There were a few chances during extra-time for Ballynagross, although neither team could find a break through to escape the need for penalties. Castlewellan swapped out Brian McVeigh in goal for Sean Dornan.Ballynagrossrsquo Connor Marron, who had already scored a penalty during the game, was first to step up and easily converted.Castlewellanrsquos Shane Mooney and Ballynagrossrsquo Declan Dowie followed and both scored.Forestrsquos new lsquokeeper Dornan came out of the net and rushed his penalty, sending the ball over the bar.John Mahoney made no mistake to give his lsquoGross side a further advantage before Ciaran Stratton kept Castlewellan in with a chance.Ballynagrossrsquo John Shields walked up to take his penalty but the lsquokeeper saved to bring it level again.Eoin Travers converted his penalty and now it was sudden death.Tom McNeill confidentially scored his penalty meaning all of the pressure fell on Castlewellanrsquos Ryan Morgan to keep the game going.However, his effort was saved resulting in Ballynagross progressing to the final.Ballynagross: C Arnold, T McNeill, R Tumelty, C Marron, C Davis, J Polley, J Shields, J Burns, L Shields, P Doran, S McComiskeySubs: D Craig, D Dowie, J Mahoney, K Taggart, A Beattie.Castlewellan Forest: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, J OrsquoNeill, N Travers, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, A Dornan, D Gilmore Subs: S Kinley, G Kidd, E Travers, R Morgan, J Murnin..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dismal end to league campaign  ","story":"DOWN senior footballersrsquo miserable campaign reached its conclusion as they lost out on home soil to Clare on Sunday.The Mourne side entered this fixture already relegated from Division  and were hoping to gain some,any, momentum ahead of their crucial upcoming Ulster campaign.The uphill task will include having to better Monaghan on May  and then the winner of Cavan and Antrim to make the concluding stage to feature in the All-Ireland series and avoid ato the second-tier championship.Down took to the field in Newry against a Clare side who had endured a mixed bag of results within their league fixtures having won their opening three before losing the next trio of matches.For Down, the loss concludes a point-starved run of fixtures having finished with just one draw and six losses.Clare fielded what appeared to be a physically stronger outfit than their counterparts at Paacuteirc Esler and Downrsquos efforts werenrsquot aided by their lack of discipline.Both Gerard Collins and Pat Havern picked up black cards towards the end of each half while team-mate Finn McElroy picked up a red card with  minutes played.By that stage, the Mourne side didnrsquot appear to be getting anything from the game but that will be little solace to Down boss James McCartan, who has endured a nightmare beginning to his second stint at the helm.Aaron Grfin scored the first goal of the match with nine minutes played, courtesy of a smart left-footed finish which bested Kilcoo-native Niall Kane at his near post.To their credit, Down showed some resilience and managed to notch the next four from five points available with Burren man Liam Kerr kicking over a well-taken score amongst these.However, Clare continued to attack the Down goal and found their second major of the match thanks to Cian OrsquoDearsquos effort.His lowly struck shot took the wind out of Downrsquos sails and the Mourne side entered the break six points adrt at -

ndash The Government is poised to unveil an astonishing pound million scheme to replace the Strangford ferry service with a road tunnel under the lough.The scheme has already been approved at ministerial level and it is believed that the pound million originally intended for the Downpatrick bypass road will be used as start-up capital, with phase top-up grants being sought from the European Community and the Ireland Fund as the scheme progresses.Plans for the mile-long road tunnel have been drawn up by senior consultants engaged by the government and it is believed that the entry points will be manned toll booth terminals in Strangford and Portaferry.The move to replace the ferry service with a tunnel received an extra impetus recently when it was revealed that the ferry service was running at a substantial loss and villagers in Strangford vetoed plans for a new jetty for the vessels.Sources within the government say that the tunnel plan, which has been gathering dust for a number of years, has now been reactivated and local roads bosses intend erting the money intended for Downpatrickrsquos ring road to the scheme before the end of the financial year.Publicly, however, officials are remaining tight-lipped about the project. ldquoThe tunnel plan was first put forward several years ago, but as far as I am aware there are no plans to revive it, said a press office spokesperson.Nevertheless, conservation organisations have been consulted about the possible environmental impact of a tunnel, and a study of its possible effects has been carried out by a university team under the guidance of Prof A Lilo.Prof Lilo told the Recorder: ldquoAs far as I can see, there would be little threat to the loughrsquos balanced ecosystem from a tunnel.There may, however, be an unsightly visual impact created by the large tunnel entrances needed in Strangford and Portaferry.CASTLEWELLAN ndash A new school is to be constructed on the site of the existing St Malachyrsquos High School in Castlewellan, it has been revealed this week.South Down MP Mr Eddie McGrady said he has been informed of the commitment of the Department of Education to a new school in the town.ldquoAn investment appraisal has recently been carried out by the Department of Education to consider how best to meet the long-term needs of the pupils at St Malachyrsquos and this has come out in favour of a new school on the existing site, he added.Mr McGrady said this week: ldquoI welcome this development as I have been making on-going representations on the matter to Lord Belstead and his predecessor as Education Minister, Dr Brian Mawhinney.ldquoThe school definitely requires additional accommodation and I am keen that is is provided on the existing site, he added.DOWNPATRICK ndash Teenagers, some as young as , are taking part in open-air drinking parties at secluded parts of Downpatrick it was revealed this week.The youth are paying adults to buy drink for them and then going to quiet parts of the town for their parties, a special meeting was told on Tuesday.The police have raided a number of these gatherings in recent months but the teenagers simply move to a dferent location and continue their drinking sprees.While the problem of underage drinking in Downpatrick has not risen in recent years it is nevertheless sufficiently worrying to prompt a group of local community representatives to get together to discuss ways of tackling the issue.Last week youth workers, headmasters, teachers, publicans and councillors met together under the auspices of the RUCrsquos Community Relations Branch and debated the causes and possible remedies of underage drinking.The end result of the discussion was that public awareness needs to be heightened, while teenagers, and their parents, should be appraised of the dangers of alcohol abuse in the young.Superintendent Ronnie Hawthorne, Downpatrick sub-isional commander explained that the problem is a province-wide concern and is not just confined to Downpatrick.He added that underage drinking is also taking place in other parts of Down District.ldquoThere is a problem throughout Northern Ireland and we cannot stop underage drinkers ourselves, we need the help of the whole community, said Superintendent Hawthorne.ldquoThere are a lot associated problems with underage drinking and we will talk to every interested body in a bid to cope with this matter, he added.The full extend of the problems were highlighted by the youth leader in charge of the Patrician Youth Centre, Siobhan Byrne, who has compiled a report on underway drinking which is to be presented to Down Council.KILLYLEAGH ndash The town of Killyleagh is set for a financial boost to help revive its economic, commercial and environmental appearance, it has been revealed.A preliminary application has been made to the International Fund for a core project to help trigger a revival in the townrsquos fortunes.And by the end of the year, plans to designate the town as a conservation area will be completed.The investment in Killyleaghrsquos future was revealed when the chairman of Down District Council, Mr Sean Quinn, officially launched proposals for the regeneration of the town.A special exhibition in the townrsquos library also features a display on the proposed conservation area for Killyleagh.Mr Quinn referred to community-led initiatives in Seeconnell and Strangford, and stressed the importance of a community coming together to take full advantage of the funding which is available to help themselves.The South Down MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, told the launch gathering that he has been delighted to assist the committee towards its goals of reviving the town.Mr McGrady said Killyleagh had recognised that it was very much an era of self-help.He looked forward to the day when Killyleagh is selected as the site for the Strangford Lough Liaison Office and is designated as the Gateway to Strangford Lough, fulfilling its tourist potential.LEITRIM ndash An  month battle to have a Leitrim footpath declared a right of way has found its way to Westminster.The Parliamentary Commissioner for Complaints has been asked to investigate Banbridge Councilrsquos handling of the matter after more than  people signed a petition asking for the adoption of the footpath as a right-of-way.The footpath, which is marked on ordnance survey maps dating from , sketches from the town lands of Slievenisky and Backaderry, through Carrivmoragh mountain and descends towards Leitrim by Heronrsquos Road.Local people claim that the path is very old and was once used to reach a Mass Rock on the Backaderry Mountain and in later times, to give a short-cut to the new church in Leitrim.It is also believed the footpath is part of the old highway system that existed before the road system was introduced, and links into a system of lanes that go to Ballynahinch.The Council first became involved in the matter in August  when the petition was formally presented, and shortly afterwards the council voted overwhelmingly to adopt the pathway, subject to legal opinions.However, for the next  months no progress was made on the matter until the council appointed a countryside officer in August . He prepared a report on the footpath, which came before the council earlier this month when it was decided not to adopt itAfterwards a statement from some of the local people seeking the right-of-way said the footpath passes over land belonging to  dferent families and only one has an objection to the council adopting it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Good Morning Down co","story":"THE head of one of the districtrsquos leading charities is officially stepping down from her role next month.Linda Baker has been Good Morning Downrsquos co-ordinator for the past  years and has watched the organisation mdash which provides a telephone befriending service to elderly and vulnerable people across the district mdash increases its operation considerably.The charity provides a valuable leline service to many people across the district, with its hardworking volunteers in regular contact with those who feel vulnerable or at risk, making telephone calls to members at an agreed time each morning.Linda said the service was especially important during the height of the coronavirus pandemic with the deadly virus unfortunately curtailing get-togethers that were organised for clients.Working in partnership with the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership, the South Eastern Trust and the Housing Executive, the charity has also received invaluable support from the Allen Lane Foundation and and Halax Community Foundation.ldquoWhen I joined Good Morning Down there were four volunteers making calls to around  people. Since then, the organisation has grown and the level of support we provided has widened considerably, Linda revealed.ldquoWe now have a team of  volunteers who are in contact with  people across the district. Despite the global pandemic, we continued to deliver the service from our homes with the calls even more appreciated by clients who could not go out themselves.Linda said that during the pandemic, the volunteers made an additional  calls to people, such was the need of elderly and vulnerable people across the community.ldquoWe started off calling people for a little friendly chat but the service we provided started to evolve. While chatting with clients remains at the heart of what we do to support those who are isolated, we now find ourselves helping people with a range of complex needs.ldquoThe charityrsquos work has evolved and I suppose it will continue to in the future, but Good Morningrsquos Down core principle will always remain the same.Linda paid tribute to all the charityrsquos staff and those who have supported the organisation over many years.ldquoWe are like family and I will be sorry to leave, she said. ldquoI have spent a large part of my working le with Good Morning Down and have literally lived and breathed the organisation and have been assisted by great people.Linda said it was ldquotremendous to meet clients when the charity organised its get-togethers and while these were put on hold due to the pandemic, she hopes there may be an opportunity do something before the end of the year.ldquoThat of course will be guided by the public health situation at the time as we are mindful that our clients are elderly, with a number of them also vulnerable.Linda said the charityrsquos service has never been more important and while she is leaving the organisation, she knows it will continue to be a key part of peoplersquos lives.She added: ldquoI really enjoyed my time with Good Morning Down and worked alongside really great people. They were the friendly voice at the end of the telephone who helped make a dference to peoplersquos lives.ldquoFor many, their chat with our volunteers was the only interaction they would have with others during the day and we were always conscious of that.

They also cause signicant damage to wildle and the environment.Mourne Heritage Trust staff helped with the response to last weekrsquos wildfires using strimmers to create fire breaks, also helping with a controlled back burn and using its argocat all-terrain vehicle and fogging unit to extinguish one branch of a fire that was threatening some field boundaries.In addition, one of the Trustrsquos teams, along with a firefighter, used this specialist equipment to extinguish the fire at Finlieve near Rostrevor.NI Water has also warned that wildfires can have impact on drinking water supplies.The organisation controls so-called water catchment areas in the Mournes which supply water to all of Northern Ireland. The organisation said while it is working hard to deal with the problem of wildfires, it wants to assure customers that tap water quality is unaffected and is of a very high quality.But NI Water has warned that wildfires within catchments not only pose a terrible risk to all le but can remove the primary layer of vegetation, leaving the burned bare soil exposed to erosion which then makes its way into the reservoirs, from where water is abstracted for treatment to provide drinking water.ldquoThe erosion caused by wildfire increases carbon and other polluting chemicals signicantly in untreated water, with sediment accumulating in streams, lakes and reservoirs, said NI Waterrsquos Rebecca Allen.ldquoThis makes raw water especially dficult and more expensive to treat at our facilities to the stringent standards required by the Drinking Water Regulations. A signicant amount of other work by our water supply colleagues also has to be undertaken at the treatment works to ensure excellent quality drinking water during these times.Rebecca added: ldquoExtra water samples have to be collected and analysed, streams from burned areas need isolated, and other remedial measures must be taken like blocking streams to protect reservoirs.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has praised firefighters, other arms of the emergency services and the Mourne Heritage Trust for their efforts to bring the blaze at the Bloody Bridge under control.He said firefighters in particular were overwhelmed by the support from the community.ldquoI witnessed the devastation of the wildfire first hand which impacted a site that is a protected habitat renowned around the world, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoThe emergency services, particularly local fire crews, should be commended for the professionalism they displayed when dealing with these incidents. However, malicious fires place a massive strain on very limited resources and as we approach the summer I would urge people to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the PSNI.Cllr Clarke said the damage caused by gorse fires has a lasting impact and that areas of outstanding natural beauty can take years to recover, calling for a co-ordinated response from the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, NI Water, health and public safety departments and the Department of Justice.He continued: ldquoWe need to see a collective response with a sharing of resources and there needs to be additional funding provided to build upon the best practice Mourne Heritage Trust has undertaken to reduce the impact of these fires in the High Mournes. Controlled burns and better land-management needs to be re-established.ldquoMeasures should include the establishment of fire breaks to reduce the fuel load and a cross-departmental strategic response to ensure that the scale of these fires should never happen again.Cllr Clarke said it is important that police proactively investigate what are environmental crimes and those responsible need to be assured that these types of crime will not be tolerated in society.South Down MLA Sinead Ennis has also praised firefighters for their efforts in battling huge fires in the Mournes which started at Hen Mountain and Spelga Dam.She added: ldquoTragically, these fires will have caused widespread damage to the environment and our wildle.

And what could be more thrilling for kids than going on rides such as the Big Dipper Recently came good news that Barry’s will not be replaced by apartment blocks, but willas amusements, run on a long lease by the Curry family from Londonderry.When residential property becomes expensive, as it does in popular vacation spots, and as it did in towns and cities on both sides of the Irish border in the  and  boom, all sorts of facilities, attractions and conveniences get sold and turned into yet more housing. This often ends in tears.In Dublin, for example, city centre petrol stations got gobbled up as land for further apartments. In such a situation soon no-one has a petrol station nearby and so stations that remain open make lots of money, demand for them rises, so that the pendulum swings back again away from housing.Something similar can happen in holiday towns.If Portrush lost Barry’s to more housing, part of the soul of the town would be gone. There would be less to do, less iety on the skyline and thus less to see.Maybe in the future people will start calling it Curry’s. If so, the managers of the newly re-branded franchise will deserve that accolade for having saved such an attraction. Or maybe people will still call it Barry’s.The key point is that families from across NI will continue to have fun experiences there.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It was owned by the Trufelli family since it opened in , and was sold last year.Last week it was announced that Curry’s were to resurrect the fun park.Owen Curry from Curry’s Fun Park said: “We are delighted to have secured such a prominent trading location that is very important to Portrush and the wider north coast area.“As a family that is synonymous with the leisure industry, we can appreciate what the Trufelli family brought to Portrush over the decades.“We look forward to building on that great foundation – Portrush is an iconic destination in Northern Ireland for locals and visitors alike. “We are very excited by the prospect of operating this legendary amusement park and we look forward to getting started.”l Morning View, page "},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry and meghan markle watch how the royal romance blossomed in a new documentary with expert analysis ","story":"Great news as busy Belfast route is reopened after ongoing incident   Detectives call for information to help crack notorious murder case which saw Protestant minister beaten with nail-studded bats  years agoNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraineSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes  Gardense-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsPeoplePrince Harry and Meghan Markle: watch how the Royal romance blossomed in a new documentary, with expert analysisPrince Harry and Meghan Markle’s story has been one of the most talked about romances of the st Century.By Bill Smith, Latest TVFriday, th March , : pmUpdated Friday, th March , : pm  \"       \"  How did it start  Where did their love bloom  Who were the original Duke and Duchess of Sussex  With exclusive footage, this is the full story of their love covering what happened on the night they met their engagement, the royal wedding, and the challenges they faced as they searched for a home.

That is why this election is so important.”Ulster Unionist South Belfast candidate Stephen McCarthy highlighted the “irony” of Sinn Fein choosing the Europa Hotel for their campaign launch. The Europa was once the most-bombed hotel in the world over three decades of terrorism.Mr McCarthy said: “A venue that was once a byword for all that was negative about Belfast and the violence that plagued us for so long, is now one of the premier venues of a rejuvenated city.“The irony of Sinn Fein holding a campaign launch in a hotel which the IRA tried to destroy repeatedly will certainly not be lost on many people in this city.“It is both sad and frustrating to think that had the republican movement chosen the political route  years ago, so many lives and so much destruction could have been spared.”TUV’s South Belfast candidate Andrew Girvin described the Sinn Fein gathering at the Europa as a “grotesque spectacle” given the location and that they were meeting there “daring to ponticate about democracy and the will of the people”.Mr Girvin said: “There is nothing undemocratic about refusing to operate the Belfast Agreement structures which could foist a Sinn Fein first minister upon Northern Ireland. The choice of venue for this republican jamboree underscores the fact that no unionist should ever agree to take up the position of deputy to a Sinn Fein first minister.”He accused both the DUP and UUP of dodging a vital question: “Will they act as bridesmaid to Michelle O’Neill ”He continued: “TUV is unapologetic and clear on this matter. We will never provide a stooge deputy to a Sinn Fein first minister. If all unionist candidates were equally clear then we would go into the election confident in the knowledge that a republican first minister was an impossibility.“No-one who supports the current arrangements which deny the fundamentals of democracy – the right to vote a party out of government and the right to have an opposition to hold government to account – is in any position to give lectures. Least of all when they have displayed a willingness to deploy terrorism to achieve their political ends in the past.”Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill has vowed to defend but not renegotiate the Belfast Agreement. At the party’s election rally, Ms O’Neill labelled the DUP decision to pull out of the last Stormont Executive as “political vandalism”.The Sinn Fein vice-president warned that her party “will not be shting any goalposts to satisfy unionism before, or after the election”.She said the May  electoral contest was “the most important in a generation” and called on party members to “make history”. Ms O’Neill predicted that the majority of MLAs who are ed to the Assembly after May  will support the protocol.Sinn Fein is running  candidates across the  constituencies in Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, Alliance Party candidate in Lagan Valley, David Honeyford, has said it would be “morally unforgivable” for political leaders to fail to help people get through the cost-of-living crisis. Mr Honeyford said that despite the election the Executive could use future borrowing powers to support households.Sinn FeinMichelle ONeillGordon LyonsDUP  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularRALLY BREAKDOWN: All the upcoming parades and protests against the Northern Ireland Brexit ProtocolGarda-IRA collusion question: ‘Refusal of Legacy Inquest for my brother confirms Dublin-IRA are untouchable for Troubles’Great news as girl ‘located safe and well’ | Community Search and Rescue and public ‘thanked for their help and support in locating this child’ during major search operation’We’re peaceful and law-abiding unionists – not rabble-rousers!DUP’s Gordon Lyons: Sinn Fein election rally a show of strength for border pollMost PopularAldi’s sell-out pet sofa is back for  - how to buy, and the best alternative pet sofas UKBest head torches UK : bright, reliable head torches for camping, hiking, and mountaineeringTen of the best Mother’s Day afternoon teas from UK supermarkets and online stores for Mothering SundayBest portable solar chargers for camping UK : keep your USB devices charged while backpacking and campingWhat’s going to happen in Season  of Netflix’s Bridgerton: what happens in Julia Quinn’s novels, where to buy                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-jQrDum sc-fvxzrP bUrEZo ivPtAx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

We’re proud Northern Ireland people who have an identity of their own and you’ve got to understand it and govern on that basis.”Mr Paisley said he could usually get a meeting with Boris Johnsonhe wanted one, but that it was dficult to keep the Prime Minister focused on Northern Ireland because “he’s pulled in so many dferent directions”.“We’ve got to do things to draw his attention before things go bad again in Northern Ireland, and I would far rather he gets it now than reacts to a situation,” he said.“We’ve always had a better deal from Labour,” he added.“Anytime we’ve had a Labour prime minister or a Labour secretary of state, they’ve understood Northern Ireland, usually better.“Their bark has been worse than their bite you might say. We’ve always kind of had the fear, will Labour take us in a particular direction closer to a united Ireland  But their bark about that and their actual bite has been very, very dferent.”Askedhe trusted Mr Johnson to resolve the Northern Ireland Protocol wrangling, he said: “I don’t trust anyone in politics, I’ve become really sceptical, and I think that it’s foolish to put your trust in people.“We can only trust the people, that they will hopefully elect sensible people, and then that we can trust those people to respond positively to the messages and the political policies that we have.“But the idea that I’m trusting this particular politician, I think those days have long since gone.”The full interview will be broadcast on GB News at .pm on Thursday, March .——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

With that we are in a one-mission mood and we are there.”The standout matches are the trip to the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, April , with an FA Cup semi-final at Wembley the following Saturday.However, Jurgen Klopp’s side cannot afford to focus on those seven daysthey are to remain on track for an unprecedented quadruple.“I think we are ready for all the challenges we have ahead and we just focus on the next game that we have,” Thiago added.“We will always be like that, so we have just in our head now Watford and that’s it.“I think the Carabao Cupgave us much more confidence than we had before..remove“We had high stakes to win the final, we won it and the guys were incredibly happy and confident.“But also it is important to arrive in this moment of the season and be ready for the finals that we have.”That starts on Saturday at home to struggling Watford when Liverpool could leapfrog City and give themselves a two-point lead just before Pep Guardiola’s side head to Burnley.Thiago does not believe, especially with there being less than an hour between their match ending and City’s kicking-off, they can strike much of a psychological blow. vw,vw,px, px\"Defender Trent Alexander-Arnold has started light training after a hamstring problem “I don’t think to see us on top before City plays would be a boost,” he added.“No, it’s just that we are in a moment where every three points count and we are really glad to arrive at this position.”Influential right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold will not be fit for the weekend, having only started light running and outdoor work and not joined full training following a hamstring injury sustained a couple of weeks ago, but he is targeting the trip to City the following weekend.Liverpool have also announced their first pre-season will be against Manchester United in Bangkok on July ..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: I uve never had as exciting a month  u Thiago relishing crunch Liverpool run article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityOrlando Fraser was put forward for the role after the Government’s previously preferred candidate Martin Thomas withdrew from the process following four allegations of inappropriate behaviour in a previous position.However, MPs on the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committeehave now rejected Mr Fraser’s appointment and accused the department of failing to learn its lessons.Committee chair Tory MP Julian Knight said: “The fiasco of four months ago should have jolted the department into widening out its search for the very best person to oversee an organisation that is so vital in ensuring people can support charities with confidence.“By failing to rerun the process and falling back on a shortlist which would seem to be so lacking in ersity, ministers have sadly squandered their second chance.“While we recognise Mr Fraser’s potential to do the job, such a slapdash and unimaginative approach to his recruitment means we cannot formally endorse his appointment.“This should act as a warning to the Government. Unless it changes tack, trust in the process will continue to be damaged and we risk missing out on getting the most qualied people from all backgrounds for these very important jobs.”A report released by the committee on Thursday made clear that while it had no concern about Mr Fraser as an inidual, it did not have confidence in the process of appointing him.In a statement in December, Mr Thomas said it was an “error of judgment on a technical omission during the application process” that had forced him to step aside, adding: “I have behaved throughout the process in good faith, and did not wilfully mislead anyone at any time.”A DCMS spokesperson said: “As recently noted by the Commissioner for Public Appointments, the appointment process for Charity Commission chair was run in line with the governance code on public appointments..remove“The DCMS Select Committee rightly recognises Orlando Fraser’s suitability for the role and we will now consider its report in full and respond in due course.”The committee does not have veto power over the appointment, which is down to Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: MPs criticise charities boss recruitment process and reject Government pick article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityInternational Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said the politan Police’s decision to issue the fines meant criminality had been discovered, echoing the view of Justice Secretary and deputy prime minister Dominic Raab.No  has so far refused to accept laws had been broken, insisting Mr Johnson would have more to say once the police investigation was complete.The politan Police refused to say on Thursday whether the fixed penalty notices, which were referred to the ACRO Criminal Records Office to be doled out, had formally been issued.However, it is not believed the Prime Minister is among those to receive a fine.Asked on Wednesday by MPs on the Commons Liaison Committee whether he was set to receive an FPN, the PM said: “I’m sure you would knowI were.”Previously, Mr Raab – who is a qualied lawyer – said it was “clear there were breaches of the law”.“Clearly there were breaches of the regulations,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.“That is the only thing that can warrant the  fixed penalty notices. That must follow.” vw,vw,px, px\"No  refused to accept laws had been broken Askedthe Justice Secretary misspoke when he said there were clear breaches of the law, Ms Trevelyan told Sky News: “No, he is the Justice Secretary and he has set out a position.“I thinkyou or I get a fine, we hopefully pay it and move on from there. And I hope, and I assume, that those who have been fined by the police will pay their fines and that will be the punishment that they have accepted.”Pressed on whether  fines being issued meant there were  instances of people breaking the law, she said: “Well, that’s right. They’ve broken the regulations that were set in the Covid Act and police deem that that was what they did, and therefore they’ve been fined accordingly.”.removeAsked why the PM would not say this, she said: “Because, as I say, he wants to wait until the whole process of the police review has been done.”At the Liaison Committee, SNP MP Pete Wishart asked Mr Johnson to accept “there has been criminality committed”, given Scotland Yard’s decision to issue FPNs.The Prime Minister said: “I have been, I hope, very frank with the House about where I think we have gone wrong and the things that I regret, that I apologise for.“But there is an ongoing investigation… I am going to camp pretty firmly on my position.”He added: “I won’t give a running commentary on an ongoing investigation.”Mr Johnson sidestepped questions about whether he would be “toast”he was issued with an FPN orhe would resignhe broke the Ministerial Code.The FPNs being issued by the Met relate to investigations into a series of around a dozen events in Downing Street and Whitehall while England was subject to coronavirus lockdown restrictions – including one in the Prime Minister’s flat.Although Mr Johnson is not expected to be among the first group to be hit with fines, the Met have indicated they expect to issue more fixed penalty notices as their investigations continue..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Second Cabinet minister says law was broken in partygate saga article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local community– What is a heat pump An air source heat pump looks like an air conditioning unit on the outside of buildings. It works a bit like a fridge in reverse, using electricity to extract energy from the outside air to provide heating for homes and hot water.There are also heat pumps that draw energy from the ground or water.Because they are extracting heat from the environment – which they can do even at low outside temperatures – they produce around three times the energy they use, making them much more efficient than a gas boiler.British electricity is increasingly powered by low carbon sources such as wind, making heat pumps a clean alternative to burning gas while they also cut local air pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide, that boilers emit. vw,vw,px, px\"How heat pumps work – How much are they Installing a new air source heat pump costs more than £, on average, with a ground source heat pump costing more than that.The Government grant will provide £, for an air source heat pump and £, for a ground source heat pump, for homes in England and Wales that are sufficiently insulated.VAT is also being removed for installations of the clean tech, along with insulation to make homes cosier, which will further bring down the cost.Energy company Octopus has confirmed that with the £, grant, it will offer heat pumps at a similar price to gas boilers.\" data-title\"Installing loft insulation \" data--holder\"PA Wire\" data--notice\"PA Wire PA Images\" data-credit\"Philip Toscano\" data-usage-terms\"FILE PHOTO\" srcset\"https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production fdeeaeeccdefYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQODANDQ ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production fdeeaeeccdefYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQODANDQ ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production fdeeaeeccdefYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQODANDQ ..jpg w w\" sizes\" vw,vw,px, px\"Installing loft insulation will make heating systems more efficient – So you need a well-insulated home to run one All heating technologies – including gas boilers – work more efficiently and save you moneyyour home is well insulated and improving insulation to save energy is a key part of cutting emissions from buildings..removeA recent Government study found all homes in the UK, from Victorian mid-terraces to s blocks of flats, are suitable for heat pumps.Energy experts estimate that nearly a fth of homes, some . million, are suitable for a heat pump today while another %, or . million, need minimal changes such as loft and cavity wall insulation, which will also cut bills.– Will I have to make other changes to my house to install a heat pump Because radiators on heat pumps operate at a lower temperature than with gas you might need to swap a few of the oldest single  radiators your home might have to ensure they are big enough to heat the room sufficiently.They can normally be replaced with double or triple led radiators that fit in the same spot.Underfloor heating works very well with heat pumps as it operates at a lower temperature than radiators so it will continue to workyou have it, oryou are doing a wider refurbishment you could think about putting it in. It is not necessary to install it, however.Currently, you need a water tank for heating up your hot water. vw,vw,px, px\"A Government study found all types of houses were suitable for heat pumps – How dferent are they to run The main dference is you do not get that immediate boost you can get with gas, when you feel cold and you fire up the boiler.That is because a heat pump heats water in the radiators to a lower temperature than a gas boiler so it warms a house more slowly.But with a heat pump, the system works out the most efficient way to keep the house to the temperature you want it and gets on with it.You can programme changes such as being away for holidays and yourtime, so the house will be warm for when you come back.– Do you save money from running one It depends on gas and electricity prices. With the energy price hikes coming in this April, the % spike in the price of household gas will push up the cost of running a gas boiler above the cost of running an electric heat pump, even though electricity prices are also climbing.Experts estimate that households which have switched from a gas boiler to a heat pump could shave £ off their annual energy bills from April.Overall, the new grants, VAT cut and the high gas prices mean installing and running an efficient heat pump is approaching cost parity with gas boilers over their letimes, though have not reached it yet, analysis by Jan Rosenow of the Regulatory Assistance Project finds.– If I don’t want a heat pump are there other technologies that could be used to heat my home Prime Minister Boris Johnson has acknowledged that people are “worried about having to replace their boilers at vast expense”.While he said he believed costs will come down very fast, he has also pointed to hydrogen as an alternative way of heating homes.The gas could be put through the gas pipe network to heat homes with new boilers that can use hydrogen instead of fossil gas.But hydrogen, made from fossil gas with technology to capture and store the carbon dioxide that would be produced, or through using renewable power to split water, is currently an expensive option.In cities there is a role for district heat networks, which pipe hot water in underground pipes to bring heat from a central source, such as energy from a waste plant, rivers, or even former mines, to a heat exchanger in homes to provide heating and hot water.You can choose to install a heat pump when you’re ready, while other technologies may involve whole neighbourhoods or towns having to make the sht at the same time..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: What heat pumps mean for your home  u and your wallet article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The broadband support package will be available to eligible jobseekers through the Department for Communities’ Adviser Discretion Fund, a grant fund available to help remove barriers to employment that prevent people moving towards and into employment Minister Hargey said: “Digital exclusion has been one of the inequalities thrown into sharper focus by the Covid- pandemic. “More than ever, employers are posting vacancies online, with many having moved to online interviewing and more positions requiring people to work from home. “Therefore, not having access to broadband can be a signicant barrier to searching for, or moving into, employment. “I am tackling this by providing free broadband support which will provide broadband for eligible jobseekers who do not currently have the service.” Support for broadband through the Adviser Discretion Fund is available for a period of six months. The Fund can provide a non-repayable grant of up to pound,, in a  month period, to remove barriers to employment. The Minister continued: “The success of the Adviser Discretion Fund in helping remove barriers to employment has already been seen throughout the year, particularly in the uptake of upfront childcare costs, which I made available last October. “I am delighted that we have already helped around  parents with average upfront childcare costs of approximately pound. “This additional scheme will help remove similar barriers to employment for those facing digital exclusion due to a lack of broadband service.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_edcacafeecaccefcfbac   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dfecceddbfccdd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1613125631842.jpg--booster_third_dose_milestone_welcomed.jpg?161312563100","title":"booster third dose milestone welcomed ","story":"The number of COVID- vaccine boosters and third doses administered in Northern Ireland has passed the one million mark. The milestone has been welcomed by Patricia Donnelly, head of Northern Ireland’s vaccination programme. She said: “GPs, community pharmacists and Trusts have all worked extremely hard to roll out the booster campaign, with the period in the run up to Christmas particularly busy. “They all deserve our heartfelt thanks. Because of the vaccines, we now have much greater protection against the virus. “All those involved in the vaccination programme are genuine history makers.” Booster doses have been provided from the latter stages of last year, supplementing the two primary doses already received. At the same time, a third primary dose was offered to people with a severely weakened immune system, which was then followed by a booster three months after their third primary dose. The latest tallies on Northern Ireland’s vaccination dashboard include , boosters and , third doses. Patriciacontinued: “While demand for vaccines is no longer at levels from the peak of the campaign, people are still coming forward on a daily basis for boosters and first and second doses. “It’s still not too late to get these jabs. Please do so - and benefit from the really important protection they bring.” The one million landmark has been reached with the Spring booster campaign imminent. In line with UK-wide guidance set by the JCVI, the Spring campaign will offer an additional booster dose to: anyone who is aged  or over care home residents and anyone aged  and over who has a severely weakened immune system.

This increase will see the yearly gas bill of a typical household with a credit meter rise by about pound per year to pound,. Those customerswith a prepayment gas meterwill see costs increase by around pound per year to pound,. Raymond Gormley, Head of Energy Policy at the Consumer Council said: “It is important that consumers are made aware that their domestic gas bills will stay high for at least the next year because the wholesale price that the companies pay for the gas continues to be much more expensive than the norm. Unfortunately heating oil prices are also very high, so regardless of the fuel we use, many of us will experience extreme pressure on our household budgets. This will further increase the numbers of people in fuel poverty, as many families may struggle to find the extra money they will now need to pay for heating. “As the Winter   Emergency Fuel Payment Scheme ends today , we implore firmus energy, and the wider energy industry, to commit to financially supporting the continuation of a fuel hardship scheme in the coming financial year.
