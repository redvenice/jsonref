That evening, Epstein was filmed leaving the mansion with an unidentified woman, as newly-released stills, far right, show.They were spotted laughing and kissing as they walked away.While there is no suggestion of any impropriety on the part of the Duke, the fact he was drawn into Epstein’s toxic world and spent nearly a week in his company will surely raise further questions about his judgment and the statement he released yesterday.The December 2 dinner was held in the mansion’s second-floor dining room. TV anchor Katie Couric, once the highest-paid female presenter in the US, sat alongside comedian Chelsea Handler, a close friend of Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Aniston. Also there was George Stephanopoulos, a former White House communications director under President Bill Clinton turned £15 million-a-year ABC News host.The soiree is believed to have also been attended by Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the disgraced media tycoon Robert Maxwell and Epstein’s one-time girlfriend.Multiple Epstein accusers have claimed that Ms Maxwell ‘procured’ girls for the perverted millionaire. She denies the allegations.Guests would have walked past bizarre erotic artwork en route to the dining room with its gleaming mahogany table, including a painting of Bill Clinton in red heels and a blue dress, a reference to the outfit worn by Monica Lewinsky when she performed a sex act on him.         Jeffrey Epstein and unidentified lady left his Upper East Side mansion, variously dubbed the House of Horror and the House of Depravity by the banker’s young victimsIn an interview published on Friday in the US political magazine Mother Jones, Epstein’s friend Stuart Pivar, a respected scientist, told how the financier loved to shock at his parties. Mr Pivar described one dinner party to which Epstein had invited a group of top scientists. ‘Jeffrey had no attention  whatsoever, he would interrupt the conversation and say things like, “What does that got to do with p***y?” That was his favorite expression. It was a subject changer.’Whether Andrew heard Epstein utter those crass words remains unknown but the Prince, albeit unwittingly, was undoubtedly a ‘draw’ in New York where ‘you can buy anything except the caché of Royalty’, according to one woman who attended an Epstein party.The socialite told The Mail on Sunday last night: ‘There’s nothing socially mobile Manhattanites love more than brushing shoulders with a genuine member of the Royal Family. ‘Diana was a superstar. Prince Charles can command tens of thousands of dollars for tickets to a dinner. Jeffrey knew exactly what he was doing.‘Who is going to turn down the chance to mingle with a real-life Prince at dinner, even if the guy hosting it has a conviction for something as terrible as child molestation?         The Prince has fiercely denied any wrongdoing and knowledge of Epstein’s crimes, but he has faced questions about how he could have missed a procession of beautiful young women visiting the mansion during his six-day stay‘Royalty is stardust. People held their noses after Jeffrey was convicted but they were not going to turn down the chance to mingle with Royalty.’The Prince has fiercely denied any wrongdoing and knowledge of Epstein’s crimes, but he has faced questions about how he could have missed a procession of beautiful young women visiting the mansion during his six-day stay.‘There were girls coming and going the entire time Prince Andrew was inside the house,’ an eyewitness said.‘It was happening in broad daylight. If the Prince didn’t see all the girls coming through that door, he was the only person on 71st Street who didn’t. It was flagrant.‘At one point someone who looked like a royal protection officer came outside. Even if Andrew didn’t realise what was going on, you have to wonder why the people assigned to protect him didn’t say something?’Many of Epstein’s victims have described how assaults took place in an upstairs massage room which was strictly off-limits to other house guests.Some reports this week claimed Prince Andrew is now ‘fearful’ of returning to the US because he worries about being dragged into one of the multiple civil lawsuits being brought against Epstein’s £500 million estate. Lawyer Bradley Edwards, who represents several of the victims, said last night: ‘We would welcome the chance to speak to Prince Andrew under oath.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Sir Elton John set feature new set stamps mark 50 years showbiz","story":"Share this article               It is understood there will be a set of four stamps, each charting a different phase of his career (pictured: A Mail on Sunday interpretation of how the stamps commemorating Sir Elton’s career could look)A source said: ‘To Elton, this is the most tremendous honour.

Nature’s soft nurse, how have I frighted thee  That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down.” Henry IV, as portrayed by Shakespeare, would have sympathised with people who struggle with insomnia. Now a major publisher has come up with a novel idea – audiobooks with such soothing sounds as soft rainfall and lapping water to relax the listener and send them off to sleep.In a project to be launched this week, Penguin Random House has collaborated with the Sleep Council and the Children’s Sleep Charity in creating collections of “Sleep Tales” for adults and children.Combining “cutting-edge technology and the ancient art of storytelling to help solve an age-old problem”, these audiobooks are part soundscape, part descriptive narrative, with softly spoken voices to calm anxieties and take listeners to the land of nod. analysed data from NHS Digital, the health service’s data provider in England, showing admissions of those aged 16 and under with a primary diagnosis of sleep disorder rose from 6,520 in 2012-13 to 9,429 last year.One audiobook story, titled Wakarango Mai, takes listeners to a paradise setting, New Zealand’s hot springs at Lake Taupo. Against a distant soundscape of chirping birds and lapping water, the narrator Sally Scott sets the scene: “This huge shiny expanse of water isn’t far from civilisation in terms of miles and yet, when you enter this ancient place, the bustling modern city is left behind, as if it ceases to exist at all, leaving with it all your stress and worries …”Each story lasts about 15 minutes, enabling listeners to set their sleep timer.The stories draw on the Sleep Council’s research into sounds that help people wind down, such as waves lapping on a shore, soft rainfall and birdsong.Richard Lennon, publisher at Penguin Audio, told the  the project was inspired partly by the realisation that increasing numbers of people were listening to audiobooks “as they’re going to sleep or as part of their bedtime routine”.He said both adults and children respond to something comforting and familiar as they are nodding off.These are tales without a beginning, a middle or an end, he added: “It’s something that’s being described to you, rather than a story that’s being told to you … Nothing happens that jolts you.”There are no authors’ names. He said: “We’re launching them as simply Penguin, Puffin and Ladybird Sleep Tales, rather than mentioning the writers by name because the focus isn’t just on the words. The combination of the words, the voice and the sound design all contribute to the relaxing atmosphere.”Asked whether a boring story could have the same effect, he said the stories needed to be “engaging enough not to put you off”: “This is about creating the right environment and headspace for you … to go to sleep. Strangely, if you’re bored, it doesn’t have that effect.”Audience research had been very positive, Lennon said. One listener reported: “The story made my mind stop racing.”The phrase “sleep like a baby” does not apply to a lot of children, with four in 10 having sleep problems. But Lennon said the children’s sleep tales were not intended to replace a bedtime story, only to become part of a bedtime routine.Lisa Artis of the Sleep Council said not everyone liked the same sounds: “Some people love thunder and lightning or birds tweeting. That’s why we came up with different stories with different effects. For some people, listening to rain just makes them want to go to the loo. But I personally like the sound of rain. I find it quite therapeutic.”She added that listening to “non-stimulating” stories were about switching off before bedtime: “It is the sort of thing you need to be doing before bed to feel more relaxed, rather than scrolling through Facebook and checking work emails … We need to forget about everything that’s going on because we will not get a good night’s sleep otherwise.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/125124f9d405e9ba2a3e74e58b04acbe7d63b303/0_834_5224_3134/master/5224.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a984d98c2374a691a2d1705d71b5c52","title":"sin eaters richard munslow","story":"Those of us on the barricades of the news cycle sometimes delude ourselves that by paying vigilant witness, we’re performing some necessary functionIn 2010, a fundraiser was held to repair the grave of a man named Richard Munslow. In the century since Munslow had been buried in the town of Ratlinghope, about an hour outside of Birmingham, the stone that marked his life had fallen into disrepair.After a few months, the £1,000 needed to hire a local stonemason was raised and the work was done. “This grave at Ratlinghope is now in an excellent state of repair,” the Reverend Norman Morris, the town’s vicar, told the BBC at the time. “But I have no desire to reinstate the ritual that went with it.”The ritual in question was known as sin-eating, the art of which Munslow is believed to have been the last practitioner. In the eighteenth and nineteenth century in the surrounding area and up through Scotland and Wales, sin-eaters would have been a familiar sight if not one exactly sanctioned by the church. Having a monopoly on the redemption of souls, they would have seen such a practice as muscling in on their corner.The essence of Munslow’s duties was to perform a sort of shamanistic ritual in which a piece of bread and a bowl of ale were passed over the remains of the recently deceased. The sins of the deceased were, as any idiot will obviously understand, thereby subsumed into the meal and the sad bastard would dine on them taking the sins on as his own and ensuring that the dead would pass unmolested through the gates of Heaven.Sin-eaters were commonly itinerant and destitute types traveling here and there until they were called upon in haste. Who but the most desperate would agree to such a one-sided metaphysical bargain in the first place? They were paid very little for the gruesome task and furthermore shunned as foul pariahs for their trouble when it was done. Each bite of bread and each sip of ale further curdled their own load-bearing souls.Munslow was unique in that he was said to be a well-established farmer in his time before getting into sin-eating. It was the loss of his four children that drove him to the practice it’s been written. Perhaps it was out of grief or perhaps it was an attempt to ensure their safe passage into the next life. You almost have to respect it. Unlike the other gig economy sin-eaters our man did it for the love of the game.Here are some things that happened in August of 2018.On a Tuesday, a woman being held in jail in Texas killed herself. She couldn’t afford the $1,500 she would need for bail. Meanwhile, a GoFundMe for Peter Strzok, a very well-off cop who lost his job for being rude to the president, had raised almost $450,000 in less than a week.On a Friday, dozens of Yemeni children were bombed to their deaths by a missile fired by the Saudi-led and US-supported coalition. It hit their school bus. As CNN reported the “500-pound laser-guided MK 82 bomb” was made by Lockheed Martin.

He was in the process of bringing his pregnant wife to the hospital to give birth. The agents left her to fend for herself and the aftermath was caught on the security camera of the gas station. She’s crying and distraught and very very pregnant standing there next to the Doritos and shit. “Mom forced to deliver without dad” the chyron on CBS LA read.That same week a Houston doctor was sentenced to ten years’ probation after being convicted of raping a sedated patient in her hospital bed who was there after experiencing a severe asthma attack. Shafeeq Sheikh lost his medical license but would serve no time. “Testifying in Spanish through an interpreter, the former patient said in the early morning of Nov 2, 2013, she awoke to find a man at her bedside in a white doctor’s coat saying he needed to examine her. He pushed up her gown and touched her breasts in an ‘ugly way,’ and she pushed the call button repeatedly, she said. Witnesses testified that it had been unplugged from the wall,” the Houston Chronicle reported.Sheikh testified that the sex had been consensual saying that she was the instigator and then his lawyer showed the jury images from Laura’s Instagram where she had posted a number of “sexy” photos as part of her job promoting a clothing boutique which is the universal signal that we all understand which means it’s OK to rape someone. “He made a mistake, but he didn’t sexually assault her,” his attorney Lisa Andrews argued. “Here we have this Latina woman with her fake boobs that came onto that little nerdy middle-aged guy, and he lost his mind.”Most people do not attend hourly to the sins of the world in its perpetual cycle of grief and misery on Twitter. Most people have better things to do with their lives than read 10,000 posts. Presumably, if you are reading this you trend toward the heavier news diet than most if not quite on the Clockwork Orange eyeball torture feed I, a writer, subsist on. I wonder if there’s a better way to live without abstaining from the feed entirely? What exactly is it we’re doing, those of us who scroll through our newsfeed endlessly like an addict lifelessly pulling the lever on a slot machine waiting for information and sadness to spill out?Certainly there are ways to effect change in the world – taking to the streets, protesting, boycotts, pressuring your representatives, helping register people to vote – but those of us on the barricades of the news cycle sometimes delude and flatter ourselves that by paying vigilant witness, we’re performing some necessary function.Sometimes I think that I, like the destitute sin-eaters, behold the grief of the world without respite because I have no other choice. Each sin I consume I can turn into a living. Much like them, it’s a paltry one to be sure and we writers and journalists are not much respected either.Other times I think a lot of us – and this includes myself – tend to be more like ol’ Bobby Munslow. We’ve been driven mad with grief and we know nothing else but to continue to compound it in a gluttonous feast. We gorge ourselves on the sins of others until it sickens us hoping without any sort of reliable proof that in the end it might help someone but knowing nonetheless that it won’t.Adapted from Luke O’Neils newsletter Welcome to Hell World and the forthcoming book of the same name."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f2afb2ffa90d25e85b497e263a8680e7d64ca5a/0_5_4031_2419/master/4031.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce3f964191aaac8229719033bbc7061b","title":"airline punctuality at uk airports nosedives finds which","story":"Ryanair and Easyjet delays double in five years, as Stansted named worst airport for takeoff timesAirline punctuality at Britain’s airports has plummeted, with the number of hour-long delays on Ryanair and Easyjet flights doubling in the last five years, according to research by Which?.The budget airlines rejected the findings, saying they were the victims of air traffic control delays, extreme weather conditions and strikes.But Which? said both airports and airlines had failed to match the rapid growth in the number of flights with the resources needed to handle an increase in traffic.It analysed 10m flights, and estimated that last year alone 17 million passengers were affected by delays, but most passengers were not entitled to compensation because this is only payable after a three-hour delay.Naomi Leach from Which? Travel said: “It is unacceptable for passengers to be regularly inconvenienced with delays that can leave them hundreds of pounds out of pocket when they miss connections or transfers, are fined for picking up their hire car late or miss their train or cab home.”In a robust response, Ryanair rejected the findings. In a statement, it said: “These Which? figures are inflated and inaccurate. They refer to 2018, which was the worst year on record for ATC delays in Europe.”EasyJet and Thomas Cook both claimed factors beyond their control were to blame for the delays, such as airspace, weather and strikes.Stansted said it had posted significantly improved results in the first quarter of 2019, in part because Ryanair had invested in additional resourcing and equipment to support ground operation.While delays at British Airways improved over the five-year period, over the weekend furious customers attacked the airline for its handling of the pilots’ strike planned for September.Customers swamped BA helplines, and many passengers reported calling every hour but never getting through. Others messaged the company on Twitter with their frustrations, some complaining they would miss weddings and honeymoons.Scott Kishere, a filmmaker and police community officer, said: “My wife and I have been told that our flight to Toronto has been cancelled. This was a full package we booked through BA for our 10-year wedding anniversary. I have made over 100 attempts to contact them for a refund and they’re not answering.”BA said it was receiving nine times its normal call volumes and that 500 staff worked over the weekend to help sort out customer issues. But the airline admitted to adding to the chaos, after it sent some customers an email to say their flight had been cancelled, even though the flight was on a non-strike day and was scheduled to go ahead.After it realised the error, BA emailed customers again but by that time many had rebooked with other airlines.In a statement, it said: “We are sorry for any confusion and inconvenience this has caused. We would encourage anyone who has incurred any expenses as a direct result to get in touch, and we will deal with each case on an inidual basis.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cac42bc651b5214123f69a67113ef441d66ce1c/0_281_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9f404cdfd4d324bb65ba476d5d8a589","title":"central bankers conventional tools no longer working","story":"Tweaking inflation targets is not an adequate response to the challenges facing major economiesThe world’s central bankers and the scholars who follow them are having their annual moment of reflection in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. But the theme of this year’s meeting, “challenges for monetary policy”, may encourage an insular – and dangerous – complacency.Simply put, tweaking inflation targets, communications strategies, or even balance sheets is not an adequate response to the challenges now confronting the major economies. Rather, 10 years of below-target inflation throughout the developed world, with 30 more expected by the market, and the utter failure of the Bank of Japan’s extensive efforts to raise inflation suggest that what was previously treated as axiomatic is in fact false: central banks cannot always set inflation rates through monetary policy.These developments seem to lend further support to the concept of secular stagnation indeed, the issue is much more profound than is generally appreciated. Relative to what was expected when one of us (Summers) sought to resurrect the concept in 2013, deficits and national debt levels are far higher, nominal and real interest rates are far lower, and yet nominal GDP growth has been far slower. This suggests some set of forces operating to reduce aggregate demand, whose effect has only been partly attenuated by fiscal policies.Conventional policy discussions are rooted in the (by now old) New Keynesian tradition of viewing macroeconomic problems as a reflection of frictions that slow convergence to a classical market-clearing equilibrium. The idea is that the combination of low inflation, a declining neutral real interest rate, and an effective lower bound on nominal interest rates may preclude the restoration of full employment. According to this view, anything that can be done to reduce real interest rates is constructive, and with sufficient interest-rate flexibility, secular stagnation can be overcome. With the immediate problem being excessive real rates, looking first to central banks and monetary policies for a solution is natural.We are increasingly skeptical that matters are so straightforward. The near-universal tendency among central bankers has been to interpret the coincidence of very low real interest rates and nonaccelerating inflation as evidence that the neutral real interest rate has declined and to use conventional monetary policy frameworks with an altered neutral real rate.But more ominous explanations are possible. There are strong reasons to believe that the capacity of lower interest rates to stimulate the economy has been attenuated – or even gone into reverse.The share of interest-sensitive durable-goods sectors in GDP has decreased. The importance of target saving effects has grown as interest rates have fallen, while the negative effect of reductions in interest rates on disposable income has increased as government debts have risen. Declining interest rates in the current environment undermine financial intermediaries’ capital position and hence their lending capacity. As the economic cycle has globalized, the exchange-rate channel has become less important for monetary policy. With real interest rates negative, it is doubtful that the cost of capital is an important constraint on investment.To take the most ominous case first, with interest-rate reductions having both positive and negative effects on demand, it may be that there is no real interest rate consistent with full resource utilization. Interest-rate reductions beyond a certain point may constrain rather than increase demand. In this case, not only will monetary policy be unable to achieve full employment, it will also be unable to increase inflation. If demand consistently falls short of capacity, the Phillips curve implies that inflation will tend to fall rather than rise.Even if interest-rate cuts at all points proximately increase demand, there are substantial grounds for concern if this effect is weak. It may be that any short-run demand benefit is offset by the adverse effects of lower rates on subsequent performance. This could happen for macroeconomic or microeconomic reasons.From a macro perspective, low interest rates promote leverage and asset bubbles by reducing borrowing costs and discount factors, and encouraging investors to reach for yield. Almost every account of the 2008 financial crisis assigns at least some role to the consequences of the very low interest rates that prevailed in the early 2000s. More broadly, students of bubbles, from the economic historian Charles Kindleberger onward, always emphasize the role of easy money and overly ample liquidity.From a micro perspective, low rates undermine financial intermediaries’ health by reducing their profitability, impede the efficient allocation of capital by enabling even the weakest firms to meet debt-service obligations, and may also inhibit competition by favouring incumbent firms. There is something unhealthy about an economy in which corporations can profitably borrow and invest even if the project in question pays a zero return.These considerations suggest that reducing interest rates may not be merely insufficient, but actually counterproductive, as a response to secular stagnation.This formulation of the secular stagnation view is closely related to the economist Thomas Palley’s recent critique of “zero lower bound economics”: negative interest rates may not remedy Keynesian unemployment. More generally, in moving toward the secular stagnation view, we have come to agree with the point long stressed by writers in the post-Keynesian (or, perhaps more accurately, original Keynesian) tradition: the role of particular frictions and rigidities in underpinning economic fluctuations should be de-emphasized relative to a more fundamental lack of aggregate demand.If reducing rates will be insufficient or counterproductive, central bankers’ ingenuity in loosening monetary policy in an environment of secular stagnation is exactly what is not needed. What is needed are admissions of impotence, in order to spur efforts by governments to promote demand through fiscal policies and other means.Instead of more old New Keynesian economics, we hope, but do not expect, that this year’s gathering in Jackson Hole will bring forth a new Old Keynesian economics.• Lawrence H Summers, US secretary of the treasury (1999-2001) and director of the US National Economic Council (2009-2010), is a former president of Harvard University, where he is currently university professor.• Anna Stansbury is a PhD candidate in economics at Harvard University."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e654a89d9b1b7b0555864d59ec58001122f635f6/0_39_5862_3517/master/5862.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ea38405c1adb2aa62426f62f5c9b121","title":"brexit no deal mps panic","story":"It’s not leaving the EU without a deal but jitters in parliament afterwards that the prime minister should worry aboutAre you ready for a no-deal Brexit? Have you stockpiled enough toilet paper? Built a small fort of tinned tomatoes, just in case? Over the next few weeks, government adverts will start warning the British public, businesses and neighbouring countries to prepare for Britain leaving the European Union without a deal, even though the official position of the government is that it still wants an agreement with Brussels.Ministers insist that they are now preparing properly for this sort of departure on 31 October, and that leaked documents predicting chaos are out of date, wrong, and being released by political opponents who want to scaremonger. They point to the extra £2.1bn being spent on protecting the supply of medicines, on ports and important freight routes, and on preparing local authorities. They argue that Boris Johnson’s administration is taking no deal seriously, unlike Theresa May and her chancellor, Philip Hammond.Even if ministers are right that their preparedness for the physical consequences of no deal are perfect, how sure are they that their colleagues are mentally ready? A number of senior Brexiteers are worried that if Britain does leave without a deal, the main problem might not be that there are what many of them optimistically term “bumps in the road”, but that MPs end up having a massive and very noisy panic attack about the whole endeavour.MPs have a tendency to panic even in small crises, calling anxiously for anyone even tangentially involved to resign so that they can at least appear to have a handle on the situation. They are much like the relatives regularly observed by doctors on geriatric wards: the ones who are the most demanding of the healthcare professionals invariably turn out to be those who failed to visit their ailing mother for years, and are now taking out their guilt on the poor nursing staff.When flooding hit the Somerset Levels in the winter of 2013-14, politicians who had paid scant attention to the activities of the Environment Agency suddenly started running around like disturbed ants. One even threatened to take Chris Smith, the boss of the quango, and “stick his head down the loo”. They’re no less brutal with their own parliamentary colleagues: ministerial resignations during bumpy periods are often seen as a way of releasing pressure, rather than actually holding someone accountable for making a mistake.It will be easy for this pattern to manifest itself again in a “bumpy” no-deal scenario. One Brexiteer fretted to me recently that “if there is no deal, journalists like you are going to find various things that have gone wrong, or a few bins that have fallen over, and then my colleagues are all going to start panicking about what no deal has done to the country, even if these problems were entirely unrelated to Brexit. They’ll start saying, ‘Oh no, this isn’t what I meant at all,’ and will then look around for someone to blame.” Another senior Tory predicts that “we might have another dodgy dossier-style situation, where you get MPs saying, ‘I only supported the evidence I was presented with, but now I’ve changed my mind.’”Johnson may find this panic hard to weather. Most Conservatives predict that he will win a vote of no confidence if the Labour party calls it in the first week of parliament sitting. But many of them worry that this result will mean the government limps on to a no-deal Brexit without having an election to clear the air. This is one of the reasons why senior Conservatives are making plans for a mid-October poll, which they hope would give Johnson the mandate to demand a new deal from Brussels.There is also the rather obvious blame game going on between the British government and its European counterparts. If there is no deal, Johnson will want to say it was recalcitrant EU leaders who forced Britain out in this way. Similarly European negotiators want to impress upon anyone who will listen that Britain is already dead set on leaving without a deal, and is only throwing up silly suggestions on the backstop that it knows could never work.If the EU fails as a convenient scapegoat, No 10 can also blame the May government for failing to prepare properly, and remainers in parliament for undermining the negotiations. This will drive an even deeper wedge through the Conservative party.Most ministerial attention is currently focused on what the first two weeks of September will bring, rather than on how MPs might behave in November. There are some plans to try to stop parliamentarians panicking. Michael Gove is likely to do weekly statements to the House of Commons on no-deal preparations, so MPs can’t say they weren’t informed, and the prime minister is holding regular dinners with MPs. Johnson on Sunday tried to prepare his colleagues and the public, saying: “I do not want at this stage to say there won’t be unforeseen difficulties.” His top adviser, Dominic Cummings, has been pushing ministerial aides to look for possible problems in their own departments in order to avoid a “black swan event” – an unexpected and severe crisis.The problem with genuine black swans, though, is that they only ever appear obvious once they have surfaced. Anything special advisers find now isn’t what will cause them the most trouble in the future. All they can do is hope that the most unexpected thing of all happens, which is that MPs don’t conform to their usual pattern, and manage not to panic.• Isabel Hardman is assistant editor of the Spectator"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afbde83d121f257fe2e041686dbf5e9fb21f7769/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8db9297328327807d86708c418baf9fb","title":"lost child turkey refuge imaginary mountain","story":"When I felt misplaced in my new world, the legends of Mount Qaf gave me a place of endless possibilities and uncensored wordsI was born in France to Turkish parents. A small flat in a tower block, sunlight through the curtains pierced by swirls of cigarette smoke. The strong smell of Gauloises, Turkish and Syrian tobacco packaged with French style. Immigrants, students, workers … leftists, mostly. Reading Althusser and Fanon but not so much De Beauvoir, passionately arguing about the revolution they believed was soon to come. When I think about my first home that’s how I see it in my mind’s eye.Shortly afterwards my parents broke up. My father stayed in France and my mother brought me to Turkey. To her, this was the motherland. To me, it was a new country. Some of my earliest memories are interlaced with a sense of placelessness. We arrived in my maternal grandmother’s neighbourhood. A two-storey, sea-green house that looked like a child’s drawing of home. Red roof, blue door, a fenced garden with fruit trees – apple, pear and sour cherry. It was a deeply conservative, deeply patriarchal environment. Life revolved around families, and families revolved around fathers, the acknowledged heads of households. Many fathers – although certainly not all – centred their being upon an abstract code of honour and discipline. There was an order to things, but it kept eluding me. Back then air pollution in Ankara had reached dangerous levels and we would go to school under veils of smog, wearing homemade cloth masks. There were long queues in front of grocery stores. It was also a time of political violence. On streets, public squares, campuses and schoolyards different political factions clashed. The elderly buried the young.It was around that time that I first came across a mysterious place in a book I was reading. A land of undisturbed peace, justice, equality, freedom. An elsewhere. It was called “that which lies behind Mount Qaf”. When I asked the people around me I was surprised to find out that they had all heard about this place, though none claimed to have ever visited it. Tradition said Mount Qaf, invisible on any map, was at the centre of this world. Others saw it as the abode of spirits and djinn – creatures made of smokeless fire. With the possible exception of Alexander the Great, it was said, many a traveller had failed to find its whereabouts, but one still had to keep trying. Little did I know back then that so many generations from the Middle East to Central Asia had grown up with the stories of that bountiful land that lies “beyond the limits of the mind of the philosopher Avicenna”.The legends about Mount Qaf emphasise the importance of knowledge, about yourself and the world around you. The seekers of other places and better worlds are seekers of wisdom. The 13th-century Persian cosmographer and geographer Al-Qazwini was one of the earliest scholars to write about it. He was endlessly curious about what he saw as terrestrial beings – seas, rivers, valleys – and supra-terrestrial beings –angels, djinn and ghuls. In line with the depiction in the Qur’an, he said the mountain circled the entire world while its green emeralds gave the sky its peculiar blue colour.It is not only Muslim communities that were drawn to the allure of Mount Qaf. The same story echoed across cultures, from Christian art to medieval Jewish philosophy. Armenian tales refer to “Mount Qaf in the Kingdom of Stars” and talk of an extraordinary bird – Zumrut – that made its nest on top of it. In The Conference of Birds the Sufi poet Attar of Nishapur wrote beautifully about the King of Birds, calling it Simurgh. In Attar’s story, birds from all over the world, eager to meet their ruler, set off on a long and perilous journey along the way many lose heart, others are scared or tired. In the end just 30 birds remain. Only when they arrive at their destination do they realise that “simurgh” means 30. What they were looking for was inside them all along.Al-Qazwini’s legendary creatures later on became one of the inspirations behind Jorge Luis Borges’s The Book of Imaginary Beings. Attuned to Sufi stories and remarkably knowledgeable in folklores of the world, he lovingly embraced and explored this idea. As Hernan Diaz demonstrates in Borges, Between History and Eternity, the author returned to this theme in a poem composed of 30 lines: “No one is the fatherland – it is all of us.”For me, however, the other side of Mount Qaf had nothing to do with nationalistic fervour or territorialism. Just the opposite, I was drawn to it as a place of endless possibilities and uncensored words – a source of ersity, creativity, imagination. It held the keys to Storyland. It provided a sense of empowerment to the powerless. That is why in numerous Middle Eastern stories – including the Arabian Nights – the protagonists ask the same thing from the magic carpet: “Carry me to Mount Qaf.”Every novel is a journey into elsewhere. From James Joyce’s Dublin to CS Lewis’s Narnia and Tolkien’s Middle-earth, whether it is about an actual place or a purely imaginary one, literature is a bold attempt to remap space and spatiality. Lost and confused though they themselves might often be, storytellers are passionate literary cartographers trying to render the invisible more visible and bring closer that which seems to be afar. It is our way of saying that there is no “us versus them” – the Other is, in truth, my brother, my sister. The Other is me.Readers know this. That is why, every time we start a new book, get under the bed covers, sit in our favourite chair or seek refuge in the local library and open that very first page, there is a part of us that faithfully repeats the old mantra: “Carry me to Mount Qaf.”• Elif Shafak is a novelist and political scientist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe34de8b6b7fb942335c8cc29a5aeb2892595fa7/0_1128_3695_2217/master/3695.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54e67f4b4f3ae5e25ece24e8b6762473","title":"england school places shortage made worse by academies","story":"Government urged to restore powers to councils to open new schools to cope with demandCouncils are warning that a looming shortage in the number of school places across England is being made worse by academies, as last decade’s baby boom enters secondary schools over the next five years.The Local Government Association (LGA) is calling for the government to restore powers to councils enabling them to open new maintained schools if residents support them, and for new powers for councils to require academies to expand to meet local demand.Anntoinette Bramble, the chair of the LGA’s children and young people board, said that without such changes children were at risk of not having a secondary school place.“Our secondary school places crisis is now just one year away and this will be the reality for thousands of families without action,” Bramble said.Councils say their position is made impossible by conflicting rules, which place a legal duty on them to ensure adequate school places for local children but allow only autonomous academies and free schools to be opened to provide more places, other than in rare circumstances.With most state secondary schools in England now academies, the problem is made worse because local authorities cannot direct them to expand their intake or offer more places to meet forecast high demand, as they can with maintained schools.“Councils need to be allowed to open new maintained schools and direct academies to expand. It makes no sense for councils to be given the responsibility to plan for school places but then not be allowed to open schools themselves,” Bramble said.“The government needs to work closely with councils to meet the challenges currently facing the education system.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education (DfE) said: “We are determined to create more choice for parents when it comes to their children’s education and we have created around 920,000 school places since 2010, and are on track to see that number rise to a million by 2020.As parents and families prepare to apply for school places in 2020 when applications open later this year, the LGA says the DfE’s statistics suggest 15 areas have a shortage of classrooms, with the number of councils affected then rapidly increasing.By 2022, about a third of councils are expected to have a shortage of places for nearly 60,000 pupils. That figure rises to nearly half of all local authorities in England by the school year starting in September 2024, when more than 120,000 young people are “at risk of no place” if no new schools are built.In recent years, councils have created an estimated 600,000 places in primary schools to cope with the mini baby boom of the previous decade. But as children in that group move on to secondary school, councils say they have far less ability to provide more places.Last year, councils say, they created 96,000 places through their existing primary and secondary schools and, in a small number of cases, by commissioning places in academies. But only 37,000 of the new places were in secondary schools.The LGA’s plea comes as the government is reviving plans to rapidly expand the proportion of academies and free schools in England."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcff64193c567b632a74112002fc4e48b5ea832e/0_1139_8077_4848/master/8077.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9391bdc9789872e3fc5772abffc7ebe6","title":"data and the dress what christopher wylie can teach fashion","story":"Big data can help high street retailers maximise profits, but it also has the potential to improve sustainability. Should the consumer be worried about how their information is being used?There is plenty for the modern fashion lover to be concerned about. As if trying to juggle your finances with choosing responsibly made clothes wasn’t tricky enough, a new ethical threat looms over the industry: data privacy.In the age of fast fashion – where online retailers such as Boohoo and Missguided can offer tops for a tenner and £1 bikinis – high-street retailers are fighting to keep their prices competitive by maximising what they know about their shoppers. This is only made possible, however, by gathering vast amounts of consumer data.Consumer data can be used to predict how many clothes each shopper will buy, meaning companies will be able to minimise waste, making them less likely to incinerate garments in the future. This is technology that H\u0026ampM is planning to leverage in order to better forecast future collections. It has first-hand experience of what happens when that is done badly: in 2017, it incinerated millions of dollars’ worth of stock before it ever reached a shop floor. While the retailer claimed the clothes were unsellable for safety reasons, the speculation was that the decision was taken simply because the items were never going to sell. It was an environmental nightmare, a PR disaster for the brand and a massive waste of money. In theory, for a global company such as H\u0026ampM, avoiding a repeat performance could help to maximise profits – and deliver sweeping sustainability gains.To get the most out of its new venture, H\u0026ampM assembled a team of experts in the fields of data analytics and artificial intelligence. One such data tsar is Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who has been hired in a consultancy role. Upon his appointment, he explained: “We can’t help people if we don’t know who they are. With the use of data, we can make sure our customers get what they want.” But consumers can already get exactly what they want, they just have to shop around to get it. The real task facing Wylie and the newly formed team is to ensure H\u0026ampM knows what customers want before their high street rivals do.While it may seem revolutionary, H\u0026ampM’s work represents the tip of the iceberg. Google Cloud recently unveiled an unprecedented partnership with Stella McCartney that will see the tech giant gather and process huge quantities of data from the luxury brand’s supply chain. This, to start with, will focus on the use of resources such as water in producing materials such as cotton, but the possibilities of Google Cloud’s data processing are broader: if applied to sales, brands may be able to respond on an almost daily basis to changing customer desires rather than waiting months to plan future collections. This could be a hugely powerful tool in a fashion industry with ever shortening lead times.Consumer scepticism is well placed, according to Lauren Vargas, a digital fellow at the University of Leicester. A specialist in the application of artificial intelligence, Vargas believes the public should be “wary of all companies – regardless of size – collecting and using their data. People need to take responsibility, to be aware of what information they are giving away and what they may be sacrificing in return for their information.” Your favourite fashion haunt almost certainly stores your name, age, address, email, bank details and style preferences – and they may well soon have built up a picture of your body shape and size, in addition to knowing what days and times you tend to shop. But who really wants Topshop knowing more about you than your friends and family do?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d20f6db7f660587056347febea5ca4d36899315b/0_97_4932_2960/master/4932.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15f9ae0baf84f24622b6efe91f4d501d","title":"harvey weinstein new  indictment annabella sciorra","story":"Prosecutors to likely ask for Sciorra’s testimony to be included rather than add additional charge, which could delay proceedingsHarvey Weinstein will head back to court in New York on Monday morning, to be arraigned on a new indictment involving the actor Annabella Sciorra.The indictment has not been publicly disclosed. It is not clear if the movie mogul will face additional charges.Weinstein has already been charged with two counts of predatory sexual assault, one count of criminal sexual act in the first degree, one count of first-degree rape and one count of third-degree rape.With the start of his trial less than three weeks away, it is likely that rather than add an additional charge, which could delay proceedings, prosecutors will ask for Sciorra’s testimony to be included, in attempt to establish a pattern of criminal behaviour.Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to all charges, maintaining that encounters with his accusers were consensual. If found guilty, the 67-year-old could spend the rest of his life in jail.Last week, lawyers for Weinstein described the arraignment as “unprecedented”.“There has been no case in recent memory where a district attorney has gone back to the grand jury on two separate occasions to re-present a case before that body in the hopes of obtaining an indictment that can withstand the scrutiny of a trial jury,” attorneys Donna Rotunno and Arthur Aidala said in a statement.The lawyers claimed the “action by the prosecutor bespeaks the desperation that has engulfed their case” and indicated “more of a focus on obtaining a conviction at all costs than on seeking justice”.More than 80 women have alleged sexual misconduct on the part of the producer, over four decades.Prosecutors first charged Weinstein with sexually assaulting three women. Charges relating to the actor Lucia Evans were dropped over inconsistencies in her testimony raised by the defense.Evans alleged that Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex during a meeting in 2004. But according to public records, a witness told police Evans had said her sexual encounter with Weinstein was consensual.Among the alleged encounters that remain attached to the case, Mimi Haleyi claims Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006. The other accuser, who has not been identified, has accused Weinstein of twice raping her in 2013.Weinstein’s lawyers claim the woman maintained communications with Weinstein after the alleged encounter, describing “a consensual intimate relationship documented in more than 400 emails”.Earlier this year, prosecutors amended their evidence to add Sciorra. She has publicly accused Weinstein of sexually assaulting her at her Gramercy Park apartment in 1993.Judge James Burke first said Sciorra could not be added to the case because she had not been before a grand jury. Prosecutors convened another such panel this month, resulting in the indictment.Weinstein’s defense team is seeking to have the trial moved from Manhattan.In a court filing last week, attorneys said: “It is safe to say that New York City is the least likely place on earth where Mr Weinstein could receive a fair trial, where jurors could hear evidence, deliberate, and render a verdict in an atmosphere free of intimidation from pressure to deliver a result that the politicians, the activists, the celebrities and the media demand.”Judge Burke has yet to rule on the request."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0456c33d4947b5f1196ed04760f0a749212f3d1/0_7_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64b92b76c984697ff35af8d2abd78db8","title":"retro active why film makers are getting stuck in the past","story":"New movie Bait’s rejection of digital technology could open up new paths to creative expressionIn the same way that vinyl has made a comeback in the face of digital streaming, so cinema is in the throes of its own analogue revival. A certain breed of movie aficionado cherishes the soft richness of photographic film over the garish perfection of digital. Some are going even further, into the realms of what you might call artisanal film-making.From that perspective, new British movie Bait sounds like an absurd extreme in defiantly keeping it old school. It was filmed on a 1976 Bolex camera, with black-and-white 16mm film, hand-processed by director Mark Jenkin in an old Bakelite tank, using processing materials including washing soda, vitamin C powder and coffee. Yes, but what kind of coffee, you may ask – Sumatran or Javan?As a result, despite being set in modern-day Cornwall, Bait has a convincing retro feel that’s somewhere between Italian neorealism and 1950s public information films.This kind of faux-retro aesthetic (I once called it “retrovision”) has become a fetish for certain film-makers. Canadian auteur Guy Maddin has based much of his career on it, as has Peter Strickland, whose recent In Fabric replicated the visual style of its early-90s setting perfectly. Michel Hazanavicius deployed retrovision to Oscar-winning effect with The Artist, shot in digital but faithfully mimicking silent-era movie-making. Then there’s Todd Haynes, whose 50s-set dramas Carol and Far from Heaven emulated the techniques of the era. Quentin Tarantino, meanwhile, once called digital projection “the death of cinema as I know it” . Not only is his latest, Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood, shot in 35mm, it also incorporates flashbacks and asides shot in other retro formats, such as Super 8 and 16mm. Tarantino also filmed The Hateful Eight in the obscure 70mm Panavision format, then urged cinemas to reinstate the projectors to play it.As with vinyl, this could all be seen as the last stand of an endangered medium. Does this craft of film-making make for more “authentic” movies? Or is it just beard-stroking affectation, designed to separate the digital masses from an analogue cognoscenti? What’s striking about the above film-makers is that, despite the obsessive retro stylings, these are stories you could never have told at the time, from Strickland and Maddin’s eccentric twisted tales to Haynes’s taboo romances.Bait actually moves the artisanal revival on even further. Ignoring the aesthetic, the story is bang up to date: a saga of Cornish fishing traditions clashing with gentrification, against a backdrop of Brexit-era austerity. What’s more, the formal experimentation is ravishing to behold. It makes your average digital, mainstream movie look staid. Maybe sometimes you have to go back to move forwards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7311ce2fd5eec8f4945a2ca984ccddbfb1a171ed/0_94_2281_1369/master/2281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcb18e6bc7f216e92d00977f8fac29f4","title":"jurgen klopp liverpool arsenal","story":"Arsenal were the latest victims of a side defined by their tireless intensity but can they keep it up for the entire season?Talk of the “Liverpool way” long preceded Jürgen Klopp’s appointment but, much as the club has been rejuvenated since his arrival, so has an ethos been reinvented. “Our identity is intensity,” said the German. Gérard Houllier and Rafael Benítez, who preached control, may not recognise this variant of Liverpool but, more than most, Arsenal can testify to the effectiveness of Klopp’s energetic makeover.“They are a fantastic team when they have rhythm,” said David Luiz, before arrowing in on the same word: “They play with intensity. They never stop.” Perhaps Arsenal were not beaten as much as frazzled, their decision-making warped by Liverpool’s relentlessness. Poor choices have pockmarked David Luiz’s career but the two that came in 10 second-half minutes, tugging back Mohamed Salah to concede a penalty and then careering towards the Egyptian only to miss him when he sprinted clear to score his second, may have been the product of Liverpool’s unremitting running. Perhaps physical tiredness brought mental fatigue. Goals were the result of intensity.“The tempo we put from the beginning was incredible, really incredible,” Klopp added. “There was no time to breathe. The opponent of the quality of Arsenal, you have to break somehow: break them physically.” As ever, Arsenal were broken at Anfield: perhaps not as badly as in the 4-0 and 5-1 eviscerations of their last two visits but to such an extent as to call into question Unai Emery’s claim that he feels “positive because the stature of the team is growing”.The concern is whether Liverpool will drain themselves in the process, sapping their strength through the intensity of their industry. “No, no,” Klopp countered. “We are well prepared. We use every second of pre-season to be ready. That is why we were so tired in pre-season. The human body doesn’t need eight weeks to come clear somehow, it’s not like this.”Mané has been a past scourge of Arsenal. On Saturday, Salah assumed that mantle, leaving the Gunners lamenting his spot-kick. “Maybe without that penalty it is different,” Emery added. “It killed the game,” said David Luiz, whose booking for his part in that incident deterred him from stopping Salah when he scored again: “You make a foul and put the team with 10 men, it is even worse.” Perhaps, for an Arsenal defender, Anfield embarrassment is a rite of passage. If the newcomer David Luiz was hired to alter that, he recognises change is needed. Arsenal have conceded 51 league goals in each of the last two campaigns. Brendan Rodgers’ Liverpool are the only team breached 50 times to finish in the top four in the last 17 seasons, though David Luiz suggested his ambitions are set higher than that.“If you concede a lot of goals you cannot fight for the title so this is one main thing we have to think about and try to reduce,” he added. “It is not just about me it is not just about the defenders. Now in modern football everybody defends when they don’t have the ball and everybody attacks when they do have the ball.”That has certainly been Klopp’s ethos, with the gegenpressing Roberto Firmino doubling up as the first line of the defence, the two most creative full-backs in Europe and Joël Matip having scored two goals before the end of August. That intensity has resolved the identity crisis of the Liverpool Klopp inherited. “The intention was to be us,” Klopp added. “Just be us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6198d9a5d6baf7fa3a554f4d55bff2b9fd959d2b/0_211_3164_1898/master/3164.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=562989507a14aa7a66a63333c7f808c8","title":"premier league 10 talking points football weekend action","story":"Cahill shows his worth to Palace, Lacazette proves Emery’s odd one out again and Wilson could be the signing of the seasonIt will not end the culture war between Newcastle fans and Mike Ashley, but victory at the Tottenham Stadium might just lift a few suspicions over Steve Bruce. In the first half, Newcastle were the team with greater vigour, and Joelinton’s finish for his goal followed a fine pass from Christian Atsu. Bruce does not enjoy comparisons with Rafa Benítez, but players such as Atsu, Miguel Almirón and Sean Longstaff might just be allowed greater freedom to express themselves under his supervision than they were within the Spaniard’s rigid tactics. Having taken the lead, plenty of last-ditch defending was required – not a long-term strategy for progress in the Premier League – but Newcastle did look organised. And beating the team Ashley grew up supporting was sweet for Bruce and his fellow Geordies. John BrewinIt takes more than a late positional switch to faze Mason Mount. The Chelsea midfielder was supposed to play behind Tammy Abraham in the 3-2 win at Norwich on Saturday but Frank Lampard had to shift him to the left when Pedro Rodríguez injured a hamstring in the warm-up. Mount’s response was to play a part in Abraham’s first goal and he later scored for the second time in two games, boosting his chances of an England call in the near future. “I think he can go to the top,” Lampard said. “He’s not a boy who wants the razzmatazz of it all, he just wants to be a top player for Chelsea and England. The confidence he has helps. I said to him five minutes before we went out that you’ll have to play on the left wing and come inside. It was no bother. He just took it on board and made all the right moves.” Jacob SteinbergFrustration was written all over Marco Silva’s face. There was frustration with the result at Aston Villa and frustration with the way their opponents defended. “We controlled all the second half, it’s not easy to play against a team with nine players around their box,” the Everton manager said a little unfairly. Deep down, Silva must have been frustrated with his players too. André Gomes was poor, Gylfi Sigurdsson a substitution waiting to happen and Richarlison peripheral – that is £100m worth of talent. The list could go on. It was not until the introduction of Alex Iwobi and Moise Kean that Everton started to attack with any conviction. Iwobi hit an upright and Kean set up a wonderful chance for Theo Walcott. While both those new signings will surely start against Wolves on Sunday, Everton need some of their other big names to come to the party. Stuart JamesEddie Howe had to act quickly on the eve of the season when David Brooks was ruled out for around three months with an ankle injury but the loan signing of Harry Wilson from Liverpool already looks to have been a masterstroke. The Welshman’s unstoppable free-kick against Manchester City after he came off the bench to replace the injured Charlie Daniels briefly raised hopes of ending Bournemouth’s awful record against the champions before Sergio Agüero settled matters on the south coast. Wilson has made a name for himself by scoring spectacular goals – no player in England’s four professional isions has managed more from outside the penalty area since the start of last season, when he was on loan at Derby – and Howe admitted he will be expecting a few more before he returns to Anfield. “I think Harry will probably want the next one,” he said. “It’s good to see – I don’t think we’ve scored that many in the past.” Ed AaronsWere it not for Florin Andone’s rush of blood, Southampton might have been joining Watford in early‑season crisis-club nil-point status. Andone looked as dumbfounded as anyone after the high-stepping hack on Yan Valery that was the most obvious of red cards. “It didn’t look like a great tackle,” Graham Potter said, embracing understatement. There were also Saintly sighs of relief when Lewis Dunk had a towering header chalked off by VAR. And Jürgen Locadia struck a post late on when Southampton were only a goal up, through Moussa Djenepo’s excellent strike. Victory did not alter the grim‑faced expression Ralf Hasenhüttl has worn through his team’s slow start, which has included defeats by Burnley and Liverpool. “It’s clear that we must do it much better,” he said. “It was too hectic.” JBAlexandre Lacazette could be forgiven for dreading August. Since his arrival in 2017, Arsenal have played four league games against big-six opponents in the opening month. Lacazette has begun all on the bench. Two years ago, he was the odd man out when Danny Welbeck, Alexis Sánchez and Mesut Özil were selected ahead of him at Anfield. Twelve months ago, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Özil were preferred against Manchester City and Chelsea. Even his status as Arsenal’s reigning player of the year did not save Lacazette oOn Saturday Aubameyang was instead joined in attack by the full debutant Nicolas Pépé. While the £72m signing showed his pace and threat to offer encouragement and Lacazette should complete a front three who could torment lesser opponents, the Frenchman may wonder why he always seems to have a point to prove to his managers when it comes to selection for the marquee matches. Richard JollyGary Cahill enjoyed the best of debuts as Crystal Palace beat Manchester United at Old Trafford in the league for the first time in 30 years. A 33-year-old who has 61 caps for England signed on a free from Chelsea may turn out to be the bargain of the summer. And though Cahill – understandably – struggled with the pace of Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford, he was integral to a proud result. “There are going to be a lot more games in this league where you have more possession,” he said. “It wasn’t going to be one of them here. We dropped into a shape and worked very hard in it. We managed the game well in difficult moments and showed great desire. We showed that determination and it would have been easy to crumble at 1-1. To hit them on the break was great. We knew it was going to be difficult coming here.” Jamie JacksonHave West Ham finally found themselves a top-level centre‑forward for the long term? You would hope so, given Sébastien Haller set them back £45m, and the signs were promising in Saturday’s helter-skelter match at Watford. Even if Haller looked rusty when failing to get a shot off in the buildup to Mark Noble’s early penalty, he was a menacing presence around the box for the rest of the afternoon and was in the right place when it mattered to score the decisive goals. The 6ft 3in Haller shares certain similarities with Andy Carroll but is five years younger and, should he stay fit, could easily prove the spearhead West Ham hoped the England striker would be. On this evidence he will have plenty of chances to finish: Manuel Pellegrini’s side in effect played with four forwards and got away with it defensively, partly because Noble provided vital midfield stability on his return to the team, exactly 15 years after his debut. Nick AmesMolineux witnessed a tired Wolves tear a point from the grip of Sean Dyche’s Burnley at the last on Sunday, but the crowd also got to watch two young English prospects strut their stuff. Morgan Gibbs-White was given a rare Premier League start for Wolves and, while he wasn’t alone in his failings, the midfielder fluffed his lines. On the Burnley side, however, the winger Dwight McNeil continued to show how important he is to the Clarets. A constant outlet who refused to lose the ball and was able to advance possession upfield without a burst of pace or having to throw a trick, the teenager looked the most composed player on the field and assisted Ashley Barnes for his goal. McNeil is not an England youth star like the Under-17 World Cup winner Gibbs-White but his future definitely looks bright.

If porting is an option, you will still need to reapply for your current deal using the details of the property you intend to move to. Your lender will assess your re-application using its current lending criteria – which may be different from the criteria it used to assess your original mortgage application as might the nature of the deal or your personal circumstances – so your lender may turn you down. If your lender won’t let you port your mortgage, it’s not the end of the world as you simply apply for a new mortgage – possibly with a new lender - which could be better than the deal you are currently on. Whether you port or get a new mortgage, when you move – and assuming you will have a mortgage of £320,000 – you will indeed get cash in the bank.

This is generally a gradual process over months or even years, but technically the menopause is defined as when a woman has gone 12 months without a period. In the UK, the average age for this happening is 52 years, but about one in 100 women have a menopause before the age of 40.The menopause is programmed into female biology. It begins when the ovaries have too few eggs to keep powering the ovulation cycle. From childhood, the ovaries have thousands of eggs (200,000, say, but the number varies widely). These cells are constantly moving along a fertility conveyor belt, taking months to grow from primitive follicle to the mature egg which is released during ovulation. The process operates in a knock-out pyramid, with most eggs dying off along the way and only about 400 ever graduating to ovulation.The primordial follicles activate in clusters that grow and compete, with one egg (normally just one) winning out each month. But as women approach the menopause, the remaining follicles become more sparsely spaced. Beyond some critical threshold, they are no longer packed densely enough to exchange the chemical signals with their neighbours that allow them to activate in clusters. So even though eggs remain, they are dormant.“It’s almost like they’re losing their friends,” says Prof Evelyn Telfer, of the University of Edinburgh. “When the woman gets older and when there’s a very low number they just don’t activate.”The follicles release oestrogen as they grow. So when they stop maturing, there is a steep drop in the levels of the hormone being produced, and that’s what leads to menopausal symptoms.Symptoms usually start a few months or years before a woman’s periods stop – a phase known as the perimenopause – and on average last about four years from the last period. However, around one in 10 women experience symptoms for up to 12 years.The first indication of the menopause is a change in the normal pattern of a woman’s periods – they may become either unusually light or heavy and could arrive with shorter breaks or be absent for months at a time.Other symptoms include vaginal dryness, changes in libido, mood swings, memory problems and higher risk of osteoporosis.It is possible, through IVF treatment using either eggs frozen pre-menopause or donor eggs. Biomedical progress might open up other options. Post-menopause, women still have hundreds of follicles left in the ovaries and scientists have demonstrated that it is possible to grow these follicles into mature eggs in the lab.A Japanese team is using a version of this technique in a clinical trial of an experimental fertility treatment called IV-activation, in which ovarian tissue is extracted, treated in the lab to encourage the follicles to mature and then grafted back into the ovary. They speculate that in the future, post-menopausal women might be able to have babies using such treatment.The age at which a woman enters menopause is partly inherited. So asking your mother or grandmother is a good place to start. Some clinics offer ultrasound tests aimed at assessing the ovarian reserve. The scans can only see the most mature egg cells – the follicles are too small to spot – and the tests are not very accurate at predicting when the menopause will begin.Scientists are identifying ever more genes that contribute to the age menopause begins, but since it is a trait that is influenced by a large number of genes, it is not yet possible to get an accurate readout from a genetic test.One of the most compelling evolutionary explanations for menopause is the “reproductive conflict hypothesis”. The idea is that when multiple generations live together in a patrilocal set up (that’s to say, a woman moving in with her husband’s parents), a woman would compete with her mother-in-law for the resources needed for babies and children if their reproductive schedules overlapped.Research by Prof Virpi Lummaa, of the University of Turku in Finland, using a 200-year dataset on pre-industrial Finns, showed that simultaneous reproduction by daughters-in-law and mothers-in-law was linked to a far worse chance of children surviving.“Our modelling work showed that such costs of two women reproducing simultaneously in the same household were sufficient to generate selection against continued reproduction beyond 51 years,” Lummaa says.It’s interesting to note that this evolutionary trade-off only happens when males continue to live with their families as adults. Lummaa’s team studied Asian elephants employed in timber camps in Myanmar and found that calves survived better if their grandmother was nearby. However, Asian elephants do not show a clear-cut menopause and have been observed to reproduce into their late 60s.A crucial difference could be that elephants live in matriarchal herds, led by a dominant older female. So, thanks, prehistoric patriarchy.There are a few contenders – guppies gasp on for a few weeks after their last litter, which some have suggested is the fish menopause. But whales are the only real parallel. Killer whales, short-finned pilot whales, belugas and narwhals all live substantial periods beyond their reproductive years.The main one is hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Hot flushes and other symptoms are caused by the loss of oestrogen in the body as the ovaries stop producing it. However, oestrogen causes the womb lining to grow, which raises the risk of endometrial cancer. To protect the lining of the uterus, combined HRT is normally given, which contains progesterone as well. It can be taken in the form of pills, patches, gels or implants.Cons: increases the chances that a woman will get breast cancer and ovarian cancer. The extent of this cancer risk has been at the heart of the controversy surrounding HRT. A large study by the Institute of Cancer Research in London found that women who took combined HRT for five years were 2.7 times more likely to get breast cancer than those who did not. Other studies have found slightly lower increases in risk. However, a major study last year found that HRT does not shorten lives – so while women on HRT were more likely to develop breast cancer they are not more likely to die at a younger age.Also, on stopping HRT some but not all women will experience a return of menopause symptoms.Some people find alternative therapies such as acupuncture, phytoestrogens or black cohosh helpful, although systematic reviews have not found strong evidence to support these approaches making a measurable difference.There are also new drugs on the horizon that work in different ways to HRT. One of the most promising is a compound called MLE4901, originally developed by AstraZeneca. It targets a chemical in the brain called neurokinin B, which is known to increase in response to oestrogen deficiency. The idea is that it would control symptoms without affecting hormone levels – and so hopefully sidestepping the downsides of HRT.Astellas, a Japanese pharmaceutical company, is now running a phase 2 trial. “It works ridiculously well,” says Waljit Dhillo, a professor in endocrinology and metabolism at Imperial, who led the trial. “The patients in our study were saying please can we carry on with the drug.”It’s clearly subjective, but many women would view no more periods and not needing to worry about unplanned pregnancies as positives. There is also evidence that women generally feel good post-menopause. One study by Australian scientists, which followed women for 20 years from the early 1990s found that negative mood scores and depressive symptoms decreased significantly as they transitioned from midlife (50–64) to late-life (over 65).Menopause: The Complete Guide to Maintaining Health and Well-being and Managing Your Life, by Miriam StoppardHot Flushes Cold Science: A History of the Modern Menopause, by Louise FoxcroftGalloping Catastrophe: Musings of a Menopausal Woman, by Jennifer Kennedy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da6337c103d30420317a9943ca7d8c38e80e9f89/464_0_4776_2867/master/4776.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d525df878f17d121f8e90492ee43c7c","title":"the best beaches in nice and cote dazur france","story":"From the palm-fringed beaches of Cannes, to the chilled vibe of Plage de la Salis, the Côte d’Azur has beaches to suit every tastePlage de la Bocca, CannesAway from Cannes’ many private beaches is the sandy stretch of Plage de la Bocca, west of the city.

Some have faced disciplinary action and many have been forced to take time off, while others have sold their homes so they can afford to work part-time or stop working altogether.The Labour MP Carolyn Harris said: “You wouldn’t dream of having a workplace where people weren’t entitled to certain things because they were pregnant, and it’s exactly the same for women with the menopause. I firmly believe there should be legislation to make sure every workplace has a menopause policy, just like they have a maternity policy.”The often unspoken impact of menopause on women at work has become a cross-party issue. The Conservative MP Rachel Maclean was the first to speak out about it in the House of Commons and has been campaigning to normalise menopause as a workplace issue.She said she wants women to be able to have time off or change shift patterns or conditions of work when they need relief from symptoms that often go well beyond the stereotypical hot flushes and night sweats.The menopause is a natural part of ageing and usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age after levels of the hormone oestrogen have declined to the point where ovulation and menstruation stop. It is defined as a woman going 12 months without a period. In the UK, the average age for a woman to reach the menopause is 52. However, about one in 100 women have their menopause before the age of 40.Common symptoms can include hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness and discomfort during sex, a reduced sex drive, low moods or anxiety and difficulty sleeping. Memory and concentration can also be affected.\u0026nbsp“I absolutely agree that employers need to do more. It’s not well understood,” Maclean said. “Employees don’t get the support they need. It is very difficult for women at work often.” She said she had heard many “horrific and heart-rending” accounts.“My central message is: menopause is the last taboo because it is still hidden and it only affects women and it only affects older women. It’s ageism, it’s sexism, all rolled into one.”Harris said she believed that if legislation was required, it would be passed by MPs. There was “tremendous support” across the benches when the house debated the issue recently, “especially from men whose wives have been through it. They understand.”Harris told of going to see a GP in 2010 after she had treatment for a gynaecological condition. “I was having a nervous breakdown,” she said. “I was really depressed and had mental health issues. I think that’s down to the fact I was going through the menopause. So many women end up on antidepressants or being told to pull themselves together.”Amanda Griffiths, a professor of occupational health psychology at the University of Nottingham who has done substantial research on the impact of the menopause on working women, said it had “quite a significant impact” on the personal and professional lives of up to a quarter of women.She said women made up an increasing proportion of the ageing workforce. “For me there is a big issue here, which is not just about women having problems with menopause. It is about managers understanding it is perfectly normal for us to have health problems,” she said.There needed to be an atmosphere at work where people could talk about health, she said, “instead of which we tend to have this fear in some organisations that if we have a health condition there will be some sort of stigma attached to i”.Two separate surveys of women going through the menopause and perimenopause – the time leading up to when ovulation stops – found they were struggling in work and felt unsupported by managers.Just over half had taken time off sick, and one in 10 had missed more than eight weeks of work.A separate survey by the shop workers’ union Usdaw found that one in five women had taken time off work and that more than half did not feel able to approach their managers if they were suffering.In the Newson Health survey, more than a third said their employer did not offer any kind of discussion group, awareness session or training on the subject of menopause, despite there being more than 5 million working women aged between 45 and 60.Dr Rebecca Lewis, a GP who works at Newson Health, said: “Women are suffering quietly for fear of saying ‘it’s the menopause’ and being laughed at and told to get on with it.“A GP might not think to put it down, or the woman might not want it put down because of a feeling that it’s not a ‘proper’ illness.”Sue Hackett, the London regional equality officer at the GMB union, said: “It is high time we stop treating menstruation and menopause as taboo subjects. Women have put up with insulting comments and a woeful lack of provision for far too long for what is a completely natural condition.”She said workplace policies around sickness absence or performance management could unfairly penalise women “because of key symptoms like memory loss or lack of concentration”.Unions said there were examples of good practice in workplaces. In 2017, Nottinghamshire police introduced a menopause policy and issued guidance to managers saying they could consider requests from women who needed to adjust their uniform or their working hours.Among other practical support, it recommended access to private areas where women could “rest temporarily, cry or talk with a colleague before they can return to their workspace”.The Welsh government has put in place guidance for its workers. It said: “All reasonable adjustments will be considered when a health issue may be impacting on a person’s ability to carry out their role – this can include changing working location or conditions for a more comfortable working life.”Last year an employment tribunal judge found in favour of Mandy Davies, a court officer working for the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service who was dismissed after an incident involving medication she was taking.Davies alleged that under the 2010 Equality Act she had been unfairly dismissed and discriminated against as a result of a disability.The tribunal heard how she had been suffering from symptoms including heavy bleeding, memory loss and confusion, and that she had previously had a 20-year unblemished employment record.Her employer accepted that the menopause was a disability, but argued it had not unfairly dismissed her as a consequence, a position the judge did not accept, ruling that she should be reinstated and paid £14,000.The court service is appealing against the decision."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19df985060b01b2aa77af69e64d0686de3432ab/0_52_5166_3100/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4c61a12dddafe4eb697a446fdf0307b","title":"helping nine year old eating disorder recovery podcast","story":"We hear about the importance of early intervention in rare cases of pre-teen eating disorders.

So, too, the World Cup final in July, as Ian Botham’s incredible exploits of 38 years ago have been matched, maybe surpassed. But on a day like this who cares about rankings anyway? Ben Stokes produced the innings of a lifetime to snatch a one-wicket victory, which keeps the Ashes alive and the game alive, while threatening to cause multiple heart failures among those lucky enough to witness this contest.A few figures: England, bowled out for 67 in the first innings, achieved their highest-ever winning total by scoring 362 for nine at this unlikely theatre of dreams on the other side of the Pennines from Old Trafford. The last-wicket partnership – somehow unbroken – between Jack Leach and Stokes was worth 76. Stokes finished, most definitely unbeaten, on 135, which included eight sixes he had 61 when Leach made his way to the crease.But beyond the figures was astounding melodrama and we have to start near the end. It defied belief that England had reached 351 for nine when Australia’s captain, Tim Paine – who, like his counterpart Kim Hughes all those years ago, had every reason to believe this match had already been decided – tossed the ball to Nathan Lyon. Stokes was on strike with eight runs needed for victory. He cut the first two deliveries to distant fielders and declined to run, following the pattern of an already a stunning partnership.The third ball from Lyon was fuller and Stokes swung. He did not quite time it perfectly but he does not have to. At long-off Marnus Labuschagne circled at the bowler’s end Lyon squinted towards the boundary, urging the ball to stay in play. By a metre or so it cleared the rope. For the first time in the match England were rock- solid favourites to win. One run would be sufficient for a tie, two for victory.Now the field came in. This must have felt claustrophobic for Stokes. For the previous hour the vast majority of the fielders had been stationed on the boundary when he was on strike. The next ball was cut by Stokes straight to one of the fielders now close enough to save the single. No matter there were two deliveries left and after his recent pyrotechnics surely Stokes would now deliver the final blow.Lyon fired in the next delivery and Stokes cut again. Leach started scrambling a run Stokes sent him back but it was clear as the throw from Pat Cummins headed towards Lyon that England’s valiant No 11 would be stranded. Home hearts sank until Lyon fumbled the ball, and the images of Australia’s 1999 World Cup semi-final against South Africa flashed past.One ball remained and Stokes decided to explore the legside this time. He slog-swept but missed. Lyon’s appeal was prolonged, suggesting an odd mix of desperation and confidence. Umpire Joel Wilson’s finger failed to appear but the realisation that the Australians were unable to ask for a review did come to light. They had wasted their last review against Leach in the previous over from Cummins (incidentally the solitary area in which England have been consistently superior in this series is in their use of DRS). The subsequent replay demonstrated that Stokes would have been out if it had been possible to review the decision.After that it was relatively plain sailing. Unusually, Leach was left on strike as Cummins ran in at the start of the next over. He ducked the first ball, defended the second and the third saw the ball trickle from his bat on the legside. Leach’s first run in the partnership had levelled the scores. In came Cummins again Stokes crashed the ball to the cover boundary and the most amazing Test match of all was over.There were one or two dramas before those final 10 deliveries. Even the first four overs of the day, which were all maidens, somehow added to the tension. The first single by Root was cheered to the skies and then England’s captain departed, superbly caught by David Warner off the inside edge and pad off the bowling of Lyon as he advanced down the pitch.Paine took the new ball as soon as it became available. It seemed the obvious thing to do yet it led to a sudden acceleration in the run rate. Jonny Bairstow was in skittish mood and two consecutive drives off Josh Hazlewood reached the offside boundary. Gradually, after hours of abstinence, Stokes began to find the odd boundary. The 50 partnership was posted inside 10 overs and as if in celebration Stokes lifted a legside delivery from Cummins into the stands.At lunch England, on 238 for four, might have been favourites, though this realisation did not seem to do them much good. They proceeded to lose five wickets for 48 runs after the interval with only Stokes looking in control – except on a few occasions when he was contemplating what constituted a run.Bairstow was caught in the slips for a very handy 36 then Jos Buttler was probably a victim of poor calling from Stokes. He was sent back too late as Travis Head hit the stumps, so there could be no reprieve of their World Cup final partnership. Chris Woakes, mindful that a bouncer barrage was on its way, was lodged on the back foot when driving at a rare full ball and caught at mid-off. Jofra Archer swished three boundaries but was then well caught in the deep by Head and Stuart Broad was palpably lbw to his second delivery. 283 for nine. Ah well. It had been a good game.Now Leach, with his unassuming West Country gait, walked out to join Stokes with 73 runs needed for victory. Perhaps one or two despondent punters opted to beat the traffic at this point. Now Stokes switched from Denly mode to d’Artagnan. The fielders were spread far and wide but still he hit Lyon for two consecutive sixes, the second of which was the most preposterous switch-hit into the Western Terrace.He flicked a short ball from Cummins over his left shoulder for another brilliantly improvised six. Upon reaching his 100, the best of his career (he will have to live with that knowledge now – and it was far better than his 258 in Cape Town), he did not celebrate. That was not his goal.Next Stokes took 17 runs from a Hazlewood over, pull shots, drives and legside flicks, which magically just managed to keep finding or clearing the boundary. A half-chance flew to Marcus Harris at third man but he could not quite cling on as he ed forward. This was beyond Roy of the Rovers.Meanwhile, Leach ostensibly remained calm, despite the fact that his glasses kept steaming up. Hardly surprising.Amid the jubilation Leach could ponder that he had now won two matches for England with the bat in the surreal summer of 2019: 92 against Ireland, one not out against Australia. With due respect to Tim Murtagh and co, we all know which innings he will cherish the most."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebd834ee7815d19a9c15887c3a6d8e9656410f8c/0_110_3296_1977/master/3296.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05436e9097ff527ecf7494e2c4aba313","title":"rory mcilroy tour championship fedex cup","story":"East Lake on Sunday afternoon was witness to something even more notable than delivery of the richest prize in golf. Rory McIlroy’s bounce, Rory McIlroy’s swagger, is back. And with good reason a season featuring recurring success has now seen the Northern Irishman claim the FedEx Cup. McIlroy will insist the value of that win, $15m, is not crucial to him - and at his level it is not - but to the watching world the cheque added ribbons to this triumph. McIlroy joins Tiger Woods as the only multiple winners of the FedEx Cup.“I’m very proud of myself. I’m going to enjoy this one tonight,” said McIlroy while simultaneously delivering a smile which hinted at epic celebration. There will be for McIlroy’s best friend and caddie, Harry Diamond, too, a commonly underestimated influence in this team who now finds himself £1.5m richer. Sometimes the good guys win.The handicapped start afforded to players in the season-ending Tour Championship had caused elements of screaming from afar. McIlroy delivered the last laugh his overall score would have been sufficient to win even if the 30-man field had started level. McIlroy’s closing round of 66 meant a four-stroke success over Xander Schauffele, with the champion’s 18-under-par aggregate requiring the context of a 10-under-par position before a ball was struck. McIlroy’s third round of 68, completed on Sunday morning after the lightning chaos which brought disruption a day earlier, was his highest tally of the week. If missing the cut at the Open Championship hurt McIlroy - and all the evidence suggested it did - he has responded in emphatic fashion. The one downside, if one can be derived from such a lucrative scene, is that the Masters is still more than seven months away.There were various strands of significance attached to McIlroy’s 17th PGA Tour win. The biggest was perhaps that he swatted aside Brooks Koepka, the world No 1 and his final-round playing partner. When the duo entered Sunday battle in Memphis at a World Golf Championship last month, Koepka prevailed pretty comfortably. This time McIlroy outscored Koepka by half a dozen round-four strokes. The 30-year-old did not appear remotely threatened. McIlroy also pointedly referenced 11 months ago at this venue, when he was afforded an unwanted front-row seat for Woods’s first success in five years.“I didn’t enjoy that walk last year like everyone else did,” McIlroy said. “I played terribly. I got myself into the final group and never took the fight to Tiger. Going up against the No 1 player in the world today, he got one over on me in Memphis and I wanted to try to sort of get some revenge. The final round in Memphis hurt a little bit. I didn’t take it to Brooks at all.“To play like that alongside Brooks and get the win, win the FedExCup, yeah, it’s awesome. It’s amazing how different things can be in a year.”Koepka and McIlroy had been embroiled in a tense battle until the 7th, when the former lost a ball from a wayward drive. A first double-bogey in 142 holes, a remarkable statistic, followed. As McIlroy birdied and bravely saved par at the 8th, Koepka needed snookers. The opposite transpired Koepka dropped shots on three holes in a row from the 12th with Schauffele now McIlroy’s biggest danger. Schauffele got within two as McIlroy had three to play but birdies for the winner on the 17th and 18th added gloss to a dominant performance.At thirteen under, Koepka shared third with Justin Thomas. Paul Casey’s 72 left him fifth, with that over-par closing round not impacting on the Englishman’s willingness to wait to congratulate the champion, which was to his credit. Koepka displayed similar sportsmanship. “Rory played great golf, pretty much mistake free,” Koepka said. “It was impressive to watch. Hats off to him.” Next for Koepka, a five-week holiday. “I’m going to enjoy myself.”Much earlier the PGA Tour had confirmed all iniduals hurt after the lightning strike at the course on Saturday had been released from hospital. “We are deeply grateful that the injuries were not more serious,” said the Tour. A happy ending there and another, rich one, for McIlroy. Money does not have to be a key motivator for such huge purses to resonate.. But that distinctive bounce, which set McIlroy apart from all others even in his youth, lingered more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3777c94f1bd05bce52c96e3242ce413ca5378705/0_169_2762_1657/master/2762.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=576b438e081c2251c7d9fc2c9d638d43","title":"us open coco gauff","story":"A few weeks after Coco Gauff’s scene‑stealing run to the fourth round of Wimbledon, the 15-year‑old made her next move. Gauff was announced as a participant in the Citi Open in Washington DC but the announcement came with a caveat – her ranking was too low and the WTA’s age eligibility rules meant she was unable to receive another wildcard, so her participation in the competition was in doubt. She would head to the capital to host fan activities and to showcase her best at practice sessions. The hope was that enough players would withdraw at the last minute to offer her a spot in the qualifying draw.Gauff’s prayers were answered and she refused to waste the opportunity. She entered the singles qualifying draw at the 11th hour, where she qualified for the main draw and then won her first WTA event in doubles alongside the 17-year-old Caty McNally. Gauff’s presence brought a record crowd to the tournament’s qualifying rounds and her doubles matches overflowed with frantic spectators as the singles matches on the main courts were empty. In a sport that does not survive without the stars that generate ticket sales and attention, a new one had been born.Throughout the US summer, tournaments have moved heaven and earth to accommodate Gauff. They see her drawing power and they want to ensure that they can make money from her success. Since Gauff’s ranking and tournament limitations made her participation in later WTA events unlikely, she was drafted into the ATP tournament in Winston Salem last week for an exhibition match against the French Open champion, Ashleigh Barty. Although she had reached her wildcard limit under the WTA’s age eligibility rules, the US Open skirted the regulations, which technically apply only to WTA and ITF events, to offer her a wildcard. The decision has produced some backlash.“No, I don’t get that,” said Naomi Osaka to the suggestion that Gauff’s wildcard could yield negative results. “Like, come on. This is such a good experience for her. She obviously deserves to play here. She played well in Wimbledon, she’s super young and, for me, it’s the same as if someone plays the US Open juniors just to gain experience for how the main tournament is. Except she can actually play the main tournament. I don’t see how it would harm her at all.”But the history of women’s tennis is riddled with young supernovas whose success would eventually cause them harm. Jennifer Capriati arrived in the sport as a bubbly all‑American 13-year-old yet her career burnout remains a cautionary tale, the primary reason why so many restrictions remain in place for Gauff. Anna Kournikova flitted to the Wimbledon semi-finals at 16 and then flitted out shortly afterwards with a chronic back injury.Today, the increased physicality of tennis has piled on more pressure for a young, growing body. Belinda Bencic reached the US Open quarter‑finals in 2014 at 17 years of age, then defeated Serena Williams in a blaze of fireworks to win her first big title in Toronto the following year. It took until this year for Bencic to shake off incessant injuries and recover her collapsed ranking.The rising prize money means players are now richer in the early stages of their careers. Alexander Zverev, billed as the next great star a year ago, has spent much of 2019 coming to terms with the reality of being a business that many people want a part of. He is now embroiled in an expensive and bitter legal dispute with his former manager, with whom he signed as a youth. Osaka reflected on her own struggles since reaching the top ranking. “You know the song Mo Money Mo Problems?” she said, smiling. “Man, oh, man.”Gauff exudes confidence. At Wimbledon she asserted that she was there to win the tournament and nobody doubted that she meant it. Her broad shoulders are made for the pressure and weight she now carries on them each day. When she faces Anastasia Potapova, her fellow teen and another junior slam champion, on Tuesday, it is hard to imagine that she will not be ready. The question is whether Gauff will be ready for the rest of her career."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0780d8d72605aff6737f5bc210214d4cb140e7f/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=802c03fb5a6a87a89c34f465dff26fb8","title":"what the papers say about englands ashes comeback australia","story":"Ben Stokes dominates the front pages as writers rate his innings as the greatest ever played by an EnglishmanThere might have been a crucial meeting of world leaders, Brexit and a kerfuffle about the BBC licence fee to fret about. But Ben Stokes’s batting heroics have given Britain’s newspapers the perfect bank holiday Monday front page.Every front page published south of the border is emblazoned with a picture of England’s brilliant allrounder celebrating after hitting the winning runs at Headingley in a match that evoked the legendary exploits of Ian Botham and Bob Willis at the same ground 38 years ago.The Times and the  both decided it was such a momentous occasion that it was worth doing away with the usual front page conventions and promotions.Both lay the masthead and headline on top of the picture with the Times declaring “Stokes leads England to epic Ashes comeback” and the  sufficing with “Howzat!”.

There is more historic reference points in the  which has a similar moment-of-triumph picture above a headline that reads: “Heroic Stokes inspires thrilling Test win”. In the sports section, a team of writers all rhapsodise about an innings that Andy Bull describes “the best anyone has played for England since Ian Botham overturned odds of 500-1 when he made his unbeaten 149 at this very same ground back in 1981”.Some sober judges reckoned it was even better, he writes, as history begins to be written about a stunning day of Test cricket.The Sun splashes on the cricket with the headline “Go urn, my son” a fitting pun on the fact that Stokes has single-handedly kept the Ashes battle alive.The Independent marks the win with a picture showing Stokes with his arms raised in triumph in a shot that also shows the despair on the face of Australian bowler Pat Cummins. Their lead underneath the picture is “PM: BBC must give free licences to over-75s”.The licence fee story is also the lead in the Mirror, which has campaigned hard on the issue. Its headline reads “I won’t pay for free TV”. The front includes a smaller picture of Stokes, a columnist on the paper, with a headline that none of its rivals were able to match: “Mirror man Ben saves Ashes”.The combination of England’s outrageous defeat of Australia and the bank holiday heatwave was too much for the editors of the Daily Mail and the Daily Star to resist.“Land of heat and glory,” says the Mail’s splash headline under the obligatory Stokes celebration picture, while the Star reckons that its “Hottest bank hols as Ashes catch fire”.The FT stays cool in the heat of the Ashes battle and notes merely that “Stokes secures England win”.The dramatic climax to the match came too late for most Australian newspapers but Rupert Murdoch’s broadsheet, The Australian, stayed up late to get the story on to the front of its final edition. Stokes is pictured flogging another ball to the boundary under a headline guaranteed to send shivers down the spine of every true blue Aussie: “Stokes revives the ghost of Botham”.Its esteemed cricket writer, Gideon Haigh, says that with the long format of the game under pressure from shorter editions, the match was a referendum on Test cricket that had no loser.Back in the northern hemisphere, Stokes is conspicuous by his absence on front pages in Scotland where the Daily Record leads with a story about a teenage serial sex offender and the Scotsman goes with “Johnson tells Trump: ‘Trade war risks global recession’”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b186c38da51b8c4d96ca8030a8830e529b31e8a/0_31_3636_2182/master/3636.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fc048cc7b327d606e3c7462c38028c7","title":"ben stokes england best since botham ashes andy bull","story":"Oh hell, just call it all off now. Forget the Premier League, cancel the Rugby World Cup, bin the world athletics championship and whatever else we’re supposed to get excited about in the coming weeks and months. And for goodness sake, junk the Hundred too. They’ll all pale after this Headingley Test, when Ben Stokes, that most unlikely saint, worked the second of the two miracles he needs for his canonisation. This was the innings of his lifetime, and everyone else’s too, certainly the best anyone has played for England since Ian Botham overturned odds of 500-1 when he made his unbeaten 149 at this very same ground back in 1981, and, sober judges reckoned, perhaps even better than that.“The most extraordinary innings ever played by an Englishman‚” was all Alastair Cook had to say after Stokes had smacked that last four away. Never mind everyone else, even Stokes found the finish too excruciating to watch.He couldn’t even bring himself to look at most of the final hour of it, when his partner, England’s No 11 batsman Jack Leach, faced up to Australia’s bowlers from behind his foggy spectacles. He kept having to stop play so he could mop them off. Whenever Leach had the strike, Stokes squatted on his haunches and stared at the ground, too scared to look up. Until he decided to steal the single that drew the scores level, he hadn’t even been bothering to stand up when the bowlers ran in. He needn’t have worried so much. Leach saw them all off. “Jack,” Stokes said afterwards, “has got some serious bollocks.”To unravel it all you have to go way back to the very first afternoon of the match, when Stokes bowled poorly, nine overs for 45, and then stop off on the second morning too, when he was caught at first slip playing one of the worst shots he has ever attempted.Something in him snapped when that happened. After the tea break later that same day, Stokes started bowling from the Football Stand End and refused to stop until the Australians were finished off. He flogged himself through 25 overs in a row, breaking only when Jofra Archer replaced him for four balls. Then Archer broke down with cramp, and Stokes came right back into the attack.Stokes bowled on all the next morning, too. It was almost as if he was punishing himself. By the end of the innings he had bowled Travis Head, and bounced out Matthew Wade and Pat Cummins. And even after all that England still needed 359 runs, more than they had ever made to win a Test, more, in fact, than anyone ever has in this country except for the Australians here at Headingley back in 1948. And they had Don Bradman.Stokes came in late on Saturday evening, when England were 141 for three, Joe Root 64 not out at the other end. He played stone sober that night, and barely attempted a scoring shot. There was a clip off his hips for one single, an inside-edge past short leg for another, and that was it. He had made two runs from 50 balls when they drew stumps, had two off 66 when Root was caught behind off Nathan Lyon right before Australia took the new ball on Sunday morning. He was going so slowly then that even Geoff Boycott began to worry that he was being too obdurate. It took him 74 balls to hit his first boundary. No Englishman has taken longer to make it to double figures in more than 25 years.Then Jonny Bairstow blew in, like the wind picking up before a storm. He started belting that new ball all over, and in a crucial spell before lunch, the two of them put on 60-odd runs in just ten overs or so. And all of a sudden the score was travelling so fast that impossible distance between England and victory started to shrink, below 200, 180, 160, 140, 120, until just as it was coming into sight on the horizon, Bairstow was caught at slip. Then Head ran out Jos Buttler, and Chris Woakes thrashed a catch to short extra cover, and England had three wickets left and needed the best part of another 100 runs.Same old England. Everyone who has ever watched them play knew which way the game was going. Not that they’d given up on the Western Terrace, where, after five hours of rounds, they were chanting‚“stand up, if you love Ben Stokes,” and “shoes off, if you love Ben Stokes”, in defiance, rather than celebration, hope rather than expectation. Of course it’s the hope that gets you in the end. By the time Leach arrived, everyone else had given up, England still needed another 73 runs. What happened next made no damn sense. Not by my logic, yours, or anyone else’s but his. The game isn’t supposed to work this way, outside of the daydreams we have when we’re kids first falling in love with it.The first two sixes felt like a last retort to the Australians it was the third, a switch hit over cover, that seemed to cast the spell, and the fourth, scooped over his own head to fine leg, that suggested some powerful magic had taken hold, and the bumbling umpires and fumbling fielders were all caught up in it. So even when he was out, lbw when England needed two more runs, he somehow got away with it. Stokes did not even stop to acknowledge the hundred he made when he cracked four through long-on, but pressed on, sixes were hit deep into the Western Terrace, fours belted so hard they were puncturing gaps in the nine-man cordon Tim Paine had set on the boundary’s edge. Another six, away down the ground, and, at the end of it all, that last match-winning four.At 67 all out England were finished, and the Ashes gone. They had reached the very bottom of the pit. Down there in the black, where people lose their careers, Stokes looked around and found, deep within himself, the resolve to lead his team right back up and out again. So, yes, throw out your whites, burn your bats, scrap your Wisdens. I’m off to smash my laptop. It’ll never be better than it was this sunny Sunday afternoon in Headingley."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4020cbc19bbdaca7a5f7d6667383573120027d3/0_34_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21b7ce87b7e963b0bad54955c49bc126","title":"epsom win aim for jamie codd the coddfather horse racing tips","story":"Irish rider and Yorkshire trainer John Quinn team up to seek another victory in the Epsom Amateurs’ DerbyJamie Codd and the Yorkshire trainer John Quinn are a formidable force when they team up – either over jumps or on the Flat. One of the highlights of this Bank Holiday Monday’s racing will be watching them try to win the Amateurs’ Derby at Epsom.It was in 2009 that Codd rode his first Cheltenham Festival winner, the Quinn-trained 16-1 shot Character Building in the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Chase. That day the jockey displayed the ice-cool waiting tactics he has become famed for.Eight more winners at the Cheltenham Festival have followed for the Wexford man since then, for other stables. His reputation as a stealthy assassin in the saddle – perhaps cemented when bringing Cause Of Causes from last to first in the 2016 Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir – earned him the nickname The Coddfather.Then, on August Bank Holiday Monday in 2016, the CoddQuinn partnership struck at a very different venue. They won the Epsom “Derby” for amateur riders with the well-backed 3-1 favourite Hubertas, who had arrived at Epsom with excellent recent form.Codd rides Mistiroc (3.40 Epsom) this time and circumstances are a little different. The attraction of travelling from Ireland to Surrey for one ride – on a horse without a win for a full three years – is not immediately apparent. And the one and only time Mistiroc has run at Epsom previously was 12 months ago – when a well-beaten last of five. That was over 10 furlongs on soft going, however. This time it will be over 12 furlongs on fast ground.On Sunday John Quinn told the  of eight-year-old Mistiroc: “He hasn’t regained his best form yet this year but we are happy with him and we’re hoping he has a good chance.”Codd said: “Yes, it’s one ride. But it is Epsom, where all those famous Derbys have been. You’re riding on the same track as all those brilliant jockeys. It’s only rare you get the opportunity, so you have to take it. John always gives me a call and we go back a long way.”Yet another motivation for Codd to gain a second win in this race is that his great amateur rival in Ireland, Patrick Mullins, has already won this Epsom contest twice – in 2013 and 2015. There will be more at stake than the race’s £7,487 first prize.After finishing a close-up second on debut at Salisbury in July Stoweman (3.45 Chepstow) was made a short-priced favourite for his second run, back at the same track a fortnight ago. Again Stoweman finished the runner-up – but the winner that day, Impressor, has some interesting future entries so the form could be very decent.Over the jumps Connor Farrell has a fine strike rate in the last couple of weeks for the Dianne Sayer stable. Farrell faces strong opposition when riding Tonto’s Spirit (3.15 Cartmel) but the partnership looks worth taking a chance with."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3771a3091160229b5d7b261db0a8cb889e5c5f6f/0_933_2848_1708/master/2848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ae882cd0767b0b91407e1099d09608d","title":"edinburgh rightwing comedians titania mcgrath brexit party edinburgh fringe","story":"This year’s Edinburgh fringe was full of wokeness jokes from liberal standups as well as a host of conservative comedians who punch downHas there been a rise in rightwing comedy? Or just more acts pinning their colours to that mast? A common claim – flogged to death by the conservative commentariat – is that comedy is dominated by a “liberal elite”. That was always a tenuous premise: beyond the late Jeremy Hardy, the Marks Steel and Thomas, and mid-career Josie Long, where are all these socialist clowns we keep hearing about? But it’s looking even more ragged now. Since journeyman standup Geoff Norcott had the bright idea of relaunching himself as a Tory and became a fixture on Question Time, other acts have followed suit. Anti-woke is the fringe pose du jour, not infrequently struck by comics out and proud about their rightwing affiliations.They draw their charge – such as it is – from the conceit that they’re fearlessly flouting tyrannical orthodoxy. But the idea that it’s Transgressive – the title of Scottish comic Leo Kearse’s show – to PC-bash in public is a bit of a stretch. Ricky Gervais, Dave Chappelle, Jimmy Carr: comedy arenas are full of this stuff. You can’t open the papers or turn on TV without hearing anti-woke and pro-Brexit sentiment. If – as these comics insist – free speech is under attack, it’s a pretty feeble attack. Although it did succeed in having Kearse’s previous show, Right-Wing Comedian, cancelled in Australia last year after protests about its alleged transphobia.Perhaps that’s why “we’re afraid of saying the wrong thing these days”, as Konstantin Kisin puts it. Kisin made the headlines last year by refusing to perform at a London university after being asked to sign a “behavioural agreement” relating to the content of his act. (He doesn’t mention that the organiser swiftly apologised.) He raises some legitimate questions in a show exploring why 3,300 people were arrested in the UK last year for things they said on social media.He also contradicts himself. We mustn’t call people we disagree with Nazis, he says – then ends with a George Carlin quote equating political correctness with fascism. The politics of Dominic Frisby’s show Libertarian Love Songs (Frisby is standing as a prexit Party candidate for parliament) are likewise all over the place. Ukulele in hand, he sings that “all taxation is theft”, then criticises Amazon for not paying its taxes. He criticises the ubiquitous blandness of modern Britain, then croons a hymn to Wetherspoons.But the show has its charms. Frisby emerges more as contrarian English eccentric than reactionary. His rant about “crony capitalism”, and the sweet ending to his song about hate speech, both suggest common ground between Frisby’s anti-corporate shtick and the politics of the bolshiest social justice warrior of rightwing demonology.Time was, of course, progressive fringe audiences might have rejected even a whiff of Toryism in their comedy. Only five years ago, Jim Davidson felt like an outlier here – although he played in a major venue and was widely reviewed. But we’re all more mindful of ersity and inclusion these days – and rightist comics are cashing in on the affirmative action. Kisin, Kearse and Frisby’s shows were well attended on my visits, and fair enough: they can be entertaining, and put forward the occasional intelligent point of view. Not so Titania McGrath, the fictional Twitter avatar of comedian Andrew Doyle – now incarnated at the fringe by comic Alice Marshall. Fitfully amusing online, McGrath is a crude caricature on stage, a mean-spirited and largely witless burlesque of millennial wokeness.The show’s presiding idea is that the left is building a gulag out of PC terminology and ever-changing gender pronouns. Spoiler alert: that isn’t true. But there are pertinent conversations to have – and jokes to make – about where we draw the lines around offensive and illegal, between acceptable jokes and hateful acts. Kisin wonders how the defence of free speech became “a far-right dog whistle”, and it’s a good question. It’s traditionally a progressive cause, and some of the best comedy in Edinburgh on wokeness and new sensitivities around language are from leftwing comics – like Ahir Shah, say, with his routine on the phrase “people of colour” (“as if I’m indistinguishable from a black woman”).If there’s debate around whether woke-bashing is an exclusively rightwing pursuit, there’s none around the Tory credentials of Sarah Southern’s show on the Free Fringe. Southern was the Conservative aide who resigned in 2012 after the so-called “cash for access” scandal. Now she’s doing standup about her love of Mrs Thatcher, her time in David Cameron’s employ and her fall from grace. The promised interrogation of where she now stands politically never quite materialises, beyond a lame disavowal of the actual record of the government she helped precipitate. (“Some of their policies don’t sit well with me”)But if hers is a low-wattage show, it’s not objectionable. Nor does it – or any of the shows mentioned – herald a new rightward direction for standup. There may be those who consider rightwing comedy oxymoronic because comedy mustn’t punch down, and punching down is what rightwingery is all about. But there have always been comics who do that, or who trade in chauvinist stereotypes, or promote inidualist values. (As Leo Kearse points out: standup is the ne plus ultra Thatcherite industry.) Kearse, Frisby and co are just the latest in their line. All that’s changed – after Norcott banished the stigma, and advertised the career benefits, of calling oneself rightwing – is the branding."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88b414ec4f9e1872d28531be3f9cda041aeea3db/0_1212_6482_3888/master/6482.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af1d4fbd1f312d98a4d9ffd76288368b","title":"max and ivan commitment review pleasance dome edinburgh festival 2019","story":"Pleasance Dome, EdinburghThe comedy duo – who don’t do things by half – send themselves up as they attempt to reassemble their teenage band for one longed-for final gig‘I don’t do things by half,” says Max Olesker. Anyone who’s seen Max and Ivan’s legendary sportscomedy spectacular, The Wrestling, can confirm this. But the duo’s new show recounts Olesker’s biggest challenge yet in events organising: his sidekick’s stag do. Ivan Gonzalez got married this year, and best man Olesker knew exactly how to launch his friend into marital life – by reassembling the groom’s teenage band for one longed-for final gig.Did he succeed? I won’t give anything away, save that Commitment is a doozy of a comedy show, big of heart, packed with laughter and sure to send you home wreathed in smiles. It follows the template of their previous shows, in that the twosome spin the story across an hour, acting out every role. Gonzalez gets the easiest job, playing himself: a nerd who thinks he’s groovy, dreaming of rock stardom but doomed never to progress beyond grainy home video and the listings pages of the Wirral Globe.Olesker plays Gonzalez’s bandmates (cue thick scouse accent) as the show traces the rise and fall of Voodoo 7:2, up to and including Olesker’s failure to reunite them for Gonzalez’s 30th birthday a few years ago. For that, he received a record low score according to his own party-planning algorithm – a formula elucidated here on an upstage screen. So too Gonzalez’s contrived new lexicon Ivanglish, the prank emails with which Olesker secured an upmarket venue for the stag, and some problematic doodles drawn by the infant Max.The show pinballs between these visual gags, their childhood backstories (both Olesker and Gonzalez’s infant selves get ruthlessly mocked) and the bachelor party buildup. Under Kieran Hodgson’s direction, the gags cascade fast and the pair send themselves up so enthusiastically, you barely realise how much you’ve started to care – about the duo’s friendship, the ambitions we nursed as kids and what value they retain. A terrific closing joke mistaking Olesker’s fantasy career threatens to derail – but only delays – this lovely show’s triumphal finale.

While she prepares breakfast, and her husband Daniel plays with their daughters Brooke and Harper, her son Chase is engrossed in sending an email to his beloved stepgrandfather, “Pops”, his face a study in intense concentration.Nine-year-old Chase, who has the neurological condition cerebral palsy, cannot walk, talk, feed himself or pick up a pen. Yet, thanks to technology that’s widely available, he can communicate, learn and explore the online world from his family’s home in Northfleet, Kent.On his computer, “Chase uses the on-screen keyboard (OSK) tool, because he doesn’t have the fine motor skills to type on a keyboard,” says Nikki. Running on Windows 10, “it displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. Using a joystick that he can control with just his thumb, once he switches on the OSK, he can do everything from browse the internet to search for videos on YouTube and write emails. We introduced him to it when he was six and it really has been life-changing for him.“Because he can’t speak or type messages on a phone, being able to write emails to his friends and close family is so important to him – it helps him feel connected.“The keyboard also has a text prediction function, which suggests words for him as he types. It makes it quicker for him, and, because he has learning difficulties too, it helps him with his spelling.“When I see him on his computer, and how its technology empowers him, it fills me with confidence that as he grows up he’ll be able to lead a fulfilling, independent life. That is all I’ve ever wanted for him.”Nikki’s hopes for her son are mirrored by Microsoft’s mission to empower every person through building inclusivity into technology, such as the Windows 10 operating system, which supports the OSK and its Office 365 suite.After a normal, healthy pregnancy, Nikki says she was devastated when Chase was born with brain damage, having been deprived of oxygen during her labour.“The hardest part was the uncertainty. No one knew how severe his level of disability would be, and for the first few years of his life it felt like I was living in limbo watching and waiting to see what milestones he would reach, or not,” says Nikki.“He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was nine months old, but it wasn’t until he was around three that the full extent of his disability was clear. He’s never spoken, he can’t stand unaided, and he suffers from almost constant involuntary movements of his limbs. His reading ability is closer to that of a five-year-old. He’s also incredibly loving, with a wonderful sense of humour and a very determined personality.”While Chase uses an electric wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care, Nikki says technology gives him the independence he craves.“He’s well aware his siblings and other children don’t need the same help he does. But when he’s on his computer, he feels like any other nine-year-old, because he’s in control and he doesn’t need any assistance,” says Nikki. “That means so much to him and it’s vital for his self-confidence.“I see how he puffs up with pride when he shows his little sisters, who are five and three, something he’s discovered online – his current obsession is looking at locations around the world on Google Maps. It gives him the chance to be the big brother and take the lead.”A keen gamer too, Chase uses his Microsoft adaptive controller to access his Xbox console.“We all game together as a family. It can be stressful going out because of the challenges Chase can face with poor disability access and toilet facilities. Sometimes it’s just nice to stay at home and have a relaxed afternoon gaming and cuddling up on the sofa.”Summing up how much the technology means to her son, Nikki says: “It’s no exaggeration to say Chase’s computer is his window to the world. I can’t imagine his life without it and I’m thankful he was born at a time when technology like this exists.“It’s so important to him and, thanks to its emphasis on inclusivity, it’s the one part of his life in which he can be completely independent.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Update your drinking habits with tips from the experts on enjoying rum’s craft revivalWhile gin has had a dramatic rise in popularity over the past five years, bartenders have been quietly getting excited about rum. It offers huge cocktail variety, depending on the style from the unaged white variety to those aged in the tropics, it’s as complex and nuanced as any other spirit. I spoke to some top mixologists about their favourite cocktails.Jack Wallis and Chris Tanner at the VaultRum cocktails range from the super-simple to concoctions worthy of Michelin stars. Jack Wallis, operations manager at the Vault in Soho, is proud of the simplicity of their Captain’s Blood – a twist on a daiquiri, made with rum, fresh lime, sugar syrup and bitters that’s perfect to serve at home. For something a little more complex, Chris Tanner, also of the Vault, makes a version of Planter’s Punch with orange, pineapple, lime juice, grenadine, sugar syrup and Lugger Rum. Unlike some varieties, Lugger Rum is not dominated by vanilla, aiming instead to deliver a full profile of spices, including nutmeg, orange peel and cloves.Liam Cotter of Heads, Hearts and TailsBarman Liam Cotter, of events and consultancy firm Heads, Hearts and Tails, warns not to take shortcuts in rum-based cocktails: “Inexperienced bartenders may swap out a quality rum with an inferior one and wonder why their grog isn’t quite the same.” Cotter’s all-time favourite cocktail is a Jungle Bird not the original 1970s version, created in the Kuala Lumpur Hilton, but the reimagined New York classic, created by way of Giuseppe Gonzales (formerly of New York’s Suffolk Arms and long-standing patron of Milk \u0026amp Honey). He reworked it to become infinitely more balanced and appealing to a refined contemporary palate. It’s part all-night-fun negroni, part complex bitter daiquiri. He thinks this would be great with Lugger Rum.He also has a soft spot for something more straightforward: “There is something lovely about a simple rum and coke.”Mia Johansson at SwiftLondon bar Swift is known for its elegant and inventive cocktails, and one of managing partner Mia Johansson’s favourites is a Praline Flip. First, they make their own hazelnut orgeat – by heating the nuts in water, cooling and re-blending them – then combine with Angostura bitters, egg, Guinness and spiced rum. Their second cocktail is a little less complicated, but still one I wouldn’t try at home. It’s an espresso martini using Mr Black cold-brew coffee liqueur, coffee, vodka, rich demerara sugar and spiced rum.Thom Solberg at Black RockBlack Rock’s bar manager Thom Solberg loves a Mai Tai. Although this award-winning Shoreditch bar primarily focuses on whisky, it also works with rum. Solberg’s take on his retro favourite uses three rums – Jamaican, Lugger spiced and over-proof – along with triple sec and lime juice. All it needs is shaking up, pouring over ice and a garnish of orange and mint. He says spiced rum goes well with anything apple-y, and that a particular favourite rum modifier is pomegranate molasses. He incorporates this mix into a rum punch alongside dry cider, lime, allspice dram and a little vanilla syrup, garnished with cinnamon, nutmeg and apple slices.Kurt Maitland, cocktail authorKurt Maitland, author of Drink, can recommend something simple and something more showy. A Devil’s Kiss won’t tax you: shake up equal parts coffee liqueur, Grand Marnier and Lugger Rum with ice and strain into small glasses.The Kama’aina is a completely different kettle of fish, however. It starts with ginger syrup, almond paste and pimento liqueur, stirred to create a #9. Next add Rhum agricole, Lugger Rum, guava nectar, real cream of coconut, and fresh lime then shake with crushed ice and strain into a tiki glass, adding Angostura bitters and an orange blossom garnish at the end. Maitland describes a Devil’s Kiss as like an aperitif at home before the main drama of a complicated Kama’aina in a specialist bar. The former can easily be made in quantity for parties and the spiced rum balances beautifully with the bitter coffee and sweet Grand Marnier.Featuring fruit, spice and a genuinely fiery twist – careful with those matchesLugger rum 50mlStrawberry and lime syrup 20ml*Angostura bitters, 2 dashesWest country cider 30mlSprig of rosemarySpiced powder**MatchesStrawSugar 50gStrawberries x10Peeled lime skins (x2 whole limes)Juice of 1 whole limeIn a bowl, muddle all ingredients and leave for 10-30 minutes in fridge, then strain through a sieve.Mix equal parts of icing sugar, cinnamon powder and nutmeg powder.Lugger Rum is a Caribbean rum aged in Devon, featuring sophisticated notes of orange peel, nutmeg, cloves and vanilla.

The house was bequeathed to the people of Dumbarton, but for many years lay in a sad state of disrepair until it was let to a Christian organisation. It runs a tea room on Saturdays (and Thursdays and Fridays in summer). You can walk around the gorgeous grounds or, if you’re feeling more energetic, go up into the Lang Craigs wood for fabulous views. Then relax and enjoy your coffee and cake in the Angel Room watched over by the heavenly frescoes.• visitscotlandCarol Ann RamsayWatchtree Nature Reserve, near Carlisle, offers walks in dense woodland populated with hare and deer, as well as frogs, toads and newts, if you look carefully enough. Sited on a former second world war airfield, it has a number of trails through the woods, as well as smooth track perfect for cycling or skating. It is possible to hire a range of bicycles from Watchtree Wheelers to tour the perimeter, though cyclists aren’t permitted to disturb the peace of the wooded areas. Given that is was once the burial ground for thousands of animals caught up in the foot-and-mouth crisis, its transformation into to a nature reserve, wind farm and disability cycling charity is a serene triumph.• watchtreeJames CartwrightHengistbury Head, just south of Christchurch, is a beautiful, tranquil and constantly changing piece of coastline that has something for everyone. As a newly created dog walker, I can choose from flat grassland tracks that lead to high sand dunes down to the beautiful natural and often deserted beach. Or we can choose to go high on to the head and walk the path through heather and ferns, with views of Christchurch Priory and estuary on one side, and the Dorset coastline on the other. Then, right at the tip, you see Mudeford Spit and its beach huts. There is wildlife and colourful plant life everywhere, and whether it’s sunny or cloudy (it’s always windy!) at the end of a walk you feel better for having been there.• see visithengistburyheadPhilippaBaggeridge Country Park, near Wolverhampton, has always been our family’s favourite place for an afternoon walk. It’s a former colliery with beautiful walks, a play park, a miniature railway, lakes and watercress beds to hop across. It’s often heaving on a warm day, so our best memories are in the drizzle when it’s quiet and we can watch the wildfowl on Bag Pool, or walk to Himley Hall and stop for hot chocolate. You often spot relics of the old mine works and can climb to the toposcope and look across to the old brickworks. A great place to observe all four seasons.• sstaffs.gov.ukColin PearsonBeacon Hill national nature reserve stands above the South Downs in Hampshire. The top of the hill is coated in beech woodland, which provides shady respite from the heat of the summer sun. The chalk downlands are the real attraction though, and you have to be prepared to go slow to appreciate its delights – multitudes of plants, all in flower, just centimetres from each other. The mind boggles at how so many different things can live cheek by jowl. The cherry on the cake isn’t just the song of the skylark, but the clouds of butterflies that erupt with every step. Here I am reminded of Pig-Pen, the character in Charlie Brown, as silver-spotted skipper butterflies surround me in their hundreds.• gov.ukRobFor a slice of serenity in the heart of London, I love Millwall Dock on the Isle of Dogs. Dwarfed by the skyscrapers of Canary Wharf, this expanse of open water is the perfect contrast to fast-paced urban life. Whether it’s observing the mischievous birdlife squabbling over possession of the tern raft in the old graving dock, or partaking in a bracing open-water swim from the Docklands Sailing \u0026amp Watersports Centre, or simply watching the sun set over the City of London with an array of dinghies in the foreground, there’s always something to amuse, refresh or inspire. And for those more interested in llamas, goats and donkeys, Mudchute Farm is just a stone’s throw away.Jack StookesSandwell Valley, near West Bromwich, is a one-of-a-kind place full of hidden gems, with surviving bits of real countryside, open pastures and grass meadows. It also has a nice old farm turned into a museum and two large, well-equipped playgrounds. Or you can visit the priory ruins – said to be haunted – with its Saxon stone coffins, surrounded by old dark woods with hidden medieval ponds. More recent history lies in the second world war ack-ack gun emplacements, still in good shape, but more and more engulfed by the vegetation every year. And an old colliery site has been transformed into a wildlife haven by the RSPB on the river Tame. This is all within a 1.5-mile radius surrounded on all sides by urban sprawl. May it remain undeveloped for ever.• sandwell.gov.ukStanleyMy absolute favourite green space is the Dalston Eastern Curve Garden. This small urban community oasis is set back from the madness of busy Hackney on a disused train line. It’s a beautifully layered garden with a magical wooded area, raised beds with vegetables, and beautiful pots full of seasonal flowers. The main reason I come here is for inspiration – I love the creativity, especially across the seasons. I especially love visiting in October: despite the year growing old, it is transformed into a beautiful autumnal space, using the changing plants, hundreds of carved pumpkins, and coppery red crispy leaf garlands. Sitting in the cold, warmed by a hot chocolate, it is just perfect.• dalstongarden.orgKatherine PhippsWilliamson Park in Lancaster is a gem. Jimmy Williamson (Lord Ashton) commissioned its construction from the remains of the city quarry in the 19th century. Most people who have passed Lancaster on the M6 heading north will have seen the Ashton Memorial in the centre of the park, rising above the trees, but step inside and you find lovely walks between mature trees, a regular outdoor theatre, cafe, wildlife park, butterfly house, children’s play areas and – on a clear day – views across Morecambe Bay to the Lakeland Fells.

It means living in the desperate search for protection and human dignity.”Factors leading to the continuing backlog include new laws from right-leaning governments and an increase in the number of rejections, leading to lengthy appeals processes.“The vision of governments on the migration crisis has changed and more and more countries are rejecting an increasing number of requests for asylum,” said Fulvio Vassallo, an expert on asylum law from the University of Palermo.The German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) has in 2019 rejected three-quarters of family reunification requests from Greece, where migrants live in the overcrowded camps of Athens and Lesbos.“If a migrant has his asylum request rejected, in any case, he is entitled to have recourse to appeal, which, however, lengthens the time waiting in limbo by up to four years,” said Vassallo. “There are migrants who arrived in 2015 and had their asylum requests denied. At that point they presented an appeal to a court and are still waiting for an answer on their future.”Experts point out how some governments in recent years, especially in Italy and Germany, have accelerated evaluation procedures for asylum requests, which appears to have caused an increase in rejections because high-speed procedures are not carried out with as much thoughtful evaluation.“The agenda of the rightwing extremists is now the agenda of the mainstream and all that matters is high speed, few or no rights in the procedure, highest possible rejection rates and increasing the deportation figures,” said Kopp. “Many rejected asylum seekers receive protection only through a legal action but years of waiting for the court decision extend the limbo situation in an intolerable way.”According to Eurostat, since 2014 there have been 3.6m requests for asylum in EU countries, only 1.8m of which have resulted in legal protection. Those who stay after rejection are at risk of suddenly becoming illegal immigrants. “This is the worrying part of this phenomenon, with thousands of people exposed to the risk of a difficult life, at the mercy of labour exploitation,” said Carlotta Sami, a spokeswoman for UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, in Italy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d05b1ac738dd83f930918369bc29ff1e8cf3b6d/117_811_3246_1947/master/3246.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bcb5c3375d1db763a8010ca90e90e51","title":"how small scale enterprises are reviving portugal neglected interior","story":"A small but growing number of investors are hoping to reverse the slow-motion decline of rural areasThe decade has not been kind to Manteigas. Nestled in the mountains in the Portuguese interior, this pretty town has suffered a familiar kind of slow-motion decline.“Once the factories started closing, then the schools closed, the shops closed, even the chapel closed,” says Maria José Santos Salvado, a wizard with needle and thread who was laid off as a textile patcher when her factory shut in 2011. “All the young people left. Manteigas became a town of old people.”It’s a common enough story in southern Europe, where rural decline is a long-term tendency that has accelerated since the financial crisis.But are fortunes about to reverse for people like Salvado? After the surprise intervention of a husband-and-wife team from Lisbon, the looms of her old factory are chugging noisily once again. With orders streaming in from as far afield as Japan, her deft skills are in higher demand than ever.Isabel Costa, formerly a high-flyer in Portugal’s corporate retail sector, and her lawyer husband, João, are among a small but growing number of investors turning their eye to Portugal’s rural interior.In many parts of Europe, the issue of depopulation of the countryside, regions, or in some cases whole countries, weighs on the minds of politicians and the public, as an era of freedom of movement means more people are able to migrate to find better opportunities.A recent study by the European Council on Foreign Relations showed that in Spain, Italy, Greece, Poland, Hungary and Romania, countries where the population has either declined sharply or is flatlining, more people are worried about emigration than they are about immigration.The problem is felt acutely in central and eastern Europe, where populations have shrunk dramatically in the decades since the fall of communism, due in part to the traumatic effects of the transition, with high mortality rates, low birth rates, and millions of people travelling to western Europe to seek higher salaries, especially in the years after EU accession. In Bulgaria, for example, the population has shrunk from 9 million to 7 million since 1989.“More and more people are investing in the interior of Portugal … but they need to look at these projects almost as a kind of mission, not as a way of getting rich,” advises Costa.This is true of her own venture, which, despite growing year-on-year, was never designed to be a major money-spinner. Indeed, its origins were more coincidental than commercial. Costa had placed an order with a local manufacturer for burel wool – a historical speciality of Portugal’s mountainous Serra da Estrela region.She quickly discovered that the manufacturer was in a “bad situation” and agreed to buy its working looms and its back catalogue of patterns. She rented a disused factory space owned by the local council, re-hired 15 of the firm’s employees, and restarted operations. With some luck (Microsoft hired her to refit its Lisbon headquarters) and plenty of hard work (she spends half the year travelling to trade shows), Costa’s Burel Mountain Originals brand now employs more than 60 people and supplies two high-end stores in Lisbon and Porto.“We couldn’t just sit back and see this incredible heritage destroyed. I couldn’t sleep knowing about this problem and doing nothing to retain the area’s industrial history and to teach the next generation,” says Costa, who also owns two boutique mountain hotels close to Manteigas.Catarina Vieira is of a similar mind. A former finance manager from the coastal city of Aveiro, she owns a modest six-chalet quinta, or estate, near the town of Seia and is a vocal proponent of Portugal’s nascent eco-tourism market.Chao do Rio is the polar opposite of the vast, package-holiday complexes that now litter the Algarve. The food she serves is all locally sourced, the swimming pool is “biological” (read: unchlorinated and teeming with frogs), and the only loud music you will hear is the sound of birdsong.“The whole idea behind projects like ours is that they are on a small scale and they show concern for the environment and social awareness,” says Vieira. Her vision of a small-scale, culturally-sensitive mode of development is shared by many of those investing in Portugal’s interior. Like Bruno Vargas. A 41-year-old former marketeer, he jacked in his city job five years ago to run a four-hectare farm in Rio Maior, a village located in the Centro region. His venture, Herbas Organic Herbs, specialises in hand-crafted aromatic tea infusions. Business is good. He exports to various European countries and employs seasonal labour from the local area. By his own admission, however, the venture grew out of the “romantic idea” of a more balanced lifestyle as much as turning a profit.Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@the“I had the idea that it would be a different kind of life, with more time for my family and less pressures. That’s not turned out to be true, of course. If you have a business, you have pressures, but at least my mind is clearer about why I’m doing this,” he says. Not all embrace this pared-down model of rural development. The Portuguese government provides warm words, for instance, but little in the shape of financial support. Such public investment as exists for rural enterprise development tends to come from the European Union.To get started, for example, Vargas received €40,000 (£37,000) in seed-funding from ProDer – a nationally-managed fund for rural development primarily financed by the EU. Costa and Vieira also received help from the same fund. Even less sympathetic are large-scale investors, for whom big is – as ever – beautiful. Despite being located in an officially designated natural park, for instance, Manteigas is soon to have a huge, luxury hotel constructed in the wooded glacial valley overlooking the town.In a similar vein, international mining firms are now sniffing around. It transpires that Portugal’s central belt is especially “blessed” with reserves of lithium, the alkali metal used in batteries for smartphones and electric cars. “If mega-mining comes to the centre of Portugal, it will spoil everything. We really need to cherish these small projects and put away these crazy dreams of Portugal as the future Arabia,” says Vieira.The economists would disagree, arguing that mega-mining and commercial tourism promise far higher levels of capital investment and job creation. The central government, which campaigners fear is poised to greenlight a lithium mine on the edge of Serra da Estrela, appears to agree.From his holistic yoga retreat near Tábua, in the district of Coimbra, Tony Speirs is watching with anxiety. Originally from north Wales, he set up shop in central Portugal a decade ago. Over that time, he has seen large-scale commercial investment completely alter the once sleepy coastline of the Algarve. He hopes his neighbours will take note and opt for a different route. As he himself readily admits, micro-enterprises like his will not transform Portugal’s rustic interior into dynamos of economic development. But they are helping spark into life pockets of entrepreneurial vitality. For Speirs, that’s enough. His neighbours, he says, are of like mind: “Here, people think once your business is working, why grow it?” Why, indeed?This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Before his death he had signed on with a private military company – his friends told her it was called Wagner – to fight in Ukraine and later Syria. For Olga it was just another military job.Two years later she is still fighting for compensation. The latest twist came when she was told by officials this year that her husband was not a soldier at all but an employee of a regional subsidiary of an energy company.Markelova said she knew this was not the case. “I know that he was fighting and he was in this private military company,” she said. “I was there in Krasnodar, I saw the base in Molkino, I saw him in a military uniform. He never hid from us that he was fighting abroad.”Markelova’s story shines a light on how Russia’s unregulated mercenary industry, a growing element of Russian power projection abroad, can affect families. Death notices can come by text message and bodies can take weeks to be returned home. “He has one child and there is no one here to help,” Markelova said. “He fought for them. They’ve all forgotten about her.”Now, as the Russian government seeks to increase its influence in Africa, driven in part by western sanctions imposed in 2014 over the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, Russian mercenary outfits are expanding on the African continent too.Central to many of these operations is Wagner, which first emerged on the battlefields of Ukraine. Since then it has grown from a simple paramilitary outfit to providing military training, political consultancy, and intelligence and online influence operations.In Africa, Wagner’s main role is to provide site security and assist in political operations. Two former fighters said they had heard reports of several colleagues killed in Sudan and of a deadly firefight in the Central African Republic (CAR), but those incidents could not be confirmed.Wagner’s footprint has been largest in CAR, where its fighters have served as military advisers, trainers and armed guards in exchange for gold and diamond mining concessions. Russian mercenaries also serve as a personal guard to the country’s leader, Faustian-Archange Touadéra. As part of Russia’s broader soft power push into the country, a company tied to the group even financed a beauty contest last year. In July 2018 three journalists who were investigating Wagner’s activities in CAR were shot and killed by unknown gunmen. Their families declined to speak for this article as the investigation is ongoing.In Sudan, Wagner mercenaries were first filmed training military personnel to storm buildings in 2017. Mercenaries were also spotted near this year’s anti-government protests, although they were not directly involved in efforts to put them down. Sudan’s capital, Khartoum, is the group’s main entry point into central Africa, and a convoy of military vehicles bearing hundreds of mercenaries was spotted at the border between Sudan and CAR last July.Leaked documents have shown Wagner’s efforts to make inroads to other countries in Africa by dispatching mercenaries and political consultants. Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman linked to the group, was spotted in November at high-level negotiations with Khalifa Haftar, the head of the rebel Libyan National Army, indicating that Russian mercenaries may be helping the his advance on Tripoli.Ruslan Leviev, the founder of the Conflict Intelligence Team, an open-source investigation unit, said Wagner is “almost like a quasi-governmental machine … It’s hard to just call it a private military company.”The number of Wagner mercenaries in Africa pales in comparison to the number in Syria. Leviev estimates the group has 150 mercenaries in CAR and several dozen in Sudan, compared with upwards of 2,000 in Syria at the conflict’s peak. The death toll is also far lower. “The goal is different: you’re not storming cities, you’re providing security and intelligence,” he said.Wagner’s core asset has always been its willingness to send paid mercenaries to places where the Russian government can not openly go. Some operations have ended in disaster. Hundreds of mercenaries, some tied to Wagner, were reportedly killed in clashes with US forces during a doomed attempt to seize an oil refinery in Syria in February 2018.Wagner promises its recruits it will provide compensation in the event of their death and usually it does, according to former fighters and media reports. Families are generally given about £60,000, sometimes on the same day as the funeral, and are told not to speak to the media.Markelova and her husband orced while he was still fighting abroad. When he was killed, compensation was delivered to his mother. They ceased speaking when Markelova went public demanding that Vladimir Putin step in to protect the families of private military contractors. “She wants me to stay quiet,” Markelova said. “But I want to see someone act for us.” ﻿"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3997040.1566766613!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coveney welcomes consistent eu support for brexit backstop","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t European Council president Donald Tusk and UK prime minister Boris Johnson  at the G7 summit in Biarritz, France on Sunday. Photograph: Neil HallEPAThe Government has welcomed the EU’s continued support for the Irish backstop following the first substantive meeting between UK prime minister Boris Johnson and European Council president Donald Tusk on Brexit.“Mr Tusk set out once again the EU’s clear and consistent position which we share,” a spokesman for Tánaiste Simon Coveney said on Sunday night following the meeting in the margins of the G7 summit in Biarritz, France.“The EU remains open to any new ideas from the United Kingdom so long as they are compatible with the withdrawal agreement.”Government sources said the leaders of major European countries and institutions that Mr Johnson has met in the past week – German chancellor Angela Merkel, French president Emmanuel Macron and Mr Tusk – have been consistent with the message that the withdrawal agreement cannot be revisited and any UK suggestions for change would occur during the next phase of the Brexit process: the declaration on future relations.The 25-minute meeting between Mr Tusk and Mr Johnson was described as cordial and positive, but sources said it involved no fresh proposals but rather a restating of the positions on both sides.The atmosphere between the two was in contrast to the previous day, when they accused each other of being responsible for the fact a no-deal Brexit is looming on October 31st.‘Mr No Deal’Mr Tusk had said he hoped Mr Johnson would “not like to go down in history as ‘Mr No Deal’” and that the “EU is ready to listen to operational, realistic ideas acceptable to all member states including Ireland, if and when the UK government is ready to put them on the table”.Mr Johnson struck conflicting tones in a series of interviews on Sunday. At one point he said there had been a change of mood and that the chances of a deal were improving, but he also told the BBC the prospect of a crash-out exit remained “touch-and-go”.“It all depends on our EU friends and partners. I think in the last few days there has been a dawning realisation in Brussels and other European capitals what the shape of the problem is for the UK,” he said, adding that “the important thing is to get ready to come out without a deal”.The EU briefed that the onus was squarely on the UK to come up with an alternative to the backstop. Mr Johnson has said he will not negotiate with the EU on Brexit unless it agrees to remove the backstop, which guarantees continuation of a seamless border on the island of Ireland.Divorce billHe also raised the prospect of the UK refusing to pay the so-called £39 billion (€43 billion) Brexit orce bill in the event of a no-deal outcome.Speaking on ITV, Mr Johnson said: “If we come out without an agreement it is certainly true that the £39 billion is no longer, strictly speaking, owed.“There will be very substantial sums available to our country to spend on our priorities. It is not a threat. It is a simple fact.”Fianna Fáil Brexit spokeswoman Lisa Chambers said Britain would find it very difficult in future to strike any trade deal with the EU if it reneged on the orce bill. She also argued that the Government must step up preparations for a no-deal Brexit and called on Mr Coveney to clarify where checks would occur in the event of the UK crashing out of the bloc.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Tom HonanThe Hundreds of millions in funding has been allocated to local authorities to bolster the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan Scheme, which was thrown into doubt following budget over-runs earlier this year.The Government committed €200 million over three years in February of last year to the low-cost mortgage scheme for first-time buyers. However, the allocation to local authorities last year was almost €210 million – more than the entire three-year budget for the programme.The value of loans approved by city and county councils last year even exceeded this figure, with mortgage applications totalling almost €224 million approved across the State, prompting some local authorities to stop accepting applications earlier this year.Following a hiatus of several months in confirming an ongoing budget for the scheme, documents seen by the  show Dublin City Council alone has had its allocation for the State-backed mortgage scheme increased to just under €130 million from the €50 million that was allocated initially. The additional €80 million is to fund the scheme to the end of this year, with additional resources expected next year.Fingal County Council, one of the local authorities which announced earlier this year that is was no longer accepting loan applications, has seen its funding rise from €20 million to more than €81 million to the end of this year.It is understood that similar increases in allocations are being issued to local authorities across the State, indicating that the sums involved will be multiples of the original budget.Low interest ratesUnder the scheme, first time buyers who have had mortgage applications rejected by a bank can borrow up to 90 per cent of the market value of a property at interest rates as low as 2 per cent over 25 years.Maximum purchase prices were set at €320,000 in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow, and €250,000 in the rest of the country. The scheme is open to iniduals with an income of up to €50,000 or couples earning up to €75,000.Several local authorities reported last March that they had run out of money for the scheme as demand had far outstripped initial expectations.He said he was in talks with the Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe and the Central Bank on this year’s allocation and that a decision on this was “imminent”. However, no announcement has since been made.A letter from the Department of Housing to Dublin City Council in recent days stated that it had an allocation of some €129.7 million up to the end of the year.“This overall allocation incorporates loans already issued since the inception of the scheme, loans which will be drawn down on foot of approvals already issued and projected loan demand for the rest of 2019,” the letter said, warning that the lending “may not exceed” the allocated amount.“Where it becomes evident that the level of demand is greater than the amount of the allocation now being notified, local authorities should contact the department before committing themselves to further lending under the scheme.”Similar letters are being sent to local authorities across the State. The funding is provided through the Housing Finance Agency and does not impact the Government’s balance sheet, the department said."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Police fire water canon and tear gas as demonstrators use petrol bombsMore than 730,000 fled across border to Bangladesh following military crackdownPolice seek to force back brick-throwing protesters on Sunday after violent clashesAustralia, New Zealand have increased scrutiny of social media companies in wake of Christchurch massacreChina frees British consulate worker whose detention helped fuel tensionPro-democracy demonstrators take inspiration from activists in Baltic states 30 years agoTokyo says Seoul fails to appreciate growing security threat posed by North KoreaFormer Vatican treasurer was found guilty of molesting two 13-year-old boys in 1990sForeign journalists cannot go out alone in Xinjiang, despite its status as \u0026lsquoChina\u0026rsquos safest province\u0026rsquoBritain expresses concern over reported detention of consulate staff member in ChinaSimon Cheng Man-kit failed to return from a business event in ShenzenGroom (25) saved $14,000 to pay for wedding with his 18-year-old bride. \u0026lsquoI brought pain and nothing else\u0026rsquoOffer would \u0026lsquocover up the crimes of a small group of violent militants\u0026rsquo China\u0026rsquos spokesman saidMore than three dozen civilians in jail awaiting trial, including prominent filmmakerProtesters\u0027 demands grow to include expanded elections and amnesty for arrested demonstratorsThere were difficulties accessing enough water and a three-hour struggle to douse the flamesHundreds of thousands join protest in pouring rain as tensions reach new levelAttack on wedding comes as Taliban seeks to negotiate deal on US withdrawalMany shops in Kowloon shut early in anticipation of clashes turning nasty at night"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons august 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Order The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Met Police reveal Epstein\u0026#39s London links \u0026#39revisited\u0026#39 but insist investigation not necessaryComment: It\u0026#39s a scandal the Royal Mint refused to put Enid Blyton on a coin.

Mr Macron then told the other leaders during dinner on Saturday night.“There was a very substantial conversation among the G7 leaders,” the source said.  The source added that the French and Iranian foreign ministers were also discussing “regional issues and Iran’s missile programme”.“We are working in total transparency with our US partners,” he said.Angela Merkel said she was only informed shortly before Mr Zarif arrived. A White House official said Donald Trump was not told that Emmanuel Macron had invited Javad ZarifEarlier the French president played down briefings by his aides that the G7 leaders had mandated him to lead talks with Iran, which was quickly denied by Mr Trump who said the idea had not been discussed. Mr Macron said there was no such thing as a “G7 mandate” as the group is a forum for discussion rather than a formal structure.The Iranian foreign ministry said Mr Zarif had flown in for talks on saving the 2015 nuclear deal, but denied that Iran\u0027s missile programme was up for discussion. It said no talks with Mr Trump or the US delegation are planned.Mr Macron is hosting Mr Trump, Boris Johnson, Angela Merkel, Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, Canada’s Justin Trudeau, and Giuseppe Conte, Italy’s caretaker prime minister, at the 45th G7 summit. Britain\u0026#39s Prime Minister Boris Johnson meets U.S. President Donald Trump for bilateral talks during the G7 summit The meeting has exposed deep rifts over everything from the fires in the Amazon rain forest to Mr Trump’s trade war with China, and Mr Macron has warned that it will likely be the first summit in the Group’s 45 year history to end without a joint communique.There were reportedly lively discussions at Saturday night’s dinner of local Basque cuisine when European leaders including Mr Johnson pushed back at Mr Trump\u0027s suggestion that Russian president Vladimir Putin, who was suspended from the G7 after annexing Crimea in 2014, should be readmitted to the forum.Mr Trump and Mr Macron have also clashed over a proposed French digital tax which would hit US tech giants like Google and Amazon. Mr Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on French wine in retaliation. Mr Trump sought to play down reports of ision on Sunday, saying meetings so far have been “very good”.“Before I arrived in France, the Fake and Disgusting News was saying that relations with the 6 others countries in the G-7 are very tense, and that the two days of meetings will be a disaster,” Mr Trump tweeted. An Iranian government plane is seen on the tarmac at Biarritz airport in Anglet on Sunday  “Well, we are having very good meetings, the Leaders are getting along very well, and our Country, economically, is doing great — the talk of the world!”Tensions between the US and Iran have spiralled since Mr Trump last year withdrew from a deal that offered Iran sanctions relief in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear programme.Since then the US has pursued a policy of “maximum pressure” in the hope that economic hardship will force the regime in Tehran to accept a more restrictive deal and end its support for armed groups like Hizbollah.The confrontation has caused tension with European allies including Britain which still support the 2015 nuclear deal.  Iran continues to hold the Stena Impero, a British flagged tanker that it seized in the Gulf in apparent retaliation for the arrest by Royal Marines of an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar in July. Gibraltar released the Adrian Darya 1, formerly the Grace 1, on August 18, despite a US legal bid to impound it. The Royal Navy sent a third warship to the provide maritime security in the Strait of Hormuz on Saturday.  HMS Defender, a type 45 destroyer, will join the type 23 frigates HMS Kent and HMS Montrose.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

It also suggests that search could be more likely to find life on exoplanets than we had thought.This is a surprising conclusion, said lead researcher Dr Stephanie Olson.\u0026nbspIt shows us that conditions on some exoplanets with favourable ocean circulation patterns could be better suited to support life that is more abundant or more active than life on Earth.In recent years, scientists have found huge numbers of exoplanets, or worlds orbiting around stars that are not our own. But they are all very far away – impossible to reach even with the fastest space probes, and difficult even to see in any detail.Researchers are working on a variety of ways to learn about those worlds, including telescopes that will be able to sniff their atmospheres and learn more about what the planets could be made of. But to understand the information that comes back, scientists need to build detailed and complicated models of how planets form and their climates work.Created with Sketch.Best NASA pictures of the month - July 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A total solar eclipse as seen from the US National Science Federation observatory in the Chilean Andes on 2 JulyA composite image of the Cygnus OB2 star cluster composed of pictures taken by the Isaac Newton Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope on July 24The spacecraft Soyuz MS-13 is launched at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on July 20A copy of LIFE magazine from July 4 1969 signed by Michael Collins is seen onboard the Soyuz spacecraftThe galaxy NGC 1156 which is said to resemble a cherry blossom tree.

The work was presented at the\u0026nbspGoldschmidt\u0026nbspGeochemistry\u0026nbspCongress in\u0026nbspBarcelona.Nasa watching planet for signs of alien life after discoveryNASA\u0027s search for life in the Universe is focused on so-called Habitable Zone planets, which are worlds that have the potential for liquid water oceans, she said.\u0026nbspBut not all oceans are equally hospitable – and some oceans will be better places to live than others due to their global circulation patterns.To conduct the study, the team made models of those planets using Nasa software, which allows them to simulate the conditions on those exoplanets. Using that Nasa technology, they were able to create models of the possible climates and oceans that could be on those exoplanets.They found that many of them seemed like more hospitable and flourishing places for life than even Earth is. They looked at the process in Earth\u0027s oceans that allows life to take root down here – and considered whether that same process could be happening elsewhere in the universe.Our work has been aimed at identifying the exoplanet oceans which have the greatest capacity to host globally abundant and active life, said Dr Olson in a statement.Life in Earth\u0027s oceans depends on upwelling (upward flow) which returns nutrients from the dark depths of the ocean to the sunlit portions of the ocean where photosynthetic life lives. More upwelling means more nutrient resupply, which means more biological activity.These are the conditions we need to look for on exoplanets.By modelling a variety of different exoplanets, the researchers were able to think about which types would be most likely to develop and then sustain life. And they were surprised to find that Earth is not the best kind – and that there may be other worlds out there that are a far better place for life to begin.We have used an ocean circulation model to identify which planets will have the most efficient upwelling and thus offer particularly hospitable oceans, she said.\u0026nbspWe found that higher atmospheric density, slower rotation rates, and the presence of continents all yield higher upwelling rates.A further implication is that Earth might not be optimally habitable – and life elsewhere may enjoy a planet that is even more hospitable than our own.The work is important because our technology means that we are unable to see everything: there is almost certainly more life than we will ever be able to see, even with the most advanced telescopes and other equipment. That means scientists will need to optimise their search by looking at the planets where life will find it easiest to find a home.We expect oceans to be important in regulating some of the most compelling remotely detectable signs of life on habitable worlds, but our understanding of oceans beyond our solar system is currently very rudimentary, said\u0026nbspChris\u0026nbspReinhard, from the Georgia Institute of Technology, who wasn\u0027t involved in the study.\u0026nbspDr\u0026nbspOlson\u0027s work represents a significant and exciting step forward in our understanding of exoplanet oceanography.The new research could now help inform how new telescopes are built, since we now know what kinds of planets will be best to search for. Now we know what to look for, so we need to start looking, said Dr Olson.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

When someone of his standing makes a statement like that, it should give pause for thought.But according to Daniel Pitchford, co-founder of AI Business, this view, while pretty common, is over-egging the situation slightly.Pitchford set up AI Business, an “online content portal for artificial intelligence and its real-world applications” back in 2014 with the intention of demystifying AI for businesses and trying to cut through some of the more hyperbolic beliefs about AI.There is no doubting Musk is not alone in his apocalyptic view of AI so Pitchford clearly has his work cut out in converting the business masses but what, in his view, is behind this rather extreme reaction?\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailAnd although there are exciting potential applications in various sectors, particularly in healthcare, he wants businesses to understand that AI is not about wholesale transformation but improving processes and profitability.\u0026nbspIndeed, one of the main reasons that AI has struggled to make more of an impact in business, he believes, is that business leaders have perhaps expected too much too soon.“What we try to do is educate businesses to be clear on the metrics – what are you looking to achieve? What is the ROI and outcome before you start. Is that realistic?\u0026nbsp“A lot of people think AI is going to change the world and if they plug a piece of software or application on top of what they are already doing\u0026nbsptheir business is going to transform overnight, and then end up bitterly disappointed when it isn’t,” he says.The fear stems from change. Whether it is AI or whether it is the industrial revolution – whatever the change is – that is what people fear because humans don’t really like to changeWhich is where he hopes his business can play a crucial role. Starting out as a blog written in his and his business partner’s spare time, AI Business quickly grew to become a trusted source of AI insight for business across the world by producing business-useful content, in contrast to the academic content that dominated at the time.But with his background in business event production, Pitchford was aware that for AI Business to become truly indispensable to the business community, it had to adopt a thoroughly analogue approach and bring vendors and businesses together face to face.From 400 attendees at its\u0026nbspinaugural AI Summit in London in 2016, AI Business is now the leading brand globally hosting events in London, New York, San Francisco, Munich, Hong Kong, Singapore and Cape Town. The 2019 Summit in London alone drew 25,000 AI enthusiasts.So clearly there is an appetite to understand the applications and implications of AI in the business world,\u0026nbspbut what is the destination?\u0026nbsp“Ultimately, the future of AI is about increasing productivity and that’s what politicians and governments get excited about – what can it do for our GDP? That is the big end goal,” Pitchford explains.Elon Musk’s AI project to replicate the human brain just received $1bnA 2017 report from PWC estimated that UK GDP could increase by more than 10 per cent\u0026nbspby 2030 as a result of AI, a cash equivalent of £232bn, which is no small shakes.But the UK is not the only nation eyeing the benefits of AI, with Pitchford outlining a global AI arms race between China and the US, each vying for the position of the world’s AI superpower.“A lot of people are saying China will emerge as the AI superpower. Over the last two years, Asia has overtaken Europe in terms of the amount being invested by enterprises and businesses in the adoption of AI whereas two years ago, Europe was ahead.”He says that China’s rapid emergence can be explained by the level of investment the Chinese government is putting into AI with latest estimates placing it as high as $300bn\u0026nbsp(£240bn): “As you move from innovation to implementation there is a massive opportunity which they are acutely aware of, hence the investment they are pouring in.”Such is the rate of change in AI development and implementation, it would be foolish to bet on any one nation or region becoming the dominant power just yet. But in the meantime, AI Business\u0026nbspintends to build on its own dominance in this space following its recent acquisition by publishing giant Informa.“The future is scale,” Pitchford says. “What we have with Informa is that opportunity of scale. The scale of the events and other acquisitions made by the group help that in terms of collaboration and opportunities.”And as for the allegedly demonic heart of AI? Pitchford says that proponents are acutely aware of the potential dangers and are actively addressing it.“There is a lot being invested by the big players in understanding how AI can support society rather than just generate profit,” he says.\u0026nbspSo perhaps the robot apocalypse might yet be averted by traditional human compassion.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

And I’d enjoyed it.\u0026nbspI couldn’t tell you the last time that happened.\u0026nbspThis led me to ask a question: with the British town centre in crisis –\u0026nbspthe number of vacant premises at its\u0026nbsphighest level for more than four years –\u0026nbspis there anything we could learn from the place?Labour promises free wifi in town centres and scrapping ATM chargesHigh streets propose five-year plan for digital technology sales boostYou have to be a little bit careful at the outset. We’re talking here about a picturesque and historic walled town in the middle of a region that attracts a large number of visitors.You’re not going to be able to replicate what it has across Britain. \u0026nbspBut here’s the thing: similarly\u0026nbsptouristy places\u0026nbspon this side of the channel are struggling in a way that Dinan at least doesn’t appear to be.Nationally, the British Retail Consortium puts the vacancy rate at 10.3 per cent. Footfall declined by 1.9 per cent in July.\u0026nbspIt isn’t just economically deprived areas that are struggling either. Last year it was reported that there were 42 vacant premises in the picturesque city of Bath, for example. It’s a good deal bigger than Dinan, but is a similar tourist trap thanks to the world-famous Roman baths, which have given the city the status of a Unesco\u0026nbspworld heritage site and put it high on the itinerary of visitors to the region.\u0026nbspCampaigner Luke John Emmett successfully drew attention to the city centre’s plight with the aid of a camera. He says while landlords have made efforts to make some of the empty premises look less unsightly since then, and new tenants are promised, the problem continues.\u0026nbspAs retailers continue to close stores, the issue of empty shopfronts looks set to continue to plague the British high street.\u0026nbspSo to Dinan. What made mooching around the place such a pleasure was the sheer variety of what this small town had to offer.\u0026nbspOf course we saw places catering for the tourist euro, but there were also bookshops, a toyshop, bakeries, a place where a bloke was selling lights built out of scrap, an indoor market.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Somehow Dinan has become Breton geek central. We even found a steampunk and Harry Potter emporium.Add in the inevitable profusion of cafes, something France does so very well, and you’ve an enticing mix.\u0026nbspThe lack of the chains that have homogenised British shopping centres, and made them boring, was a big plus point for me. It’s not that they aren’t there. There was, of course, a Carrefour convenience outlet, broadly equivalent to Tesco . There was also a bookie, in the form of a PMU bar. But they weren’t dominant features in\u0026nbspthe same way that they are in Britain.\u0026nbspThe retreat of the chains could provide an opportunity for small and more specialist outlets to move in, especially in places like Bath which have a ready supply of visitors.But, of course, there are high rents to contend with and the running sore of business rates linked to property values that are far\u0026nbsphigher in town centres than they are on the outskirts where internet retailers like Amazon build their warehouses.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Would you risk setting up a shop in the current climate when you’d be better off selling online from your garage if retail is your thing?Some imagination is called for, and from local as well as central government. Mr\u0026nbspEmmett thinks encouraging pop-up shops could help. That’s an idea that could have legs. A fresh\u0026nbspset of shops every week? People might just be moved to take a trip to check out the week’s new arrivals if there were to be a variety of places cycling through.\u0026nbspWhat Britain’s walking dead town centres are in dire need of is what Dinan obviously has in abundance: life. It would certainly help if the nation could find a government willing and able to breathe it in.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Ricci’s deadpan performance is so gloriously apathetic and mean that she comfortably steals the show from her adult co-stars, and deservedly had her role beefed up for the film’s sequel. (AW)218 Saoirse Ronan in Atonement (2007)Since Atonement, Ronan has become one of the most accomplished actors of her generation. And it’s no surprise, given how convincingly she brought to life, at the age of 13, Ian McEwan’s precocious and stubborn protagonist Briony Tallis, whose misinterpretation of a romantic encounter between her sister and her childhood friend wreaks havoc in the lives of those around her. (EH)318 Quvenzhané Wallis in Beasts of the Southern Wild (2012)Quvenzhané Wallis is proof that lying sometimes gets you places. As a five-year-old, the child star convinced her parents to let her fib about her age so that she could audition for Beasts of the Southern Wild – their minimum age was six. So impressed was director Benh Zeitlin by Wallis that he changed his entire script so that the character of Hushpuppy matched her stubborn personality. At the age of nine, she became the youngest Best Actress nominee in Oscars history. (JS)418 Aleksei Kravchenko in Come and See (1985)Horrific war film Come and See – which depicts Nazism through a child’s eyes – is a nightmarish but essential experience, if only to witness the performance of Aleksei Kravchenko. It would have been tough for an actor of any age to film the scenes asked of him by director Elem Klimov let alone a 14-year old one, but Kravchenko commits so nobly it’s hard to tear your eyes from the screen. He found the shoot so troubling that he reportedly developed grey hair. (JS)518 Jean-Pierre Léaud in The 400 Blows (1959)Jean-Pierre Léaud was one of several hundred boys who François Truffaut auditioned for The 400 Blows and it’s easy to see why he won the role. In Truffaut, Léaud found a mentor –  he took control of the 15-year-old\u0027s upbringing when shooting ended after he was expelled from school and kicked out of his carers’ home – and Léaud would return as the character five more times. (JS)618 Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone (1990)Considering he starts Home Alone as an obnoxious “little jerk”, it’s a testament to Macaulay Culkin’s skill that Kevin McCallister manages to worm his way into viewers’ hearts . Culkin has insane amounts of fun ruling the roost when his family accidentally forget to bring him on their Christmas holiday, and it never fails to be a gleeful experience watching Kevin runs rings around bumbling burglars Harry (Daniel Stern) and Marv (Joe Pesci). (JS)718 Abigail Breslin in Little Miss Sunshine (2006)Breslin became one of the youngest Oscar nominees of all time when she received a nod for Best Supporting Actress for her performance, aged 10, as Olive Hoover in the beloved 2006 road movie. She played an underdog youngster on a mission to win a beauty contest, accompanied by her quirky and dysfunctional family, with real wit and flair. (EH)818 Alex Hibbert in Moonlight (2016)Giving a performance in perfect symmetry to the film around him, Alex Hibbert is one of a number of brilliantly subtle actors in Moonlight. Only on screen for the film’s first third, he mostly inhabits a quiet and devastating yearning, embodying a character buried under the emotional weight of playground bullying and constant domestic upheaval, and desperate for someone to show him compassion and answer his questions. If Hollywood has any sense, Moonlight will be just the first of many incredible opportunities for the young star. (AW)918 Mara Wilson in Mrs Doubtfire (1993)Mara Wilson is one of those great child star success stories, immortalised in at least three classic movies while still in single-digits, retiring early, and now writing, podcasting and saying smart, funny things on Twitter. But while 1996’s Matilda is often talked about as her best work, she was somehow even more brilliant in Mrs Doubtfire three years earlier, where she is adorable and grouchy and seems to possess a beautifully sincere, if today bittersweet, joy over merely being in Robin Williams’s company. (AW)1018 Isabelle Fuhrman in Orphan (2009)Isabelle Fuhrman is scarily convincing in her role as Esther, the sickly-sweet orphan girl turned murderous dwarf asylum escapee. The sexual and violent nature of some scenes may be uncomfortable to watch, but there is no denying Fuhrman executes them perfectly. (MH)1118 Tatum O’Neal in Paper Moon (1973)Tatum O’Neal was, and still is, the youngest person to ever win an Oscar for her role as the sassy, smoking, swindling tomboy Addie in Paper Moon. Addie may or may not be the daughter of con man Moses, who is reluctantly saddled with the youngster before realising she can help him with his scams. Moses is played by O’Neal’s real-life father Ryan O’Neal, and there’s just no faking that kind of chemistry. (AP)1218 Lindsay Lohan in The Parent Trap (1998)Lohan was just 12 when she played identical twins Annie and Hallie in the 1998 classic. While the sisters were of course impossible to distinguish by their looks, their personalities and backgrounds could hardly have been more different: one was a well-to-do Londoner, the other a boisterous American tomboy. The young star impressed audiences with her ability to switch effortlessly and convincingly between the two. (EH)1318 Heather O’Rourke in Poltergeist (1982)Heather O’Rourke tragically died aged just 12 in 1988, but she will long be remembered as the ethereal blonde Carol Anne Freeling. Cast after a chance meeting with Steven Spielberg, she captivates the audience as a little girl who can communicate with “the other side” through the family television set. (MH)1418 Jacob Tremblay in Room (2015)Egregiously overlooked for an Oscar in 2016, Jacob Tremblay\u0027s performance in Room will pull out heartstrings you never knew you had. As Jack, a long-haired five-year-old who has been imprisoned in a garden shed all his life and is oblivious to the outside world, he not only raises the film\u0027s cute quotient, but also brings surprising depth. His is a turn of great maturity, one that scratches away at the fact that Jack has never had any male interaction. Brie Larson, who plays his mum, did win an Oscar for her role here. (PS)1518 Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense (1999)Haley Joel Osment’s performance as Cole Sear, a young boy tormented by his ability to see and talk to the dead, is so strong that he remains the most memorable part of the M Night Shyamalan film, despite a career-best turn from Bruce Willis and one of the most effective twists in cinema history. (JS)1618 River Phoenix in Stand by Me (1986)One of the few comforts to cling onto when thinking of River Phoenix’s tragic death aged 23 is that he was at least able to showcase his vast acting range before he died. The actor, whose brother is Joaquin Phoenix, played everything from tortured teenagers to tough adventurers and street hustlers. But perhaps his finest work came early, in 1986’s Stand by Me, when he played a sensitive pre-teen who masks insecurity and self-loathing beneath a veneer of macho posturing. It’s a staggering bit of acting from someone so young. (AW)1718 Hailee Steinfeld in True Grit (2010)It’s probably not true to say that Hailee Steinfeld is the only person who could have pulled off the role of the fearless Mattie Ross in the Coen brothers’ adaptation of Charles Portis novel True Grit – but from the moment she arrives in Fort Smith with plans to hunt down her father’s killer, she makes you feel like she is. How she didn\u0027t win Best Supporting Actress at the 2011 Oscars will remain a mystery. (JS)1818 Heather Matarazzo in Welcome to the Dollhouse (1995)Generally speaking, children acting in Todd Solondz movies need to have nerves of steel and far more self-confidence than average youngsters. But it takes a child of unusual gutsiness to enact the horrors inflicted upon poor Dawn Wiener in his 1995 film Welcome to the Dollhouse. A yearning, eager loner played to perfection by Heather Matarazzo, Dawn is the recipient of a level of casual cruelty that would feel fetishistic if it weren\u0027t so tragically true to life. When she was killed off before the credits in Solondz’s 2004 film Palindromes, the collective mourning it inspired in his fanbase was only a result of how powerfully Matarazzo’s performance lingered. (AW)118 Christina Ricci in The Addams Family (1991)In the 27 years since she was transferred to the big screen via Christina Ricci, Wednesday Addams has become less a character and more a mood, a religion and a lifestyle. Ricci’s deadpan performance is so gloriously apathetic and mean that she comfortably steals the show from her adult co-stars, and deservedly had her role beefed up for the film’s sequel.

While the sisters were of course impossible to distinguish by their looks, their personalities and backgrounds could hardly have been more different: one was a well-to-do Londoner, the other a boisterous American tomboy. The young star impressed audiences with her ability to switch effortlessly and convincingly between the two. (EH)1318 Heather O’Rourke in Poltergeist (1982)Heather O’Rourke tragically died aged just 12 in 1988, but she will long be remembered as the ethereal blonde Carol Anne Freeling. Cast after a chance meeting with Steven Spielberg, she captivates the audience as a little girl who can communicate with “the other side” through the family television set. (MH)1418 Jacob Tremblay in Room (2015)Egregiously overlooked for an Oscar in 2016, Jacob Tremblay\u0027s performance in Room will pull out heartstrings you never knew you had. As Jack, a long-haired five-year-old who has been imprisoned in a garden shed all his life and is oblivious to the outside world, he not only raises the film\u0027s cute quotient, but also brings surprising depth. His is a turn of great maturity, one that scratches away at the fact that Jack has never had any male interaction. Brie Larson, who plays his mum, did win an Oscar for her role here. (PS)1518 Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense (1999)Haley Joel Osment’s performance as Cole Sear, a young boy tormented by his ability to see and talk to the dead, is so strong that he remains the most memorable part of the M Night Shyamalan film, despite a career-best turn from Bruce Willis and one of the most effective twists in cinema history. (JS)1618 River Phoenix in Stand by Me (1986)One of the few comforts to cling onto when thinking of River Phoenix’s tragic death aged 23 is that he was at least able to showcase his vast acting range before he died. The actor, whose brother is Joaquin Phoenix, played everything from tortured teenagers to tough adventurers and street hustlers. But perhaps his finest work came early, in 1986’s Stand by Me, when he played a sensitive pre-teen who masks insecurity and self-loathing beneath a veneer of macho posturing. It’s a staggering bit of acting from someone so young. (AW)1718 Hailee Steinfeld in True Grit (2010)It’s probably not true to say that Hailee Steinfeld is the only person who could have pulled off the role of the fearless Mattie Ross in the Coen brothers’ adaptation of Charles Portis novel True Grit – but from the moment she arrives in Fort Smith with plans to hunt down her father’s killer, she makes you feel like she is. How she didn\u0027t win Best Supporting Actress at the 2011 Oscars will remain a mystery. (JS)1818 Heather Matarazzo in Welcome to the Dollhouse (1995)Generally speaking, children acting in Todd Solondz movies need to have nerves of steel and far more self-confidence than average youngsters. But it takes a child of unusual gutsiness to enact the horrors inflicted upon poor Dawn Wiener in his 1995 film Welcome to the Dollhouse. A yearning, eager loner played to perfection by Heather Matarazzo, Dawn is the recipient of a level of casual cruelty that would feel fetishistic if it weren\u0027t so tragically true to life. When she was killed off before the credits in Solondz’s 2004 film Palindromes, the collective mourning it inspired in his fanbase was only a result of how powerfully Matarazzo’s performance lingered.

But despite her long comic book history, a number of iniduals have taken to Disney’s official Instagram to complain about the series, which was announced yesterday, and what they have interpreted as merely a gender-switched version of The Hulk.Created with Sketch.Marvel films – ranked worst to best Show all 23Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

Another added: “You can tell by the comments which people have never picked up a comic book in their lives.” On Twitter, one person wrote in response to the criticism: “Ah yes, because women were only created in 2019.”The forthcoming She-Hulk series will mark the character’s first appearance in live-action. She has previously appeared on numerous animated Marvel series and in video games, however, voiced by actors including Eliza Dushku and Katee Sackhoff.A She-Hulk film that would have starred Brigitte Nielsen was announced in 1990 but never materialised.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Dame Caroline Spelman, the Tory former cabinet minister who led opposition to no deal under Theresa May, said she wasn’t interested and she supported Boris Johnson’s approach.\u0026nbspNick Boles, the former Tory MP now sitting as an independent, said he couldn’t be there but urged Corbyn to focus his efforts on legislation rather than a confidence vote.\u0026nbspAnd that seems to be what a group of ministers who recently left the government are doing. Philip Hammond, Greg Clarke, David Gauke and Rory Stewart are said to be using their contacts to discuss with European leaders the length and terms of any Brexit extension.\u0026nbspThis is significant because, if the EU is prepared to grant a further extension, the most certain way of making it happen would be for the terms to be set out in advance of the EU summit on 17 October. Johnson could then be instructed by an act of parliament to accept the terms offered.\u0026nbspIt would be difficult to pass such an act against the wishes of the government, but Yvette Cooper, the Labour former cabinet minister, showed that it was possible in April, when she passed a law requiring Theresa May to seek an extension.\u0026nbspJohnson may \u0027declare no confidence in himself\u0027 to force no-deal BrexitThe weakness of that act was that it could not require the prime minister to agree to an extension, because the EU had not decided at that stage how long it would be. Hence the importance of early agreement among EU leaders on the terms.\u0026nbspAs things stand, this legislative route looks as if it is a surer way of blocking a no-deal Brexit than the idea of replacing Johnson with a caretaker prime minister. That plan involves opponents of no deal agreeing on a temporary prime minister who would negotiate an extension and preside over a general election.\u0026nbspSo far, MPs have been unable to agree who that temporary prime minister should be. Corbyn said it should be him, while Jo Swinson, the new leader of the Liberal Democrats, said it should be Ken Clarke or Harriet Harman. Last week, Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, wrote to Corbyn saying she was prepared to support him, but “if he cannot gain the support of a sufficient number of colleagues across parliament, I hope he will be prepared to back another MP from his party, or another, who can”.\u0026nbspEven if opponents of no deal can unite behind a single candidate, however, it will be hard to muster the votes needed to force Johnson out of office. Several Tory MPs who are strongly opposed to no deal say they will not go as far as to vote for a motion of no confidence in Johnson’s government.\u0026nbspHence the intense discussions about the alternative plan of backbench legislation to block a no-deal Brexit. But, as Nick Boles says, this will take time, and, if MPs opposed to no deal are serious, they cannot afford to wait until October.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Clark Mindock reports from IowaClick to followThe Independent USWith the UK facing an uncertain future as Boris Johnson marches the country towards a no-deal Brexit, American farmers can’t help but see something of a golden opportunity to bring their goods into a new market.While many US farmers have historically been turned away from trading with the UK over fears for the implications of practices such as washing chickens in chlorine, or the use of genetically modified crops, Britain’s impending exit from the EU has left some dreaming of a change to that situation.On a blistering summer day in Iowa, the idea is hard to avoid for farmers such as Leon Sheets, a pork producer from the northeast of the state who also maintains 600 acres of row crops.“Hey, let’s have the conversation. Let’s work out a deal,” Sheets says, emulating the kind of language one might expect from Donald Trump.When prodded further, Sheets acknowledges\u0026nbspthat he hopes to see a post-Brexit trade deal that would allow for the introduction of products that have previously been off the table: “That’s what the goal is – no restrictions, so products can move freely back and forth.”It is an issue that has received backing from prominent American farming executives, even if some lip service has been given to having “a conversation” about the US food standards that have worried some in the UK.Currently farming exports to Britain – including wine, nuts and fruit – are worth only about $1.8bn (£1.47bn), a fraction of the total overall sales of $133bn. That means there is potentially massive room for growth, under the right circumstances.With the US saying that the UK will be “first in line” for a trade deal following Brexit, Zippy Duvall, the head of the American Farm Bureau, recently said that they are eagerly watching for ways to begin a trade partnership – but that Britain had to accept US standards.PM warned US trade deal ‘highly unlikely’ if Ireland has hard borderGovernment finally hands firms customs numbers for post-Brexit tradeTrump vows to continue China trade war even if recession hits USAs Britain seeks new trade deals, can we learn a lesson from Poldark?UK told to accept US food standards in any trade deal“You know, here in America we treat our water with chlorine,” Duvall, a poultry farmer himself, told the BBC.He claimed it was not a public health issue, saying: “So there is no scientific basis that says that washing poultry with chlorine wash just to be safe of whatever pathogens might be on that chicken as it was prepared for the market should be taken away. If there was something wrong with it our federal inspection systems would not be allowing us to use that.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailChlorine-washed chicken was banned by the European Union in 1997, which virtually stopped all exports from the United States of US chicken meat, which is often treated with the antimicrobial wash.The wash itself, though, is not the issue.US farmers say Trump’s trade war is hurting, but they still back himThe EU’s Food Safety Authority said in 2005 that “exposure to chlorite residues arising from treated poultry carcasses would be of no safety concern”. Chlorine-washed bagged salads are sold in the UK and other countries in the EU, for instance.But what is of concern is that relying on chlorine washes – which proponents say makes harmful bacteria virtually undetectable – at the end of the process allows farmers to keep unsanitary conditions for the chickens earlier on. And the wash could allow for crowded abattoirs where disease could theoretically spread with greater ease.While it is tricky to compare the rates of food-borne illnesses between two countries, two separate studies would suggest that the US experiences higher rates of salmonella infection. One British government study from 2014 found that there were roughly 55 salmonella infections per 100,000 people, when analysing 2009 data. A separate study of the US found a rate of 350 infections per 100,000 people, using data from 2002-08.When it comes to deaths, the US also reports higher numbers. While the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention reports around 380 deaths a year due to food-borne salmonella, England and Wales had zero such deaths between 2006 and 2015, according to the most recently available data from Public Health England.Gail Soutar, the chief European Union exit and international trade adviser for the National Farmers Union (NFU), says there was a considerable level of anxiety that a hasty and chaotic Brexit could leave UK farmers competing against a flood of international goods coming in, and undermining their prices.Soutar says she is particularly concerned at the prospect of a no-deal outcome, and the impact that subsequently high tariffs on UK agricultural products could have. Farmers, she worries, could be threatened by a flood of new goods being brought in from the US, which could undermine efforts to honour European Union standards – with the EU, for now, a much larger trading partner than the US.“There is a concern that we are going to see an increase of imports coming into the UK under a no-deal situation,” she says. “It remains absolutely key that we get a deal with the EU.”UK politicians have at least paid lip service to the notion that standards will not be abandoned in pursuit of a deal, with former environment secretary Michael Gove telling an NFU conference in\u0026nbspFebruary that they would not abandon those requirements “in pursuit of trade deals”.But thousands of miles away in Iowa, the outcome of negotiations between the UK and EU are understandably less of a concern for farmers. Whereas UK farmers may be feeling some anxiety, American farmers are clearly sensing opportunity.Bill Tenneger, a pig producer in northwest Iowa, says\u0026nbspDonald Trump’s trade war with China had been hurting farmers like him, but he thinks Mr Trump could potentially capitalise on a weak negotiating position following Brexit.But he adds\u0026nbsphe hopes\u0026nbspit would help British people out too: “I think trade agreements are good. Hey, it’s a small world. We’ve all got to get along in the world. I’ve travelled all over the world representing the pork industry.“In the end, I don’t care what culture you go to or you get embedded in, they all just want to feed their families and support their families and have the government leave them alone.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The two men were seen walking together a year after Epstein had been convicted.There are allegations — strongly denied by Buckingham Palace — that Andrew was more directly involved in Epstein’s sordid shenanigans.most read in opinion\" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTHE SUN SAYS Remainers have no right to complain now that the tables have turned \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTREVOR KAVANAGH BoJo cannot risk being side-tracked and humiliated by bullying Brussels \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   TM-comp-Tony-Parson-.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTONY PARSONS Be the Duchess of Woke or jet-setter, Meghan, but you cant be both \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   tp-composite-Brendan-ONeill.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentBRENDAN ONEILL Why so glum for those on Planet Remain  Were loving it on Planet Brexit \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   DD-COMP-IRA.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentLEO MCKINSTRY The Troubles could come back with a vengeance as New IRA rears its ugly head What cannot be denied is Andrew’s close friendship with the vile but powerful man.Remaining Epstein’s bosom buddy after he had been convicted certainly shows bad judgment.But then parts of Andy’s career as a royal have involved bad judgment.He apparently enjoys the retinue of rich and famous tossers who gather around him, no doubt anxious to be associated with the British crown.And he doesn’t seem to care very much how awful some of them are.This is shaping up to be a bad year for the Royal Family.Prince Andrew, never hugely adored by the public, could be a source of grave embarrassment to them.The public is also tiring of Harry and Meghan’s relentless political preaching, whining and hypocrisy. The private jets to climate change summits. The gobsmackingly expensive renovations to their house with wallpaper made of organic kale and goji berries, or something.It was reported this week that the Royal Family’s bill for travel and security has almost doubled since . Much of that is probably Meghan.But I think people are also weary of William seemingly talking about depression every time he opens his mouth.Hell, you’re depressed, Wills  Howja think the rest of us feel I’ve always been marginally in favour of having a royal family.But that’s contingent upon who that royal family actually is. And how they behave.The Queen and Prince Philhave been models of decency and duty. They keep a certain distance from the public and that is perhaps why they are so adored.To her immense credit, Princess Anne has followed that blueprint. She doesn’t emote for the media and lecture us.My worry is that the newer generation of royals will turn the British public against the Windsors. In Andrew’s case, befriending a scumbag has brought disgrace upon him and the family firm.With Harry and Meghan and William, it’s a case of trying to be too modern and thus losing sight of what it means to be a member of the Royal Family.Keep on this track and we won’t have a royal family for very much longer.A FADING reality star called Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace has had a mega boob implant. She went for the maximum allowed in the UK – ml.As you can imagine, they look pretty ridiculous. She has a way to go, though, to beat doolally German model Martina Big whose baps check in at  litres.And indeed Lacey Wildd, whose  breasts weigh more than lbs each and actually glow in the dark.Maybe Aisleyne could next buy some jubblies that do magic tricks or something.IT’S not often this column comes to the defence of Gary Lineker.Truth be told, I’m a little bit weary of the jug-eared, virtue-signalling, overpaid, crisp-flogging dimbo.But he’s in trouble for having made a joke – not a funny joke, obvs – about his co-presenters being bald. That’s Alan Shearer and Danny Murphy.Cue outrage from the follically challenged members of the public.It is now almost impossible to make a joke about anything without someone wetting the bed and writing a letter of ­complaint.How did we get so thin-skinned in this country Lower the tone  Always happy to oblige.Stop bullying people, you third world dog-munching commies.THE Queen’s pharmacist, Ainsworths, is selling homeopathic remedies.These are remedies which do not work.Homeopathy is a charlatan movement in denial of science.One of the remedies sold is “Berlin Wall”. This claims to have the spirit of the Berlin Wall in it.And the homeopaths suggest it might be good for healing relationships.I used to think homeopathy should be banned outright.But now I think – hell,you’re dumb enough to believe that rubbish, good luck to you.BORIS Johnson is stamping around Europe demanding the EU scrap the ridiculous Northern Ireland backstop.He’s absolutely right to do so.If only this had been done three years ago, we’d have a decent deal and be free of the EU by now.But time is short. And the EU knows that Boris still doesn’t have a majority in parliament to push No Deal through, no matter what he says.So they will be less likely to agree to concessions.It just makes you weep at three wasted years.When we were led by a Prime Minister who didn’t think we SHOULD leave the EU.And caved in on every issue.Just two thirds  What kind of drugs are the other third on  Horse tranquillisers and crack Jeremy Corbyn wouldn’t make a very good caretaker of a carpet warehouse, never mind PM.THEY’RE trying to improve the look of Sunderland. No easy task, you might think.And so the city’s Business Improvement District has put out a notice politely asking residents to stop pooing in the streets.Apparently it’s all the rage up there.The BID people said: “Disappointingly we’ve seen an increase in people thinking it is absolutely acceptable to defecate or urinate in public in our city centre. This will not be tolerated.”I think they’re being a bit heavy-handed. Maybe as a compromise measure they should just hand out little black poo bags to everybody.Then the locals can go about their business in front of, say, Greggs, and scoop it up immediately and put it in a bin.You Mackems, huh.

which s on Sunday - kicked off, the real Peaky Blinders had actually disbanded, and other, more sinister gangsters were running Britains criminal underworld.After decades of vicious battles over gambling and turf boundaries, the Blinders lost control of their patch to the Birmingham Boys, led by Billy Kimber – portrayed in the series by Charlie Creed Miles.And across the rest of the UK, other criminal gangs were establishing themselves in all other major cities - as employment and poverty after the industrial revolution left city dwellers forced to turn to violent crime.One of these was London’s Forty Elephants – an all female gang who struck as much fear into the hearts of the cities as their male counterparts with their violent criminal tactics.Like the Peaky Blinders – who wore tailored suits with bell-bottom trousers and button jackets, leather steel-toed boots, silk scarves and starched collars – most gangs had dress codes which made them instantly recognisable to rivals and terried victims alike.Each had dferent violent tactics, from the Liverpool gangs who beat people with belts in the middle of the street to gangsters who carved a V into the faces of their victims.Here we look at the major gangs that controlled the UK’s criminal underworld in the first decades of the th century – and their vicious battles over each territory.Turf: LondonLeader: Annie DiamondEnemies: The Sabini FamilyCriminal tactics: Shoplting, smash and grab and blackmailWhile many of the criminal gangs had women who helped them carry out their crimes, the Forty Elephants, also known as the Forty Thieves, were an all-female group who ran their own crime syndicate.Working alongside the Elephant and Castle Gang, they were first mentioned in print in , and specialised in shoplting and smash and grab raids on West End stores including Whiteley’s and Selfridges.Their method was to turn up in a large group, wearing specially tailored coats, cummerbunds, muffs, skirts, bloomers and hats sewn with hidden pockets, pour into the stores and plunder thousands in a matter of minutes – frequently making their getaway in high-powered cars or limos.They became so notorious that shoppers fled as soon as they saw them arrive.Leader Diamond Annie – born Alice Diamond – lived up to her name by wearing a fistful of stolen gemstones in rings on her hands, which she was not afraid to use as a knuckleduster.As violent and territorial as their male counterparts, they even hid razors in their corsages.They used their charms to seduce men – and then blackmailed them for cash.In the s,the gang threw lavish parties and aspired to live like the flappers and film stars of the day.When Annie was arrested and jailed in  after a violent brawl in Lambeth, fellow gangster Lillian Rose Kendall – dubbed the Bob-haired Bandit by police – took over.Turf: Birmingham, Leeds, The Midlands and LondonLeader: Billy KimberEnemies: Peaky Blinders, Sabini FamilyCriminal tactics: Razors, hammers, hatchets and bricksThe Peaky Blinders sprung up in the s as a street gang led by Thomas Gilbert – also known as Kevin Mooney - with members aged between  and  who used violence to take over patches of land.By the s, they had branched out into extortion, bribery, smuggling, hijacking and robbery as well as running gambling syndicates.At the time, the only legal gambling in the UK was at the racecourses – which raked in a £m a year from bets -  but when the Blinders attempted to grab a slice of the pie in , they bit off more than they could chew.According to historian Professor Carl Chinn, rival gang the Birmingham Boys – AKA the Brummagem Boys – were already working the course as a “loose collection of pick-pockets, racecourse thieves and pests who were gaining a lot of power.”Led by -year-old Billy Kimber – who had already served two prison sentences for wounding and assaulting a police officer – the gang launched a violent backlash against the Peaky Blinders.Over the next decade, the Peaky Blinders gradually lost their hold over Birmingham and, frightened, their families began to disperse into the surrounding country.With Birmingham under his spell, Billy expanded his operations to Uttoxeter and Leeds, and throughout the Midlands and the North.But he wanted more – and soon turned his attention to London and the racetracks of the South East.With several gangs operating in the capital already, Kimber formed alliances with smaller gangs, including the Elephant and Castle Gang – led by notorious gangster Charles ‘Wag McDonald.Kimber began to prey on the Jewish bookies of the East End, who turned to rival family the Sabini family – and war broke out.Turf: London and the South EastLeader: Charles Darby SabiniEnemies: The Birmingham Boys, The Elephant and Castle Gang, Cortesi BrothersCriminal tactics: Razors, beatings, hitmen from SicilyPlayed in Peaky Blinders by Noah Taylor, Charles ‘Darby’ Sabini and his four brothers – Harry, George, Joe and Fred - were born in London’s Little Italy.Darby established his reputation as a hard man after knocking out the enforcer of another South London gang in a pub brawl in the East End, and went on to run bookies protection rackets, earning the nickname the “King of the Racecourse Gangs.”His Clerkenwell operation also ran several nightclubs and he had a network of corrupt judges, politicians and police chiefs in his pocket.At its peak, the gang had  members and, although notorious for razor attacks, Sabini also imported Sicilian gunmen to carry out hits on his enemies.In March , the Birmingham boys ambushed Sabini at Greenford Trotting Park.A few days later Billy Kimber went to Sabini’s house in King’s Cross where he was shot and beaten by notorious Jewish hitman Alfie Solomon -played by Tom Hardy in the BBC drama.Solomon was tried for attempted murder but charges were dropped when all witnesses mysteriously “lost their memory” about the attack.The violence escalated into the event that would prove the downfall of the Birmingham Boys – the battle of Epsom Road.On June , , after the Epsom races that day, the Birmingham Boys ambushed a charabanc containing bookmakers from Leeds, ramming it with a taxi.The gang attacked the passengers with hammers, hatchets, bottles and bricks, hospitalising six with head wounds. Of the  gang members arrested,  were jailed, and Billy Kimber’s reign as king of the underworld was over.Billy fled to the US, where he was shielded by the US Mafia, later ing to the UK and working as a bookie himself.Turf: LondonLeader: Augustus Gus CortesiEnemies: The Sabini FamilyCriminal tactics: Knives and gunsWith Billy gone, the Sabinis faced a new challenge from rival Italians ,the Cortesi Brothers.In November ,  Darby and brother Harry met Gus and Paul in a London club, supposedly for peace talks.When tempers boiled over, Paul Cortesi threw a hot cup of coffee in Harrys face and Gus tried to shoot Darby, failing when the club secretarys daughter knocked the gun away.In the following battle, Harry was shot in the stomach and Darby was knocked unconscious with a bottle. The Cortesi brothers were jailed for three years for attempted murder.At the outbreak of the Second World War, Sabini was arrested and jailed as an enemy alien but by then there was a new guy in town.Billy Hill had made his mark in the s with a new brand of violence - marking his enemies with a V for Victim, slashed into their face - and had become the King of the London criminal underworld.The notorious villain, who netted £, in a  postal van robbery, was to inspire a new generation of gangsters, including the Kray Twins.Turf: Sheffield Leaders: George MooneyEnemies: The Parkhill BrigadeCriminal tactics: Street attacks, razors, knives and bricksA popular gambling scam at the turn of the century, was pitch and toss – a simple game where three coins were tossed in the air with punters betting on the number of heads and tails.In Sheffield, gang members would wait outside factory gates on payday to fleece the workers of their hard-earned cash, making an average of £ to £ a day.A prime location for the illegal gambling was Sky Ridge, overlooking the slums of the Park district, which provided a great lookout so gangs could pack up and run should the police show up.Up to , the site was controlled by the notorious Mooney gang, led by George Mooney, and his number two Sam Garvin.But when unemployment rose in the s, profits fell and Garvin broke away to form the rival Park Brigade – sparking a turf war which terrorised the poverty-stricken neighbourhood with tit-for-tat attacks.Street and pub brawls using razors, guns, knives and bricks were an everyday occurrence and even innocent bystanders were not safe.On April   William Plommer, a local man who waded in to a fistfight involving one of Garvin’s followers, was fatally stabbed outside his home in Norfolk Bridge.Sheffield’s Chief Constable John Hall-Dalwood decided to face violence with violence, launching a “Flying Squad” to go out into the streets of Park to stamp out the gangs once and for all.In July that year, the brothers Wilfred and Lawrence Fowler were convicted of Plommer’s murder and sentenced to death at West Riding Assizes in Leeds. They were hanged two months later.Turf: ManchesterLeaders: VariousEnemies: Rival street gangsCriminal tactics: Brass-buckled belt attacksAt the turn of the th Century, violent gangs known as Scuttlers sprang up around Manchester.Described by iNews as the “first youth cult”, the violent gangs of young men cut their hair into distinctive short cuts, wore clogs and bell-bottom trousers, with silk scarves in gang colours.But the heavy leather belts with huge brass buckles were more than a sartorial statement – they were a weapon, used to seriously injure and maim rivals in planned attacks.Gangs were named after the streets they came from -  the most feared being the Bengal Tigers from Bengal Street and the Meadow Lads from Angel Meadow – and the street brawls were dubbed “scuttling”Prison proved little deterrent with one report stating: “their conduct in the dock at the police court was most flippant and callous… the youths laughed and turned round to wink at friends in the gallery.”In , there were more youths in Strangeways for “scuttling” than any other offence.Turf: LiverpoolLeader: UnknownEnemies: The Logwood GangCriminal tactics: Attacking dockers with knives and beating with beltsIn the th century, much of Liverpool’s wealth depended on the docks - and so did a lot of its criminal activity.The most feared of the city’s gangs the High Rip Gang - named after the long knives they called High Rippers - who became infamous after a Spanish sailor was brutally beaten and stabbed to death in , in a botched mugging.Like the Blinders, they were smart dressers, wearing tight-fitting, bell bottoms and a Bucko hat – a flat cap gathered at the top – set at a jaunty angle with a quf of hair poking out.The gang became known for extreme and random violence, vicious robberies and brutal revenge attacks against rival gangs.They targeted dock workers and on their way home from work, viciously beating them to steal their wages, and locals lived in terror.They were deadly rivals with the Logwood Gang, named after the short lumps of wood they used to beat victims.After a string of murders in Liverpool, several members were executed. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris will need to move quickly to show that alternative arrangements are possible — and he’ll need Whitehall to be on his side, too.But Varadkar’s performance over the past three years doesn’t fill us with much confidence. The Irish PM hasn’t missed an opportunity to tear into his country’s biggest trading partner.A man who has never seen a microphone he didn’t like, he’s rubbished every suggestion of compromise and has failed at every turn to be a constructive partner.Ironically, it’s his inflexible attitude towards the UK that has made no deal more likely. It’s blindingly obvious that the Withdrawal Agreement as it stands is well into dead parrot territory. If Varadkar continues to insist that it’s the only deal possible, what does he think will happen We remain sceptical that the EU really has seen the light, and that they’ll finally — after three long years — negotiate in good faith.In the coming month we can still see things going pear-shaped. In which case we’ll leave with a clean break and, finally, our Government will have actually delivered on the Referendum result.It might be bumpy. But it’s what we voted for.THAT as many as  kids could be involved in drug-dealing at a school is mind-boggling.What on earth is going on  How did teachers not notice  Was anybody in social services even awake It’s a complete failure at every level. Thank goodness cops finally took action. The question now is how many other schools have the same problem Crime has crept into seemingly every corner of society.It’s a result of the police taking their eye off the ball — messing around on social media but barely raising a finger for burglaries and muggings.The Home Secretary must give the police what they need. And leave them with no excuses.GOOD for the kids rising to the challenge of tougher GCSEs.Take the brilliant Michaela School in North London. Most of the kids are from disadvantaged backgrounds. But rather than succumbing to the bigotry of low expectations, the teachers challenged the kids — and they delivered.Well done to them, and everybody .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A disaster. A “catastrophic ­national danger”, according to the feverish .They say Britain is on a “clf edge”. If we leave without a deal it will be a “car crash”.It will bring the “hardship of war” raining down upon us, says one Brexitphobic columnist. These people seem to live in a permanent state of dread.They’re forever fantasising about a desolate post-Brexit world in which there will be “riots, looting and disorder”as zombied Brits fight each other for scraps of food and bottles of medicine.The rest of us, however, have a rather dferent take on No Deal. Across the country, far from the political bubbles and ivory towers inhabited by these anti-Brexit hysterics, people are far more chilled out about the prospect of No Deal.You hear it in everyday ­conversations: “If the EU won’t give us a good deal, let’s leave without one.”You see it on Question Time when the audience applauds a list who says we should walk away from the EUit keeps messing us about. And you see it in opinion polls, too.Much to the horror of the Brexit-bashing elites, polls show that ordinary people do not think No Deal will be the end of the world as we know it.A recent Opinium poll asked people what we should doBoris Johnson fails to wring concessions from the EU and to change the Withdrawal Agreement to make it more palatable to MPs.A whopping  per cent said we should go ahead with Brexit on October  — Boris’s ­promised exit day — evenwe don’t have a deal.Just  per cent said we should cancel Brexit altogether and  per cent said we should continue with negotiations.This echoes a YouGov poll from a few months ago. It asked what we should dothe EU refused to grant an extension to talks on the exit deal.Forty-four per cent said we should say adios without a deal. Forty-two per cent said we should revoke Brexit and stay bound to Brussels.This is all incredibly revealing. No, it does not suggest millions of us are reckless and crazy and hell-bent on jumping off the “clf edge”.Most Brits, including Boris himself, would prefer to leave with a deal,a good one can be struck.No, what the polls show is that there is only so much baloney from the EU that we are willing to take.If Eurocrats carry on behaving stubbornly and arrogantly by refusing to reopen talks about the Withdrawal Agreement, then we should show some self-respect and walk away — that is what people are saying.This captures one of the key ides between the elites and ordinary people today. The political and media classes dread No Deal because they have lost faith in Britain.They view the UK as a tiny, pathetic island that could never possibly cope outside of the EU.They think we need to be looked after by the apparently caring, maternal figure of the Brussels bureaucracy. Andwe do the political equivalent of cutting the apron strings, we will be doomed, apparently.In the rest of the country, meanwhile, people have far more faith in the nation.They believe we are more than capable of being a sovereign, independent country that strikes its own trade deals and writes its own laws.They see the country not as a useless little island, but as a plucky, resourceful nation that should reach out to the world without being beholden to any of it.The ide over No Deal reveals how much disagreement there is between the political elites and the people today.It is hard to remember a time when the chasm between Us and Them was as wide as it is right now.The th Century Prime ­Minister Benjamin Disraeli once said the UK feels like “two nations”. In one nation there are the posh and well-educated, and in the other there are ­ordinary working people.These “two nations” have entirely dferent “habits, thoughts, and feelings”, he wrote. It is asthey are “inhabitants of dferent planets”.It feels like that again today. On the planet of the Remainer elites, No Deal will be terrible, Boris is the worst PM ever, and anyone who ­disagrees is probably a racist.But on the planet inhabited by the rest of us, No Deal will be fine. And support for the Boris-led Conservative Party is rising. Surging, in fact.The latest Britain Elects ­opinion poll shows that  per cent of us would vote for the Tories, compared with just  per cent for Labour.But their shrill cries make no impact on our planet. In our more sane world, we still want Brexit to happen and we think Britain is a good, decent, capable country.The elites should come over to our planet. It’s a far happier place.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

During the time I knew him, I saw him infrequently and probably no more than only once or twice a year. I have stayed in a number of his residences.At no stage during the limited time I spent with him did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction.Disgraced financier Epstein, , hanged himself in his New York jail cell on August  amid a string of multi-million dollar lawsuits brought by some of his alleged victims.Andrew was notoriously photographed with his arm around Epstein’s alleged “sex slave” Virginia Roberts, now Virginia Giuffre, when she was .But he has denied sleeping with her and declared himself “appalled” by reports of his former friend’s “alleged crimes”.Ms Giuffres claims against Andrew were struck from a court case in .The judge ruled they were “immaterial and impertinent”.Andrew today reiterated it was a mistake seeing Epstein after his release from an -month prison term in  for prostituting minors.He was pictured with the financier in Central Park, New York, at the time and footage has since emerged of him at Epsteins home in the city in the same year.His statement continued: I have said previously that it was a mistake and an error to see him after his release in  and I can only reiterate my regret that I was mistaken to think that what I thought I knew of him was evidently not the real person, given what we now know.I have tremendous sympathy for all those affected by his actions and behaviour.His suicide has left many unanswered questions and I acknowledge and sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.This is a dficult time for everyone involved and I am at a loss to be able to understand or explain Mr Epsteins lestyle. I deplore the exploitation of any human being and would not condone, participate in, or encourage any such behaviour.Epsteins inquiry is now focusing on several alleged co-conspirators, believed to include Ghislaine Maxwell, , the daughter of disgraced newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell.At least five women who say they were abused by Epstein have filed lawsuits against his £million estate after the paedo killed himself.All said Epstein used a “vast enterprise” of associates to recruit them, subject them to unwanted sex acts and keep them under his control.He was arrested on July  over claims he was involved in the sex-trafficking of dozens of girls as young as  from at least  until .Epstein had denied the charges and was being held in prison until his trial where he was facing up to  years in prisonconvicted.Andrew is on holiday in Spain with ex-we Sarah Ferguson, , as Buckingham Palace fights to clear his name amid revelations that have surfaced since Epstein’s death.His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/CM-COMPOSITE-CAR-MUZZ.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=300\u0026amp;h=192\u0026amp;crop=1\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"rail__item-content\"\u003e\u003ch3 class=\"rail__item-headline t-p-color\"\u003eCAPITAL PUNISHMENT\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cspan class=\"rail__item-sub\"\u003e £80k Porsche painted with \u0026#x27;show off\u0026#x27; as supercar season hits London \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"rail__item-cutoff\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ca href=\"/news/97960","title":"britain families london council homes westminster","story":"Hugh Grosvenor, , the Duke of Westminster, is the worlds richest person under the age of  after he inherited £.billion and his fathers title after dying three years ago.His property group Grosvenor aims to demolish Walden House, in Belgravia, London and erect luxury flats, shops and social housing by .The building is currently leased to Westminster Council and  people, including eight who are disabled, have been told to leave, the Mirror reports.Some of the residents, who currently pay £ for a month for a two-bed council flat, have lived in the building for  years.They have been told they can apply for new homes up to  miles away, but many still fear they wont be able to stay in the area.Liza Begum, , who works as an NHS PA, has been at Walden House all her le, said: Its social cleansing.She claims residents were told in March about the plans, seven years after private tenants in neighbouring flats were told.A petition against the Dukes plans has reached more than , signatures.It claims residents are now facing facing homelessness and the break up of our community.It explains: Grosvenor are now cancelling Walden Houses lease, which has historically been for council housing provision, and plan to demolish the building.The Cundy Street flats are a mixture of affordable and market rent accommodation next to Walden House.Many of the residents are elderly and have lived in the area their whole lives.

I deplore the exploitation of any human being and would not condone, participate in, or encourage any such behaviour.Epsteins inquiry is now focusing on several alleged co-conspirators, believed to include Ghislaine Maxwell, , the daughter of disgraced newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell.At least five women who say they were abused by Epstein have filed lawsuits against his £million estate after the paedo killed himself.All said Epstein used a “vast enterprise” of associates to recruit them, subject them to unwanted sex acts and keep them under his control.He was arrested on July  over claims he was involved in the sex-trafficking of dozens of girls as young as  from at least  until .Epstein had denied the charges and was being held in prison until his trial where he was facing up to  years in prisonconvicted.Andrew is on holiday in Spain with ex-we Sarah Ferguson, , as Buckingham Palace fights to clear his name amid revelations that have surfaced since Epstein’s death.A previous Buckingham Palace statement said: The Duke of York has been appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epsteins alleged crimes.The Sun Online contacted Buckingham Palace for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"cricket ashes boozing britain pubs","story":"However the scorching heat, a bumper line-up of sport and the extra-long weekend meant many  sessions were in full swing long before Ben Stokes winning shot.The three-day weekend saw record numbers head straight from pubs to clubs for boozy nights out all across Britain. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She had spent the day in Washington on a fruitless quest to interview former Vice President Spiro Agnew. It was part of a one-month tryout with an American weekly newspaper that paid her extraordinarily well - far more than her usual newspaper could afford thanks to the country’s current economic crisis. Sandy had no plans for the evening and was nervous at the prospect of drinking alone in the South. Atlanta wasn’t London, where the pubs in Soho were so familiar to her they ed as a second home. As she wrote a few years later, years of pulling in pubs and clubs had taught her that, despite being a bit broad in the beam and not exactly a raving beauty, she had a magnetism that drew men asto a pile of iron filings. Sandy was single, in her mid-forties.She could travel, pursue flings with younger men — early to mid-twenties was the ideal range — drink heavily without a hangover and keep her primary focus on her work.  Sandy wasn’t alone at the Holiday Inn bar long. A young man she’d eyed earlier with some disdain for wearing a flowery tie to match his shirt walked towards her. Would you like to dance  he asked. Well, no, thank you She’d been thrown by his advance, but seeing the rejection cross his face, she blurted out: I have only just arrived in town and haven’t had a drink all day….I have to go to work. I am a journalist, you see. He replied: Will you be gone long  Will you come back  Are you staying here  Sandy wasn’t gone long.The Atlanta Constitution office proved disappointing.She came back, and the redheaded six-footer with a classically handsome face topped by hair the colour of scotch and water that complimented her own flaming red hair, was still in the bar when she ed. This time, she accepted his invitation to dance. He told her he was on his way to Miami. That’s funny, said Sandy, I’m going to West Palm Beach tomorrow. “You should let me drive you there,” said the man. “It only takes a day and you could see something of the country.” Sandy mulled over his suggestion. How  would she see America as it was, not the America constrained by tight deadlines and formal interviews  Plus, he seemed to be an experienced traveler. Earlier, the young man rattled off a list of cities and states visited - New Orleans, Houston, Dallas, Kentucky, St. Louis. Alabama. She decided to accept, on one condition. “I’m not going to bed with you. Oh, I know you haven’t asked, but it sure ain’t dficult to read your thoughts!” Besides, Sandy continued: “I don’t know anything about you, you could easily be another Boston Strangler for all I know!”  Both burst out laughing. Within hours, Sandy would take the younger man to bed, though the experience would prove underwhelming. “So you’re not really another Boston Strangler after all,” she said, after. “What a disappointment.” Days later, Sandy would learn how wrong she was, and what danger she’d been in the entire time. An experienced reporter Sandy had found success as a fashion editor and when she grew restless with greater ambition, joined the Daily Mail and the , where she moved into feature journalism. She was a lone woman among throngs of men, and felt it was necessary to outdrink, outlast, and outwit them. She was fun to be with. And that was before what happened in America in November . Sandy wondered why she had agreed to the man’s offer of a ride to West Palm Beach. He was attractive and young, yes. But the sex wasn’t all that great. His conversation revolved around recurring visions of a shortened leI don’t know when, but within a year I shall be dead.

Was any of it true, or was the man, who had finally given his name as Lester Daryl Golden, putting her on And why on earth was he determined that she write a book about him     Meanwhile, people kept dying with alarming speed. -year-old Alice Curtis, choked to death in her own home in Jacksonville, Florida.Mylette and Lillian Anderson, sisters aged just seven and  whose bodies were never found. A teenage girl whose name wasn’t known for decades. Marjorie Howie, , strangled with her nylon stocking, television set pilfered from her apartment. Women and girls, all dead between August  and , . The spree didn’t stop with those victims. Kathie Sue Pierce, strangled in her Musella, Georgia home on August  in front of her three-year-old son, who escaped harm. William Bates, picked up at a roadside pub in Lima, Ohio on September , his nude body not discovered for another month. By that time Emmett and Lois Johnson were found shot to death at an Ely, Nevada campsite on September  Charlynn Hicks, raped and strangled in Seguin, Texas and Ann Dawson, a beautician missing from Birmingham, Alabama as of September . Worse was still to come in October and November.Karen Wine and her -year-old daughter, Dawn, both raped in their Marlborough, Connecticut home on October , both strangled with a nylon stocking. Doris Hosey, , shot to death two days later in Woodford, Virginia.Edward Hilliard and Debbie Grfin, choosing the wrong car to hitchhike with on November , with him ending up murdered, and her body never recovered. Carswell Carr, befriended by his killer over drinks in Milledgeville, Georgia, only to be stabbed to death on November , after which his -year-old daughter, Mandy, died by strangulation. Sandy knew none of this. Not until she spied the front page of the local paper that Daryl purchased on November , the day they finally left Atlanta. A page devoted entirely to the recent spate of murders. But she wanted to get to Florida. She’d drunk too much the night before. She didn’t much care about Daryl’s assertion that he had friends in Macon, about  miles from Milledgeville. And she certainly didn’t recall saying to him in bed the night before that she didn’t think he was a “maxi-murderer at all, more your mini-murderer. That fleeting look of irritation  No, this was a joke best left alone. Once in West Palm Beach on November , Sandy did find Daryl useful. He drove her to the local office of the paper she was trying out with.He drove her to the house of Florida attorney general William Saxbe so she could conduct an interview, and waited in the car until she was finished. But the next day, after a heart-stopping near-loss of materials, as well as a more pressing looming deadline, Sandy knew it was over. The sex hadn’t been worth much to begin with, but now there was little point keeping on. “I hate saying [the words] but I’m going back to London on Saturday and I have a lot of work to do and people to see before I go.” But before they parted, she had to know - would Daryl tell her what was on the tapes  He would not.    “In that case I have to concentrate on my own business…but it’s been a marvellous week, Daryl, wonderful, truly like a holiday. However, le must take over again.” Couldn’t they spend just one more night together, asked Daryl. “No, darling. No.” Sandy was firm: “Goodbyes are horrible but they’re better over and done with.” She kissed him on the mouth one last time, and felt “free to come and go and please herself again. She spent that evening at a bar with some other American journalists, who teased her about ditching a clearly heartbroken Daryl. The next day, Sandy received an urgent message from West Palm Beach police detective sergeant Gabbard. When she arrived at the station, she thought perhaps Daryl had had an accident. When Gabbard askedshe knew of a Susan MacKenzie, Sandy said she did, vaguely.She was the we of one of the journalists she’d gone out drinking with the prior night. “Your friend attempted to rape her this morning.” Sandy, stunned, blurted out a response she would regret for the rest of her le: “Good God…and he wasn’t even a good poke!”After a beat of silence, she asked Gabbard to fill her in. “Mrs. MacKenzie says that when he was driving her to the hairdresser’s this morning when he pulled the car off the road and asked her to make love to him. When she refused he pulled a gun on her.”  Susan managed to get out of the car, despite Daryl grabbing her by the hair, and called police from a nearby pay phone.Despite being spotted by a squad car, Daryl had escaped, though police now knew the make and model of his car. By the time he was arrested on November , after a shootout involving multiple officers from several law enforcement agencies, helicopters, and dogs, Daryl had killed two more people. Florida Highway Patrol Trooper Charles Campbell, who’d failed in his own attempt at an arrest and ended up a hostage and James Meyer, kidnapped so that the man could swap a police car for a less obtrusive one. By the time the killer and the abducted duo reached a remote, wooded area in Pulaski, Georgia, the hostages’ fate was clear: both were handcuffed to a tree and shot to death. Over the next few days, Sandy learned the gruesome truth about her week-long lover -his real name was Paul John Knowles, and he was suspected in the deaths of at least  people. “Exactly a week ago I had been in his arms,” wrote Sandy.“How could I have made such a mistake  Then, like hot metal flooding my veins, came the memory of that first morning, the sense of evil in the room that had thrust me headlong to the door. Good God, I had known.” Knowles was well-acquainted with Florida’s foster homes and reformatories, given up by his father after a juvenile conviction for petty crime. He married, young and briefly.

Scot James Cooper was left fighting for le after ing from the Kalofer Hotel, in Bulgaria, last year. At one stage, medics gave relatives of the -year-old stonemason the stark prognosis before he eventually recovered, the Daily Record reports. James’s we Janet, from Dunfermline, says she alerted the hotel’s bosses about his condition and demanded they take action.    The couple were shocked when they read last week that two holidaymakers had died from Legionnaires’ shortly after staying at the Kalofer this summer. John Cowan , from Hamilton, and Brian Taylor, , from Huddersfield, passed away within days of each other. They stayed at the -star Sunny Beach resort in June. Janet said: “As James started to recover, I thought I would contact the hotel manager to let her know about his illness. “I advised her to check the air conditioning and shower systems to hopefully avoid this happening to anyone . “She responded promptly via Facebook Messenger, shocked at my news, but also listing their alleged water cleansing routine and timetable.    She contacted me a couple of times after that, asking how James was. I was so shocked that these deaths have happened this year.” James, who spent nearly three weeks in hospital, said: “It was terrying. One minute you’re on holiday having a great time. The next, you’re fighting for your le in hospital.” Janet, James and their teenage daughter Chloe stayed at the Kalofer in July last year. They booked the break directly with the hotel. On the second-last night, James slept for a couple of hours with the air conditioning on while Chloe was in another room and Janet was on the balcony. The family believe it was during this period – the only time the aircon was used – that James picked up the bug.  Janet said the day after they ed home, James had a dry cough. Later, his breathing became laboured. He was diagnosed with a chest infection and given antibiotics. But his condition worsened and he was rushed to the Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy, where he spent four days in a coma. He was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia Legionella. In messages to Janet, the Kalofer said they’d spent £, on a system to prevent Legionnaires’ and assured her all tests had come back negative. Last night, hotel spokeswoman Stanislava Petrova said they had “not been informed by the local health authorities about any case from last year”. She said: “From the beginning of the summer season, more than  samples from the guest rooms, the kitchen, the pools, the water heaters and the other parts and systems in the hotel have been tested and in all, no Legionella is found.” "},{"url":null,"title":"childrens imaginary friends dying out","story":"NewsChildrens imaginary friends dying out as kids spend more time looking at screensAlmost two thirds who were surveyed felt tablets and television are making children less imaginativeShareCommentsByAlison Kershaw:,  AUG NewsPsychology lecturer Dr Paige Davis, of York St John University, said modern technology has changed the way children play in general\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man covered in tattoos who is the talk of his town has opened the doors of his home for the first time to reveal the story behind his ink. Paul Kidson has become a familiar face in Newquay, Cornwall, sporting dozens of tattoos across his face and body. He lives in a ground-floor flat on his own, adorned with dozens of red trinkets ranging from clocks, to shoes and wigs stacked on his shelves. Paul refuses to invite people to his home because many had robbed him in the past, he said.In an exclusive interview with Cornwall Live , Paul revealed his adventurous le story - from a broken childhood to travelling the world, and marrying four times along the way.He said: “I don’t have many people in here. In all the time I’ve been here - three years - I’ve only had six or seven people inside. I don’t let people in, because my trust in a lot of people has gone since I got robbed.” Paul is referring to the time he was burgled when he lived in Blackpool around seven years ago. Not only did they take all his money, but he says they also ripped up old photos of his mother, who had recently died. This, on top of mounting solicitor bills from a orce, led Paul to try and take his own le. It was his first suicide attempt, but sadly, not his last. Inside Paul’s flat, it is almost impossible to see where the floor ends, the walls begin and the painted ceiling starts. With every available space filled with colour coordinated red objects, and the room temperature hitting  degrees, his tiny home feels almost womblike. Paul was born in Harrogate Hospital at .am on a very snowy  of January . He says that years later, his mother would tell him that his father’s first words when he came to visit the hospital were: “I didn’t want a boy, I wanted a girl”.  Growing up in a small village near Thirsk in Yorkshire - the home of James Herriot – Paul says that he ‘didn’t have much of a childhood’, spending most of his time caring for his mother who was quite ill and struggled to get out to the shops by herself. Despite describing himself as a ‘proper mammy’s boy’ and not getting on well with his father, Paul did follow in his footsteps and got a job at the Rowntree’s sweet factory in York, where he quickly earned enough money to save up for a deposit on a house. “I left home when I was  or , because my father was an absolutely despicable person. I just could not live with him at all. I won’t go into details of what happened, but a lot happened.” Paul bought his first home just down the road from his mother, so that he could still look after her. Around this time, he got his first tattoos – his name on his right arm and a swallow on his left. This began his lelong obsession with getting tattoos, with more recent ones often covering older ones, except for those first two, which Paul has kept.  His body quickly became covered in ink, but by covering them in make-up, Paul still managed to keep his tattoos hidden from his mother when he went to see her. “She never knew. She’d have gone mental.” In between his time working in the warehouse at Rowntree’s, Paul befriended local tattooists and helped them in their shops infor tattoos. As well as making up the needles, he would help to look after the inks, which had a habit of drying up and getting too thick after a while: “You’d have to water them down a bit, so what you’d have to do is put a little bit of mouthwash in, and shake it up, because then it’s still sterilized.” Aged , Paul married his first we, who at the time was only  years old. But the marriage lasted less than a year: “She wanted family straight away and I said no. So we got orced.” It wasn’t long before Paul met someone , a girl in The Old World Club in York, which he had been going to since he was a teenager. “She was really nice, but she was going out with one of the doormen. All she did was go out with doormen. Anyway, she finished with him to go out with me, which caused a lot of trouble. But eventually we married.”  This time the marriage lasted for years, and other than having a lot of tattoos on his body, from the outside Paul seemed to be living a fairly conventional le through his twenties and into his thirties. He was married, living in a three-bedroom bungalow, and still working at Rowntree’s: “It was good money, so I couldn’t give up that, because I’d just bought a house. But I’d been moving round doing dferent jobs . Then I went into the Smartie Department, making Smarties by hand. That was a hard job. Then putting the holes in Polos. Oh, I’ve done all sorts.” However, admitting that he can be ‘a bit of a handful’, Paul’s marriage eventually turned sour, and after separating from his we, he went to live in Greece, where he says he met and married another woman, despite not being orced from his second we. “We lived togetherfor a long time, but she liked to drink a lot for her breakfast. Then I knew I had to come back home, to do the orce. But I couldn’t fetch the other we home, so I had to do a runner.” Paul began travelling a lot, to the Middle East, to Thailand and around Europe. It was in Benidorm that he got his first tattoo on his face.  “Getting them on your face is a hard decision. You have to know what you want.” Paul got a small tattoo on the side of his left eyebrow, which has since disappeared beneath more recent ink. Paul married for a fourth time and moved to Leeds. But eventually this marriage too broke down, and as he and his we went through the orce, he decided to move to Blackpool, where he had lots of friends in the tattoo industry. In Blackpool, Paul began getting more face tattoos and piercings, sometimes infor doing promotional work for the tattooists which saw him featured in magazines and on television. “‘Then you know, things just got a bit... I got a bit bored with it all. So I just packed it all up, and just cleared off abroad.” What Paul later explains, is that this was when he first attempted to take his own le. “The solicitors were charging me £ an hour and it went on for seven months and it just broke me, just ruined everything. It got that bad, I had to sell my clothes and my furniture just to pay for the solicitor. And I was living on virtually nothing.” These crippling costs, along with the death of his mother and then getting robbed, finally broke Paul. He took a kne to his stomach and cut it open, nine inches, from the bottom of his ribs, through his belly button and down to his waist. “I ripped half of my stomach out and lost a lot of my bladder. I actually died twice.    I was in casualty, I died, and I could actually see them working on me.”Despite this happening seven years ago, Paul is still on medication for the pain in his stomach, cannot eat big meals and struggles to sleep most nights. Paul left Blackpool, and once again went travelling through Europe, making his way through Portugal, Spain and France, before ing to England and moving to Eastbourne. Unsettled there, Paul came to Cornwall, homeless, originally staying in St Ives, and then walking the coast up to Newquay five years ago. Homeless on the streets of Newquay, but not wanting to beg for money, Paul discovered that his unique appearance would be the key to his survival: “I never used to beg. I used to sit out in the centre. I never had a hat on the floor and I never asked for money, but people wanted a photo of me, and I’d say yeah,you want to make a little donation. And that’s how I lived for a long time.” However, as someone who had worked for all of his le, Paul looked to the Job Centre to help him find work and get back on his feet. But frustrated by the system, and spiralling into a deep depression, Paul attempted suicide for a second time, stabbing himself in the stomach once again, and leaving a trail of blood as he staggered to the Job Centre. At rock bottom, Paul went to the local newspaper, the  Newquay Voice , and asked them to issue a plea on his behalf to help him get back on his feet again.In the article that they printed, Paul explained: “I’ve been doing odd jobs over the summer, but I have had no support at all in finding work. I went to the Job Centre, but they put me on courses which didn’t seem to have anything to do with employment and they were not very helpful. I don’t like going on the dole, but even when I tried you have to wait six weeks, and I can’t survive that long without money and there are all sorts of hurdles caused by not having a permanent address. “I’m a genuine person and I refuse to steal from people so I have been living rough and getting by with help from community groups such as Soul Food and kind gts from locals, but without any support or help I feel like I’m reaching the end of what I can take. Living on the streets is just not healthy and I know I just won’t last the winter.” Then, talking about his recent suicide attempt, Paul is quoted as saying “I just couldn’t do it anymore. I have tried so hard to get work and get back on my feet. All I want is a roof over my head and some food and then I will be happy. Newquay’s community is amazing and people here are so friendly and so I’m hoping somebody will give me a chance to work, get some money and get off the streets.” "},{"url":null,"title":"man who sank 7 pints","story":"NewsMan who sank  pints a day sheds st after he couldnt walk up hill in BenidormPaul Aitchison, who weighed st lb at his heaviest while gorging on full English breakfasts and downing  pints a week, made dramatic changes when he ed home from BenidormShareCommentsByLottie Gibbons:,  AUG NewsPaul Aitchison weighed st lb at his heaviest \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

He said: “I joked at first that I was just keeping Pam company, but in truth, I was too embarrassed to admit that I was doing it for me and I needed to do it. “And,I’m honest, I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to do it. I had been big for so long I wasn’t sure I could lose weight.” He has now dropped down to st ½lbs after dramatically changing his diet and taking up exercise.

Her brutally honest yet uplting video diaries were shared by thousands and inspired an army of supporters to raise money for the future of her children. Then when she hit her £, target she turned “Lisa’s Army” into a charity offering treats to other families hit by cancer. Her letter to her daughters has also been turned into a children’s book to help such families.Dan, , a road surfacer, announced the sad news on Facebook last Saturday.He wrote: “At am this morning Lisa lost her battle with cancer. She’s now at peace. No more pain, no more suffering. Sleep tight you absolute warrior. You won the hearts of many. Love you always and forever, Dan”.    He was with her to the end at Dorothy House, a hospice near their home in Frome, Somerset, for which Lisa had raised £,. “The last thing Lisa said to me will stick with me forever,” he said on Facebook. “She tried to tell me something and I really couldn’t understand the message she was trying to get across. “When I kept asking, ‘What are you trying to say’ she opened her eyes and said unbelievably clearly, ‘Are you deaf ’ and then closed her eyes and continued to rest. I wouldn’t have expected anything less, to be honest. “She was one in a million and had the best sense of humour in any situation. Sleep tight, love you always”. They had been a couple since they were  and last summer they went back to the stately home where they married to renew their vows on their th anniversary. The Sunday People last spoke to Lisa in June. At that point she hoped to live long enough to see the charity support its first family, but the odds were against her.

Believing this choice will not contribute to polluting rivers or end up choking a turtle, you happily put it in your trolley, safe in the knowledge that you’re doing a small, but important, bit in helping to protect the environment. But later in the shower, you notice the ingredients’ list. A quick Google search reveals they aren’t that eco-friendly after all. You’ve sadly fallen for “greenwashing”. The term applies to instances where unsubstantiated or misleading claims are made about the environmental benefits of a product, service, technology or company. The same can be said for well-meaning public figures seeking to promote their green credentials while hopping on gas-guzzling private jets, inevitably opening themselves up to criticism. Prince Harry faced this situation last week after Elton John sought to defend his recent private jet journey to the south of France, saying the flight was “carbon-neutral” as he’d made an appropriate contribution to Carbon Footprint. The firm is a leading player in a rapidly growing industry which seeks to provide a quick option to repair some of the damage caused by modern lestyles by payinga small fee. In turn, this finances a iety of projects to take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by plantingtrees, or to prevent it frombeing emitted.Yet the industry is also the subject of fierce criticism, particularly among environmentalists, who see it as a highly unethical form of greenwashing. Sceptics also point out that many offsetting schemes take ages to have a signicant effect.

Emily Collett, , and student flier Tom Castle, , died when a Pitts S-A plane - which has a top speed of mph - crashed into a field. Mrs Collett, an aerobatics national champion in , taught former Countdown presenter and pilot Ms Vorderman, , how to perform a loop-the-loop in her two-seater aircraft in July . Ms Vorderman, who has her private pilotaposs licence, posted photos of themselves on social media back then, writing: “I loved doing the loop with this top woman Emily Collett . . . just brilliant x.” Mrs Collett was reportedly practising spins with Mr Castle when her small plane went down near the village of Stonor in Oxfordshire on Saturday afternoon.    She had taken off from White Waltham airfield near Maidenhead, Berkshire, earlier in the day. Cambridge-educated Mrs Collett and her husband Mike ran Ultimate Aerobatics from the airfield - the base of the West London Aero Club - and competed with the British Advanced Aerobatics team. They both learnt aerobatics - involving spins, rolls and loops - in the Pitts S-A, which has a top speed of just over mph, according to their companyaposs website.    Mrs Collett, who was inspired to become a pilot after seeing a fighter jet aged nine and had her first flying lesson when she was , won the UK standard class nationals in G-ODDS using the plane. She had once said of the aircraft: “She shows up all your mistakes, so that you quickly learn how to ­prevent them. Mrs Collett graduated from Cambridge University with a masteraposs in engineering and had been a civil servant with the UK Government for  years, according to her LinkedIn profile.  She was director of the British Aerobatic Association and won the British Advanced Aerobatics Championships in , with only a whisker between her and Mr Collett, a business jet pilot who finished second, according to their website. Mrs Collett had competed at the World Advanced Aerobatics Championships and won a number of national and international awards, including a silver medal with the British team - and her husband - in South Africa in .

She competed in a Mudry Cap  stunt plane and also provided instruction for student fliers. Last year, she became the first female member of the Great War Display Team, flying in an SEa replica aircraft. She once flew with the Red Arrows and was nominated for the Sporting Role Model Award run by the Women’s Sports Trust. Graeme Fudge, of the British Aerobatic Association, paid tribute to the talented and accomplished pilot.  He told the Sun: Emily was an incredibly talented and highly experienced aerobatic pilot. A caring and considerate nature, Emily’s generosity in sharing her knowledge and time to help others was well known in the aerobatic community and beyond, helping many pilots achieve their goals. Emily will be sadly missed by all who knew her and our thoughts are with her family and friends who have lost a wonderful daughter, we and friend. Mr and Mrs Collett, who met a gliding club and got married about four years ago, started Ultimate Aerobatics in , offering lessons, pleasure flights and aerobatics displays for hired events such as weddings and country fairs. In  she told the Sunday Timesapos Driving section that she was inspired to become a pilot when she saw an F- fighter jet when she was nine.  She told her family that day: When I grow up, I’m going to be an engineer and fly aeroplanes. Her grandmother paid for her first flying lesson for her th birthday. She later joined the Air Training Corps, learnt how to fly gliders at RAF Wattisham in Suffolk and was flying a Cessna  trainer at Stapleford airfield in Essex at . Mrs Collett said of being an aerobatics pilot: “I was apprehensive to begin with but I needn’t have worried. I’m lucky enough never to have felt nauseous.

Laura Donegan, , from Coventry, was just  weeks pregnant when her waters broke. But she had no idea this was the case as a doctor had initially told her she had wet herself, she said.Laura, who had lost a lot of fluid, posted her concerns in Facebook group Little Heartbeats and a flurry of mums rushed to advise Laura who then decided to go back to the hospital.She was eventually diagnosed with preterm premature rupture of the membranes three weeks later. If not for the advice from other mums, Laura said she would have risked losing her babies due to infection.    After being signed off work for six weeks, she went on to give birth to her daughters Cara and Evie, at  weeks pregnant on May . Laura, an accountant, said: If I hadnapost have posted into the group about my concerns, Iaposd have never have known about apospreterm premature rupture of the membranesaposand could have easily lost the girls. My first pregnancy went really smoothly, so I had no idea what to do when things started to go wrong. Whilst the doctor told me Iaposd simply wet myself and said to aposcontinue as normalapos, the ladies in the group said I should insist on antibiotics and lie down as much as possible so I didnapost lose too much fluid.  I had to take three weeks off work before I eventually got a doctors note confirming my waters had broke allowing me a further six weeks off before the girls were born. PRROM is where the sac, or the amniotic membrane, ruptures before week  of pregnancy. Once the sac breaks, there is an increased risk of infection and a higher chance of having the babies early - and Laura said this would have been detrimental for her twins.  If it wasnapost for the advice from members of the Facebook page, Laura believes she wouldnapost have managed to hold off her labour until  weeks.

Richard Bertinet, who has been acclaimed as a food champion by the BBC and has appeared on shows like Saturday Kitchen, was born in Brittany, France and has lived in the UK for  years. He runs his own bakery classes and has published a number of books. He also has a British we and three British children. Despite the le he has built for himself here, the Home Office has only granted Mr Bertinet pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme. This means he can remain in the UK for five more years, before needing to apply again.  The governmentaposs website states pre-settled status normally applies to EU citizens without five yearsapos continuous residence upon application. Mr Bertinet, of Bath, said he felt betrayed by the decision but is determined to appeal against it. He shared a photo of the Home Office letter on his Instagram account yesterday. Alongside the photo, he wrote:  years living in the UK without a break for more than a few weeks holiday . Originally employed without gaps then started several businesses employing s of others and one that attracts visitors in to the UK from overseas.    Always paid UK taxes. Married to a British woman for  years with three British children. Have NOT spent  days in five years or  days in  months outside the UK. Submitted all evidence requested, as requested. NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR SETTLED STATUS. Speaking about the Home Office decision, he added: I applied as we watched the news about Brexit and we were worried about having to reapply for residency. He continued: You feel like you spend  years of your le living here but it is not your home, said Mr Bertinet.  There is something not right here. It is something of a betrayal. It is a slap in the face. I have paid taxes, I am grateful for the NHS and I have employed hundreds of people for my businesses. I have never had a British passport as I have a French passport. It leaves a very sour taste in the mouth. When people today say they are embarrassed about their country, you know something is not right. Mr Bertinet said messages of support have come flooding in, including from fellow chef Nigella Lawson.  The letter from the Home Office states: You have permission to stay in the UK for five years from the date of this letter. If you wish to apply for settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme, you can do so as soon as you meet the qualying criteria for this. More information on the qualying criteria for the EU Settlement Scheme can be found at:  https:www.gov.uk settled-status-eu-citizens-families when-to-apply . You should make an application when you believe you qualy for settled status and before your pre-settled status experies. You can also rely on any rights that you may have as an EEAor Swiss citizen under EU law whilst those rights remain in force in the UK.

The team of paranormal investigators said it also has video footage of growling and screaming noises at Pool Parc asylum in Ruthin, north Wales. Six ghost hunters from the group Spirit Walkers went into the -year-old manor house armed with specialist equipment including night vision cameras and EVPdevices on August . Beth Hopper, , who runs Spirit Walkers, said they only discovered the haunting images once they ed home. She said one image appears to show a shadowy figure standing next to a noose.

It was quite disturbing. People have said to me they can hear the sound of torture. If you picture the mental asylum and what mightaposve happened there, that might explain it. It is just a horrible sound. Iaposve been there several times and have heard voices and footsteps. One girl said she felt a nurse was standing right in front of her in the dark. Weaposd also heard reports of an ex-patient there who thinks heaposs a Roman soldier and who marches up and down the corridor and throws stones at people.  I was glad to get out of there in the end! But then when we did we saw a noose hanging from a window that we hadnapost spotted with our torches before we went in. It wasnapost until I lightened the picture later that we saw what could be a figure in the window. It was pretty creepy. The spirits could be trying to send a signal of the pain they went through there. My team say spirits are drawn to me because of my bubbly personality.

More than , Italians captured in Libya and Tunisia arrived in Henllan north Wales in  and were held in huts and sheds. Their camp was equipped with a hospital, theatres, football pitches, tennis courts, a bowling green and kitchens.Many of the Italians were deeply religious and asked military bossesthey could build a Roman Catholic church in one of the huts in the camp, Wales Online reported .Stunning images show the inside of the church which is all that remains of the camp and was decorated entirely by the prisoners.    They show stunning religious paintings painted by prisoner, Mario Ferlito, who taught himself to paint when he family were unable to pay for him to go to art school. Also pictured is the painted dome above the altar and murals on ceiling beams, which still look stunning despite being more than  years old. Marioaposs incredible images were painted using whatever materials and supplies he could find around the camp. Boiled fish bones were used as an adhesive to bond and preserve the paint that was pigmented with fruit, vegetables, tobacco and tea leaves to create a range of colours.    Mario left the camp at the end of the war but   years later he was astonished to be told by children the chapel was still there by schoolchildren when he visited the village in . Youmanity.today reported when he saw the chapel again he said: Through the rainbow of my tears, I see the days of my youth opening in front of me like the pages of a book.” John Meirion Jones is an -year-old retired headmaster and author living near Pentregat, Ceredigion, who became lelong friends with Mario after the trip.  Mr Jones said: He didn’t learn about it from books or TV, he learned from -year-old Welsh schoolchildren. “His we said that Mario was in tears for twenty minutes when he found out the church was still there . Mr Jones said the relationship between the Italian prisoners and the local community during the war was “very emotional and friendly situation. Many of them lived with local farmers, tending their land for the five years they spent in Wales. The prisoners didnapost have any money of their own so they made jewellery to trade with the residents of Henllan, some of which Mr Jones has in his home. In ,  of the ex-prisoners came back to Wales.  Members of the community went to greet them at Heathrow Airport in London and brought them back to Henllan. They were taken to the church where they had an emotional reunion with the farmers they used to work for and villagers they bonded with “The farmers were hugging them and crying. They were meeting each other for the first time in  years,” Mr Jones said.  In the following decades, Mr Jones went to Italy to see Mario  times and the Italians ed to Henllan a further five times.

victory over Hearts has been dampened by the - aggregate loss to Rijeka and - league loss at St Mirren.McInnes’ side struggled to an extra-time Betfred Cup win over second-tier Dundee on Sunday, and Hedges insists they can no longer hide behind excuses like fatigue as they try to rediscover the dynamic, free-flowing football they showed just a few weeks ago.Hedges said: “We were off Monday and Tuesday, so we’ve had a few days.“I think the performancewasn’t to the standard we expect, but the main thing is we’re through and now we’ve got to look forward to the next round in the League Cup and to today.“When the games come thick and fast, there’s a lot of things to overcome and the travelling out to Croatia probably didn’t help as well.“But you want to be playing Thursday and Sunday, because it means you’re still in Europe, obviously that’s not the case anymore, but playing with  men on Thursday probably didn’t help going into Sunday.“I don’t think we can hide behind that – we should’ve done a lot better and hopefully we can put it right today.“On the whole, everyone to a man could’ve given a better performance.“I can’t say there were any stand-out performances.“Cossyis scoring goals, but there’s a lot more the team can give as a whole and hopefully we can do that.”Today was set to be a novelty for Hedges as he’d never played competitive football on an articial pitch.Angelo Alessio’s Kilmarnock, who will also be new to him, have a newly-laid G surface at Rugby Park.Hedges said: “I’ve never been to Kilmarnock and it’ll be a whole new experience playing on G as well.“It’s one I’m looking forward to and something I’ll need to get used to playing in this league.”He added: “They’ve got a new manager in who’s trying to change the way they play this season.“We know it’s going to be a hard game, but we need to go there trying to get three points.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/5d5fd225da82c8.70592606-351x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet dougal josie and harley are looking for a new home can you help1","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.This boisterous boy is five years old and is looking for a new place to call home.Dougal, who has been neutered, is not suitable to be homed around children.

Every one of our staff has the opportunity to see they are changing lives and that has its own reward. It has given me a great experience.“From a recruitment perspective we are constantly trying to keep our profile up. It’s a case of trying to get our message out there and sell our story.”VSA is preparing to host recruitment days at Broomhill Activity Centre on August  and at Linn Moor School on September .Carol believes these offer a perfect opportunity for people to find out more about the work the charity does in the north-east.She said: “What these events do is allow people to come along and see for themselves what VSA is all about.“It’s a really nice opportunity for people to come and use those skills in a dferent way to see how they can make a dference to an organisation. It’s not just front-line roles. We’ve got all of the support around that.“We can appeal to iniduals who want to work with children, older people or in mental health. We can meet career aspirations.“We have just recently launched our mental health campaign around our th anniversary celebrations and our focus is very much on building the new Abergeldie unit.“It’s amazing to be part of that, knowing we are playing our part in making Aberdeen a city which is built on strong social values.“We are supporting the people who live in our community.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/77274937-847x564.jpg ","title":"new soft play centre for north east children with additional support needs opens its doors","story":"The first soft play area for children with additional support needs in the north-east has opened its doors.Charity BECSbuilt the facility at Burghmuir Circle in Inverurie.Founder Becky Mennie, , has spoken of her delight at finally opening the premises and said it will make a huge dference to families in the area.It was originally hoped the new site would open at the end of June but it was delayed due to a lack of funding.However, a final push for cash led to the group raising £, to cover the running costs for the centre for the first couple of months.Becky, mother to three-year-old Mason, said: “It is a relief to get to this stage and to get the final pieces in place.“It will bring everyone in Inverurie together, including children who have additional support needs and get all the children to mix together.“I think the centre will bring in people from across the north-east.“I’ve already had a number of inquiries from people in Stonehaven and up in Peterhead asking when we’ll be opening up.“It has taken a long time to get to this point and I think some people had questionedwe were going to open.“However, I am quite stubborn so we were going to get over that funding hurdle.”The charity will also receive more donations from the proceeds of a Highland League legends match held yesterday.

They also make for an excellently contrasting pair.From Mendelssohn’s exuberant opening bars, we are swept through music that is complex yet captivatingly, joyously melodic throughout, while Enescu’s is moody, breathlessly dramatic and, in parts, simply volcanic.Guest directed by Marianne Thorsen, SE will explore the specic charm of seeing a small group of musicians performing live. With fewer instruments, the fabric of the music becomes more tangible, subtle shts in mood may have a new-found presence, and pieces you think you know well might offer surprising new colours when heard live. With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway’s Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry sportive well supported in sunshine","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Kilberry Loop Sportive saw around  cyclists take on a -mile route starting and finishing in Tarbert.All eyes were on the forecast for the non-competitive cycling event on Saturday August .

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

There is also a dedicated exam results section.Details of the local SDS centres are available at myworldofwork centres and information about events and opportunities is also available on Facebook.Pauline Graham, Project Manager for the SDS Exam Results HelplineSir,I had a great time at this year#s Islay Show. It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead golf club junior championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowCongratulations to Lochgilphead Golf Club junior champion , Kern McKellar and Euan Gilmour, who was the Stableford winner."},{"url":null,"title":"lets get our mojo working","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStarting out in , Lost in Berlin is the creation of Ardrishaig-based wordsmith Russell Taylor.The name Lost in Berlin could be seen as an apt metaphor for society#s sometimes confused state.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"trailer load of cash raised for marie curie","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOne lucky winner can look forward to a cosy winter after winning a trailer load of logs at Mid Argyll Show.The sticks were donated, as in previous years, by Ardrishaig#s Alan Ryan to the Mid Argyll Marie Curie Fundraising Group for their stand at the show.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"filming-taking-place-port-seton-high-street","story":"A short film called Fishing by LS Productions means that a rolling road closure has been created.This is when the road is mainly open, but traffic will be lsquopausedrsquo to clear the road at times.It is a system commonly used in cycling and road events.There will also be parking restrictions in place.When asked, LS Productions marketing team informed the Courier that due to signing non-disclosure agreements, they were unable to say anything more about the film."},{"url":null,"title":"surge-39-struggling-39-families-sees-demand-kids-39-lunch-club-soar","story":"More than  children took part in this summerrsquos club compared to just  when it began in .And Universal Credit has been blamed for the dramatic increase in families who need help providing their children with a healthy meal, during the holidays.Sandra King, from Preston Seton Gosford Area Partnership, who help fund the club, which runs in Prestonpans and Tranent, said there was no doubt the impact of East Lothian being used to pilot the roll-out of Universal Credit was being witnessed.She said: ldquoIt is like being back in the Seventies: the number of families who are struggling and need support is high and the Universal Credit pilot in East Lothian has definitely had an impact.The outward appearance of East Lothian as an affluent county was misleading, she added, with families in all of its town and communities struggling.She said: ldquoEven in places like North Berwick we are seeing families affected.

I think for many parents who have childcare challenges,there can be a real sense of relief as the summer holidays end, and to some extent I feel that myself.The pressure to fill six weeks with entertainment and activities, and go on holiday, can be immense, especially on a tight budget. For some children too, the holidays can be a dficult time and school can offer them ato some familiar routine.However, I remember the impending dread I felt when I was a child in the final days of the summer holidays. I hated the back to school adverts on TV as they heralded the end of free days playing on the rocks at the Pans shore, and of loosely defined bedtimes.So I was glad that our youngest daughter Skye was looking forward to school as she enters P. She met friends she hadnrsquot seen in weeks this morning and smiled as she said hello to George the lollipop man.She seemed slightly anxious as she waited in line in a new place, but the friendly manner of her new teacher visibly lted her mood and she went in with a smile, unknowingly tracing my childhood footsteps and those of her big sister.But then as I walked home, I was suddenly overwhelmed with anxieties: money worries, work worries, deadlines, bills etc. It seemed asduring the holiday period I had consciously decided to put such thoughts aside, to just enjoy the family time. Now was the pay back, we had ed to lsquorealityrsquo.But then I suddenly remembered a tale a fellow storyteller had told me many years ago. It just popped into my head and it spoke to me as I wandered back. And the truth in the story was the antidote I needed in that moment. And so I will share it with you in case you may one day find you need it:There was once a weaver who was weighed down with worries. He had so many things to do, so many responsibilities he looked into the future with dread. His worries kept him awake at night, which of course made his worrying worse during the next day. It was a vicious cycle.Then one day, he was sitting at his loom working and his worries got in the way. He couldnrsquot concentrate and he made mistake after mistake. He cursed and this was heard by an auld guidewe who happened to be passing by his window.ldquoFir whit reason dae ye curse at yer loom son, is there nae joy in yer work  she asked.The weaver looked up, feeling ashamed: ldquoIrsquom sair sorry fir ma words. Itrsquos just that as I work I think aboot orsquo ma troubles.The old woman nodded in understanding. She knew about troubles herself.ldquoAye, she said with an understanding nod, ldquotroubles can fair get ye doon.Then she paused and thought for a moment. She could see in the weaverrsquos face that he was riddled with anxieties.ldquoCan I show ye something that will tak ye awa frae yer work fir only a few minutes The weaver was happy to have a break so he left his loom and came outside.ldquoDae ye hae a bucket  asked the guidewe.ldquoA bucket ldquoAye a bucket, tae put some water in, she explained.The weaver fetched his bucket, wondering what the old woman was going to do with it.She took it to the well and filled it with a little water.ldquoNoo son, I dinnae kenthis will be tae heavy fir ye tae hold up.The weaver laughed: ldquoOrsquo course itrsquos no too heavy, fir ye only put a wee drop orsquo water in it.So the woman asked him to prove this by holding up the bucket with arms outstretched. The weaver had strong arms because of his work and held the bucket before him without any effort.ldquoAh, said the guidewe, ldquosae itrsquos nae tae heavy.ldquoIt isnae heavy at arsquo, replied the weaver.The old woman smiled: ldquoIn that case, keep haudin it afore ye like that fir  minutes. He wondered why she was asking him to do this, andshe was just trying to make a fool of him. But he was also intrigued and knew her to be an honest old soul, and so he did as she asked.After a few minutes of holding the bucket in front of him, it began to feel much heavier. After five minutes, his arms began to ache and soon they began to shake. The pain began to spread to his back as he desperately tried to keep the bucket in position.ldquoIs  minutes no over yet  asked the weaver desperately.ldquoIf the bucket is now tae heavy fir ye, put it doon son.He was reluctant to admit that the bucket was now too heavy to hold and so put it down.ldquoThe water got heavier son, didnrsquot it ldquoThe water wasnae heavier, protested the weaver, ldquoye just made me hold the bucket for tae lang.ldquoSae the water did get heavier, no in itself, but for you!The weaver looked confused and the guidewe continued.ldquoWater can get heavierye haud it ower lang afore ye, evenitrsquos just a wee drop. Yer worries are like that water, son. I am sure that they are many but ye mak them much heavierye try tae haud them in yer thochts arsquo the time.She smiled at him: ldquoTry an put the bucket doon as often as ye can,ye ken whit I mean. Dinnae mak it heavier than needs be. When ye need tae, haud it, but no arsquo the time.ldquoIn fact, she added while raising a pointed finger, ldquohauding it arsquo the time gies ye pain and paralyses ye. Yersquoll hae nae ability left tae empty the bucket.And so the old woman wandered off, leaving her words with the weaver. He looked down at the bucket. He lted it again and held it in front of him. It wasnrsquot as heavy now as before, but still had the same amount of water in it. She was right, water can get heavieryou hold it for longer, even though itrsquos the same weight.He chuckled to himself and watched the woman as she waddled down the street.ldquoThank ye! he called out.He ed to his loom. This time he whistled and sang as he worked. He enjoyed his creation and made no mistakes, for he had put his bucket of worries down for a while.Later they would still be there, but they might seem lighter and easier to manage now that they had stopped paralysing him with anxiety.And so that was the story. And as I arrived home, I realised that although I needed to deal with lots of things, I wasnrsquot going to give my worries more weight by holding them constantly in my thoughts.Itrsquos really important to put your bucket down every now and then, and that can make it easier to empty as well."},{"url":null,"title":"letter-railway-isn-39-t-perfect-39-s-better-driving","story":"Sure, things

years. While the name of these types of promotions seems to imply that players will be on the receiving end of totally free spins, during which anything won can be kept and withdrawn, the truth is often a bit murkier than that.The UK Gambling Commission has played no small role in attempting to clear up the matter. According to them, to use the term ldquofree spins casinos must genuinely offer free games with no strings attached, such as wagering requirements. The old, standard spins are to be referred to as ldquobonus spins instead.When Free Spins Are Not Truly Free SpinsThere are several occasions when free spinsarenrsquot free. Any spins which come with wagering requirements, for instance, breach the concept of being truly free. Wagering requirements, also known as playthrough rates, denote that a player must wager whatever they win a specic number of times before they can withdraw those funds.Wagering requirements are common in deposit bonusesbut shouldnrsquot be included in any offer which proclaims itself to be free.Free Spins With No Wagering RequirementsFortunately, the new regulation issued by the UK Gambling Commission, Swedish Gaming Authority and others are aiming to fix this issue. True free spin deals should come with no hidden terms and no strings attached. They should be offered to players with a genuine chance to win real money for free, money which can ndasha player desires ndash be withdrawn from the start. This doesnrsquot mean to say that there arenrsquot other terms and conditions.Many top free spin bonuses tend to come with dates attached, only being valid during a predetermined period. Moreover, they may only be valid on select slot machines and could be limited to players in a specic region.Only a Handful of Chances to WinThere is a downside to the new ldquofree spins offers at casinos. They generally tend to provide a limited number of spins, far fewer than the old no deposit bonuses with wagering requirements, and deposit offers. Moreover, they are often only valid on slot games which do not offer substantial cash prizes, including many simple - line games from NetEnt and others.Promos Which Are Ideal for Test Driving CasinosSuch free spin bonuses which come with no wagering requirements at all are hardly going to be appealing for players who fancy landing big wins. As mentioned, they tend to be valid on slots which donrsquot offer such epic wins. However, these promos and deals may make the ideal introduction to slot gaming for new players, or those who wish to test-drive a slot before deciding to wager real money on it.The East Lothian Courierencourages readers to gamble responsibly.

The procedure for iding matrimonial property, which is any money and other assets owned jointly or inidually is that it is to be ided fairly, which may not simply mean equally. If the situation has to be resolved in court that can result in a decision that is far from satisfactory to one ndashor both ndashof the partners.ldquoItrsquos important that we advise clients about the fact that Alternative Dispute Resolution is available. These situations emphatically donrsquot involve an inevitable progress to court ndashwhich should be regarded as very much the last resort, he says.In fact, some % or more of cases are now dealt with through negotiation rather than a court order that determines the ision of assets. People who proceed to court, says Ferry almost inevitably have an urgent issue such as suffering from a serious shortage of money or protection issues resulting from circumstances of domestic abuse.The alternative routes principally involve collaboration or mediation. Mediation, involves an independent mediator guiding the parties toward a solution. The mediator does not usually give them legal advice as to their entitlements though in assisted mediation both parties have their solicitors in the background .ldquoThat is an option that sometimes works out well ndash but many people are looking for veriable answers, and this can be achieved through the collaborative approach which I find is generally a better way to resolve disagreements.Ferry, a trained collaborative lawyer, believes this route is best to minimise conflict and secure financial choices ndashwhile also, importantly, ensuring the best future for the children. He explains that collaborative law involves the parties and their advisers in four-way meetings with discussions around the table, in private and without the delay of correspondence and court proceedings. And this, he says helps to avoid subsequent, and potentially costly, misunderstandings.The problem with pensionsPensions, for example, can become very contentious. ldquoIn our experience pensions are frequently overlooked by clients when considering orce settlements. However, the value of the pensions built up during the marriage or civil partnership is taken into account and can be substantial. Our clientsrsquo settlements often involve pension sharing agreements.ldquoHowever, pensions can be extremely complicated ndashnot only in terms of valuing them and iding them but itrsquos also important to get the best advice on which pensions should be shared and which should not. Some have more benefits attached to them than others. For example, there may be spousersquos benefits attached to them which may be very valuable.In addition, he adds, there are ious types of pensions such as Self Invested Personal Pensionswhich can be convoluted when dealing with them in orce cases as sometimes these can involve multiple underlying property and other assets contained in the pension which may need to be valued too.ldquoYou need to take advice not only about its value at the date of separation but also its type of pension and current value. A failure to identy pension interests or to correctly apportion the value of a pension may have dramatic long-term implications for either spouse and there is a strict timescale involved after orce for implementing the pension share.Business assetsFerry says that clients also need advice about business assets and shareholdings, as to what constitutes matrimonial property as these can, inadvertently, be converted into matrimonial property in the course of, for example, restructuring a company that was founded or bought before marriage.ldquoShareholdings that may be worth several millions can be transferred into the joint matrimonial pot and that possibility is not often considered by the accountant or tax advisor involved, he says.These are just a few of the issues to be considered but despite the obvious vexations that separation and orce involve, Ferry believes in confronting them in a positive, proactive way. The Family LawAct of  was well thought out and is quite flexible, providing for the needs of inidual cases, he says.Divorce, he adds, need not end up in long, drawn out court proceedings. ldquoWhether via a pre-nuptial agreement or a collaborative resolution, with good legal advice parties can deal with separation and orce in way that achieves the solution that works best for them both.Noel specialises in all areas of family law but is particularly noted for acting in high value cases for high net worth iniduals, for example, celebrities, sports personalities, entrepreneurs, business owners, directors, professionals and executives.

His missionary work took him all over Scotland, including the coastline of the Forth. It is said his arrival at this small natural harbour gave the place its name.Last weekend, artist Andrew Crummy, who lives in the village, organised three lsquosunset eveningsrsquo at the Boat Shore. Local musicians, singers, artists and actors gathered on the beach with an audience of fellow locals to share the sunset.I sadly couldnrsquot attend the first two but was able to make the last evening with some of my children. It was a wonderful mix of music and song, with a very funny short drama, and a setting sun as the backdrop.It was a poignant evening for myself, and I know for some others too a moment of reflection as well as coming together. I had planned to tell a tale about St Kenneth, but I changed my mind just before the event.Instead, I told a tale of a friendship between a tortoise and a butterfly and what sunsets meant to them. In story, anything is possible, and I made this tale to help ease someonersquos sadness in experiencing an ending.I was later askedI could share it, and so here is the story:There was once a tortoise who became friends with a butterfly. On the first day of their friendship, the tortoise invited the butterfly to sit with him on his favourite rock, to watch the sunset.However, Butterfly had no idea what a sunset was, and so when she saw the sun fall gradually from the sky she became concerned.ldquoWhatrsquos happening to the sun  she asked in a worried tone.ldquoItrsquos the sunset, said Tortoise, ldquoitrsquos when the sun goes down and ends the day.ldquoWhat, already! Thatrsquos it  asked Butterfly, horried. ldquoThis is just my first day being a butterfly and my days are over Tortoise smiled: ldquoNo my wee friend, itrsquos not all over. The sun will come back and there will be another day.But Butterfly remained anxious: ldquoHow can you be sure the sun will come back ldquoTrust me, I know. Irsquove seen many sunsets, said Tortoise. ldquoThe sun always comes back. Sometimes it takes longer than others, sometimes you canrsquot see the sun because of clouds, but it always s and makes another day.Butterfly was now reassured and so settled down to watch, as the sun dipped lower, painting the sky. She expected the sun to sizzle and the sea to steam when they touched each other, but of course that didnrsquot happen. The sun slid quietly below the horizon, leaving a trail of bright red and orange.ldquoThat was beautul, wasnrsquot it  Tortoise said.But Butterflyrsquos reply was unexpected: ldquoI think I donrsquot like sunsets very much.Tortoise curled up the wrinkles on his old face in surprise: ldquoWhy not, donrsquot you think it was spectacular, the way it painted the sky ldquoSuppose, but it was sad, really sad, said Butterfly.ldquoSad ldquoYes, because the sunset ends the day and thatrsquos sad. Endings are sad.Tortoise nodded in a way tortoises do when theyrsquore thinking: ldquoYes thatrsquos true, endings can be sad. But everything ends sooner or later. Nothing lasts forever.ldquoBut thatrsquos what I mean Tortoise, itrsquos so sad. I donrsquot want to sit and celebrate the end of something.Tortoise thought for a moment: ldquoAlthough endings can be sad, they also give meaning and value to our time. Without sunsets we would not treasure our days. Our le would become one long blah of sameness.ldquoA blah of sameness ldquoYes, my expression, smiled Tortoise proudly.ldquoBut thatrsquos easy for you to say, Tortoise, because you have more time than me, you will have more days.ldquoPerhaps, but that means your time is more precious than mine. And your sunsets are greater celebrations of your days.Butterfly thought about this. ldquoYou seem quite wise, Tortoise, she said, looking at her friend.ldquoYes, he replied immodestly, ldquoI do have that reputation. I suppose I have a lot of time to think, sitting on this rock.It began to get dark and colder.ldquoNow itrsquos time for our dreams. Soon there will be the sunrise, said Tortoise.ldquoSunrise  Is that when the sun s Tortoise nodded: ldquoYes, you see you donrsquot get a sunrise without a sunset. Although endings can be sad, they open the door to new beginnings. At the other side of a sunset there is a sunrise.Tortoise was indeed wise and Butterfly felt reassured by his wisdom.That summer, the two friends watched many sunsets together. They would share stories about their day as the sun went down. Then one evening, as flocks of geese were flying overhead, Butterfly spoke sadly.ldquoTortoise, I need to go. Itrsquos getting cold. Irsquom off to Africa. Do you think there are sunsets there ldquoIrsquom sure of it, replied Tortoise.ldquoI love sunsets now, said Butterfly. ldquoThey have shown me to treasure and celebrate my days. But I am sad this is our last one together.ldquoMe too, said Tortoise.The two friends sat together on their rock as the sunset commemorated their summer with a blaze of colour. Then they said goodbye.A new dawn now lay ahead for them both, for the end of one story is the beginning of another.And at the other side of a goodbye, there is a hello."},{"url":null,"title":"new-dunbar-grammar-school-head-boy-follows-mum-39-s-example","story":"Thomas Leitch has been named head boy at Dunbar Grammar School, nearly  years after his mum, Karen Leitch, nee MacKay, was named as head girl.Thomas, , is joined by head girl Georgie Cross, with the duo looking to strengthen communication in the school and its eco credentials.Thomas, whose mum was head girl in -, said: ldquoBecoming head boy was always something I have been interested in.ldquoI would not say there was a pressure but I was pushed forward by my mum, who was head girl when she attended the school.ldquoI always wanted to give something back and I have enjoyed my six years and felt it was right for me.Georgie, also , previously planned to leave school and work for a year before looking to go on to university.She said: ldquoI made the decision to stay on towards the end of S.ldquoI was involved in the pupil council and the set-up already within the school.ldquoI made my decision to stay on and decided I was not a person to sit idle or who wanted it nice and easy I want to make a dference while I can, especially when I consider myself quite a confident person.Interested pupils put their names forward to become head boy or head girl and outlined what skills and attributes they possessed which they felt made them suitable.A hustings then took place within the school before speeches were given in front of senior pupils encouraging them to vote for them.An interview in front of Claire Slowther, headteacher at the school, and the outgoing head boy and head girl Ben Dorin and Hannah Dickson, followed before the results were revealed.Now the duo, along with deputes Ben Totten, Niamh Goldie, Alicia Lancaster and Emma Welsh, are looking forward to a busy year ahead.Thomas, who plays scrum-half for the schoolrsquos rugby team, told the Courier that communication had been at the heart of his manesto.He said: ldquoI really focused on communication within the school and making sure it is not just senior management and senior pupils who get a say.ldquoIt is everyone and I got that point across and set up drop-in sessions so we have always got younger pupils to get involved.Similarly, Georgie, of East Linton, was keen to strengthen the schoolrsquos eco profile.She added: ldquoOne issue I would push, which the school is doing, is to make the school as eco as possible.ldquoThere is a lot of buzz around climate change.Mrs Slowther said there was a strong list of candidates for the two roles.She added: ldquoBoth Thomas and Georgie stood out with their confidence, commitment to the school and a real sense of what they wanted to bring to the school."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/10121511.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"gerry-cinnamon-announces-second-glasgow-hydro-gig-popular-demand","story":"The Castlemilk singer recently told how he is to play the SSE Hydro on December  following his insane TRNSMT set.This morning the venue confirmed a second leg of his Glasgow show the next night for December .EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FOR @GerryCinnamon!! #Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW... https:t.co JVHyTY pic yXRWuCIimPosting on social media the Hydro wrote: \"EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FORGerry Cinnamon.\"Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW...\"We told previously howCinnamon, , told fans they had \"lost it\"they didnt think hed soon play in Glasgow and his latest output confirmed two December gigs for lucky punters to get excited about.He will also play Aberdeen in November."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-incredible-moment-karaoke-singer-stuns-hamilton-pub-nessun-dorma-performance","story":"William Boyle had the usually rowdy crowd at Bar West at a hushed silence as he bellowed through Paottis famous tune.The clip was posted on social media by user Ann Robertson who hailed the performer.:Watch boy, , belt out Bohemian Rhapsody on Central Station pianoShe said: \"I love all music but my absolute fave song in the whole world is Nessun Dorma by Luciano Paotti.\"I hope I dont embarass this gentleman but he nailed this in Bar West tonight n should be proud.

The world is a much better place as a result but, unlike with family, the bonds and obligations of friendship are less clear-cut. Sometimes ties wither naturally, at others, rash or destructive relationships have actively to be severed. This is an unpleasant fact of le and one that Prince Andrew is discovering belatedly to his cost.For some time now, speculation has been mounting after the publication of a photo showing the Prince walking in a New York park with his friend, the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was recently found dead in a prison cell, where he awaited trial on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to engage in sex-trafficking.The headlines must have made the Palace shudder, their insinuations all too clear. After details of a US lawsuit mentioning him were released, a terse statement was issued distancing the Prince from historic accusations made against Epstein, and claiming that ldquoAny suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.:Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at BalmoralClose observers of Buckingham Palace might have noticed a cloud of dust around the flagpole as the house was shaken to its foundations. When the Daily Mail published footage recently showing the Duke of York ushering a young woman out of Epsteinrsquos Manhattan apartment in , a further statement was issued. The Duke, it said, ldquodeplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.Poor Prince Andrew. He is discovering what every child in the playground knows: that you are tarred and feathered with the same brush as those with whom you mix. If one of your gang throws a brick through a window, you are deemed guilty too, evenyou did nothing wrong.In the case of His Royal Highness, letrsquos put aside for a moment the suspicions his closeness to Epstein, following his release from prison, arouse. Bad enough that Andrewrsquos personal contacts are so dodgy they raise serious questions about his judgement, let alone his behaviour.If nothing , these images suggest one of two things: that the Prince was a loyal chum who stuck by Epstein, despite his ruined reputation and the risk it posed to his own. Or that, living as he did in a gilded cage, removed from real le and the consequences of any stupid decisions he made, he was utterly unconcerned about the effect their friendship might have on his prospects. When you are cocooned from birth in a cradle of privilege when you are feted, indulged, and pandered to by sycophants and liggers from the minute you can shake a rattle, it must be easy to believe you are above the normal rules and standards by which society works.Meeting in the park with Epstein was, at best, decidedly odd for someone in Prince Andrewrsquos position. Going to his apartment, however, where a stone satyr presides over the front door, was simply crazy. According to police who raided the property, they seized photos of underage girls. These and the fetishist decor would have led most ordinary visitors to make a swt exit.These images of the Duke of York date from the period when he was acting as British ldquoSpecial Representative for Trade and Investment. A bespoke role for an aimless aristocrat, it gave him licence to roam the globe, meeting fat cats in rich countries and opportunistic states in the hope that some of their wealth would find its way into Britainrsquos Treasury.:In Pictures: Commonwealth leaders gather for state dinnerDuring his deployment as an envoy, Prince Andrew made ious embarrassing ldquomissteps, among them some politically unwise associations. Nothing, however, could compare with being identied as one of Epsteinrsquos cronies, after which revelation he relinquished the post.As the grapevine quivers with anticipation over other high-profile names likely to be found in Epsteinrsquos fat address book, the Dukersquos predicament is increasingly grave. He can hide behind the Palace gates and hope the storm will pass, but this is a story that has been brewing for years. Until certain questions are satisfactorily answered, as far as hersquos concerned it is far from over.Doubtless, it will go against every royal instinct, but would he not be wiser to face the cameras, do an in-depth interview, and silence ndash perhaps even charm ndash his critics  In a situation like this, where unfettered gossip is fuelling supposition, Prince Andrew surely needs to explain his connection with Epstein and help suffocate the scandal. It would, of course, be a historic move. No member of the royal dynasty has ever voluntarily gone on record to put their side of a wildfire story, with the exception of Princess Diana. In her unforgettable, kohl-eyed interview with Martin Bashir, she was more focused on scoring points against Prince Charles than in illuminating her own often dubious actions.Sticklers for Palace protocol might feel sick at the thought of Prince Andrew going public. Even in the hands of the most measured journalist ndash Kirsty Wark, say, or Fiona Bruce ndash it would be viewed as stepping into the lionrsquos den, a suicidally reckless act. Added to which, the Windsors do not explain. They take a long view, recognising that the passage of time usually allows even the most unsavoury episodes to fade into oblivion.In this instance, however, that seems unlikely. So what is worse  Staying schtum, and waiting for more seedy revelations to be added to the blaze, or allowing the Duke to get ahead of the story, and give his version of events By remaining aloof, the Palacersquos response suggests it hopes to avoid further fallout. The implication of this is all too plain: royals might not be above the law, but its arm would have to be very long indeed to winkle one of them out of the front door and into a Black Maria. Inviting a Windsor to a police interview, let alone into a courtroom, would require Herculean effort, and a mountain of cast-iron evidence. By contrast,Andrew were willing to face, refute and defuse the rumours, it would be an act of bravery to restore family pride."},{"url":null,"title":"heat-pump-innovation-tackle-rural-fuel-poverty","story":"But, so far, ground-source heat pumps have been a niche way of supplying household energy used only in isolated locations.However, the technology could soon be part of the mainstream energy network in Scotland after a company pioneering the technology announced it is expanding operations north of the Border.Kensa are providers of ldquoshared ground loop arrays, a form of heating that provides each home with its own ground source heat pump, which the firm claims will mean lower bills and low-carbon heating with no heat loss.The company, based in Cornwall, said deployment of ground source heat pumps is particularly effective at alleviating fuel poverty in rural areas.Ground-source heat pumps work by running water through energy-absorbing pipes that are fed back into a house and used to heat a secondary fluid which turns into gas in a condenser.This gas is hot enough to provide heating and hot water from the taps without the need to connect to largescale infrastructure. The firm has enlisted the services of Matthew Black, previously a senior energy adviser at the Stirlingshire-based Fintry Development Trust, specialising in reducing carbon emissions and enhancing sustainability.Mr Black said: ldquoShared ground loop arrays are the most effective solution for delivering Scotlandrsquos ambitions for the decarbonisation of heat.

The race to decarbonise heat and transport is on.Currently celebrating its th anniversary, Kensarsquos heat pumps already provide heating to a number of sites, notably Orkney Islands Councilrsquos multipurpose facility Stromness Warehouse, which is heated using the sea, and the first and most northerly ground source installations in Unst, Shetlands.The Warehouse Buildings house the townrsquos library and customer services team, and provide a work base for staff from a iety of Council services, and draw heat from coils of pipes fixed to  stainless steel s ndash known as ldquopond-mats ndash sunk beneath a nearby pier to draw heat from the surrounding water.This has allowed the local authority to make substantial savings, thanks to the pound, cost of the electricity used to run the xkW heat pump over a -month period, compared to pound, for an oil-based system.It also means the Warehouse Buildings now produce substantially less greenhouse gas emissions thana more conventional source of heat was used.The carbon emissions linked to keeping the Warehouse Buildings warm are calculated to be six tonnes of CO per year, compared to more than  tonnesan oil boiler had been fitted.James Stockan, who chairs the councilrsquos Development and Infrastructure Committee, said at the time: ldquoAcross the country very few buildings currently use sea-source heating systems. ldquoAs the Warehouse Buildings stand close to the sea, it made sense to opt for this innovative approach to keeping them warm and I am very pleased the system is proving to be efficient and effective.ldquoAs wersquore using heat from the sea and electricity primarily from renewables, these buildings are an excellent example of how the council is making signicant steps towards creating buildings that are virtually carbon neutral in terms of their energy consumption.ldquoThis investment clearly demonstrates our commitment to making best use of one of Orkneyrsquos greatest assets ndash the abundant renewable energy we can harness from the wind and seas around us."},{"url":null,"title":"green-energy-debate-wind-farms-really-worth","story":"As reported in yesterdays The Herald, more than  Shetlanders have banded together in a bid to stop the proposed windfarm, which could be the UKs third biggestapproved, to be built across the archipelago, voicing concerns over the islands fragile bio-ersity and plans to desecrate ancient peatlands.If given the go-ahead, Viking Wind Farm could span  sq km of the islands leaving many islanders living close to or within the wingspan of the , ft turbines.A partnership between Scottish and Southern Energy and the council-owned Viking Energy Shetland, signed in , the windfarm is to largely be built on peatlands, raising fears over carbon release.The installation of the turbines and the infrastructure required to support them can fatally damage the peat through extraction, drainage and drying.Scottish peatlands are vital in climate change mitigation, acting as a sink for greenhouse gases, supporting bioersity and regulating water quality and flow.While peatlands cover only % of the worlds land area they contain nearly % of all carbon stored on land.Read more:The green energy debate: the case for onshore windCampaigners and experts warn that damage to the peatlands could be irreversible with degraded peat losing the ability to absorb carbon and potentially releasing thousands of tonnes back into the atmosphere.Renewable energy sources, such as wind, are seen to be inexhaustible, creating energy that can be harnessed for heating, electricity and transport.Scotlands wind turbines produced enough electricity between January and June  to power almost double the amount of homes - around . million - it already does, according to WWF Scotland.New research has revealed that onshore windfarms in Europe have the capacity to generate  times the energy currently produced. By building a further  million turbines, the entire world could be powered until .With Scotlands current greenhouse gas emissions target set to meet net-zero in , windfarms are said to be a key tool in reaching the goal. Butthe building and maintenance of these windfarms and their de- or recommission  years later destroys one of our greatest natural assets in the flight against climate breakdown, as well as others, what are their true cost Richard Lindsay, head of environmental and conservation research the University of East London said: \"There is a delicious irony in the fact that we build wind farms to reduce our carbon emissions. But some of the best places to build wind farms are peatlands, which are our biggest carbon store.\"Just cm of peat over a hectare holds the same amount of carbon as the same area of tropical rainforest. They have been capturing and storing carbon for up to  years so when you damage them, you release this long-term carbon store.\"Read more: The green energy debate: why wind power will never be the answerPeat is lost when the foundations for the turbines are dug out but it is the building of the roads that are the biggest risk to the peatlands, said Mr Lindsay, as they cut across their natural water s, causing them to dry out.Mr Lindsay said: \"As soon as you stop peat being water logged it will begin releasing carbon dioxide. Long term, we actually dont know what the effect is going to be.\"Other concerns, particularly in Shetland, include peat slides which occur after the peat has been destabilised through disturbance. In , in Galway, around km of peat slid off the hillside and travelled for km down the river system narrowly missing buildings.Mr Lindsay said: \"Actually, they are just slowly sinking roads.What they need to be doing is constantly building the road surface up again. The windfarm industry is not been very forthcoming on the extent of that issue.\"In terms of what is being done by energy companies to offset damage to the peat, the future remains unclear. Mr Lindsay said: \"Maybe theyre restoring some very damaged peatland but what are the long term effects of what theyre doing on the windfarm  Nobody can answer that question because were looking at potential carbon release over decades. There are a whole series of issues that have never really been investigated.\"And its not just an issue in Scotland. On the ridges of Northern Spains Cantabrian Mountains windfarms have been constructed on blanket bog, bisecting almost every one.But there could be an alternative: building onshore windfarms on agricultural land that is currently not being used to its full potential.In America and Europe, some windfarms are built on leased farmland, allowing farming, crops and grazing, to continue around them.Mr Lindsay said: \"There is incredible reluctance to turn agricultural land into multi-use but there is huge potential there.\"Scottish government planning policy now requires the use of a carbon payback calculator, developed by The James Hutton Institute and Aberdeen University, that assesses the carbon impact of windfarm developments by comparing the carbon costs of the developments with the carbon savings made.David Miller, Knowledge Exchange Coordinator for The James Hutton Institute who helped develop the calculator, told the Herald on Sunday: \"The starting point was to rely on modelling of the carbon costs ... after a few years you could begin to refine the models to say the carbon payback would take a certain number of years, originally calculated to be one estimate and then subsequently recalculated today.\"Calculations can y from seven to  years which far exceeds the -year le span of turbines, influencing the carbon calculations when considering the impact of re-turbining or reinstatement of the site.Mr Miller said: \"This is something still being worked on in Scotland because we recognise that protecting our peatland is a core element of Scotlands contribution to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.\"Onshore wind is playing its part meeting Scotlands climate targets, said Mr Miller, but more questions need to be asked.He said: \"After  years, as each of the developments come up for reconsideration, are there any which might have been put in the wrong place and might not be renewed because other sources [of energy] are becoming effective.\"We have an opportunity in the second half of the next decade for reconsidering whether some of the earlier developments are as efficient for production as originally intended. Hypothetically, it might turn out [that windfarms] are not as negatively impacting to landscapes as feared or there might be other areas where the impacts are greater than has been expected but it does mean that the story is not finished.\"Nothing comes without a cost, said Mr Miller, especially not our energyHe said: \"Energy isnt created, its just transferred. So its hard to imagine that genuinely, there is environmental and cost free energy. Its not just the magnitude but where and the nature of the trade-off. That explains why were felling trees instead of planting them as we did  years ago because of the understanding of the signicance of the peatlands for carbon storage.\""},{"url":null,"title":"3d-scanners-airports-put-end-liquid-restrictions","story":"Boris Johnson has announced plans for all major UK airports to introduce new D cabin baggage screening equipment.The equipment will provide security personnel with better images of cabin baggage and could mean in future passengers may be able to keep liquids and electrical equipment, like laptops, in their cabin baggage while it is screened.Government officials said that once in place, the ml liquid limit may no longer apply.The equipment will be rolled out over the next few years, with the Department for Transport requiring all major UK airports to have the technology by December  .The Prime Minister said: ldquoWe are home to the largest aviation network in Europe, with millions of people passing through our airports every year for work, holidays and family visits.ldquoWersquore set to streamline those trips with the rollout of this ground-breaking technology ndash cutting down hassle for travellers and improving security measures.ldquoBy making journeys through UK airports easier than ever, this new equipment will help boost the vital role our airports play in securing the UKrsquos position as a global hub for trade, tourism and investment.Passengers will still be required to remove their laptops and liquids from their cabin bags for security screening, until the equipment is introduced.Heathrow Airport is currently trialling the new D equipment, which will be gradually rolled out at other UK airports.Heathrow chief executive John Holland Kaye said: ldquoWersquore proud to be at the forefront of this new generation security equipment.ldquoTaking liquids out of hand luggage could end under plans for new airport scanning equipment through the UKrsquos only hub airport.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the technology could mean ldquoan end to passengers having to use plastic bags or rationing what they take away with them."},{"url":null,"title":"issue-day-greggs-vegan-roll","story":"So the vegan sausage roll was a hit It proved so popular, Greggs had to increase production to meet demand.And in March - two months after the firm released the product to much fanfare - it announced annual sales of pound billion for the first time, saying the snack helped sales surge by .%.Whatrsquos it made of Designed to mirror some of the sausage rollrsquos classic features, it features Greggsrsquo own bespoke Quorn filling, encased in ldquo layers of light and crisp puff pastry.Signicantly, it launched during ldquoVeganuary, when many people go vegan for the month of January.It sparked a bit of a fuss It met with a mixed response initially.

With their viciously sharp, curved horns, rather angry scowl and considerable girth, itrsquos probably best to give them a wide berth.Yet despite what he describes as having been ldquoduffed up by his stampeding herd, his water buffalo appear to hold the key to what must be Scotlandrsquos most inventive case of farm ersication yet.Andhis plan to create the first Scottish-made buffalo mozzarella reach fruition, herds of the beasts ndash which he insists are far more gentle than they may look ndash could eventually replace fields of more familiar grazing Friesians, supplying the creamy milk for his cheese and low fat, low cholesterol meat.Mr Mitchell, who runs Scotlandrsquos first buffalo farm, recently spent the day before the birth of his first child launching a major crowdfunding effort aimed at inspiring an ambitious pound, of investment to produce Scotlandrsquos first home-produced buffalo mozzarella.The funding would go towards building a manufacturing facility, milking parlour and slurry store to complement the Fe farmrsquos existing buffalo beef production, farm shops, event catering and cafeacute.It could see a Fe version of traditional southern Italian buffalo mozzarella ndash which must be made using milk from buffalos - land on supermarket shelves Aldi has already expressed interest in adding it to its stores.The mozzarella dream is now taking shape.

That meant the herd got jumpy and I got duffed up.With a herd of  startled buffalo to contend with, is it possible hersquos underplaying it slightly  ldquoWell, it was more like being gored a little bit. Well, actually a big bit, he concedes.The frightened herd dragged him  metres across a field and through a pond before a witness drove a pick-up truck across the field, desperately blaring the horn to scatter the beasts. It saved his le in the process.Mr Mitchell was left bleeding, bruised, with puncture wounds on his lower body and several weeks in hospital.He was, however, undaunted. Indeed, one of the farmrsquos larger specimens - a one-ton angry-looking infertile bull with vicious arm- curved horns and dubbed  despite, as Mr Mitchell points out, ldquofiring blanks - has become its mascot and is known for rolling on its side and having its belly tickled.It transpires that not only is he Scotlandrsquos first water buffalo farmer, and the first to survive a buffalo stampede, he is also the first to have a buffalo bull as a pet.He may be breaking new ground in farming, yet he is the sixth generation of his family to farm the land at Clemtrie near Kirkcaldy. His father died in a farming accident when he was a toddler, and he grew up watching his uncle keep the business going by rearing large white Duroc pigs and creating an award-winning pork and bacon business.Inspired, Mr Mitchell used his inheritance in  to invest in the countryrsquos first water buffalo herd, bought from a Welsh farm and imported from Romania.ldquoIt suited my skill set, he explains. ldquoMy passion is cattle, but lots of people are selling beef at farmersrsquo markets. One of the first things you learn about farming is that you must find a way to ersy, and you need a unique selling point.ldquoBuffalo provides healthy meat, has low cholesterol, low saturated fat and they produce amazing, rich, creamy milk.Paired with lush Scottish grass, and the result, he says, is an even better quality product with the potential of creating Scottish buffalo mozzarella that could even beat traditional Italian-made competitors.Indeed, an Irish farmrsquos buffalo mozzarella pearls, produced in West Cork using milk from its herd, was rated among the best in the by a  of  experts at the World Cheese Awards, beating  cheeses from  dferent countries.Itrsquos a success that Mr Mitchell believes can be replicated here. And hersquos hopeful that other dairy farmers who have faced a decade of low milk prices and falling demand, might join him on Scotlandrsquos own buffalo trail.Buffalo milk, he points out, also makes deliciously creamy ice cream and is commonly drunk around the world. It also has less cholesterol than dairy cow milk, has % more protein and has extra potassium which is said to help lower blood pressure.ldquoThey are robust, they will breed and continue to produce milk for three times as long as a normal dairy beast in conventional farming, he adds.And while the cows provide the milk, there is the potential to rear the male calves for beef ndash supplying rising demand from professional kitchens for buffalo steak, burgers, sausages and even a potential rival for Desperate Danrsquos cow pie, buffalo steak pie.As a result, the familiar sight of typical grazing dairy herds could soon be replaced by distinctive black water buffalo.ldquoA big part of my objective is to try to encourage farmers to produce buffalo milk in the future which can help us reach our goals, adds Mr Mitchell.ldquoThere is a current UK market of pound million and a  per cent year on year growth within the mozzarella market.ldquoAnd I strongly believe that Scotland needs a quality home produced alternative to imported mozzarella."},{"url":null,"title":"surge-help-children-caught-chernobyl","story":"But the programme that charted the Chernobyl nuclear plant explosion in  has led to an unexpected spin-off as a Scots charity that helps children affected by the disaster saw a huge increase in volunteers looking to help.For over ten years, the tiny Friends of Chernobylrsquos Children West Lothian charity has battled to raise the money needed to bring groups of around  children each to stay in the homes of ordinary families for a month at a time, over a five year period.A group of children from Bykhov in Belarus, one of the areas most contaminated by the radioactive fall-out from the nuclear disaster, are now coming to the end of a refreshing month-long stay in family homes in West Lothian, which has seen them enjoy the kind of summer many Scots children taken for granted.There have been trips to outdoor centres and a castle, theyrsquove explored heritage sites including New Lanark and ndash a first for the children whose Belarus home is mostly pancake flat ndash climbed a hill.For four busy weeks which have included trips to the doctor and dentist for a health check-up, they have been able to live without being haunted by Chernobylrsquos deadly legacy.But while itrsquos a bitter-sweet moment for the small charity, support has come from the five-part HBO dramatisation of the disaster.ldquoWe were looking for new families to step in for next year, so I placed a social media advert on the last day of Chernobyl being screened, says group organiser Kenny Turnbull.ldquoWe would normally struggle to find families who can commit to five years.

In some areas, contamination was at the same level as that of the official Chernobyl contamination zone.Studies have claimed the children whose parents were exposed to radioactive fallout in Belarus have twice as many mutations in their DNA as British children, raising their risk of genetic diseases, spontaneous abortions and congenital malformations.There have also been increased incidence of thyroid cancer, while Chernobylrsquos legacy is said to have sparked high levels of depression, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health problems.The positive impact of spending a little time away from their humble wooden homes and the poverty that grips many of their lives, is often plain to see.ldquoEven in one visit you see a huge improvement in their health, Mr Turnbull explains. ldquoWe take a picture of every child before they come, and towards the end of their stay you can really see the dference ndash they look much healthier and happier in space of one visit.ldquoOne little girl was so shy, frightened and introverted when she first came, but you can see over the five years how she grows to become much more sociable and healthier.ldquoOne of the things we see most is an improvement in their confidence. They are smiling.The group makes regular visits to Belarus to meet families in their own homes and to deliver packages of vitamins ndash which the children take every day ndash food and to offer help with living conditions.ldquoUsually children come from wood houses with an outside toilet and a well, he adds. ldquoEven basic things like washing their face means they have to go outside to get a bucket of water.ldquoIn winter, the weather can be - and in summer + ndash it can be a harsh le.ldquoWhen we visit, we take food and ask to put it in the fridge.

Some research even claimed it could en le spans by up to two years.The break is said to give their immune system respite from battling contaminates, leaving them better placed to fight viruses and bugs.ldquoWe have a little girl whorsquos now  years old and was diagnosed with bone cancer two years ago, adds Mr Turnbull. ldquoAnother lost her little brother to cancer when he was only two years old.ldquoItrsquos harder to see the mental health impact.

These are steps that can immediately be implemented, are equal to the scale of the climate crisis and will help make Scotland a better place to live and work.With most buildings in Scotland still heated by fossil fuels and many of them leaky and inefficient, changing how we heat our homes is a key next step for Scotlandrsquos journey to net-zero climate emissions.A heat pump sector deal should be created to accelerate the adoption of electric heating from modern, efficient heat pumps and to maximise the opportunities for economic growth found in manufacture and installation.Between now and  we need to retrofit the vast majority of our existing buildings to make them zero-carbon. This means accelerating the Scottish Governmentrsquos energy efficiency programme, using regulation and public funding to improve our leaky and draughty buildings.Unbelievably, we are adding to this retrofit task every year, by putting up new buildings that are not zero-carbon, despite the technology being available and the costs being marginal.From now on, Scottish building standards should ensure that all new homes are zero-carbon rated, and that buildings undergoing any major refurbishment have their carbon emissions improved.These policies will mean people living warmer, more comfortable lives with lower fuel bills.Scotlandrsquos land has a vital role to play in our climate emergency response.Regional land-use plans can ensure that every part of Scotlandrsquos land contributes, whether that is through the recovery and restoration of natural habitats, the replanting of forests, or through efficient and climate-friendly productive agriculture.Our farmers need a helping hand with this vital role. Grants, loans and funding for training opportunities should be increased, helping farmers purchase new machinery and equipment that enables them to be more efficient and precise in bringing about a climate-friendly modernisation of Scottish agriculture.Public guidance on diets that are sustainable, climate-friendly and healthy should provide us all with expert advice that helps us reduce our impact on the climate.Achieving all these changes to our lives requires investment and we should begin by harnessing what the public sector already spends.Every year, the Scottish public sector spends pound billion, which should be mobilised to develop demand for new climate-friendly products, business and services.Similarly, the new Scottish National Investment Bank should have the climate emergency in its DNA ndash its project investments must be consistent with Scotlandrsquos climate goals.Climate change should be at the heart of Scotlandrsquos economic strategy.A new set of Green City Region Deals can fund the infrastructure that will enable the transformation of our cities, increasing productivity, making them healthier, more attractive and more liveable. Signalling that Scotlandrsquos city centres will be vehicle-emission free by  will drive the market for zero-emission vehicles, while also supporting public transport, walking and cycling.A focus on establishing Scotland as a global centre of net-zero industrial expertise will provide our best chance of competing in global industrial markets ndash and our group has recommended the establishment of a public-interest company that can develop the necessary infrastructure for commercial carbon capture and storage as a first step.These are our recommendations. They respond to the climate crisis and they are actions that will benefit the economy and people of Scotland.More will be required, but transformative actions like these are needed now.

Given its outward-reaching and positive attitude to the EU, and the desire to see Scotland remain at the heart of Europe and with a seat at the United Nations, perhaps it there ever was to be a name change, a better reflection on where the SNP stands would see it known as the Scottish International Party.Ruth Marr,Stirling.ldquoWHEN I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean. The Humpty-Dumpty theory of language is obviously endorsed by Mark Smith.I am an unapologetic supporter of Scottish independence, but I never describe myself as a nationalist. Why  Because this word must be the most ambiguous in the English language, so much so that it has long ceased to have any practicalin discourse. It has no taxonomic value.Just think: Nelson Mandela was a nationalist, so also were Radovan Karadzic, Ho Chi Minh, Mladko Radic, Slobodan Miloscaronevi#, Mahatma Gandhi, and Adolf Hitler. A word that includes such contradictory definitions is meaningless.Mr Smith is hideously wrong in claiming that Anglophobia is at the heart of the SNP. In fact, many of its supporters are English.One cannot be a true internationalist without recognising the existence of nationalism.Brian Quail,Glasgow G.THE England Get Out of Scotland Banner, the subject of comments made recently by Nicola Sturgeon is not racist, bigoted or anti-English. The banner is a copy of an older Irish banner saying the same and is all about the conquest of Scotland by England in  when the parcel of rogues in a nation, our nobles, accepted the equivalence of more than pound, in bribes to sell out Scotland. The banner in its true meaning is calling for English institutions like Westminster, the Bank of England, the BBC, the English Monarchy and the Ministry of Defence at Faslane with Trident to leave Scotland so that we are no longer a province of England, no longer a colony of England.With regard to English people who live, work and retire in Scotland, they are always welcome. It is a mark of the timidity of some that such a banner has been unfairly criticised when Boris Johnson when Editor of the Spectator in  allowed a poem to be published that talked about putting the Scots in ghettoes and calling for our extermination and hardly an eyebrow was raised. That is truly racist and Scotophobic and should be condemned by all right-minded people but very few voices are raised.The banner will be shown in future with no apologies from me and I will give the final word to Police Scotland to whom complaints have been made about the banner when it was shown. When I explained what the banner was about they allowed it to be displayed as we had not broken any law.Sean Clerkin,Barrhead.I AM engaged in correspondence with the Electoral Commission about the conduct of a further independence referendum. The Commission appears to be unaware that in Scotland the people are sovereign and not the Scottish Parliament. Therefore the Commission requires to consult the Scottish people about such issues as yes no and remain stay questions also the need for a two - thirds majority to settle a constitutional question.Thus there may need to be a two stage referendum, the first stage consulting the sovereign Scottish people about how an independence referendum should be conducted.The SNP, allied with the unelected Greens, controls the Scottish Parliament and hatea being outranked by the Scottish people.William Durward,Bearsden.CORRESPONDENTS Philip Adams and Alan Fitzpatrick , express a preference for the question in the next independence referendum to ask whether the voter wants to remain or leave. Unfortunately, such a question would be legally unsound.

It follows thatthe citizens of Scotlandvote for independence there is then no UK to break away from. The UK disappears, to be replaced by the old new nation states of Scotland and England.

If you see a hedgehog lay still in the open, or with flies round it orit’s struggling to walk properly, it is in urgent need of rescue.”If you find a hedgehog in need of help the society suggest you use gardening gloves or an old towel to collect the animal, placing it inside a high sided cardboard or plastic box with the towel or an old t-shirt in the bottom for it to hide under. Take the box indoors away from flies.If the hedgehog isn’t bleeding, offering a warm wrapped hot water bottle is good first aid, but do make sure there is room for it to get offit gets too warm and ensure the bottle is not allowed to go cold.Offer some meaty cat or dog food and water but don’t force feed it.Once you’ve done that, call a local hedgehog rescue centreyou know of one, or BHPS on    for further advice and local contacts.If it’s a baby, Fay says you should check for siblings.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The exhibition-on-wheels is travelling around Scotland highlighting the importance of remembrance.\"  Poppyscotland’s ‘Bud’ hits the road to tell the poppy’s storyviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"A healthier way to travel...and the government hopes more of us will get back on our bikes or walk for short journeys, rather than taking the car.\"  Have your say on Scotland’s National Transport Strategy viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“Hoglets don’t usually come in ones,” she said. “If a hoglet it is trouble, its brothers and sisters may well need help too, so do look around vicinity for others.” She added: “Acting quickly could literally mean the dference between le and death.

The additional roles are part of package of improvements agreed by councillors in January.However, a new permit scheme is also being introduced to move business waste away from recycling centres to create more space for new recyclable materials to improve services to householders.While most businesses pay the necessary fees to dispose of their waste and recycling responsibly, the current open access to recycling centres means some business waste is being presented as household waste so that it can be processed free of charge.To tackle this, a new permit scheme is one of the measures being introduced next year to prevent such abuse. Under the new scheme householders using commercial type vehicles - vans, pick-ups, minibuses or trailers - to take materials to recycling centres will require a permit to do so.The permits will be free of charge and can be used at any of the  recycling centres operated by the council.Households will be able to apply for the free permits in advance and a yearrsquos supplywill be issued at one time to minimise inconvenience.Permits can be applied for online or by post at any time of the year and will be valid for  months.Aberdeenshire Council does not expect the new scheme to have an impact on most householders as permits will not be required for cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs or xs, unless they tow a trailer or a horse box.Permits can be obtained for trailers up to  x  ft in size.Certain types of vehicle typically used by businesses will not be permitted at HRCs, specically those over . tonnes gross weight, tippers, tractors, large trailersand vehicles with twin wheels or more than four wheels.Aberdeenshire Councilrsquos Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: ldquoThe approval of the new permit system is very good news as it will allow us to make space for more recyclable materials at recycling centres and improve services for householders.ldquoMost households will not be affected by the permit system at all as cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs and xs will continue to have unlimited access to recycling centres.ldquoWe are keen to minimise inconvenience to those householders who use commercial type vehicles or trailers to take materials to recycling centres.\"Only one application is required to get a yearrsquos supply of permits and we have also increased the number of permits to  per year to make sure householders have enough permits to cover the grass cutting season.ldquoWe will be communicating the details of the new permit scheme over the coming months, so there will be plenty of time to apply for the permits before the new scheme starts.ldquoBusinesses will be provided an alternative service at waste transfer stations, and with a lower price for recycling, will be encouraged to segregate and recycle as much of their waste as possible.ldquoWe will be monitoring closely how the new schemes settle in and can tweak them in future based on feedback received.More information about the new recycling permit scheme is available on www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk recyclingcentrepermitsdata-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aberdeenshire Provost Bill Howatson said armed forces personnel make huge sacrices to keep us all safe\"  Aberdeenshire Council achieves gold award for work with armed forces, families, veterans and cadets viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"August ,  at : amCOMPETITION: WIN A PAIR OF TWEED LAMPSHADES FROM ORKNEY TWEED  The Orcadian has teamed up with Orkney Tweed to offer readers the chance to win a pair of Orkney Tweed lampshades, worth £.

Free parking of up to one hour will apply as usual in metered car parks over the winter period.Tankerness Lane will be closed to vehicles throughout the works, with one-way systems in place at ious times on Broad Street and Palace Road — with Victoria Street closed to vehicles for approximately five weeks from  January . Pedestrian access will be maintained throughout.The council has said the key aspects of the Place and Spaces project are to improve the area at the bottom of the Strynd and top of Castle Street, provide a new path to the war memorial to enhance it as a place to stop and reflect on the signicance of the monument and improve the head of Victoria Street to encourage more people into this part of the town.Depute council leader, councillor Leslie Manson, said: “The works carried out in Kirkwall’s town centre through our Townscape Heritage Initiative Scheme have given our streets and buildings a much-needed new lease of le, whether that be improvements to the shop fronts or the attractive new paving at the head of Broad Street.“This latest phase is aimed at improving the entrance to Victoria Street to encourage more shoppers and visitors to take a wander down this street — a long-held aspiration of the businesses that are situated there.“There will, of course, be some inevitable disruption, but we’ve worked hard to ensure that this is kept to a minimum, including suspending works for the Christmas period.

Christ, how many times  IT’S RAPE, you troglodytes.However discomfiting these examples may be, they have nothing on the disingenuous coverage of Boris Johnson’s encounters with Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. I mean, we could all see him sitting beside Merkel as protesters screamed “Liar” and “Stop Brexit” we could all see him stick his feet up on Macron’s side table like a self-entitled brat .The most inexperienced of analysts would have understood that turning up in Berlin with bluster and braggadocio, but no actual plan B was hardly a masterstroke and that Merkel and Macron’s agreement to give him a month to come up with aalternative was just a tactic to keep him occupied while they get on with important affairs of state.And yet the Express and the– cheerleaders for the worst Prime Minister in history – presented his bilateral talks as a triumph. The Express carried a photo of him raising his arms behind a fence with the headline “Brexit Victory Salute”, ashe were Winston Churchill giving his “Finest Hour” speech rather than a floppy-haired fop back from a European jolly. Thewent with the headline “Johnson Demands Fresh Border Plan”while columnists lined up to explain how he had seen off Macron’s attempts to intimidate him and had reset the EU negotiations. Neither paper pointed out that Macron reiterated that the Irish backstop was “indispensable” and that this is the position they have held ever since Theresa May’s withdrawal deal was negotiated.Their spin – or as Byrne would doubtless prefer us to frame it, “lie” – would be troubling at the best of times but as we are hurtling towards a No Deal, it is utterly irresponsible. At a time when journalists should be pointing out the perils of his misplaced ebullience, many are egging him on, feeding his self-delusion.In her MacTaggart Lecture, Byrne called out the inadequacy of much of our current news coverage and scrutinised some of the reasons for it. She blamed our contemporary leaders – May, Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn – for refusing to submit themselves to scrutiny as previous leaders including Margaret Thatcher did, and went on to compare the way Johnson does his own pieces to camera as Vladimir Putin-style politics.But she also castigated news organisations for believing audiences no longer crave forensic investigations and for talking down to young people. Citing Carole Cadwalladr’s Facebook Cambridge Analytica investigation and the popularity of hard-hitting podcasts, she said there was still an appetite for in-depth exposés, although she didn’t point out that they require resources as well as courage – and that such resources are not widely available.Finally, Byrne talked fearlessly about the need for more ersity: for more women, certainly but much more pressingly for more BAME employees. Although she rejected the phrase “pale, male and stale”, pointing out that many middle-aged white men make excellent programmes, she said TV made by a clique of posh boys was never going to challenge the status quo. “When you change who is making TV, you change TV,” she said.Much of what Byrne raised, we see in action every day the cabal of male presenters who revel in their outmoded attitudes . And the courting of a younger demographic with nattily-dressed presenters, bite-sized news items and YouTube influencers when what many of those who are politically engaged want is to be confronted with new perspectives on giant issues such as climate change. There are exceptions, of course: Jon Snow stands out as a journalist willing to challenge the prevailing orthodoxy, and Five Live journalist Emma Barnett has earned a reputation for skewering political interviewees.But time and time again, especially in  shows and radio phone-ins, broadcasters yield to the demand of  balance, treating journalism as a stand-off between two opposing sides rather than a quest for truth. Nor is BBC Scotland immune to these problems though much of the new channel’s output has been admirable, it is still overwhelmingly white. Meanwhile, The Nine has twice invited alt-right mouthpiece Brendan O’Neill to spout his anti-scientic climate change-denying views. Shouldn’t we be better than this As the spectre of a no-deal Brexit casts its increasingly dark shadow, there does appear to be a collective raising of the game. Over the past week or so, the BBC has been running a series of news packages analysing what a no-deal Brexit might mean in terms of the supply of fuel and medicine and the slaughter of animals that can no longer be exported.But as Byrne says, whatever happens with Brexit, our country is undergoing seismic changes and our broadcasters must do much morethey are to play a crucial role in holding those responsible to account. “We must find courage in this time of crisis,” the Scot said. “We must unite to use the power of television to protect democracy because it is being seriously undermined.” The following day, the Express gave its default response, which was to refer to “an online backlash” invisible to all but them.As Johnson engages in some pre-US trade talk willy-waving – insisting he will tell the US president “the NHS is not on the table” – Byrne’s rallying cry could not be more relevant. As men who couldn’t be trusted to tie their own shoelaces set the global agenda, the public is being failed. We need journalists to be less cowed. But we also need broadcasting companies to be willing to take risks, and newspaper owners to be interested in the actual news. And we need this to happen sooner rather than later. Because the hour of reckoning is nigh.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"solidarity not subsidy underpins union between scotland and england brian monteith","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Politicians should nurture ties among people that have more in common than drives them apart, writes Brian MonteithScottish unionists who bang on about a union idend are playing a very dangerous game, one that risks playing directly into nationalist hands and leaving them without arguments for remaining in the United Kingdom.Last week we had the annual announcement of the Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotlandfigures and with it the usual claims and counter claims by unionists and nationalists seeking to gain partisan advantage from the data provided. Please note before I go any further that the information is released by the Scottish Government it is prepared by its own statisticians and carries with it the First Minister’s seal of approval, even though she could not be bothered to give this key publication the time of day. Over the years the methodology has been refined to take account of any possible gaps in the information presented, while politically motivated hoaxes, such as the whisky export tax, or “missing” allocations of public spending projects like Crossrail and HS have been debunked. Importantly, allowance is also made for looking at the figures with or without tax revenues from oil and gas production.The essential finding was that for the period of - Scotland had a public sector deficit of £. billion, slightly down on the year before. Average tax revenue per head was demonstrated to be £ lower in Scotland than in the rest of the UK, while spending per head has climbed to £,. Put together, these two figures define the fiscal transfer of £, per man woman and child that takes place seamlessly between the UK Treasury and the Scottish Government, including apportioned UK spending for defence and other mutual services Scotland benefits from.By themselves the GERS figures cannot and do not sayan independent Scotland could be economically sustainable. What they tell us is where the likely starting point would be were we to decide to leave the UK, before any changes could be made in Scottish government policy to alter the existing landscape. There would be notional Scottish spending of £.bn supported by an income of only £.bn – giving the estimated deficit of £.bn. Against Scotland’s Gross Domestic Productthe deficit was  per cent, compared to a deficit of . per cent for the UK. To put this in context Scotland would have the largest deficit as a share of GDP in the developed world, certainly the worst in Europe and way beyond the EU’s guideline limit of  per cent for its members.Taking account of the regional figures available via the UK’s Office of National Statistics there can be no doubt that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland provide a deficit against England’s surplus that leaves the whole UK in deficit, albeit reducing. Given the foregoing, Scotland’s receipt of this fiscal transfer is obviously not unique, indeed within England itself the tax revenues from the three regions of London, the South East and East notionally transfer to support all the other English regions, including the North West, North East, Yorkshire and West Midlands.This is the nature of fiscal transfers, where economically prosperous nations or regions fund a pool that is used to support those parts of the UK that are enduring harder times. Contributions and withdrawals to and from this pool will y over time, with some requiring help one year – or even decades – while at other times being the source of community municence.It is dangerous to justy participation in a country purely on economic terms while ignoring the greater historical, social and cultural bonds or strategic interests that make an entity greater than the sum of its parts. It is a good thing that when oil revenues collapsed the UK was able to ensure there was no catastrophic impact on Scottish public finances – as there would have beenScotland had voted for independence in . It is not a good thing for Scotland to run a large deficit and be reliant on the UK to make that forever possible.To justy Scotland’s place in the UK because it receives a “union idend” of nearly £, per person is like accelerating towards a blind summit, unaware of the hard landing that awaits politically.If unionists rely upon a figure to define the union idend then they must accept that correspondingly there will in some years be a union premium – a time when Scotland’s allocated tax revenues are greater than the spending it makes. Personally, I think this is a good thing, for it is what the union idend is really all about. It is a process, not a number a process that is built upon British solidarity, a shared experience of helping each other in times of great need from our hardest endeavours, creative genius or even just fortunate bounty.Indeed we can see from the official figures over the last  years that there have been times when Scotland has contributed to the maintenance of the UK and others when it has itself been supported. Since  Scotland has contributed a net £bn to the UK in real terms – a figure that shall undoubtedly be cancelled out by next year’s GERS figures. I know it is hard to imagine at a time when the SNP Scottish Government demonstrates with impressive regularity its ability to miscalculate it own economic forecasts and deliver poorer results in too many sections of the pubic services year-on-year – but the deficit could eventually change were the politicians to alter their centralising and incompetent ways.The private sector of the Scottish economy does relatively well despite the Scottish Government, rather than because of it. It could, with a change towards lower taxes and fewer regulations, achieve greater results and therefore contribute higher revenues while spending is restrained. When that day comes where stands the argument about the union idendit is measured by price alone How then will the argument fare that we should remain in the UK because of the Union Dividend when the GERS figures allow the SNP to complain about a similarly ridiculous “Union Premium”  Unionist politicians should stop focussing on the number and start concentrating on the shared benefits of giving and receiving help amongst people that have more in common than drives them apart. They should instead talk about how the deficit is reduced and how Scotland can help the weaker parts of the Union just as we have been helped when we needed it.Brian Monteith MEP is editor of ThinkScotland.org©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"parents share update on fate of boy 6 who fell five storeys from tate modern","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The child, who was visiting from France, suffered injuries including a brain bleed and spinal, leg and arm fractures after being allegedly thrown by a -year-old boy from a th-floor viewing  at the art gallery on August .His parents issued a statement to the organiser of a fundraising page set up on their behalf which has received donations of almost £,.They said: \"Our son has already undergone two long and dficult operations. - Mice droppings and mould found at Michelin-starred The Kitchin in Edinburgh\"He is stabilised, but we still do not know the full extent and severity of his injuries.

While it is yet to be approved at Holyrood’s business bureau, the motion is expected to say: “That the Scottish Parliament agrees that the UK should in no circumstances leave the EU on a no-deal basis.”Mr Russell said: “When the new session starts we will be less than two months away from a catastrophic no-deal which the UK government appears now to be actively pursuing.“It is essential that the Scottish Parliament has the opportunity to have its say while there is still time to stop this disaster from happening. It is more important than ever for politicians and parties to work together in Scotland and across the UK to do as much as we can to make the new Prime Minister change course.”He added: “For the Scottish Tories this could be a defining moment. Their leader in the Scottish Parliament says she is opposed to a no-deal Brexit. This is an opportunity to make that opposition crystal clear and unambiguous. Crashing out of the EU without a deal is in no one’s interest.”Scottish Conservative MSP Donald Cameron said: “The Scottish Conservatives agree that the best way to leave the EU is with a deal.“That’s why all  of our MPs backed a deal, and are continuing to back the Prime Minister’s efforts to get another deal secured. If the SNP and Labour believe that a no-deal would be as bad as they say it is, they need to explain why they have continually blocked attempts to get a deal over the line.”Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie and Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie both confirmed their parties would back the motion. Mr Rennie said: “The overwhelming majority of the public across the whole of the UK are opposed to a no-deal Brexit.“This parliamentary debate is an opportunity for all parties to come together and urge the Prime Minister to change course.

The disease can lead to early loss of le, cause preventable sight loss in working age people, and is a major contributor to kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and even amputation, yet the illness is often preventable by adopting healthier lestyle changes.The new Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.Cullybackey patient Thelma Shanks from Cullybackey was referred onto the programme this year. She said: “There is a history of hypertension and diabetes in my family. “Several of my paternal aunts sadly passed away due to complications that came with the disease, and my mum was found to be diabetic following admission to hospital for routine tests. “I was born in London, but grew up in my parent country, Jamaica. I ed to the UK for good in , and my husband and I moved to Northern Ireland, where all my children were born, in . “As a nation, we from the Caribbean tend to be a bit more susceptible to diabetes than others, so it wasn’t a complete surprise to be told I was at risk of developing the disease. “I am also a trained doctor so despite having given up my profession when I had children, I have knowledge of the medical risk.“I have a wonderful busy family le. I have four children, all of which I home schooled, and of course, their needs always came before mine. “When you’re running a busy house and looking after everyone  it’s easy to forget to look after yourself. However, in  when I heard that a health fair was coming to the area I decided to go along. For a small fee they carried out multiple tests which showed I had hypertension or high blood pressure. “I decided to make an appointment with my GP who put me on a number of drugs, first Irbesartan, then Amlodipine and finally a diuretic to bring my blood pressure under control.“I realised I needed to be more careful with my diet and tried to be a bit healthier but I admit it was a bit half-hearted. TESTS“My blood sugar levels were border-line they weren’t going down but they weren’t going up either, so I thought everything was all right. I was having routine check-ups with my nurse at this stage so I was on her radar and having blood tests taken intermittently. In April  I had my regular tests done and then hopped on a plane to London. “It was my daughter’s birthday and I had decided to treat her by going away for the week. We had just made it to the hotel when I received a phone call from my nurse. “She said tests showed my sugar levels were up and I was actually diabetic, which was the wake-up call I needed. Let’s just say it wasn’t quite the luxury week that I had planned! My daughter certainly ate well, but no sugar passed my lips that trip. “Needless to say, I had the blood tests repeated soon after our , and was delighted to learn that due to my dietary sacrices, my blood sugar levels had again receded into the ‘pre-diabetic’ band.“Prior to our trip away, my doctor had called me. She said there was a new Diabetes Prevention Programme starting soon in my area being run by the Public Health Agency. She askedI would be interested and of course I agreed.“The class has  others in it and we meet on Wednesday afternoons. There are eight women and two men, and together we re-learn what we should be eating, what to avoid, and how to step up our exercise routines. “I’ve found it really helpful because everyone is in the same boat and we can share our experiences and encourage one another. “Each week we build on the goals of the previous weeks, paying attention to diet and exercise and gaining strength from each other.“I used to believe that running after a busy family was exercise enough but now I’m walking every other day, trying to increase my pace and my distance. My daughter and I often walk together and I try to keep up with her. LONG TERM“One day I managed , steps in one walk and  of those miles were uphill. I’m trying to make long term changes and make sure these become habits I’ll stick to for the rest of my le. So far I’ve lost  kg, and my exercise levels have increased signicantly too. My blood sugar levels have decreased, but more importantly I feel better physically and psychologically. “The Diabetes Prevention Programme and the team who deliver it have been amazing. I’m looking forward to seeing a new me at the end of the nine and a half month course.”Thelma was referred onto the Diabetes Prevention Programme by her GP Dr Jean McCaughern, Maine Medical Practice, CullybackeyThe practice serves around , patients that live within a six mile radius of the surgery. Dr Jean McCaughern joined the surgery around  years ago and was placed in charge of the practice’s diabetes clinic.At first she managed this alone, today she heads up this specialist clinic with the help of two practice nurses. She does this alongside her normal GP responsibilities.She said: “When I first started the clinic around % of our patients were diabetic and that included those who had both type  and type  diabetes. Today that figure has more than doubled. In  we have a prevalence rate of .%. That’s how quickly the disease is on the rise. “Often patients don’t realise just how serious the illness is. I have overheard patients saying ‘I just have a touch of diabetes’ or ‘I only have diabetes’, but it’s a serious illness which can cause deterioration of vision, contribute to heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, and vascular problems which at their worst can lead to amputation.“Patients of mine have had all these problems and more. The reality is dferent to the perception and it’s only when dficulties start that people begin to understand what living with diabetes can mean. The longer you have the disease, the more likely you are to have any one of those complications.“Having diabetes presents practical problems too. In some cases the DVLA can revoke people’s drivers licensestheythey believe there is poor management of diabetes. This can include raised sugars, but more importantly sugar levels dropping and causing confusion in patients as is would be unsafe to drive.“For some people having diabetes is out of their control. Those with Type  diabetes have no choice but to manage it using medication. “For others who spot heightened blood sugar levels early, termed pre-diabetic, they have a window of opportunity to reverse or delay a diagnosis of Type  diabetes through healthy eating and exercise. That’s who the Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at and who it can help.“Once higher sugar levels are discovered, the earlier people can make changes and the higher the chance they have of reversing the outcome. Sometimes, it’s not about changing the diagnosis but delaying it by a decade or so. “The longer you can hold it off the longer you can hold off the complications that come with it. “It’s not all bad news though, having diabetes, whether Type  or Type , is largely manageable either by medication, treatment or diet. “Insulin, used primarily for treating type  diabetes, lowers blood sugar levels when diet and exercise alone aren’t sufficient, but the effectiveness of these medications depends on how early the disease is diagnosed and the size of the dose.“I was happy to get involved in the Programme. Having an interest in diabetes I was approached by the Public Health Agency at the operational stage to look at the programme’s viability in my area. I’m a big supporter. “So far I’ve referred around  people from the practice onto the programme which educates and empowers people of the contents of foods, the need to exercise and develop better eating patterns. “Often I’ve heard people say once they have to go on a special diabetes diet but that’s not the case, it’s just healthy eating, it’s the way we should all be eating.“As far as the success of the programme goes, it’s a little early to tell. The first cohort of people started on the programme in May and early results are positive. Certainly weight loss as a group has occurred and people have more knowledge of food, portion control and exercise.“So, there are benefits for all and for some the course is working really well. When you join the programme as a group you bond as a group, you encourage each other, you don’t want to let your group members down. “That shared experience and cohesiveness is a real motivator and works across all ages and all groups. For many the programme offers them a chance to turn a future diagnosis around and gives them the tools to change their future. “That can be le changing and what the programme is designed to do”.KEY FACTSThe Diabetes Prevention Programme is run by the Public Health Agency.It is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.The Diabetes Prevention Programme is delivered over a nine month period and is free of charge.It is facilitated by health coaches who offer help and assistance to participants, helping them change their lestyle, diet and physical activity with the aim of postponing and even preventing type  diabetes.For more information on the ‘Diabetes Prevention Programmeemail your local Health Trustdiabetespreventionni@northerntrust.hscni.netst  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2094373.jpg--.jpg?1566376242000\n","title":"talent galore at music mania event","story":"Broughshane was alive with the sound of music last weekend when the Music Mania event rolled into the village.Local people were given the chance to take to the stage and show off their musical abilities and talents, both with instruments and voice.Many turned out to not only take part, but also to watch on and support those on stage.Bob Esler was the compare for the evening where there was live music on stage from pm with an open mic session and a BBQ proving popular with everyone.

These included the Ulster Farmers’ Union, the Countryside Alliance Ireland, NI Master of Hounds and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, all of whom allegedly received invitations before Easter.Janice Watt from the League Against Cruel Sports said: “It’s clear from the meeting today that many farmers are frustrated by the way the hunts are acting. The majority do not give permission for hunting to take place on their land, yet trespass and damage by huntsmen are all too common. “Some farmers have told us that after they banned hunts from their land they were threatened and intimidated, which is completely unacceptable. “st century farms have no need for fox hunting, as has been made clear today. Claiming that farmers need their assistance was the last argument available to hunters, but today’s conference has proven that it is not true. It is time this barbaric, unnecessary blood-sport was banned in Northern Ireland.”“Political representatives from most parties attended, including Sean Rodgers , Jim Wells , Patrick Brown , Henry Reilly , Robert Burgess . The meeting was also attended by the PSNI who provided invaluable advice to everyone who attended. “Hunting with dogs remains legal in N. Ireland, despite a recent poll showing that only one in five people believe it should be. As part of their Election Manesto, the League have asked all electoral candidates to pledge to support introducing legislation to ban fox and stag hunting in N. Ireland, which has already be banned in England Scotland and Wales for over  years.Steven McLinn, a farmer attending the session said: “Farmers are fed up with the hunts treating our land as their own.

Neils grandmother is in the centre of the centre row.He said: “A good friend of mine owned a bar in Dromore, she gave me an old bottle that said ‘ginger beer’ on it. It was meant as a joke because I’m ginger, but it ended up starting a fascination with bottles.“I started looking into where the bottles were made and background to them.“My original intent was to collect a bottle from every county, but soon I found out there are a lot of bottles out there, probably  known bottles. They are very dficult to find. I would hunt through antique shops, flea markets, auctions and that type of thing.

No two bottles are the same due to the processes involved, but the minor flaws are what add to their charm. “Historically stone bottles were gradually replaced by mass produced glass bottles, the result of which is that many of these were buried in landfill sites or dumped in rivers and canals and can be dficult to locate.”Neil added: “I’ve always had a big interest in local social history, these stoneware bottles are part of it. I have been working hard in documenting the past so that it can be preserved for future generations. “I have amassed a collection of local items, everything from clocks to water pumps, but there are a few items that I have struggled to find.

Whether it’s further education or the world of employment, the important thing is not to panic. There are loads of options available and, as McDonald’s Westwood’s Business Manager Katie McManus can attest, an unexpected road can often be the best one.The -year-old began working in McDonald’s in Glengormley while studying for her A-levels. Aged , Katie had plans of going to University and becoming a Mental Health Nurse, but completely changed direction following her time at the fast food restaurant. “I decided not to go to university and to take a gap year after my exams,” she explained.“I went Crew Member to Sht Manager and then realised that’s what I wanted to do. I got promoted the whole way through to Business Manager. “Personally, I wouldn’t advise anyone to go to university until they know what they want to do. There’s no point wasting the time and money doing it. I would encourage people who are maybe panicking about grades not to worry. There are dferent things out there, and you’re not always taught that in school or given all the options. I never thought I would be working in McDonald’s but the option found me.”She continued: “It’s not what people would assume – it’s very business orientated for me. You’re very driven to work towards targets and it’s competitive. The teamwork and morale is amazing too, you literally feel like you’re with your family away from home.”As well as offering a career, McDonald’s also offers a range of educational and professional development courses to help employees attain everything from GCSE’s to university degree.“There are so many opportunities,” Katie said. “You can constantly get promoted towards Business Manager and then after that you have options to become a franchiser one day, which is a big opportunity butyou really want it you can push for it. “We have people at the minute studying for the GCSEs through our apprenticeship programmes, so they’re getting their Maths and English qualications, which will help them in the future le. Because I didn’t go to university, the option is there for me to do a business degree, which I’m planning on doing next year, so I didn’t miss out on that.”She continued: “I was quite anxious and nervous about making the decision not to go to university. It’s hard to knowyou’re making the right decision at that age. “Looking back, I’m glad it turned out that way. I would say to some of the young ones in here not to panic. Everything happens for a reason and you don’t know what path you’re going to go down until you go down it. GCSE’s and other exams are important, but there are other avenues that you can go down to get dferent jobs.”She added: “McDonald’s don’t really on experience and what you have in your qualications – it’s all about your attitude, your attitude to doing well and how hard you work. “If you are hard working and they really want to make something ofyourself then you should come here.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"glasmullin green standoff continues into second day","story":"PROTESTORS have ed to Glassmullin Green amid a stand off over plans by De La Salle College to build a new sports facility on the site.Work was due to begin the £.million project yesterday, but campaigners moved on to the green in a bid to block the development.Contractors Haffey Sports Grounds left the site yesterday following an intervention from the Friends of Glassmullin Open Green , who have campaigned to protect the space since .Residents resumed their protest this morning.Aithne Kerrigan from FOGOG has accused De La Salle College of acting “in bad faith from the outset”.“They have said that they have tried to engage with residents – they haven’t,” she said.“They held an open night at the start of April and they only managed to get seven people across their doors, four of which were definitely objectors. They told us at a meeting in April that they would keep us informed by email, but we have yet to receive an email from De La Salle to inform us that the work was going to start. They basically think we’re going to go away, but you know what  – we live here, we’re not going to go anywhere.”A spokesperson for De La Salle said the school had engaged in“considerable consultation” and modied plans three time to benefit its pupils and “the whole community”.“The school has kept the community in touch with developments as the contract process drew to a conclusion including leaflet drops and an open evening in April to present and view final design plans. A meeting with residents followed shortly after the open viewing evening. The school also indicated that with tendering administration nearly complete the work would start by the summer. Following notication from the successful contractor the school provided details to residents immediately about the contract start arrangements. We also advised local political representatives.”The spokesperson added: “The school has already invited residents to participate in a Management Committee to minimise the impact of any potential disruption to residents during the construction phase and to oversee the usage of the new facilities which will be available to the whole community next year. During the open viewing evening, at subsequent meetings and in written communications residents have been encouraged to join the Committee.“We remain committed to working with the local residents during the construction phase and thereafter.”FOGOG maintain that the pitch will be detrimental for the people of the area.“There’s going to be a major loss access to open green space,” Ms Kerrigan said.“There’s a covenant on this green. It should be protected for everybody. It shouldn’t be fenced off for exclusive use, not to mention noise pollution, lighting pollution, the additional traffic to this area, but fundamentally the loss of open green space. Glassmullin green is precious to the residents, it’s precious to the community.“We don’t have access to open green space in West Belfast. This is the last open green space in West Belfast and it should be protected for this generation and the next. We lost it before when it was Silver City, and we’re not prepared to lose it again.”She added: “We’ll do what needs to be done to protect Glassmullin Green. We’ve campaigned since  and we’re not going to stop now.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"portrait honour for campaigner raymond","story":"A PORTRAIT of a local victims campaigner has gone on display as part of an exhibition by an artist who believes he embodies the true spirit of the north.The painting of Raymond McCord is among  by artist Shauna Fox that have gone on display at the exhibition in the Sea Holly Gallery in Hill Street.Shaunawas born in Bangor but is now based in London, where she is studying fine art painting at Camberwell College of Arts. She makes paintings, sculptures and installations related to being a woman in st century Britain and, more recently, issues related to the north.Shaunw asked her father to pick someone for a portrait who he believes unites communities here. His answer was Newtownabbey man Raymond, who became well-known for his work as a victims campaigner after his son, Raymond Jnr, was murdered by the UVF in .Shauna explained: “Raymond McCord is a victims’ campaigner and he’s a man I’ve always admired – an archetypal Ulster man, brave, unrelenting and he believes that the only way we can deal with the past and move forward isboth communities deal with it together.“My work focuses a lot on ethical issues and human rights. I have explored the destruction of Aleppo by barrel bombs, the oppression of women in relation to honour and sacrice and the Troubles in Belfast.“I studied Ethics at school and from there I became interested in humanitarian and ethical issues. I knew my peers knew little of the atrocities, injustices and inhumanity being carried out at home and abroad on a daily basis and so I based my artwork around these issues in an attempt to raise awareness and present my thoughts, views and responses to them in an innovative and stimulating way.“This body of work is mainly based on my experience of living in Northern Ireland for  years, moving to London and then looking at it from afar. Moving away has made me interested in finding out more about where I’m from, but the more I discover about where I’m from, the more I question whether it’s somewhere I can be proud of and want to live in again.”Raymond said he was “honoured” to be featured in the exhibition.“It is an honour to have a portrait done. I never ever dreamt something like this would happen to me. Unbelievable. I can#t thank the artist enough.“The portrait itself will be dedicated to my son young Raymond and the rest of the innocent victims and in particular to the many from North Belfast. This is for all of us in both communities.”Shauna’s exhibition runs until August  at the Sea Holly Gallery in Hill Street."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38415041.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/poll.jpg","title":"brexit poll saying majority backs irish sea border rejected by dup","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Sea border rejected by DUPBelfastA DUP MP has rejected the findings of a poll which revealed that almost three out of five voters in Northern Ireland would prefer a border down the Irish Sea to a hard Brexit.https:www.belfasttelegraph news brexit brexit-poll-saying-majority-backs-irish-sea-border-rejected-by-dup-.htmlhttps:www.belfasttelegraph incoming article.ece d AUTOCROP h poll.jpgEmailA DUP MP has rejected the findings of a poll which revealed that almost three out of five voters in Northern Ireland would prefer a border down the Irish Sea to a hard Brexit.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the idea that more people here would rather remain closely aligned with the EU than the UK is in no way reflective of the community he represents.The survey carried out by Belfast-based polling and market research company LucidTalk asked people how they would vote in a referendum proposing that Northern Irelandremained aligned to the European Union, \"perhaps staying in the single market and the customs union\".Read MoreDire Brexit warnings of no-deal listed in leaked document dismissed by DUPAlex Kane: Boris Johnson could be tempted by Brexit backstop only for Northern IrelandCorbyn: Brexit general election once-in-a-generation chance for changeJohnson under pressure to recall Parliament following no-deal Brexit warningsSome .% of respondents said they would vote in favour of \"a border in the Irish Sea\" and would rather Northern Ireland remained more closely aligned with the EU than Great Britain.Some .% said they would reject the compromise, while .% said they did not know.Within the response, unionist voters were largely opposed to the prospect of breaking away from the United Kingdom in favour of the EU, with some % of Democratic Unionists and % of Ulster Unionists rejecting the idea.However, Sir Jeffrey questioned the level of support for staying aligned with the EU indicated by the LucidTalk poll, saying it contrasts with the views of his constituents in Lagan Valley.\"These polls by LucidTalk I dont think accurately reflect opinion,\" he told the Belfast .\"Their polling methods are not reflective of the wider community, especially on the unionist side.\"In contrast to the  of people that they poll, the people that I talk to in my own constituency do not share that view at all. data-dfpadtargetingSir Jeffrey Donaldson\"A clear majority of them would not support Northern Ireland being separated from the UK.\"As the UK hurtles towards its exit from the European Union, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly said will go ahead with or without a deal on October , experts have warned that at least , jobs could be at risk in Northern Irelandan agreement is not reached.Sir Jeffrey said the survey has no bearing on his partys position of opposing the backstop and protecting links with the United Kingdom. data-dfpadtargetingMartina Anderson\"We believe that it is not in Northern Irelands best interests, economically or in any other way, to be torn away from Great Britain,\" he continued.He said the UK is one of the largest economies in the world.\"We export far more goods to Great Britain than we do to the rest of the world, including the EU combined, so I dont think it is a credible or rational approach that we should create barriers between ourselves and what is by far our biggest market.\" However, nationalist politicians said the poll is an accurate reflection of public opinion in Northern Ireland and comes as no surprise.An overwhelming number of nationalists opted for closer alignment with the EU, with % of Sinn Fein and SDLP voters who responded to the poll backing the Northern Ireland only backstop.Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson said the survey reinforces her view that more people would prefer a united Ireland as a means to staying within the EU than a potentially catastrophic crash-out.\"Opinion poll after opinion poll has shown that the majority are in support of a pathway back into the EU,\" she said.\"I think we need to acknowledge that the vast majority of people in the north voted against Brexit.\"If faced with the choice, they would prefer an enhanced border in the Irish Sea.\"Ms Anderson added: \"If unionists are surprised, they dont have their finger on the pulse of the people that they represent,\" she said.\"The majority of the people quite clearly dont want to see a hardened border.\"Also responding to the survey, SDLP Brexit spokesperson Daniel McCrossan said his only surprise is that the number of people who favour a border in the Irish Sea over a potential hard Brexit is not higher.\"Brexit has been an absolute calamity which looks about to end in a disastrous no-deal,\" the West Tyrone MLA said.\"This will be bad for business, trade and commerce.\"It will especially hit people hard along the border.\"A united Ireland has become a reality for many now and not just an aspiration.\"It should be no surprise to anyone that a further majority wants to avoid a hard border on this island that would interrupt integrated supply chains, damage our economy and bring hardship to border communities.\"Its sadly also no surprise that the DUP continues to ignore the wishes of most people.\"The Tory-DUP Government at Westminster has no mandate for a no-deal exit.\"The majority of middle ground voters also supported the compromise, with % of Alliance voters and % Green Party voters backing the proposition."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38421911.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/2008192-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"1000 children on waiting list yet trust returns half its

She has been on a waiting list for  months for occupational therapy and we have been told we will have another year to wait.\"Ms Harron said she enquired about the cross-border health directive, where EU citizens have the right to access healthcare in any EU country and to be reimbursed by their home country.She hoped to get her daughter assessed by an occupational therapist in Donegal and claim the money back through the directive, but claimed the trust didnt reply to her letter.Ms Harron added: \"Getting a child with autism the relevant treatments and assessments is so important, because it can make the dference in your child being allocated a full-time classroom assistant at school.\"It also helps parents cope with the additional needs a child with autism has.\"The Western Trusts failure to spend the money came to light through a Freedom of Information request submitted by SDLP MLA Mark H Durkan.He said: \"We are all too well aware of the y delays in diagnoses and waits for support and help which are often explained away by the trust as a result of insufficient resources to meet the demand on autism services. However, now we have a situation where the trust actually received money to improve its performance in service for autism and it seems it has been unable to spend that money.\"From the information I have received, all other trusts in Northern Ireland havent had the same dficulty in spending the money and recruiting new staff.\"The Western Trust spokeswoman said: \"The Western Trust was allocated funding by the HSCB to facilitate the development and implementation of a new regional framework for the delivery of children and young peoples emotional wellbeing, autism and ADHD services. \"The HSCB withdrew part of the funding from the original allocation as it was dficult to recruit staff within the required timeframe. \"The trust has, however, recently appointed one band-six social worker to address the extensive waiting list for children and young people for intervention following a diagnosis of ASD.\"In relation to childrens autism services, there are  on the assessment waiting list and  on the treatment waiting list as at end of July . \"The trust apologies for theof time waiting for both assessment and intervention and is committed in its efforts to reduce waiting times and enhance service provision for children with a diagnosis of autism and their families across the Western Trust area.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37264874.ece/36493/BINARY/primarknew010.jpg","title":"chamber chief hails creative thinking shown following belfast primark inferno","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It led to many months of disrupted business for retailers and shoppers in the area after a cordon was put in place around the unsafe building. \"We all really felt it,\" he said.Read MoreClaire McNeilly: Why do we still not know how Belfast Primark fire started In October alone footfall was down % on the year before. Fast food restaurant City Picnic closed on the day of the fire and hasnt been opened since, though hopes to be open again by the autumn. Others such as Pizza Boutique struggled on for a time after the cordon was reduced, only to also shutter their premises completely.Primark opened two stores, one at the back of its Bank Buildings shop and another on Donegall Place - though it is also planning a restoration of Bank Buildings. Fashion chain Zara was closed for around seven months, thanks to its close proximity to Bank Buildings.Mr Rana said the first impact had been to galvanise organisations in the city to work together with a greater sense of urgency than ever before. \"There was Belfast City Council, then ourselves in the Chamber, then the other business-type organisations like Belfast City Centre Management and also the Department for Communities, and Translink.\"It did throw us together and resulted in a great deal of co-ordination and co-working. Its probably strengthened that relationship and added impetus to work together.\"That led to initiatives to draw people into the city centre around Christmas, such as a winter-themed slide in Royal Avenue and stalls selling fast food. And a kids play park was also installed in Castle Place.Mr Rana said: \"The animation that the council provided in the peak Christmas season meant the city was very busy, and that did attract people into the city that probably hadnt been in recently. data-dfpadtargeting\"\" title\"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \" width\"\" \"\"  \" title\"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \" width\"\" \"\"  Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  Aerial view over Bank Buildings following Tuesdays fire.

Discussions are taking place, too, about pedestrianisation and improving public transport into and around the city. Mr Rana - whose company Andras House owns a string of hotels in the city - said the crisis of the fire had led to creative thinking. \"I would say it did stimulate new ideas to try things, which dont always work but its good to try them. \"It certainly has highlighted the importance of the city centre. When it wasnt ing we all really felt it.\"He said retail was the biggest pull into the city centre, but that the night-time economy and the drive to get more people living in it were also a big part of planning its future. And he said retail in Belfast centre - despite the well-publicised dficulties of the sector as a whole - was performing well.\"Weve had a new store, Anthropologie, opening in Arthur Street two Primark shops opening and CastleCourt Shopping Centre has a new Matalan, which does very well. \"And in Belfast, we still have our big-brand retailers like House of Fraser, Debenhams and Marks  Spencer - retailers which have closed stores in other city centres.\"And he said other parts of the city centre were being redeveloped, such as a site close to Smithfield Market and the Tribeca development around the Cathedral Quarter. The Tribeca name has attracted objections as its also the name of a district in New York. But Mr Rana said he did not object to the name. \"The name gives definition to the area and at the end of the day, the priority isnt the name but making sure development starts, proceeds and benefits the city centre.\""},{"url":null,"title":"only 6 of crossborder traders prepared for nodeal brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The trade body found that just % of cross-border traders are prepared for cash flow and liquidity issues in the event of a no-deal Brexit.They have urged business owners to take steps to protect themselves.Aidan Gough, InterTradeIreland’s designated officer and director of strategy and policy, said: “Ignoring Brexit is a bigger issue than not preparing for it.“Failing to take into account how it may impact your business could be very detrimental down the line.”There are about , cross-border traders on the island of Ireland.A substantial proportion of these are micro-businesses, which are particularly vulnerable to changes in current trading arrangements and are more likely to be reliant on the cross-border market as their only export destination.The latest research also shows continuity of supply is an additional problem that could hinder cross-border businesses and the ability to trade, but fewer than one in ten have taken steps to interrogate their supply chain.Tarfs are a further issue that could strike at the viability of SMEs  in the event of a hard Brexit.InterTradeIreland’s latest business monitor highlighted that just % of SMEs that trade across the border have looked at the possible impact of extra taxes on their business.Mr Gough said that InterTradeIreland has launched a new campaign to encourage cross-border traders to plan for Brexit, adding that the research underlines the need for companies to start acting now.“We want to reach as many SMEs as possible to help them prepare, that’s why InterTradeIreland is launching our new campaign,” he added.“This will be a signicant departure for InterTradeIreland.“It recognises that Brexit is the elephant in the room and with the deadline of October  fast approaching, Brexit is now just too big to brush under the carpet.“We think this approach and striking visuals will resonate with busy firms on many levels.”InterTradeIreland highlighted its online Bitesize Brexit, a tool for cross-border traders which details specic actions that businesses can take to prepare for Brexit.In a statement from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, a spokeswoman said it has been working with companies for more than two years to raise awareness of the key Brexit challenges.The statement said: “The department’s ongoing engagement and research indicates that the proportion of businesses preparing for Brexit is increasing, particularly among those businesses identied as most exposed to Brexit-related impacts, and that awareness of the key Brexit challenges is also increasing.“Almost % of Irish SMEs report a good understanding of the likely implications of Brexit impacts that are relevant to their business.”The department said that a survey carried out in February this year suggested that planning for Brexit is increasing, with almost half of SMEs saying they have taken “some form of engagement” to prepare for Brexit.“Among the most impacted businesses, progress is also being made, for example more than half of exporters indicate that they have a Brexit plan,” the statement added."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Half-a-century on, this week has also seen contention and disturbances surrounding the Apprentice Boys of Derry annual parade in Derry-the very same demonstration that was the focal point for the beginning of serious violence exactly  years ago.But, whilst the events of August  in Derry without doubt played a pivotal role in shaping the following decades, in a wider context it was just one episode amongst many more fraught historical events of the last  years.The decade between - was undoubtedly one of the most consistently eventful in Ireland throughout the twentieth century.Within those ten years the country went through the campaign for Home Rule, World War One, the Easter Rising, the Irish War of Independence, partition, the Irish Civil War and the foundation of the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland. Added to that were campaigns for social change exemplied by the  Lockout and the suffrage movement.In combined effect, each of these hugely momentous events left no strata of Irish society untouched or unscathed by the violence that emanated from them. And, the historical shockwaves of some of these events, most particularly partition, also shaped future events in Northern Ireland that literally exploded onto the streets in the late s.In the Republic of Ireland concerted efforts have been made in recent years to make this decade of centenaries more inclusive and tolerant and respectful. The civic remembrance of those Irish men who fought and died on the British side in WWI has grown for example and the previously unthinkable visit to Dublin by an English monarch has taken place.Republican leaders once sworn to end Queen Elizabeth II’s reign in Northern Ireland by any means necessary have greeted her with handshakes and smiles. Uncomfortable conversations around these events have also taken place.In the North, still three years away from the conclusion of this decade of th anniversaries, there is the looming prospect of how the creation of Northern Ireland will be dealt with by nationalists and republicans.The outward signs at least are of course currently not good, encapsulated as they are by the ongoing absence of Stormont. Overlapping it all is the fact that in the North the events of  years ago are beginning to come full circle into the realm of major time passed milestones.So, half-a-century after the Civil Rights movement rocked the foundations of the Northern state to their core, how have we dealt to date with the commemoration of seminal historical events north of the border Professor Peter Shirlow is Director at the Institute of Irish Studies at University of Liverpool and was formerly Deputy Director of the Institute of Conflict Transformation and Social Justice at Queen’s University. He has undertaken conflict transformation work in Northern Ireland and has used his knowledge to work with former combatants and non-governmental organisations in Yugoslavia, Moldova, Bahrain and Iraq.“I think we have dealt with these issues in ways that have shown a lot of maturity, especially when it came to commemorating .“There was a lot of stretching beyond previously comfortable positions and remembering for example the children and the Royal Irish Constabulary who were killed and a realisation that conflict is just not about the commemoration of those who were on ‘your’ side. We are also beginning to look at women in this period who were made invisible.“There are many ways in which to understand what happened and they are a lot more erse than we have been told, but we haven’t yet built this into ways of how to deal with our past,” Peter Shirlow said.The insistence within each community that their version of the stories of the past are the ‘righteous’ versions has been at the root of inter-communal stre even decades after actual conflict has ceased. Heroic versions of the past are something that Peter Shirlow says that as a society we need to look beyond. He added that his research has indicated that Northern Ireland’s dferent cultures are not necessarily converging on that issue as yet.Professor Shirlow is also the Independent Chair of the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister Employers’ Guidance on Recruiting People with Conflict Related Convictions working Group.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshHe told the Derry News: “I have found a very strong sense in the Protestant Unionist Loyalistcommunity that the conflict is finished and there’s a need to move on. They don’t want to engage because there’s a sense it’s in the past, that it’s over.“More people in the PUL community seem to have drawn a line under it-that it was  years ago, so there’s a reluctance to engage. A lot of loyalist prisoners came out and went back to work and don’t appear to have the same fascination with the Troubles.“The republican view of that is they believe loyalists do not want to engage because they are ashamed. It’s not a practical or a sensible view.“I’ve done a lot of research within Protestant working-class communities and there’s some acknowledgement of history, some reverence for Edward Carson and a degree of asking where we are going, but not a lot of interest in looking back at what happened during the Troubles.”The academic also said that he senses with the nationalist and republican community a need that their narrative of events “must be proven right.”So, the Derry News asked Peter Shirlow about how things will pan out when the centenary of the creation of Northern Ireland arrives It’s an issue he believes which still very much reverberates within the political sphere today.“The issue of partition is part of the inter-party talks at the minute. We will have to decide whether Northern Ireland is a ‘good place’ or a ‘bad place’.“We tend not to concentrate on what we have done well. Culturally we are globally renowned-from Van Morrison right through to Snow Patrol’s Crashing Cars being the most listened to song of the st century so far. In terms of sport we recently hosted The Open and we have names such as Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, but we don’t use what should symbolise the positive aspects but concentrate on the fractious issue of conflict. It makes us forget how globally regarded we are,” he said.Professor Shirlow also contends that the all invasive aspects of one-sided commemoration also often obscure the stories of human bravery and kindness that took place during the conflict.“There are stories of the Troubles where many people put their own lives in danger to save others. I know someone in Ardoyne who took a policeman into their home and him to stop him being killed. It stops the appreciation of victims being someone’s mother or father, son or daughter. And, I’m sure it’s the same in Derry.“Commemoration doesn’t look at a lot of le experiences or the fact that people on both sides took risks to help protect each other. Commemoration can largely be about the self.”The Derry News also asked Peter Shirlowhe thinks that at specic times, political parties push their ideas of commemoration onto their prospective voters to purposefully polarise communities “There is part of it that is a response to ‘your’ community and that symbolises that these events have power and politicians are sometimes trapped in that. But, of course parties will use that for their own ends.“If we united on issues like the health service, education, employment and the environment perhaps there wouldn’t be such a focus on identity. However, there are signs that people are exploring other ways to move forward,” he said.CAPTION: Professor Peter Shirlow, Director of the Institute of Irish Studies at the University of Liverpool."},{"url":null,"title":"special creggan performance dedicated lyra mckee","story":"A special all-female performance of a play written by esteemed Irish dramatist Brian Friel took place in Creggan yesterday in memory of Lyra McKee.Art Over Borders’ th Lughnasa FrielFest paid tribute to the young writer and journalist who was killed in the city with a free performance of Brian Friel’s  play The Enemy Within.Two performances had been scheduled to take place in two churches, St. Columba’s Church of Ireland in Omagh, Friel’s birthplace, and All Saints Church of Ireland in the Waterside Derry on Saturday.However, festival organiser Arts Over Borders unexpectedly announced the additional free performance in Creggan.The Enemy Within is centred around Columbas room or cell in the Autumn of , on the island of Iona, off the West coast of Scotland.The entire play centres around issues such as ‘Who am I’ and ‘To whom am I connected ’Published in , Friel wrote the play connecting it to the social troubles at the time.Columbas enemies were not only limited to his inner self, but also to his own family. Even though he had left Ireland, presumably for good, his family held an immovable grip which crippled Columba in his work on Iona.This pressure contributes to the inner struggles Columba is forced through in several parts of the play.Yesterdays performance on the last day of the four-week festival was dedicated to the memory of Lyra McKee who was shot dead during rioting in the Creggan area on April  of this year.Her partner Sara Canning was invited along by the organisers. Derry born festival co-curators Sean Doran and Liam Browne felt it was appropriate and timely to honour the memory of Lyra McKee with this all-female world premiere presentation.Speaking to the Derry News, Mr Doran said: “Our international Brian Friel Festival is jointly held in Donegal and Derry, with the Derry location now celebrating the playwright’s more socio-political plays and themes of justice, gender and ethnicity.“To complement the Lughnasa FrielFest Donegal, Here I Come! we have given the title of OVERCOME to Derry’s Lughnasa FrielFest in recognition of Derry’s ability to continually overcome its challenges and to resonate  years on from the Civil Rights marches of  that were directly inspired by the Black American Civil Rights movement.“The Black spiritual singers Ruby Philogene MBE and Tayo Aluko will join the casts of Brian Friel’s The Enemy Within and The Freedom of the City offering sung preludes and interludes to the Omagh and Derry performances.”Mr Browne added: “We had the pleasure of working with Lyra previously when she kindly agreed to be part of a discussion  in our Home of St. Patrick Festival in Armagh in . On that occasion she explored the particular challenges that face young women today, the pressures to reveal, issues around identity, privacy and such.“The subjects which Friel explored throughout his work of gender, poverty, ethnicity, isolation and spirituality mirror the themes which also concerned Lyra and about which she wrote.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"llandrindod man mike complete last ever six marathons birthday","story":"Mike Hodges with one of previous marathon medals.

Then I got a local engineer to sandblast it and paint it so that is was like new and that cost another few thousand.ldquoThe rest of the cost will be spent on the build and the fit out inside. I reckon that even after we live in it for a while, it would still retain some valuewe wanted to sell itwe decide to travel again or rent it out. I see the cost as the equivalent to three yearsrsquo rent and itrsquos money not wasted as we still have something at the end of it.The tiny home concept mdashnormally one bed studio-style homes mdash has become popular for people looking for a simpler way of living in locations that they can change and without tying themselves down to massive mortgage.Michael, who is from Whiterock, and Alex, who is from Saintfield, discovered the concept while travelling and living in a small van in New Zealand for a year.ldquoI had been aware of tiny houses before we went to New Zealand and over there it is really popular, explained Michael. ldquoThey really are everywhere. Seeing how people live in these tiny houses inspired me that it could be done here too.ldquoWe lived in one of them during our time in New Zealand and loved it. It did simply our lives and it was a bit more sustainable which is a big thing is for us.ldquoWe donrsquot like the idea of renting for the next few years or being tied down to a mortgage and this allows us to be flexible, plus it is a bit adventurous.The couple, who first began to date after getting together at their leaving formal at Down High School, have designed their home with a galley kitchen with sitting area, a small shower room and loft bedroom in a building that is six metres long by . metres wide and . metres high.The house should be finished in time for Christmas and is kept near Lisbane where the couple try to work on it every day.Michael, a design engineer graduate, and Alex, who graduated in textile and design, are both working part-time jobs at the moment in order to devote themselves to the build.Michael said: ldquoWersquove done all the work ourselves in order to save money and to gain more skills. The exterior is nearly finished so we will be moving on to the interior soon.ldquoRegarding installing the utilities, some have pretty easy solutions and some are more dficult. As we would like some flexibility as to where we can park it, we donrsquot want to plug into mains electricity or the sewerage system, so the shower will be a standard shower with an instant water heater. Any grey water from the sink or shower will be probably be handled by some kind of natural filtration.Michael and Alex donrsquot yet know where they will site their home when it is finished but hope to place it on land owned by friends, or to rent out a field.They say that part of the reason to build their tiny home is financial, but also down to the way of le that living in such a small space brings with it.Michael said: ldquoWe like to do something more meaningful with our money and prefer travel experiences. We would rather not spend loads of money on a sofa mdash we would prefer to go travelling.He added: ldquoI would love to convert a camper van and go around Europe. I really donrsquot see the sense of buying up stuff and would rather have experiences that I would remember more.The couple want to have a cosy feeling to their home but not something too modern.Like caravans or boats, space is at a premium in a tiny house and Michael has designed stairs up to their loft bed so that extra storage can be built in.ldquoWe donrsquot have that much stuff which is good. Often when people do move into these small houses they find it dficult to get rid of a lot of stuff, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call for play park upgrade  ","story":"MOTHERS in Ballynahinch are demanding that immediate improvements are made to the play park in Hillfoot Crescent.The women claim that due to vandalism and a lack of maintenance, the play facility is in dire need of an upgrade and is not fit for purpose to serve the needs of local children.The members of Hillfoot Crescent and Windmill Residents Association also say that the play facility is long overdue for some general weed tidying up by Newry, Mourne and Down Council which is responsible for it.A large group of women and children held an open meeting at the park last Thursday and invited local councillors to attend to see at first hand the poor state the park has declined into.Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews told the mothers, grandmothers and children that Hillfoot Crescent was one of three local parks due to be upgraded by the council within the next two years.However, while Ursula Jess, secretary of Hillfoot Crescent and Windmill Residents Association, welcomed the news, she said that the association would still be pressing for some interim improvements.ldquoItrsquos good to hear that a new play facility upgrade is supposed to be in the pipeline but we need something done between now and then, she said.ldquoWe urgently need it upgraded as therersquos no summer seats and parents and minders either have to stand or sit on the grass to keep an eye on the children and itrsquos not good enough. The seats were burnt one by one years ago and never replaced sowe were to get summer seats between now and the upgrade, it would be helpful.Mrs Jess said that Hillfoot Crescent got a Lottery grant in the late s to install the park and over the years broken equipment has not been replaced.She added: ldquoItrsquos a massive park with a lot of potential. We still have some tyre swings, a climbing frame, a slide and baby swings. There used to be a basket ball hoop but that is away now.ldquoItrsquos all been down to vandalism and general wear and tear. When the little elephant rockers were broken, the council just came and took them away but they werenrsquot replaced.She said that the play arearsquos summer seats were only replaced on one occasion after local vandals burnt them and had have not been replaced for years.Mrs Jess said that the community has done its best to keep the play park safe by sweeping away any broken glass and rubbish and have raised money for equipment in the past.The play facility caters for a large numbers of families at Millbank Grove Windmill Gardens, Windmill Drive, Windmill View, Carlisle Park and further afield, added Mrs Jess.Cllr Andrews said that he welcomed the residentsrsquo invitation to come along and to find out about the play facility.He said: ldquoThe play facility at Hillfoot Crescent serves a big catchment area with new developments being built in recent years.ldquoI was very impressed by the excellent turnout of parents, neighbours and children to convey their frustrations, worries and concerns about the condition of the existing playground here and the sense of being forgotten about.ldquoThey are calling for an upgrade to state of the art play parks that others in the Rowallane District Electoral Areahave been supplied with in recent times.ldquoI was able to tell them that Hillfoot Crescent is included in the line-up for an upgrade to new state of the art equipment.ldquoI will be lobbying and supporting this call at council level for this much-needed new play park to go ahead speedily along with those for Darragh Cross and Kilmore.The councillor said the council will encourage local residents and children to have their say and input into the new playground.He was presented with a heart-felt plea from the children for their park to be improved which was written as a poem and presented to him.It read: ldquoOur park is dying, itrsquos so sad, No one cares that it looks so bad.A lick of paint a bench or two, A modern slide area all overdue, So come on Council what do you say  Help us out and let us play..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call to clean up Mary Street area of Crossgar  ","story":"CALLS have been issued for a clean-up of the Mary Street area in Crossgar.South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews have highlighted the need for the work to be carried out following a recent visit to the village.Mr McGrath mdash who was in Crossgar along with Cllr Andrews to listen to residentsrsquo concerns mdash is keen to see a resolution to the issues in Mary Street.ldquoPaths at this part of the village have become very poorly neglected and a dumping ground for some, the MLA explained.ldquoThis is totally unacceptable at a location adjacent to residentsrsquo garages and homes and the issue needs to be addressed as soon as possible.Mr McGrath suggested that the Mary Street problems are indicative of a wider issue people and groups across the country are going to have to get to grips with mdash determining who is responsible for certain pockets of land.He continued: ldquoBy the time it takes to actually determine ownership of areas, the issue could have been sorted multiple times over.

The remaining minutes of the half were played at a hectic pace with some tremendous play on show.Sheila McGrath and Greville handed Westmeath a three-point lead before Mallon and Dowdall swapped points as the game entered added time.However, Down had the bit between their teeth and three inspirational scores from Finnuala Carr, Aoe Keown and Mallon brought the sides level at - to - with time practically up.Westmeath were not to be denied a first half lead and a converted Greville free sent her side in at the break with a hard-earned - to - lead.The second half was every bit as competitive with Down again dominating the share of possession, but they continued to struggle to put that advantage to good use.Frees from Greville and Mairead McCormick and a magical strike from McGrath suddenly had Westmeath - to - ahead after  minutes.Down went for broke and minutes after Mallon and McCormick exchanged points, the predatory Saoirse Sands struck with venom when she netted after taking control of a Fionnuala Carr free.Paula Gribben reduced the deficit to two points before Greville and Mallon again exchanged scores. Mallon was unerring in front of the posts and with four minutes remaining she left a point in it after scoring from play.Unfortunately, McCrossan took advantage of two more Down wides from frees when she gave her side a - to - lead with two minutes of added time played.Sara Louise Carr kept the pot boiling with a th point for Down, but this was the last score of the game as the referee blew the final whistle on the resumption of play.Down: M McNally, N Kelly, A Savage, C McGilligan, C Rocks, D Magee, K McMullan, A Keown , P Gribben , S L Carr , D Savage, S McCartan, N Mallon , C McGourty, F Carr .

Within hours, the three Belfast brothers were back in Newcastle harbour where anxious relatives awaited news of their ordeal.Philip Sharp and his brothers Johnand Markhad left Minerstown Park Caravan Site wearing only trousers, pullovers and with only two lejackets between them. They started to fish about  yards offshore, but it was when they decided tohome that they hit trouble.They struggled to make any headway against the strong outgoing tide. ldquoWe just drted further and further away until the shore was just a haze, Philip said.They did not realise, as they drted six miles out to sea, that the alarm had been raised and the Newcastle leboat was on its way to their rescue, along with the helicopter..ldquoThe helicopter circled over us until the leboat came, Philip continued. ldquoThey took us on board and gave us hot soup and a tot of rum.ldquoI donrsquot think we have ever been so glad to see anyone in our lives.

He fired one shot straight at the lsquokeeper, one went wide and a cross which narrowly evaded everyone in the box.Killyleagh did prove menacing and in the th minute nice link up play between Charlie Holland and Darren McConnell allowed him to release Jamie Sharvin, but he hot straight at lsquokeeper, Mark Hynes.Thomas Healy was next up for the Whites in the th minute. John Murray won possession on the half way line and drove through midfield, linking with Neale, who released Healy on a one-on-one with Hynes, but the stopper stayed upright to deny him.Rosario were happy to let the YC play in front of them and hit on the counter and their best chance in the first half fell to Conor Murray after some clever link up play with Michael Johnson. However, his driven shot ended safely in the arms of YC goalkeeper Aaron Carberry.The visitors then had their best chance of the half in the th minute. Neale did well to hold off a defender and release Healy on the edge of the box, but his shot was fired just over.Both teams changed formations in the second half and Rosario really started to create some great opportunities.The game sprang into le when Johnson was put through one-on-one with Carberry, but once again the lsquokeeper stood up and made a smart save, with Murray missing the rebound.In the th minute Rosario were awarded a penalty.

Earlier this year, a planning application was submitted to formally designate the area as a car park for council vehicles and staff cars as well.Concerned residents who live nearby and Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran expressed opposition to the move, describing the unofficial parking area in front of the remains of the townrsquos former workhouse as an ldquoeyesore, highlighting the noise created by heavy refuse vehicles starting up in the morning.Council officials say they have sold part of the existing Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to pave the way for the development of Down Highrsquos new multi-million pound campus.They explained that part of the land which has been sold to provide a new main entrance to the school includes an area which is currently used for council staff parking.The local authority is seeking planning approval to develop remaining land at the front and side of the old workhouse to provide parking for staff and its fleet of vehicles.In papers submitted ahead of todayrsquos planning meeting, it is confirmed that  homeowners who live close to the Strangford Road site were informed about the car park proposal, with some expressing concern about the impact it will have on property values.Concern was also raised about vehicle engines starting as early as .am, particularly at weekends, with those opposed to the planning application insisting that commercial vehicles should not be parked close to residential properties.Outlining their reasons for recommending that the planning application should be approved, planners admit that the car park plan will impact on the remains of the former workhouse which is of special architectural and historic importance.However, they confirm that the Department of Communities Historic Environment Division accept the parking plan in principle, provided the scheme respects the character of the area, suggesting that ldquosoft landscaping between banks of spaces with a low wall constructed to the western boundary.ldquoThe site is well established as the former Down Council offices, with a refuse depot to the rear, the planning papers continue.ldquoThe area has been used for staff parking with this application to formalise the arrangement with staff parking to the front and small vans to be parked at the side. The works proposed will aim to upgrade the existing frontage and use hardstanding to provide a more formalised parking arrangement.Planners say the existing land is to be regraded and resurfaced with low walls and have confirmed that external lighting also forms part of the proposal, with the current entrance set to be widened and new gates installed. Hedge planting is also proposed to help screen some of the activities to the rear of the site.Signicantly, the planning papers spell out clearly that the new parking at the front of the site will be laid out for vans and staff vehicles, not refuse vehicles. Planners also insist the application does not represent a change of use to the site.The papers continue: ldquoThe application proposes to relocate staff parking to the site of the formerly demolished council administrative building and use the other side of the car park for some additional fleet vehicle parking, with designated parking spaces marked and circulation routes displayed through the site.ldquoThe proposal will not impact any more signicantly in terms of residential amenity as to what is already there at present.Planning Committee members will also be told today that as part of the sale of council land at the Strangford Road to the Education Authority that there will be a two-hour daily traffic restriction over the use of the existing main fleet access to the site for local authority vehicles.Council vehicles will not be permitted to use the entrance between .am and .am and between .pm and .pm, with planners explaining this clause was ed into the contract of sale with the Education Authority on the grounds of child safety to ensure students could not be injured by council vehicles.In addition, planners say it is anticipated that most council HGVs and bin lorries will be off site by .am, but that a few may not be, requiring the need for an access through the site to the Strangford Road.

Others can be invited as necessary.”The committee’s remit was to consider questions relating to the government’s policy on Northern Ireland and relations with the Republic of Ireland and to report to the Cabinet’s ministerial committee on Northern Ireland.He said that “the Cabinet Office have a very clear prime ministerial remit to treat Northern Ireland as an issue of the highest priority”.Two of the issues suggested for discussion at the initial meeting of the group were the decommissioning of arms and force levels in Northern Ireland. He said that an additional meeting would focus on exploratory dialogue with Sinn Féin.In a further indiction of the signicance of what was being discussed in a period where the government was attempting to establish whether the IRA and loyalist ceasefires would last, a November   note from John Coles in the Foreign Office which accepted the proposed terms of reference for the committee was copied to Stella Rimington, then director general of MI.Declassied files: How the Troubles impacted everything from the environment to animal health Coremetrics  Coremetrics

Children will be free but do require a ticket.Tickets are limited so purchase your tickets now at musicintheparkpenarth or via Ticketsource.This is the first time the event has charged the public to attend which has attracted a packed crowd for many years now.Karen Martin is Chair of Friends of Belle Vue, the local community volunteer group that organises the park.She said: ldquoAs the event has grown, so the cost of hosting the event - which is extremely popular with Penarth residents and friends ndash has expanded beyond what our fundraising and local sponsorships can cover.\"Even with everyone donating their time for free, costs include the rental of toilets, stage, sound, security, insurance, health and safety requirements, and more. Itrsquos a wonderful afternoon of live music in a lovely setting and we think thatrsquos well worth the pound ticket price.\"We hope everyone will support this move to ensure the festival can continue into the future.The bands and singers this year are an excellent, ied line-up of music styles and all are local talent. They include:bull Little Rock ndash a musical duo playing folk, rock, country and popbull The Cheatinrsquo Hearts ndash a country band playing songs from the likes of Lindisfarne, Bonnie Raitt, Steve Earle and morebull Karmen Field ndash a psychedelic rock band playing funk, blues, rsquos rock and metal influencesbull Maddy Carver ndash Penarth-based singer songwriter performing original and cover songs from a range of styles and genresbull Knitwear Junkees ndash a groove-driven originals band playing jazz, funk soul and groovebull The Snorklers ndash a popular Music in the Park band playing hits from the Cure, Billy Idol and morebull The Woods ndash another old favourite, playing classics from The Beatles and Rolling Stones, to the latest rock and pop favouritesbull Grooveline ndash who will end the festival with classic songs from Heatwave, Earth Wind and Fire, Kool  The Gang, OrsquoJays, and Sam  Dave.Festival-goers are encouraged to bring their own food and drink. There will be no hot food stalls in the park this year although soft drinks, tea, coffee and snacks will be served in the park pavilion and ice-creams and slushies will be on sale.More information about the event is available on the Friends of Belle Vue Park Facebook Page - facebook BelleVueParkPenarth article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A French official said Mr Macron personally told US president Donald Trump that Mr Zar was in France. His visit has been considered a high-stakes gamble for the French president. Mr Trump later said he wasnrsquot surprised by the invitation. He said he did not want to say when Mr Macron had spoken to him about Mr Zarrsquos visit but added: ldquoHe asked me. I donrsquot consider that disrespectful at all, especially when he asked me for approval.Great meetings at the @G in Biarritz, France! #GBiarritz pic OdASQxUYfmdash Donald J.

Officials said the White House was not aware in advance of the invitation to Mr Zar.For several months, Mr Macron has assumed a lead role in trying to save the  nuclear accord, which has been unravelling since Mr Trump pulled the US out of the agreement.Mr Macron had earlier outlined details of a French plan to ease tensions with Iran by allowing Iran to export oil for a limited amount of time, said a French diplomat.In exchange, Iran would need to fully put in place the  nuclear deal, reduce tensions in the Persian Gulf and open talks.The plan was met with a sceptical reception by Mr Trump, and the White House paid only a cursory mention of the Gulf in its official report of the lunch meeting..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Iranian president defends foreign minister us visit to G article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Now in its st year, the region’s longest established listing of company performance provides insight on the accomplishments of Northern Ireland based companies, either Northern Ireland registered or where a signicant proportion of their business is transacted in the province. The  edition of the Top  incorporates analysis of figures filed at each companies year end and posted at Companies House and primarily relate to financial periods ending in late ,  and . SUMMARY Sales have grown to £.bn from £.bnwhich is a growth of .%. While extremely encouraging this result needs to be tempered with the fact that profits for the top companies decreased by nearly % to £.m. Shareholder value for the Top  companies increased by .%. Revenue sales Sales revenue is the income received by a company from its sales of goods or the provision of services. The performance of the Top  showing a .% sales growth to £.bn is exceptional in what is a dficult trading environment and period of uncertainty for the provinces businesses. The Brexit question came to the fore on June ,  so all the financial figures shown in the listing have come post the referendum and in essence since the suspension of the Assembly in January . Moy Park continues to hold sway with the highest turnover, currently £.bn, up from £.bn previously – snapping close at their heels is WR Barnett Ltd . Next in the listing are a number of high fliers, LCC Group Ltd and John Graham Holdings Ltd. John Graham Holdings Ltd, which trades as Graham, is another privately owned company based in Hillsborough and specialising in building and civil engineering projects – Graham posted annual sales of £.m in its latest financial accounts up from £.m – an increase of some .% year on year. One of the perennial high performers of the Top  showed a signicant decrease in sales dropping it from a position last year of  to a position this year of . Fane Valley Co-Operative‘s sales decreased from £m to £.m – this is a result of their change in ownership of Linden Foods.

This year has seen a drop in profit margin for the Top  companies from a margin of .% to .% with total profits now sitting at £.m compared to £.bn for the corresponding companies in their prior year. Northern Ireland Water Ltd has retained its position as the most profitable business within the listing, posting pre tax profits of £.m on a turnover of £.m a margin of .%. Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Ltd is second most profitable with pre tax figures of £m against a turnover of £.m . While the reduction in profitability of the Top  is disappointing this can be tempered by the fact that a number of the companies made signicant losses during the last filed figures recorded for the compilation of the listing. Short Bros PLC after currency adjustments filed losses of £.m, CaterpillarLtd posted losses of £.m, Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companyfiled losses of £.m, EP Kilroot Power losses of £m and Dunnes Stores Bangor Ltd losses of £m.
