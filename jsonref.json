[{"url":null,"title":"Andrew turned aide book room Buckingham Palace event","story":"Share this article The feud blew up amid criticism of Prince Andrew for his friendship with with paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself in his jail cell last month following his arrest over sex trafficking of underage girls - and a raft of lurid allegations have since emerged. In a lengthy statement last month, the Duke admitted it was a \u0027mistake and error\u0027 to see Epstein in 2010 after his 2008 conviction for sex with a child but he insisted did not \u0027witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction\u0027. Buckingham Palace has issued strong denials over allegations made by Virginia Roberts Giuffre in court papers filed in the US that she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew when she was 17 years old.She claims in the papers she had sex with Andrew ‘three times’ in London, at Epstein’s home, and at his private island in the Caribbean.Since the allegations, Prince Andrew has only appeared in public a handful of times and was recently seen in County Antrim at the Royal Portrush Golf Course.          Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, accompanied by Tony Johnstone-Burt (Master of the Household to Queen Elizabeth II), attends a reception for the London Taxi Drivers\u0027 Charity for Children at Buckingham Palace on February 14, 2019         Prince Charles subsequently heard of the row and asked his brother to say sorry. Pictured, with his wife Camilla at the Braemar Gathering last weekIn a statement about the tiff between Andrew and Johnstone-Burt, a spokesman said:  ‘Some time ago there was a disagreement between the Duke of York and a member of staff. The disagreement was resolved and there are no ongoing issues’.The disagreement was said to have happened at the beginning of this month, and sources had previously told the Mail on Sunday that Prince Andrew had been \u0027very cross\u0027 and it was even thought that Prince Charles had asked him to apologise.  There was said to have been words on both sides but no actual physical altercation between the two parties.‘It was a verbal dispute. It was a work-related issue. The Duke got very cross that what he wanted wasn’t possible.’         Mr Johnstone-Burt (pictured above) looks after teams including catering, housekeeping and entertainmentPrince Charles subsequently heard of the row and asked his brother to say sorry.The source added: ‘The Duke explained the situation to the Prince of Wales and left it at that. There was no apology because there was nothing to apologise for. The Duke maintains a good relationship with the Prince of Wales.’ Johnstone-Burt, who has worked at the palace for six years, is responsible for 250 staff covering catering, housekeeping, entertainment, maintenance and administration.On September 7, a source close to Charles said such an intervention would not be unusual. ‘He is the second most senior member of the family and is known to take action when and where is necessary.‘Mostly he is well informed and will intervene where it is appropriate to do so.’He is also in charge of a £370 million, ten-year re-fit of the Queen’s official London residence.Johnstone-Burt joined the Royal Navy in 1977 and served in the Falklands before eventually being promoted to vice-admiral and becoming the Chief of Staff to Nato’s Supreme Allied Command Transformation at Norfolk, Virginia.He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath by the Queen in 2013.        "},{"url":null,"title":"Former Tory leadership contender Sam Gyimah sixth MP defect Lib Dems year","story":"Share this article          In the first speech from one of leader Jo Swinson\u0027s top team at the party conference in Bournemouth, she said: \u0027Now, like Trump, Johnson is talking about \u0027extreme weather conditions\u0027 - he is moving away from the acceptance of climate change\u0027She tore into the Conservative administration\u0027s record on reducing the UK\u0027s carbon footprint, and said ministers had \u0027destroyed\u0027 the record left by the Lib Dems when they were in coalition between 2010 and 2015.\u0027What have the Tories done about the climate emergency in the last four years? Apart from Theresa May\u0027s legacy bill of committing the UK to net-zero by 2050, the Tories have destroyed almost every bit of progress we made during the coalition years,\u0027 she said.She singled out for criticism the decision to scrap the Department for Energy and Climate Change and blasted the Government\u0027s policy of pursuing fracking - which has resulted in drilling that has caused earth tremors in Lancashire in recent weeks - as \u0027madness\u0027.The party\u0027s climate change spokeswoman told supporters that the Lib Dems could support future airport expansion - but only if an alternative to jet fuel was found.\u0027In aviation, we urgently need to find an alternative to jet fuel. This development could take 15 years. Until then, Liberal Democrats will not support any airport expansion across the UK,\u0027 said Ms Hobhouse.\u0027For the Green Party, aviation is the problem, for the Lib Dems, jet fuel is the problem.\u0027The conference is due to debate the party\u0027s climate change policy, which includes setting up a citizens assembly to decide on how best to tackle the threat of changing weather and rising sea levels, on Monday.If approved, the idea for citizens assemblies would form part of the Lib Dem manifesto at the next election.          The party will be discussing ways to scrap Brexit while avoiding a second referendumThe party will also be discussing ways to scrap Brexit while avoiding a second referendum. Ms Swinson says holding the 2016 referendum got the UK into a \u0027mess\u0027 and will push to revoke Article 50.  The East Dunbartonshire MP wants to sign her colleagues up to the policy - a move that would cancel the orce from Brussels without the need for a second referendum. Revoking Article 50 - effectively undoing the mechanism under the EU\u0027s Lisbon Treaty that was triggered to start Britain\u0027s withdrawal - would be written into the next Lib Dem election manifesto if members at the conference back the move.        Ms Swinson says holding the 2016 referendum got the UK into a \u0027mess\u0027 and will push to revoke Article 50. Pictured is Ms Swinson smelling a bath bomb Until the conference the party have been in favour of a second referendum but have now changed tack and insist that revoking Article 50 is the only satisfactory way out. Deputy leader Ed Davey has been campaigning for a second referendum but admitted that it doesn\u0027t look likely it will happen. Ms Swinson has insisted that if her party were to come into power they would immediately scrap Brexit.          The party will also be demanding £5billion per year for the benefits system, reforms on gender equality and help for ex-offenders to rebuild their livesWith a general election expected soon, Ms Swinson has also definitively ruled out any coalition with Conservatives or Labour.The party\u0027s numbers dwindled after their five-year coalition with the Conservatives and ended up with just eight MPs. But a recent boost due to defections from both Labour and the Conservatives over the summer has bumped their numbers to 17.   The party will also be demanding £5billion per year for the benefits system, reforms on gender equality and help for ex-offenders to rebuild their lives. Ms Swinson is expected to take questions from delegates tomorrow, after a speech from her predecessor Vince Cable. Her main speech will be held on the last day of the conference, Tuesday, and will follow a tribute to the party\u0027s formed leader who died in December - Paddy Ashdown.  Chuka Umunna, who joined the Lib Dems under Sir Vince\u0027s leadership, will address party members on Monday in his role as Treasury and business spokesman.Environment and climate change spokeswoman Vera Hobhouse MP will give her speech on Saturday morning before Baroness Brinton, the party president, closes proceedings in the afternoon.  As Prime Minister Boris Johnson looks to weather the storm following the ruling from Scottish judges this week that his advice to the Queen to suspend Parliament was unlawful, the Lib Dems are looking to capitalise and mobilise supporters in Dorset in preparation for a snap election.         Deputy leader Ed Davey has been campaigning for a second referendum but admitted that it doesn\u0027t look likely it will happenParliament has so far denied Mr Johnson\u0027s request for an autumn trip to the polls as opposition parties look to see the Benn Bill - legislation that demands the PM extend the Brexit deadline until January 2020 rather than take Britain out of the European Union without a deal - enshrined in law.But with Royal Assent for the Bill now achieved and no majority in the House of Commons for the PM, both the Conservative Party and its rivals are gearing up for another Brexit-themed election."},{"url":null,"title":"Labours Keir Starmer mounts secret plot lead unity government","story":"Share this article Some also claim the party\u0027s Brexit spokesman would be far better placed than Mr Corbyn to head a post-election Labour minority government if the party needed Lib Dem and Tory rebel votes.One senior Labour MP claimed: \u0027Keir has a very tightly controlled operation to approach like-minded fellow MPs who are anti-No Deal or anti-Brexit full stop.\u0027It\u0027s about building enough of a base within the party by saying only he can appeal to the Lib Dems and the Tory rebels as the head of a post-Boris unity government.\u0027It doesn\u0027t actually involve ousting Jeremy as leader – just establishing Keir as the best choice for PM.\u0027         One Corbyn ally even alleged the Brexit spokesman was in league with Labour Deputy Leader Tom Watson (pictured)The MP claimed that North London MP Sir Keir had an operation in every region of the country to overcome his metropolitan Remainer reputation and woo as many Labour MPs as possible.One Corbyn ally even alleged the Brexit spokesman was in league with Labour Deputy Leader Tom Watson who defied Mr Corbyn last week by insisting the party must campaign for a second referendum ahead of a General Election.The ally said: \u0027There have been suspicions that Tom and Keir have been working together on this.\u0027But there\u0027s no way a figure like Keir can appeal to Labour voters across the Midlands and the North who voted for Brexit and will simply not put up with North London MPs betraying their referendum vote.\u0027In comments at a meeting in Sunderland reported last week, the Shadow Brexit Secretary admitted many voters wanted a different party leader to Mr Corbyn. He said: \u0027I\u0027m well aware from discussions around the UK and door-knocking and campaigning and canvassing that a lot of people think we would do better with a different leader.\u0027Sir Keir stressed this was not his own opinion. He pointed out that many people liked Mr Corbyn and that the elected party leader would take Labour into the next Election.         Allowing a pro-EU figure who is already retiring, such as Ken Clarke (pictured), to step in would avoid Mr Corbyn being punished by voters for being the one to seek the politically toxic Brexit extensionIn a further hint that Mr Corbyn was willing to compromise and back a caretaker PM, the Labour leader said last night that he would do \u0027all we can\u0027 to prevent the UK leaving the EU without a deal.Speaking in Scotland he said: \u0027Opposition parties have worked very closely on this. \u0027We will do all we can to prevent that No Deal crash-out because of all the damage that will do to jobs, living standards, supply chains, food supplies and medicine supplies, and if it happens we\u0027re absolutely determined to bring this Government to account, to make them answer for their irresponsible behaviour over the last few days.\u0027The Labour leader was addressing workers and trade unionists at a rally following the Fighting For Our Future march in Kirkcaldy in Fife.Last night, one Labour MP close to Mr Corbyn condemned Sir Keir\u0027s remarks.He said: \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter what you think privately – you shouldn\u0027t undermine Jeremy by saying lots of people want a different Labour leader.\u0027Last night, a source close to Sir Keir denied the plot reports, insisting it was \u0027complete nonsense\u0027 to suggest he was manoeuvring to become interim PM."},{"url":null,"title":"Cricket legend David Gower mutters havent got f ing clue microphone on","story":"Share this article          Gower\u0027s rare blunder came just days after viewers saw him behave strangely during the first day of the Test matchEyebrows were raised when, during the tea interval, he walked off midway through a televised conversation with fellow pundits Shane Warne and Michael Atherton on the outfield. It prompted Warne to comment: \u0027You know how to bat from here, David.\u0027 Gower replied: \u0027Hang on a second, you hold that, hold that.

She worked as a guitar teacher and a toy shop sales assistant before being signed by Domino Records in 2009. Brian Eno was an early champion, calling Calvi “the biggest thing since Patti Smith” and singing and playing on her debut album. She’s also collaborated with David Byrne, Marianne Faithfull and PJ Harvey producer Rob Ellis. Calvi’s guitar-driven art-rock sound is often described as dark and cinematic, so it’s not too surprising that she’s recently scored series five of Peaky Blinders.Influences: Black Midi’s name comes from an internet music genre the band learned of via YouTube, a video frontman Geordie Greep has said they “haven’t spent more than five minutes watching”. The four-piece experimental rock band initially bonded over a shared love of Talking Heads, Deerhoof and Danny Brown, but that doesn’t mean these acts are “influences” in the traditional sense. According to Greep, “there’s stuff we all like, but it’s not like we all like stuff that we based the band on sort of thing. We’ve tried to keep the band quite distinct from what we like.”Scene: Black Midi formed at the Brit School, the Croydon performing arts institution known for cultivating Adele, Amy Winehouse and Jessie J. They then honed their live skills at Brixton venue the Windmill, a bastion of the south London indie scene. Though they’re hardly typical Brit School alumni, the group acknowledge they owe a debt to their time there. “You do shows every term and stuff,” Greep has said. “So once you get out you’ve got a really good idea of how sound works. It meant we left school, could play at the Windmill and knew how to soundcheck straight away.”Influences: Growing up in Wales in the 90s, Cate Le Bon’s father would make her mixtapes introducing her to seminal artists such as Neil Young and the Velvet Underground. She was also drawn to California rockers Pavement and two leading Welsh bands of the era, Super Furry Animals and Gorky’s Zygotic Mynci. Her shortlisted album Reward grew from a year of “self-imposed isolation” in Cumbria where she spent her time woodworking by day and later, “playing the piano and singing into the night”.Scene: Born in Carmarthenshire, Le Bon’s roots lie in the Welsh indie scene. She first came to prominence opening for Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys on his 2007 solo tour, then singing on I Lust U, a standout track from Rhys’s electro-pop side project Neon Neon. She’s since released five albums, collaborated with John Cale and the Manic Street Preachers, and co-produced an album by American indie rockers Deerhunter. She’s revered by peers including St. Vincent and Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy, who earlier this year described Le Bon as “pretty much my favourite artist”, going on to say: “I’m mesmerised by her output over the last 10 years.”Scene: Dave is a leading light of the blossoming British hip-hop scene. Fellow London rappers Stormzy and Wiley supported him early on then Dave’s profile grew again when US superstar Drake jumped on a remix of his 2017 track Wanna Know. More recently, the 21-year-old has collaborated with several other London rappers including Headie One, J Hus and Fredo, who featured on Dave’s chart-topping single Funky Friday. This year, Dave has underlined his rising star status with a guest spot on Ed Sheeran’s No.6 Collaborations Project.Influences: Oxford band Foals have cited minimalist composer Steve Reich, indie icons Pixies and innovative dance producer Arthur Baker as influences. Frontman Yannis Philippakis has also said that a “general anxiety” caused by Trump, Brexit and climate change fed into their shortlisted album, Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 1. “I was listening to the tracks in the pub and I’d I look up and see a pub garden full of people and realise: ‘We’re all in this shitstorm together.’ I felt the songs should deal with that,” he said recently.Scene: Foals formed in Oxford’s indie scene in 2005. Two band members, frontman Yannis Philippakis and drummer Jack Bevan, were previously part of another band, math-rockers The Edmund Fitzgerald, who disbanded when things apparently became “too serious”. Since releasing their debut album Antidotes in 2008, Foals have been shortlisted for the Mercury Prize on three occasions and become seasoned festival headliners. A follow-up to their shortlisted album, the logically-titled Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 2, is due in October.Influences: Dublin post-punks Fontaines DC are influenced by the Strokes, the Libertines and the Velvet Underground they’ve called the latter “the base point of modern music”. Frontman Grian Chatten has also cited the Pogues’ 1984 debut album Red Roses for Me as a major touchstone for their own shortlisted debut, Dogrel, saying: “It sounds so raucous but at the same time so intelligent.” But the band’s most formative influence could be their hometown. “I think of Dublin and our music as one and the same, because it was written by people who were intensely absorbed by the city,” Chatten has said.Scene: Inspired by fellow Dubliners Girl Band, whom they credit with “modernising” Irish music, Fontaines DC are part of a new wave of Irish guitar bands making music with a strong social conscience. Discussing the scene earlier this year, Fontaines bassist Conor Deegan III said: “There’s so many things going on in Ireland, socially and politically, that for so long were not being talked about. It feels like there’s a coherent voice for our generation again.” Having toured with Shame and Idles, Fontaines DC also have close connections with the UK guitar music scene.Influences: While often described as a post-punk band, Idles frontman Joe Talbot has said they’re really “a product of different things we love”. The Bristol outfit’s shortlisted second album, Joy as an Act of Resistance, is influenced by the Sex Pistols, Interpol and Welsh post-hardcore group Mclusky, plus garage music, grime and jungle. It’s all funnelled into a righteous and rousing call-to-arms which takes on toxic masculinity, class conflict, immigration and Brexit. The end result isn’t anger, said Talbot, but music that’s “all about opening up and being vulnerable”.Influences: Little Simz said her shortlisted album Grey Area was inspired by “just coming into myself a lot more and being a young woman in my mid-20s and still learning about myself”. The north London artist, whose real name is Simbi Ajikawo, has said that listening to grime as a teenager influenced her writing style, but Grey Area also draws from other sources. Produced by her childhood friend Inflo, it incorporates jazz, funk, soul, rock and trip-hop, and includes collaborations with reggae artist Chronixx, folk-rock singer Michael Kiwanuka and electro-R\u0026ampB band Little Dragon.Scene: Little Simz said earlier this year that “people have struggled with finding where to place me”, adding: “And I think that’s also because I don’t even know where I fit.” This doesn’t mean the north London rapper lacks influential and high-profile fans. Two years ago, Kendrick Lamar said she “might be the illest doing it”, and she’s been tapped for collaborations by Gorillaz, Khalid and alt-j. Simz has even toured with Lauryn Hill, whose seminal album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill was part of her “day-to-day life” when she was growing up.Influences: Neo Jessica Joshua, better known as Nao, grew up in Hackney listening to R\u0026ampB, hip-hop and UK garage, as well as Donny Hathaway, Aretha Franklin and Prince. Conceptually, her shortlisted second album is inspired by astrology’s Saturn return. “It’s this idea that Saturn takes 29 years to orbit from when you’re born and it is the planet of blessings and growth. So by the time you’re around 29, between 27 and 32, something big happens in your life,” 31-year-old Nao says. “You start to rethink everything – old stuff that your parents taught you or ideas that you believed in. It’s like a complete shedding of skin and it can be painful.”Scene: Nao’s unique musical journey means she doesn’t slot neatly into any particular scene. After studying vocal jazz at Guildhall School of Music \u0026amp Drama, she joined all-female beatboxing troupe The Boxettes, who were popular on YouTube. She also put in stints as a backing singer for Kwabs and Jarvis Cocker. When she released her debut album For All We Know in 2016, she often described her sound as “wonky funk”, and she’s since collaborated with Nile Rodgers \u0026amp Chic and Disclosure.Influences: Led by alto saxophonist Cassie Kinoshi, SEED Ensemble is a 10-piece band “combining jazz with inner-city London, West African and Caribbean-influenced groove”. Kinoshi says she’s personally influenced by composers such as Maria Schneider, Duke Ellington and Charles Mingus, and named Driftglass after a collection of short stories by African-American author Samuel R Delany. “This record specifically focuses on interpreting … what driftglass is as an analogy for how improvised music changes and evolves over time depending on its environment,” she says. “Sci-fi, specifically space travel and Afrofuturist references to water and its connection to black history, were also important in its creation.”Influences: Northampton rapper Tyron Frampton, or Slowthai, has varied musical influences ranging from the Beatles to Basement Jaxx, and So Solid Crew to Elliot Smith. He namechecks the Prodigy on Nothing Great About Britain, the title track from his shortlisted debut album, saying: “I am a prodigy – they made me.” He’s also said he related to Radiohead’s Creep during his formative years. His album is an impassioned mix of hip-hop, grime, electronica and punk, so it’s fitting that it features collaborations with both grime icon Skepta and noisenik guitar duo Slaves.Scene: Tyron Frampton, the rapper better known as Slowthai, was born and raised in Northampton. “It’s always been a band town,” he said earlier this year. “There’s always been good music but never a strong scene to keep it going.” His own music mixes hip-hop grit with a scabrous punk energy, but he’s keen not to be pigeonholed, saying: “I want to play guitar, piano, drums, write songs for other people. I can do punk, I can do indie, but as long as it has my voice, it’ll always be my sound.”Scene: The four members of the 1975 met at Wilmslow High School and started making music at 15. At one point, they operated as a punk covers band, but they soon developed their own genre-splicing songwriting style inspired by everyone from Michael Jackson to My Bloody Valentine. Since signing to indie label Dirty Hit and breaking through with 2013’s self-titled debut, band members Matt Healy and George Daniel have co-written tracks for fellow Dirty Hit artists Pale Waves, The Japanese House and No Rome.Watch the 2019 Hyundai Mercury Prize live on Thursday 19th September, BBC Four - 9pm.

The artwork will go on display in London for the first time later this month at Sotheby’s auction house, less than a mile from the House of Commons.Alex Branczik, Sotheby’s European head of contemporary art, said Banksy was a modern-day Voltaire.He said: “Regardless of where you sit in the Brexit debate, there’s no doubt that this work is more pertinent now than it has ever been, capturing unprecedented levels of political chaos and confirming Banksy as the satirical polemicist of our time.”At nearly 4 metres (13ft), the work is the largest known canvas by Banksy. It is being sold with an auction estimate of £1.5m-£2m. That means it could exceed the record of $1.9m (£1.52m) paid for Keep it Spotless, a Damien Hirst spot painting on to which Banksy stencilled a maid cleaning.Banksy originally painted Devolved Parliament for his takeover of his hometown museum in Bristol in 2009, a show that attracted more than 300,000 visitors and became one of the top 10 most visited exhibitions anywhere in the world that year.It was lent earlier this year, by its anonymous owner, to a display at Bristol Museum marking both the exhibition’s 10th anniversary and Britain’s original planned exit from the EU on 29 March.At the time, Banksy wrote on Instagram: “I made this 10 years ago. Bristol museum have just put it back on display to mark Brexit day. Laugh now, but one day no one will be in charge”.Banksy recently addressed Brexit in a huge mural on a building in Dover showing a worker chiselling a star from the EU flag. It was mysteriously whitewashed over. He said he had been planning to update it on 31 October, with the blue crumpled on the ground, writing: “Never mind. I guess a big white flag says it just as well.”Devolved Parliament goes on display on 28 September before its sale on 3 October. It will be the same auction room where Banksy a year ago stunned the art world by activating a shredder moments after one of his works was sold."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23e59ec0e125f88fda2cf1245db989d4e0f541ff/0_165_4626_2776/master/4626.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f9dc6b7e75180ef07d4dfe3df6c1fde","title":"share your reviews of the testaments by margaret atwood","story":"Whether you’ve been waiting decades for the sequel to The Handmaid’s Tale or you’re new to Atwood, we’d like to hear from youIt is the literary event of 2019 and 34 years in the making: The Testaments, Margaret Atwood’s sequel to her dystopian feminist classic The Handmaid’s Tale is finally out in the world (a week after Amazon’s embargo-busting snafu.)

You had to invite the vampire over the threshold before they could suck you dry. The successful con artist is a true artist, with an instinctive grasp of character that makes the average fiction writer look like an unsophisticated child.The con artist knows all your petty, humiliating wants. Your thirst for unearned wealth. Your hunger for approval. Your terrible pride, which means that, even when your bank account is empty and your hopes are broken, you’ll still swear loyalty to the person who scammed you rather than admit your weakness to the world.The extraordinary shame associated with being scammed is one reason why these are hard crimes to prosecute: who would stand up in court and swear that they were stupid enough to believe implausible claims, greedy enough to think they might come out on top in a too-good-to-be-true offer?Luckily, the internet is a place where shame does not exist, which means that last week drama hounds got to enjoy the climactic instalment in the very public dissolution of a grift, when New York magazine published a 6,000-word essay (six thousand! And I read them all, twice!) about disgraced Instagrammer Caroline Calloway by her former friendone-time mark, Natalie Beach. How did Beach end up in Calloway’s thrall? Because she wanted to be Calloway and she wanted Calloway to be her ticket to a better version of herself. When they met – in a creative non-fiction class, of course – Calloway seemed to Beach “like an adult, someone who had just gone ahead and constructed a life of independence. I, meanwhile, was a virgin with a meek ponytail.”Beach compared her own dismaying sex life with Calloway’s romantic adventures: “If I were more like Caroline, I thought, more beautiful and fun, if I radiated girlishness, then men would view me as someone worthy of care.” But she also recognised Calloway as “someone to write about, and that was what I wanted most of all”.And so the two become collaborators in the project of a lifetime: creating Caroline Calloway. Their medium was Instagram, on which Calloway claimed to have become recently famous thanks to a picture of some macarons, which acquired her 50,000 followers. Calloway supplied the life and Beach supplied the captions, which presented a fairytale vision of a free-spirited life. They confected a high-minded defence of their work as art, telling themselves that they were inventing “memoir in real time” and engaged in “true feminist storytelling”. What they were actually doing was a kind of identity pyramid scheme, cultivating a public version of the Caroline that Beach fell for and inviting other young women to buy the dream of being her.It worked. There was a six-figure book deal. There was a “creativity workshop” tour, where for $165, attendees were promised they would learn “how to begin architecting a life that feels really full and genuine and rich and beautiful for you”, along with an orchid crown and a mini garden in a Mason jar. Then it fell apart. Calloway couldn’t deal with working on the manuscript and ended up owing $100,000 to her publisher. The tour was a disaster: instead of crowns, there were single flowers and Calloway ended up with 1,200 Mason jars in her flat. Most dates were cancelled. No one “architected” a really full and genuine and rich and beautiful life.Everything turned out to be empty. In one emotional scene in Beach’s essay, Calloway revealed that the influx of followers who established her profile were not authentic macaron fans, but purchased. The farrago of the creativity workshops cemented Calloway’s reputation as a scammer, something that, with typical savvy, she has leaned into, putting it into her Instagram bio and her hashtags.Calloway has been compared to Anna Sorokin, the fake heiress who was convicted this year of appropriating $275,000 to fund her social-media friendly lifestyle. But Calloway has refunded ticket holders (admittedly not in a very orderly fashion) rather than just taking the money and running and committed to repaying her advance.What Calloway extracted was devotion. While Sorokin put plane tickets on her friends’ credit cards, Calloway sprung for the flights when she and Beach got caught in Europe. In fact, she seemed shockingly conscious that money gives her an advantage over Beach, at one point lumping an unpleasant task on her with the words: “You’re the only one of my friends who needs the money badly enough to take the job.” But Beach hung on in there, because even scammed love is real love. Women who ponied up for the creativity workshops reported being anxious about pushing too hard for their money back, in case Calloway blocked them – she’d let them down, but they still longed to touch the hem of her garments.The Beach-Calloway relationship comes off as a kind of manic pixie folie à deux, which even though they’ve fallen out is still being conducted via articles and captions. Beach created Calloway so she could create herself as a writer (6,000 words in New York Magazine!), and Calloway ingeniously fulfilled that role. The art of the grift is an old one, but where notoriety would kill a traditional scam, in an attention economy it’s exactly the point. The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was making sure everyone knows that she exists.• Sarah Ditum is a writer on politics and culture"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f87c41bccfb69ebeb42f648a960cb7a8ba6c879/0_364_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6690295e595663d5ef589eab97bbc20","title":"the guardian view on the future of work share out the benefits","story":"California is one of the few economies large enough to set the rules in a globalised world. The state’s initiatives on car safety and emissions have in the past set an example that was followed by car manufacturers everywhere. In a less beneficial way, California was also the birthplace of the gig economy, and the widespread use of webs of casual labour tied together by algorithms to subvert labour laws and other regulations in all sorts of fields, ranging from taxi firms to B\u0026ampBs. So it’s an important development that the state’s senate has now turned decisively against the exploitation of casual workers. This week it passed a law that would reclassify many of the so-called independent contractors who work in the gig economy as employees, entitled to a minimum wage, paid parental leave and unemployment insurance.The ride-sharing companies Uber and Lyft have reacted with a mixture of defiance and obfuscation, which makes it clear just how central it is to their business model to deny workers these benefits. Both claim they are happy to give their workers benefits, so that the law is not really needed, but that it is at the same time a terrible threat to their businesses – neither of which has ever made a profit, despite their astronomical valuations. Uber has said the law will have no effect on it when it comes into operation. The two companies, along with a food delivery business, have also pledged $90m towards a referendum campaign aimed at repealing the measure. This has the potential to be one of those struggles that determines how and for whose benefit the third industrial revolution will continue.When economists think about technology, they don’t just ask what it makes possible but what will be profitable to do with it. This is a more helpful way to look at the future than it would be simply to imagine the outcomes if people used new inventions only for good. There is a long history of self-delusion, not least by those who profit from new inventions, which goes back at least as far as Alfred Nobel, who convinced himself that his invention of dynamite would make war less likely. Then there are the prophets of fully-automated luxury capitalism. The economist Roger Bootle has just published a book in which he predicts, as many have done before him, that the rise of artificial intelligence technologies will lead both to the creation of new jobs to replace some of those which it will undoubtedly destroy, and that these jobs will be better, or less time consuming, than those we have at present. This is not entirely impossible. There is no call for absolute pessimism. But the rise of the gig economy companies shows that the future of work that economists and others have worried about has already arrived, and it is not what the optimists promised.We were promised that robots would take away much of the drudge work in which people are presently employed, and that artificial intelligence would solve problems that mere humans cannot. Yet there are many problems that AI cannot even simulate understanding, and many things that robots cannot manipulate with the subtlety and dexterity of human fingers. Although some futurists talk about the possibilities of embedding silicon ships into human bodies to enhance their capabilities, what has actually happened is almost the opposite. Human bodies have been embedded into algorithmically controlled enterprises. The drivers for Uber and Lyft, the food delivery cyclists of Deliveroo and the warehouse workers of Amazon are all controlled by software, which makes the work longer and harder than any unaided human overseer could. This did not have to happen. Nor was it entirely the fault of greedy capitalists: everyone who takes advantage of these services is also taking advantage of their workers.The Californian laws – and similar attempts to rein in the gig economy companies in this country, driven mostly by the unions, and especially the GMB – show that none of these developments were inevitable. And none are irresistible, either. It is half true that these companies are, as their boosters boast, disruptive, but they also reinforce age-old tendencies towards exploitation and inequality. It is up to us as citizens and legislators to disrupt this great disruption and make it work for everyone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/509b59b2a2d27f483ebd41dcbef1f7b6dc5f5693/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ddf8e55a9e369cae48347eb2f312afdf","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of market","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘market’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘market’.Share your photos of what market means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 18 September at 10am.

Khawa Karpo is the tallest of the Meili mountain range, piercing the sky at 6,740 metres (22,112ft) above sea level. Local Tibetan communities believe that conquering Khawa Karpo is an act of sacrilege and would cause the deity to abandon his mountain home. Nevertheless, there have been several failed attempts by outsiders – the best known by an international team of 17, all of whom died in an avalanche during their ascent on 3 January 1991. After much local petitioning, in 2001 Beijing passed a law banning mountaineering there.However, Khawa Karpo continues to be affronted more insidiously. Over the past two decades, the Mingyong glacier at the foot of the mountain has dramatically receded. Villagers blame disrespectful human behaviour, including an inadequacy of prayer, greater material greed and an increase in pollution from tourism. People have started to avoid eating garlic and onions, burning meat, breaking vows or fighting for fear of unleashing the wrath of the deity.

This frozen “water tower of Asia” is the source of 10 of the world’s largest rivers, including the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Yellow, Mekong and Indus, whose flows support at least 1.6 billion people directly – in drinking water, agriculture, hydropower and livelihoods – and many more indirectly, in buying a T-shirt made from cotton grown in China, for example, or rice from India.Joseph Shea, a glaciologist at the University of Northern British Columbia, calls the loss “depressing and fear-inducing. It changes the nature of the mountains in a very visible and profound way.” Yet the fast-changing conditions at the third pole have not received the same attention as those at the north and south poles. The IPCC’s fourth assessment report in 2007 contained the erroneous prediction that all Himalayan glaciers would be gone by 2035. This statement turned out to have been based on anecdote rather than scientific evidence and, perhaps out of embarrassment, the third pole has been given less attention in subsequent IPCC reports.There is also a dearth of research compared to the other poles, and what hydrological data exists has been jealously guarded by the Indian government and other interested parties. The Tibetan plateau is a vast and impractical place for glaciologists to work in and confounding factors make measurements hard to obtain. Scientists are forbidden by locals, for instance, to step out on to the Mingyong glacier, meaning they have had to use repeat photography to measure the ice retreat.In the face of these problems, satellites have proved invaluable, allowing scientists to watch glacial shrinkage in real time. This summer, Columbia University researchers also used declassified spy-satellite images from the cold war to show that third pole ice loss has accelerated over this century and is now roughly double the melt rate of 1975 to 2000, when temperatures were on average 1C lower. Glaciers in the region are currently losing about half a vertical metre of ice per year because of anthropogenic global heating, the researchers concluded. Glacial melt here carries significant risk of death and injury – far more than in the sparsely populated Arctic and Antarctic – from glacial lake outbursts (when a lake forms and suddenly spills over its banks in a devastating flood) and landslides caused by destabilised rock. Whole villages have been washed away and these events are becoming increasingly regular, even if monitoring and rescue systems have improved. Satellite data shows that numbers and sizes of such risky lakes in the region are growing. Last October and November, on three separate occasions, debris blocked the flow of the Yarlung Tsangpo in Tibet, threatening India and Bangladesh downstream with flooding and causing thousands to be evacuated.There is another culprit besides our CO2 emissions in this warming story, and it’s all too evident on the dirty surface of the Mingyong glacier: black carbon, or soot. A 2013 study found that black carbon is responsible for 1.1 watts per square metre of the Earth’s surface of extra energy being stored in the atmosphere (CO2 is responsible for an estimated 1.56 watts per square metre). Black carbon has multiple climate effects, changing clouds and monsoon circulation as well as accelerating ice melt. Air pollution from the Indo-Gangetic Plains – one of the world’s most polluted regions – deposits this black dust on glaciers, darkening their surface and hastening melt. While soot landing on dark rock has little effect on its temperature, snow and glaciers are particularly vulnerable because they are so white and reflective. As glaciers melt, the surrounding rock crumbles in landslides, covering the ice with dark material that speeds melt in a runaway cycle. The Everest base camp, for instance, at 5,300 metres, is now rubble and debris as the Khumbu glacier has retreated to the icefall.The immense upland of the third pole is one of the most ecologically erse and vulnerable regions on Earth. People have only attempted to conquer these mountains in the last century, yet in that time humans have subdued the glaciers and changed the face of this wilderness with pollution and other activities. Researchers are now beginning to understand the scale of human effects on the region – some have experienced it directly: many of the 300 IPCC cryosphere report authors meeting in the Nepalese capital in July were forced to take shelter or ert to other airports because of a freak monsoon.But aAside from such inconveniences, what do these changes mean for the 240 million people living in the mountains? Well, in many areas, it has been welcomed. Warmer, more pleasant winters have made life easier. The higher temperatures have boosted agriculture – people can grow a greater variety of crops and benefit from more than one harvest per year, and that improves livelihoods. This may be responsible for the so-called Karakoram anomaly, in which a few glaciers in the Pakistani Karakoram range are advancing in opposition to the general trend. Climatologists believe that the sudden and massive growth of irrigated agriculture in the local area, coupled with unusual topographical features, has produced an increase in snowfall on the glaciers which currently more than compensates for their melting.Elsewhere, any increase in precipitation is not enough to counter the rate of ice melt and places that are wholly reliant on meltwater for irrigation are feeling the effects soonest. “Springs have dried drastically in the past 10 years without meltwater and because infrastructure has cut off discharge,” says Aditi Mukherji, one of the authors of the IPCC report.Known as high-altitude deserts, places such as Ladakh in north-eastern India and parts of Tibet have already lost many of their lower-altitude glaciers and with them their seasonal irrigation flows, which is affecting agriculture and electricity production from hydroelectric dams. In some places, communities are trying to geoengineer artificial glaciers that ert runoff from higher glaciers towards shaded, protected locations where it can freeze over winter to provide meltwater for irrigation in the spring.Towards the end of this century, pre-monsoon water-flow levels in all these rivers will drastically reduce without glacier buffers, affecting agricultural output as well as hydropower generation, and these stresses will be compounded by an increase in the number and severity of devastating flash floods. “The impact on local water resources will be huge, especially in the Indus Valley. We expect to see migration out of dry, high-altitude areas first but populations across the region will be affected,” says Shea, also an author on the ICIMOD report.As the third pole’s vast frozen reserves of fresh water make their way down to the oceans, they are contributing to sea-level rise that is already making life difficult in the heavily populated low-lying deltas and bays of Asia, from Bangladesh to Vietnam. What is more, they are releasing dangerous pollutants. Glaciers are time capsules, built snowflake by snowflake from the skies of the past and, as they melt, they deliver back into circulation the constituents of that archived air. Dangerous pesticides such as DDT (widely used for three decades before being banned in 1972) and perfluoroalkyl acids are now being washed downstream in meltwater and accumulating in sediments and in the food chain.Ultimately the future of this vast region, its people, ice sheets and arteries depends – just as Khawa Karpo’s devotees believe – on us: on reducing our emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. As Mukherji says, many of the glaciers that haven’t yet melted have effectively “disappeared because in the dense air pollution, you can no longer see them”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bceaab691b06c3f3830e7794d24c6ada2b301fad/847_177_2750_1650/master/2750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e3d863135d213c6bf3cde7ebe4d2104","title":"victoria beckham announces launch of own makeup brand","story":"Ex-Spice Girl reveals plan to take on Gwyneth Paltrow in increasingly lucrative sectorVictoria Beckham’s pivot from Spice Girl to fashion designer was, it turns out, just the beginning. Her next ambition sees her poised to reinvent herself a second time as Britain’s answer to Gwyneth Paltrow. Paltrow is currently the unrivalled star of the increasingly lucrative wellness industry, as frontwoman of the brand and media empire Goop, but Beckham looks set to mount a challenge.Launching her makeup collection at London fashion week, she revealed that her new beauty brand was “just scratching the surface. I always say that it’s about living a really healthy lifestyle. I like to have fun – I like a glass of wine and I like a glass of tequila – but I also really look after myself. I talk a lot on my channels about the vitamins I take, about the working out, about my whole lifestyle. So that’s what’s next – wellness. It’s not about skincare that makes you look younger, it’s about being the best version of yourself.”The Victoria Beckham fashion show on Sunday lunchtime was a grand affair, held in the pomp and grandeur of the light-filled Durbar Court in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, a stone’s throw from Downing Street, with Dame Helen Mirren in the front row. After Beckham acknowledged the end of show applause with a smile and a wave, Mirren sought her out backstage to offer some advice, insisting that “before next time, I’m going to teach you how to take a proper bow”. Beckham, however, seemed to be focused on how many eyeshadow palettes had been sold in the first day of online sales.“The reaction has been huge, bigger than we dreamed,” Beckham said. “We had aggressive targets, and we’ve smashed them. It confirms there is an appetite for what I do.” The Tuxedo eye palette and Mink lid lustre both sold out within hours of going on sale.The collection on the catwalk was strong, channelling the 1970s bourgeois-chic aesthetic currently in vogue but with an added hit of juicy, vibrant colour. A check tweed kilt-styled midiskirt was worn with a lemon yellow silk blouse, layered over an ivory polo neck. Burgundy wing collars were spread over the lapels of a houndstooth trouser suit, and a slim chocolate skirt was elevated to evening wear with a ruffled silk blouse in Granny Smith green. Longline blazers hung over high-waisted straight trousers, while airy kaftan-styled evening dresses had heavy gold pendants at their plunging necklines. “I love how the ruffles dance around your body when you move,” Beckham said of the strikingly anti-body-con party dresses. You feel really sexy in them, without showing lots of skin.”Victoria Beckham Beauty will be “active and effective, but clean and kind”, said Beckham. The brand will use no parabens or sulphates, “clean” being a buzzword that resonates with a young customer base priced out of Beckham’s catwalk fashion creations but who follow her on social media channels and are now able to buy into her brand.The expansion into beauty has rooted her business more firmly in London. “When we moved our show from New York to London, we didn’t know if we would stay. But now I can’t imagine being anywhere else. I’ve got my ateliers and my beauty team in the same building, and it’s nice to go home to my family at the end of the day,” she said at a preview on Friday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73ce2b3b955367327448d708f38f6ffe331515db/0_0_2831_1699/master/2831.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d149038574df66348cd410695d93281","title":"chinese food revolution uk hunan sichuan xinjiang fuchsia dunlop","story":"Charting the 200-year journey from city docksides to Michelin stars as the UK finally explores new frontiers of Chinese cooking – from Hunan to XinjiangIn 1996, I sent my first proposal for a Sichuan cookbook to six publishers. The rejection letters came in one by one. Each of them explained, in one way or another, that a regional Chinese cookbook was too niche for British readers. Crestfallen, I was also incredulous, having spent nearly two years in Sichuan, eating widely and being amazed by the local food. Sichuan was no backwater, but a province with a population of 80 million. Within China, it was famed for its thrilling and distinctive cuisine. Could these editors not let me persuade them of the incomparable charms of fish-fragrant aubergines and mapo tofu?In retrospect, their hesitation was understandable. Although China had embarked on its “reform and opening up” in 1992, to most Britons it still seemed remote and irrelevant. In the UK, the Chinese food scene had mainly settled into a pattern of Cantonese dishes adapted to British tastes. “Chinese food” was both so familiar that it seemed passé and hardly known at all. Practically the only visible glimmers of China’s breathtaking regional cuisines were occasional references to “Szechwan” or “Peking” flavours on the menus of otherwise Cantonese restaurants. While the pioneering cookbooks of Ken Hom, Yan-kit So and Deh-ta Hsiung had introduced British readers to classic recipes from all over China, China’s decades of introversion had offered outsiders little chance to explore its regional food traditions in the way they had the cuisines of southern Europe.Historically, the first Chinese eating houses in Britain weren’t aimed at local customers at all, but at Chinese sailors who had settled around the docks in London’s Limehouse, Liverpool and other cities in the 19th century. The country’s small Chinese population grew in the early 20th century when a new trickle of students joined the original settlers. They all faced discrimination, exacerbated by Sax Rohmer’s 1913 novel The Mystery of Fu Manchu, which painted a lurid picture of Chinese Limehouse as a hotbed of opium and crime.It was only when Chinese restaurants started opening in central London that they began to win the affections of customers who were not Chinese. The first in the West End seems to have been the Cathay in 1908 more appeared in the 1930s and 1940s, including the popular Ley-On in Wardour Street.By all accounts, it was the altered palates of servicemen returning from Asia after the second world war that helped to shift attitudes.After the war, the number of Chinese restaurants in London and other cities grew steadily. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, a new wave of Cantonese immigrants from Hong Kong arrived, followed in the 1970s by thousands of ethnic Chinese refugees from Vietnam: many ended up in catering. In the 1960s, clusters of Chinese restaurants appeared around Gerrard Street in central London and in central Manchester, both of which quickly became established as their cities’ Chinatowns. The old Limehouse Chinatown, largely destroyed by wartime bombing, sputtered out as Chinese restaurateurs focused their energies on Soho.By the time I started reviewing restaurants for Time Out in the late 1990s, Chinese restaurants and takeaways were a fixture across the country. Most specialised in the lightly flavoured cuisine of the Cantonese south: dim sum, roast ducks and barbecued meats that hung enticingly in restaurant windows, steamed seafood, stir-fried vegetables and claypot stews. While authentic, traditional Cantonese cooking could be found at the much-loved Mr Kong, Poon’s and the New Mayflower in London, many Britons preferred dishes adapted to their tastes: crispy duck, sweet and sour pork and egg fried rice. More interesting delicacies were hidden away on Chinese-language menus. There was little to challenge the Cantonese dominance of the trade. Restaurants were mostly Cantonese-run, as were the importers and sellers of ingredients. Zingy Sichuan pepper and earthy Pixian chilli bean paste were nowhere to be found. Cantonese was the language of Chinatown: hardly anyone spoke fluent Mandarin.Over the past two decades, there has been a revolution in Chinese food in Britain, driven by the waves and ripples of China’s emergence as a new cultural and political force in the world. The old Cantonese guard have mostly retired from the catering business, their children, educated in the UK, moving into white-collar jobs. Since China began to open up in the early 1990s, a new generation of Chinese people, not only from the Cantonese south but all over the country, have had the chance to explore the world. Immigrants from other regions, particularly south-eastern Fujian province, have come to work in the kitchens of established Chinese restaurants and later to open their own. Students have flocked to British schools and universities, alongside growing numbers of Chinese tourists (the number of Chinese visits to Britain almost quadrupled between 2008 and 2018).These twin forces of a newly erse population of Chinese restaurant workers and an equally erse pool of Chinese customers have been equally important in reshaping British Chinese food. In the past, Chinese restaurants could only survive by catering for the British tastes of their time now, particularly in university cities, they have a substantial market of recent arrivals from China, many of them young people, who want to eat the kind of food they enjoy at home. And since the late 1990s, that food has overwhelmingly been the spicy cuisine of Sichuan province.When my Sichuan cookbook was eventually published in 2001, Sichuanese food was still an unknown quantity for the vast majority of British people. Food journalists I met around that time had never experienced the arresting tingle of good Sichuan pepper on their lips or tasted a properly fiery mapo tofu. Little had been written about Sichuanese food in English: a couple of American cookbooks (Robert Delfs’s The Good Food of Szechwan and Ellen Schrecker’s Mrs Chiang’s Szechwan Cookbook) had been the first to showcase the cuisine, but both were out of print. There were few Sichuanese people living in western countries, and until the 1990s, when serendipity first took me to Sichuan, it would have been impossible for a foreigner to research a regional Chinese cookbook on the ground, collecting recipes and describing at first hand local life and culture as I was able to. The culinary institute at which I’d trained in the Sichuanese capital, Chengdu, had never previously had a foreign student. In the UK, “Szechwan” (an older transliteration than the current “Sichuan’) was merely used to describe generically spicy dishes on Chinese menus.As the new market economy emerged in China in the 1990s, the restaurant scene, in the doldrums since the Cultural Revolution, once again erupted into life. With economic revival came an appetite for one of China liveliest and most stimulating cuisines. Sichuanese restaurants and snack shops opened all over the country dishes such as shuizhuyu (tender slices of fish in a seething sea of oil and chillies) and hotpot became wildly fashionable. It was only natural that the new wave of Chinese sojourners and immigrants making their way to Britain brought this fashion with them.Already, around the time my book was published, the first shoots of a Sichuan restaurant spring had appeared in London. I began hearing rumours from Chinese friends of small restaurants in Acton and Kilburn serving authentic Sichuanese food, and was astonished when I visited Angeles on the Kilburn High Road, with its menu of traditional Sichuan dishes. It was the opening of Barshu in Soho in 2006 that really put the cuisine on the map. A businessman from Shandong province, Shao Wei, wanted to open a smart, central restaurant serving the kind of food his highly educated and often affluent Chinese friends wanted to eat. He assembled a team of five chefs from Sichuan, led by the talented Fu Wenhong, imported key seasonings from China and, before the restaurant opened, brought me on board as a consultant. From the beginning, we decided to dispense with crispy duck and other London Chinese staples, and offer a contemporary Sichuanese menu on Chinese terms. Barshu was at the forefront of a broader ersification of the Chinese restaurant scene. Before long, there were Sichuan restaurants in many parts of London, as well as in Manchester, Nottingham, Birmingham, Oxford and other cities even Cantonese restaurants began adding Sichuan dishes to their menus. Spicy Sichuan hotpot, adored throughout China, started to appear in specialist restaurants with tables cut out to hold bubbling cauldrons of chilli-laced broth.The cuisines of Hunan, another chilli-loving province, and the Dongbei (north-eastern) region followed in Sichuan’s spicy wake. Many of the new regional restaurants started out with no English-language publicity but simply an eye for attracting Chinese customers, their menus reflecting Chinese more than local culinary fashions. The street food of Xi’an and the great north west has begun to make its mark in London with the opening of Xi’an Impression, Master Wei, Murger Han and Xi’an Biang Biang Noodles. You can even head for the Silk Road in Walthamstow, where Uyghur chef Mukaddes Yadikar cooks up the specialities of her Xinjiang home at her restaurant Etles. Aside from regional flavours, the Chinese food scene has ersified in other ways. In London, diners can take their pick from a meal of shared dishes with rice, a dim sum lunch, a hotpot feast, a dumpling extravaganza at xiaolongbao specialist Din Tai Fung or an elegant mah jong dinner at Xu. Homegrown restaurants are now in competition with Chinese international brands, such as Din Tai Fung and Haidilao. In 2017, the British-born Chinese chef Andrew Wong won a Michelin star for his inventive, historically inspired cooking.Beyond the formal dining sector, street food stalls and pop-ups have opened the kitchen door to new tastes and styles. There are toasty-bottomed Shanghainese buns on offer at Dumpling Shack in Spitalfields Market and spicy Chongqing noodles cooked up in the basement of a pub in Marylebone by Liu Xiaomian. Lillian Luk, originally from Shanghai, offers home-cooked Jiangnan food at her Shanghai Supper Clubs another Shanghainese chef, Jason Li, hosts acclaimed dinners in Wapping under the name Dream of Shanghai. While these openings still represent only a taste of China’s extraordinary gastronomic ersity, they have shattered old stereotypes of a monolithic Chinese cuisine.The availability of Chinese ingredients has also been transformed. Chinese supermarkets stock Sichuan chilli bean paste, fresh green Sichuan pepper, Sichuan pepper oil and facing heaven chillies. Even mainstream supermarkets sell Chinese brands favoured by Chinese customers, such as Lee Kum Kee seasonings and the addictive Laoganma chilli and black bean sauce. And while Chinatowns and Chinese superstores may have the greatest ranges of foods, a new generation of small east Asian grocers stock most of the basic ingredients for Chinese cooking.Despite all these developments, the UK Chinese restaurant scene faces serious constraints. The tightening of immigration rules a few years ago has made it almost impossible for restaurants to bring in new chefs from China. The rapid expansion of hotpot restaurants reflects not only the popularity of the dish, but also the fact that hotpot is a relatively low-skilled business: it’s much easier to find staff to slice up raw ingredients for hotpot than chefs adept at wok cookery. There have been some attempts to introduce local training in Chinese cooking, most recently with a collaboration between Crawley College and the Tianjin School of Cuisine, but most restaurants are competing to employ Chinese chefs from the same limited pool already living in Britain.The proliferation of exciting Chinese street food has come hand in hand with a decline in more sophisticated cuisine in London’s Chinatown, accomplished Cantonese cooking, once the mainstay, is now almost impossible to find. Aside from these specific worries, Chinese restaurateurs, like everyone else in the business, complain of tough competition and soaring rents and rates.When it comes to Chinese cuisine in Britain, the possibilities are almost infinite. Late 20th century convention carves China up into four or eight regional cuisines, but in truth every region, province, city and town has its own specialities. The great south-western province of Yunnan, for example, is an extraordinary patchwork of foods and flavours even Sichuanese and Cantonese cuisines are still relatively unexplored. While Britons’ appetite for new Chinese foods may be boundless, the ability of Chinese restaurants to respond to it is tightly circumscribed. It remains to be seen whether we are at a peak of innovative Chinese cuisine in Britain, or on the brink of a multitude of new discoveries.The Food of Sichuan by Fuchsia Dunlop (Bloomsbury Publishing, £30).

For large periods, a passive Everton side flattered to deceive and Bournemouth duly punished them.Other than Richarlison, Everton underwhelmed until things clicked on the brink of the interval. Bournemouth, though, gave them a helping hand. Seamus Coleman surged down the right flank unchallenged before slipping in Richarlison, who eased to the byline before standing up a cross for Calvert-Lewin to tower above a flat‑footed Steve Cook and nod in. It was a soft equaliser that exposed Bournemouth’s brittleness in defence and a degree of naivety in a side with an average of 24 years and 195 days, Eddie Howe’s youngest starting lineup in a top-flight fixture.Everton may have been off-colour but Richarlison had threatened before Wilson’s opener, smacking an effort against a right angle of Aaron Ramsdale’s goal from 25 yards after slinking away from Philip Billing, who twice flashed wide at the other end.Howe opted to field Joshua King on the left wing, with Dominic Solanke and Wilson paired as a front two and Bournemouth’s abundance of pace caused havoc. It was the three of them that combined for a scruffy opener. It was a case of Wilson feeding off scraps in the box, alert enough to head in from close range after Solanke beat Richarlison to the ball to flick on Diego Rico’s corner at the front post. King, who selflessly plugged away throughout, swiped his left leg at it, helping the ball back across goal and Wilson, together with Nathan Aké, strained to guide it home.Rico was unconvincing defensively, though, with the left-back laying the ball on a plate for Calvert-Lewin to fire over before inviting Coleman to maraud forward in the buildup to the leveller. On the opposite flank Jack Stacey was kept busy, asked to tame Alex Iwobi and the excellent, overlapping Lucas Digne, on his Premier League debut.The presence of Lewis Cook in the Bournemouth midfield after nine months out with a knee injury was a major boost for Howe, who dropped Fraser and Jefferson Lerma, who racked up more than 11,000 air miles with Colombia over the international break. That did not stop Marco Silva fielding the midfielder’s countryman, Yerry Mina, or Richarlison, who played 170 minutes for Brazil. Lerma did enter as a late substitute for Cook, who was given a standing ovation on leaving the field, while Howe called on Fraser approaching the hour. After replacing Harry Wilson the winger immediately lured Digne into a foul that earned him a booking.Ten minutes after coming on Fraser had the ball in Jordan Pickford’s net. Fraser’s right-footed free-kick – won by King after another explosive run – trickled past Pickford via Fabian Delph, who swiped his left leg at the ball. Five minutes later Bournemouth sealed the three points, with Wilson latching on to Rico’s pass and powering a shot beyond Pickford."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c80df5dc6161978dc7f25c85549a5d87aefc5f42/0_63_2856_1713/master/2856.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d854f5d41332d776579f280c4498d57","title":"bournemouth v everton premier league live","story":"Callum Wilson scored twice for Bournemouth who took advantage of poor Everton defending throughoutThanks for joining and especially for any New York tips. Alternatively, join Rob Smyth for Watford v Arsenal Amuse yourself with Jonathan Wilson while we wait for Ben Fisher’s report ...Souness is not a fan of Everton’s defending. Cahill a bit more diplomatic in the studio. Callum Wilson says: “We needed to get back to winning games at home. Winning games at home is the most important thing.”Ryan Fraser says Eddie Howe told him to prove why he should be starting the next game. He has proved that. “Hello Mr Howe, I’ll take a three-year deal, please.”Calvert-Lewin scored but I think Kean needs to be given more chances as he looks the more dynamic player. Calvert-Lewin is very much a ‘can do a job’ striker but if Everton really want to start looking up the table, they need someone more prolific and Kean could be that man. When Kean and Bernard came on it did seem like Everton were playing quicker.Bournemouth took their chances and that was the difference, to be honest. Everton let two set-pieces and a long ball over the top end up in the back of the net, while failing to create much down the other end.90+2 mins: Mina seemingly hates Pickford, he plays a short backpass to the goalkeeper, who realises it’s a terrible pass and leaps out to clear the ball before Wilson can nip in for his hat-trick. Pickford then gives Mina the look of a primary school teacher to a pupil who has just poured his milk on the floor. 89 mins: Bernard cuts and drifts past Lerma, whacks a shot which is deflected up into the air, resulting in Billing and Iwobi battling for the loose ball at the back post. The challenge leaves them both on the floor but both just about get up. Five minutes added on. 87 mins: I actually think this game has been quite even but Bournemouth have just made the most of their time in the final third, aided by some poor defending. Everton have been limited to half-chances and little else.85 mins: Michael Keane decides the best idea is to lift a long, high backpass to Pickford from about 40 yards away is a good idea. It is not and bounces out for a corner. Keane would be a good defender if he could pass or keep his position. 83 mins: Can Everton salvage anything from this? Kean indicates they won’t by crossing the ball into Ramsdale’s hands.81 mins: Everton should be back in this game but first Iwobi’s effort from 17 yards is repelled by Ramsdale into Richarlison’s path but the Brazilian messes everything up and whacks it wide. He is rightly punished by being replaced with Theo Walcott. Justin Kavanagh emails: “Surely a club paying wages in the tens of thousands (per week) have the right to demand that players become two-footed? Delph’s dreadful inability to use his right foot is comparable to a goalkeeper only using one hand going up for crosses.” Rather than demand, they could just train them.79 mins: Jack Stacey, making his Premier League debut, has gone down with cramp after tackling Bernard. He is finding out what the Premier League is all about today.77 mins: I watch a lot of live football but have never wanted to buy a TagHeuer watch. Maybe their sponsorship plan is not working. Lerma replaces Lewis Cook who has shown what he adds to Bournemouth. The midfielder has missed nine months of football and will be very happy to be back.75 mins: Everton have conceded from two set-pieces and a long ball over the top today, which is a bit of a worry looking to win the Everton Trophy this season by finishing seventh.The Everton defence is awful. Lewis Cook lifts the ball over the centre-backs who turn like the Titanic, allowing Wilson to nip in ahead of them and calmly lift the ball over Pickford who calm a long way out of his goal.71 mins: Bernard and Kean are on for Everton, which is not much of a surprise after Bournemouth took the lead. Calvert-Lewin and Sigurdsson make way.69 mins: Fraser is having fun here. This time he dinks a ball into Wilson, who takes it onto his chest but then can’t get his shot away in time and the ball is cleared for a corner. Fraser takes a dreadful, low free-kick from the left wing, which beats Delph at the front post who makes a laughable attempt to clear it with his wrong foot. The ball deceives everyone and lands in the bottom corner. 66 mins: Steve Cook beats Calvert-Lewin to a through ball but then plays a pitifully weak backpass to Ramsdale, which the striker gets to first but the goalkeeper does well to stop his jab and Cook recovers to remove the remnants of danger. Down the other end, King springs away from everyone down the left until Richarlison almost catches up and cynically downs in to take the Bournemouth forward down 20 yards from goal. Needless to say, Richarlison was booked.64 mins: Richard McGahey points out: “The problem isn’t VAR, it’s Premier League refereeing. Much more physical play is allowed on a consistent basis, tackling opponents in the penalty area, kicking them in the head with high boots, never calling persistent infringement for a cynical team policy of fouling, commentators admiring Sean Dyche, etc. VAR can’t correct for this playing and reffing culture.”62 mins: The Everton fans shout for a handball after the ball hits Fraser’s shoulder in his own area. It goes to VAR and comes to nothing. Steve Cook is down in the box with a knee issue, so he might struggle to carry on.60 mins: Bournemouth try to pass the ball out from the back despite one of their centre backs being on his haunches. Bit of an odd move which ends with Everton winning a throw-in. Digne wins a corner after his dangerous cross is turned behind by Fraser.58 mins: I very rarely get things right, so Eddie Howe replacing Harry Wilson with Ryan Fraser, as I suggested, has cheered me greatly. Fraser’s first involvement is to intercept a stray Delph pass, forcing Digne to bring him down, earning a yellow for his troubles. 56 mins: Digne seems to be struggling with some sort of injury, not that I can work out what it is. Mina does well to intercept a ball over the top but then just runs it out of play for a corner. 54 mins: Sigurdsson looks to instigate a counter-attack with a ball down the channel but thinks he is playing for Wimbledon circa 1993 and just whacks it the entire length of the pitch so even Ben Johnson at peak drug taking couldn’t catch. 52 mins: There’s plenty of back and forth here but someone really needs to take hold of this game in midfield. 50 mins: A missed a few moments retrieving a pastel de nata from my bag. Luckily, nothing happened. 47 mins: Digne and Iwobi combine well on the left-hand side of the box, allowing the former to cut it back for Sigurdsson who does his best to ert a strong pass at goal and Ramsdale tips over. Here we go again!JR says: “The reason Calvert-Lewin has so high above Cook was because he had both hands on Cook’s shoulders and held him down at the same time as he used him to push himself up. You’d maybe expect VAR would have something to say about that. Of course you’d have to believe the people in charge of using VAR know what the hell they’re doing, which I don’t. It’s an epic shambles so far.“(And I’m not saying I necessarily want every little niggly foul looked back on or every eyelash offside looked and again and called but if they’re going to use VAR there needs to be some consistency in how it’s used and right now there is absolutely none.)“Also ... if anyone wants to email in New York recommendations to me, please do.Any early changes required? I would consider Davies for Schneiderlin and Fraser for Harry Wilson.Mary Waltz offers: “Everton finally shows some quality in the box. They have the talent to do so much better but on the road it so rarely appears.”It’s been a game with plenty of action but minimal quality in the final third. A draw is fair enough at this stage. Richarlison makes a run out to the right wing, and lifts a cross onto the head of Calvert-Lewin, who leaps a lot higher than Steve Cook and heads beyond Ramsdale from six yards out. 42 mins: Ake spins in the box and hits a relatively tame shot towards goal which Solanke gets in the way of and erts wide. 40 mins: A yellow card for Delph as he cleans out Wilson with a very high boot. It could have been worse if he caught more of the man but the VAR check says it is not worthy of a dismissal.

Arsenal were a bit tentative we smelt that a bit, and we said at half-time that if we got the next goal we had a massive chance. We can definitely build on that second half. We know we can compete with anyone, especially at home.“We’re both disappointed and happy. We reacted very well, but we could have won today. We played well in the first 20 minutes and we knew we would get more chances in the second half. We gave everything today – we are so tired. We know we can do it, and this is good for the future.”It’s hard to know where to start with that match. Arsenal led 2-0 at half-time after two lovely goals from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. But Watford were relentless in the second half, and got back in the game through Tom Cleverley after some laughable defending from Arsenal. Roberto Pereyra’s late penalty brought them level, and both teams had chances to win it. It was pulsating entertainment.Peep peep! A fine, uplifting game ends with honours even. Quique Sanchez Flores is back so are Watford. They were wonderful.90+2 min: Vital save from Leno! Doucoure almost scored the winner after a fantastic piece of play. He surged forward from deep inside his own half, beating Sokratis with a lovely bit of skill on the halfway line before finding Sarr on the right. Sarr fizzed a precise low cross to pick out Doucoure, whose sidefooted shot was smothered by the plunging Leno. This is tremendous stuff!90+1 min It’s like a basketball game now. Willock misses a great chance to play Aubameyang in at one end then Cleverley’s shot is blocked at the other and finally Capoue is booked for stopping Arsenal’s counter-counter-counter-attack.90 min An abysmal pass from Xhaka on the edge of the Watford area allows the home side to break. Doucoure’s vicious shot is blocked by Torreira. It’s breathless stuff.89 min Nelson wins the ball off Sarr and buys Arsenal a bit of time with a break down the left. Eventually Aubameyang’s cross is miscontrolled by the stretching Xhaka, in a lot of space at the far post. A better touch there would have given him a great chance.87 min Janmaat shoots well wide from the edge of the area. Watford have had 28 attempts on goal to Arsenal’s seven.86 min Doucoure’s shot is blocked and comes to Cleverley, whose cracking rising drive is headed over by David Luiz. I think that was going in. Leno certainly wouldn’t have got to it.85 min Arsenal are all over the place. They are hanging on for dear life.84 min So close from Deulofeu! Cleveley’s shot was blocked by Sokratis and rebounded to Deulofeu, who drilled a low shot this far wide of the far post.83 min Only one side looks like winning this game, and it’s not Romania. Pereyra’s cross is headed away by David Luiz, but Arsenal cannot get out.Pereyra passed the ball low to his left, with Leno going the wrong way. Watford deserve that for a stirring performance.VAR check: it’s a penalty. It was just inside the area. Pereyra changed direction nicely, and David Luiz dangled a leg as only he can.David Luiz has fouled Pereyra right on the line of the area. 79 min Arsenal enjoy a bit of respite in the Watford half. Eventually, Torreira rattles a snapshot from 12 yards that is beaten away by Foster.76 min A comedy of errors almost leads to an equaliser. Nelson leads an Arsenal break, only for the ball to hit his heel and fall for Doucoure. He plays it wide to Sarr, whose low cross is miskicked by Kabasele near the penalty spot. That was a chance.75 min Watford deserve an equaliser. Sarr’s stinging shot from long-range hits a defender and goes behind for another corner.72 min A rare Arsenal attack. Pepe does well to pick out Nelson, whose low shot from the edge of the box is comfortably saved by Foster.70 min Technically, Watford’s goal shouldn’t have counted, because Deulofeu’s foot was in the Arsenal area when the goalkick was taken. Apparently VAR can’t get involved with restarts. Quite right, too it’s not like it led to a goal or anything.69 min “When,” says Ian Copestake, “is Will Hughes going to complete his move to Liverpool?”68 min Deulofeu comes infield, past Maitland-Niles yet again, and hits another good shot that takes a deflection and spins wide of the far post.67 min Guendouzi goes off for Arsenal, with Lucas Torreira replacing him.67 min Deulofeu has been fantastic today. He starts another move that almost ends with an equaliser when Femenia’s cross is flicked behind his standing foot and wide of the far post by Pereyra.65 min: Fine play from Sarr! Deulofeu teased Guendouzi on the left of the area and played a short pass into Sarr, who had his back to goal. He stabbed the ball around David Luiz with his first touch, turned and hit a volley that drifted wide of the far post. The shot was mishit but the first touch was lovely.63 min Deulofeu wins a corner for Watford. Before it is taken, Will Hughes is replaced by Roberto Pereyra.60 min It’s all Watford now, and Femenia blasts over from the edge of the area. Arsenal make their first change, with Joe Willock replacing Dani Ceballos.58 min Another fine effort from Deulofeu, who zips infield from the left and curls a low shot that goes a few yards wide of the far post. That means a goalkick for Arsenal, and another chance for Watford.56 min Kiko Femenia is booked for pulling Ozil’s shirt to stop an Arsenal attack.55 min Watford make a change, with the record signing Ismaila Sarr replacing Andre Gray. Moments later, the superb Deulofeu cracks a shot from the left of the box that is comfortably saved by Leno.What an absurd goal. Leno took a goalkick to Sokratis in the six-yard box. He telegraphed a straight pass to Guendouzi on the edge of the area that was intercepted by Deulofeu. His touch erted the ball to Cleverley, who rammed a low shot past Leno from 15 yards.It’s been coming. Arsenal have been playing silly buggers in their own area all day, and now they’ve been punished.52 min Doucoure, teed up nicely by Hughes, slices a shot miles wide from 20 yards. In fact, it’s gone for a throw-in.49 min Ozil finds Xhaka, who blasts over the bar from 35 yards.47 min Guendouzi loses the ball in a very dangerous area again, this time playing a square pass straight to Gray in the Arsenal area. He’s saved by Xhaka, who comes around the side of Gray to make a brilliant tackle. Moments later, Hughes cracks a first-time shot over the bar from 17 yards.46 min Peep peep! Watford begin the second half, so they do.Peep peep! Arsenal lead through two brilliant goals from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The first was an expert finish the second was a team effort inspired by Mesut Ozil. The scoreline is harsh on Watford, who started very brightly and have looked dangerous on the break.45+2 min Holebas and Guendouzi are booked.45+1 min It’s all kicking off here! Holebas challenged Pepe near the halfway line, and suddenly players from both sides appeared to start a shoving match. 45 min Deulofeu, who has been excellent, charges into the area at pace only to run out of room after beating David Luiz.44 min “The relationship between Ozil and Emery is a nuanced one, I think,” says Bill Hargreaves. “Mesut: ‘I don’t care if you don’t want me (but watch this!)’ Unai: ‘I can’t afford you, I don’t want you (but look at that!)’.”It fascinates me, given all type of criticism both men receive, that one of Ozil’s biggest fans was Jose Mourinho. 43 min Kolasinac is booked for an oafish lunge at Hughes.43 min “The NBC feed announcers are trashing the Watford back line,” says Mary Waltz, “but I think it’s more Arsenal quality then poor performance by Watford.”They were two excellent goals, I thought.41 min A win today would take Arsenal to third in the table, behind Manchester City on goal difference.39 min Femenia wins a corner for Watford, who are still game despite the double blow from Aubameyang. David Luiz heads it away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2de5be394b3da544969c27ee48ac09a06a5e68bf/0_140_4800_2881/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d83eb3eb717df8d3735e9f31d19be3e1","title":"tim walker fashion photographer interview theres an extremity to my interest in beauty","story":"Tim Walker’s glossy, dreamily surreal work has dominated fashion photography for two decades. On the eve of a rare show at the V\u0026ampA, he talks about inspiration, not working too hard and how he was once sacked by Richard AvedonIt’s 1995 and supermodels are not getting out of bed for less than $10,000. In Richard Avedon’s studio, a converted fire station on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, Nadja Auermann and Kristen McMenamy are being shot for the new Versace campaign. Both “supes” are almost 6ft, and their hair has been teased upwards, like a skyline, to add another couple of inches. Their frocks and suits are bold, body-conscious, all shoulders and boobs: the acme of power dressing. Avedon – whom everyone calls “Dick” – sets his large- format, 10x8in plate camera low, shooting upwards, making Auermann and McMenamy seem even more like Amazonian deities.In the background, meanwhile, a skinny, somewhat pasty Englishman, not quite 25, looks on. He is Avedon’s fourth assistant, meaning he defers not only to the photographer but to a third assistant, a second assistant and a studio manager. His main responsibilities are changing light bulbs, emptying wastepaper bins, getting food for everyone. He’s shy and a little dreamy, but he is noticing everything.“My role was very, very basic, but having to clear dog shit off the street right in front of his studio – which I had to do a lot – enabled to me to have a front-row seat in the experience of seeing Richard Avedon photograph,” recalls Tim Walker, now 49 and one of the world’s leading fashion photographers for two decades. “I was on the front line and how Dick communicated with the subject was everything.”How so? “Dick would give them a story,” Walker replies. “When Kristen and Nadja came out in two little black suits, he was like, ‘Oh, I think you’re crows and you are on a branch. There’s a worm on the floor and you’re fighting for that worm.’ Very simplistic, childlike scenarios that were very immediate.” You can see how this played out: in one image from the shoot, McMenamy threatens Auermann with a spike-heeled shoe in another, Auermann throws a punch while McMenamy laughs in her face.Walker didn’t stay long with Avedon, only a year. “He actually fired me,” says Walker, laughing. “I didn’t hustle enough. I was a very tragically bad photo assistant, very slow, and the people that worked for him were very quick, fiery and technically uber-experienced.”And, really, you probably wouldn’t instinctively link the two photographers: Avedon is best known for his starkly lit portraits, often set against a minimalist white background Walker, on the other hand, has a more whimsical, fantastical aesthetic. His work, found in magazines such as Vogue, W, Love and i-D, often exists in a surreal realm somewhere between a dream and a nightmare. The scale is off, or the colours are psychedelic, or there are a pair of white horses galloping through an English stately home or the actor Margot Robbie in pink latex is poised to bomb down a slide into a cracked egg, or a model is sitting in a biplane made from a baguette.But Avedon, who died in 2004, is never far from Walker’s mind. On the day we meet, he’s at a studio in east London preparing a shoot he hopes will be the final piece of work for a new exhibition at the V\u0026ampA called Tim Walker: Wonderful Things. Today’s images will feature models wearing extraordinary rubber “balloon” creations designed by Fredrik Tjærandsen, a Norwegian just graduated from Central Saint Martins who has come along to watch. Catwalk footage of the designs, which look like huge inflatable orbs until they are deflated by the wearer and turned into dresses, went viral this summer. Tjærandsen won the prestigious L’Oréal young talent award and, overnight, gained 25,000 Instagram followers.Walker is slim, his dark hair and beard trimmed to the same length. His clothes – black T-shirt, shorts and Nikes – are both less strange and less ‘fashion’ than you’d expect. He has no idea how the photographs will turn out, but he is already toying with Avedon-style scenarios to create a world and coax performances from the models. “This afternoon there will be a bunch of balloons being sold and they are going to be floating around and someone’s bought a balloon and a child is taking them away,” he muses, as we head downstairs to a café. “I’d never talk to someone and say, ‘Stand here, face the light, pose like this…’” Walker pauses, making his point explicit: “So yeah, I owe everything to Avedon.”Looking at Walker’s portfolio, you’d assume he could only have survived a disturbed, deranged childhood. Except, really, it sounds like it couldn’t have been more idyllic. He was born in Guildford, Surrey, but when he and his brother were little, his parents moved to an isolated spot in rural Dorset. Their summers were spent jumping fences, building tree houses and trying to dam the little river that flowed through their valley so that they could swim in it. “Not that my upbringing is any better than anyone else’s,” he says, “but I know the privilege of growing up feral, being allowed to run around gave me a lot of what I draw on now.”When Walker wasn’t mucking about outside with his brother, he was drawing. “Cartoons or cartoonesque figures, extreme,” he says. “So I’d be drawing an extremely tall person with very, very long hair, or I’d be drawing a very round person, or a very black person, a very white person, a very pink or green person. It was sort of a Mr Men language that I’m still doing in a way. There’s an extremity to my interest in beauty.”Walker is that rare photographer who doesn’t post images to Instagram. “I’m not comfortable with people looking at technology too much, because it takes you out of reality in a relentless, needy way,” he says. “And I think just looking at images all in one size makes everything very linear. There’s a great joy of encountering an enormous Wolfgang Tillmans print he’s just stuck up with a nail on a wall in the Tate, then looking at a tiny Cecil Beaton in the National Portrait Gallery taken in the 1930s, then opening up the Sunday Times and seeing Don McCullin’s pictures. Instagram is scary. Be careful. Nineteen Eighty-Four.”After school, Walker spent a few months cataloguing the Cecil Beaton archive at magazine publishing house Condé Nast in London, followed by art school in Exeter. Being given the boot by Avedon during a year in New York didn’t derail his career, in fact the opposite: aged 25, back in the UK, he received his first commission for Vogue (a relationship that continues to this day). Walker soon became the go-to for high-concept fashion shoots, often in collaboration with the set designer Shona Heath.A turning-point, though, came in 2009 when Walker was asked by Vogue to photograph the designer Alexander McQueen. Walker was on a roll before the shoot: the previous year, he’d staged his first major solo exhibition at the Design Museum, and he had recently been honoured with an Infinity Award from the International Centre of Photography in New York. For McQueen, he sourced a skull and asked the set designer Andy Hillman to make a bow tie out of bones that McQueen would wear.The problem was that McQueen didn’t want to wear the bow tie and he didn’t want to put the skull on his head, as Walker envisioned. There was an awkward impasse. But then McQueen popped a cigarette in the mouth of the skull, now perched on the table in front of him. He lit another for himself. The portrait would become one of Walker’s most famous, and an iconic image of McQueen, who killed himself the following year.“McQueen taking control of that sitting taught me the importance of the subject owning their photograph,” says Walker now. “So I am very into all creative people who I work with, whether it’s Fredrik Tjærandsen or McQueen, I want them to own and enjoy and exist within their photograph.”Walker insists that inspiration for his unhinged dreamscapes comes from “the same place it does for you and everyone”. He goes on, “I look at television, I read, I look at National Geographic, at newspapers, at documentary photography, at fashion photography, at cinema, at Fassbender’s films, I look at Merchant Ivory films… Anything that any one of us has seen – high, low, mid – and then I mix it all up.”His best ideas come when he is daydreaming: cycling through Victoria Park, near where he lives, swimming in the Olympic pool in Stratford, walking the dog. A few years ago Walker photographed the director David Lynch, who explained his weirdest thoughts came after he had been doing transcendental meditation. “It was a state that sends up so much creativity for him,” says Walker. “So I learned how to meditate transcendentally.” He breaks into a broad grin, flashing a gold tooth, “And it didn’t really give me a lot!”Walker was approached by the V\u0026ampA back in 2016 about doing an exhibition that looked back at his career in the fashion industry, but also included new, specially commissioned work. It was a huge honour for the photographer, but perhaps an equally outsized gamble for the museum.“It is rare for the V\u0026ampA to give an exhibition of this scale to a photographer so young,” admitted Susanna Brown, the V\u0026ampA’s curator of photography, at the launch in March. “But I feel he has achieved so much over the last 25 years. His work speaks to so many people.” The invitation came at a perfect time for Walker. The commissions from magazines and brands have never stopped rolling in, but he was finding himself disenchanted with the fashion world. There are some exceptions – the Vogue editor Edward Enninful, for example, is a friend and Walker credits him with “de-stagnating” what we think of model beauty – but the industry was leaving him cold. “It’s isolated figures making a lot of money and creating very banal work,” he says. “Artistry is at a premium.”Alongside a more conventional retrospective of 100 or so images in a white room, the V\u0026ampA asked Walker to explore their archives, which contain some 2.3m objects ning 5,000 years of human creativity, and select 10 items that excited him. He would then make new photographic projects based around each of those. “I spent a year opening boxes and speaking with each archivist at the V\u0026ampA,” says Walker. The objects he picked include a manuscript made for the Duchess of Brittany in the 1470s, illustrations by Aubrey Beardsley and a dress from McQueen’s 2009 Horn of Plenty collection. The photographs, alongside the objects that inspired them, will be displayed in room sets created by Shona Heath – think a burned-out cathedral or an opulent country house – so you will feel like you have stumbled into one of Walker’s photographs.“The best thing about the V\u0026ampA project is that it’s a never-ending resource of inspiration,” says Walker. “And coming at that point in my life, it was like a feast! It’s like when you suddenly discover a new restaurant and you’re tasting flavours you’ve never tasted before.” Walker needs to go back to his shoot with the balloon dresses. After today, three years of work on the V\u0026ampA show will be complete. As for what happens next, he’s not sure. As much as Avedon remains a touchstone, Walker is less interested in emulating his ferocious work ethic. He has a newish boyfriend and he likes being one step removed from the fashion world. “I feel sorry for Dick,” says Walker. “He was brilliant, but I don’t know how much fun he had. Working with him was very, very hard, like being in the army. Every time he photographed, it was like going into war. Whereas I’m trying to have a nourishing life and also hopefully make some memorable photographs. But if it doesn’t happen, it doesn’t happen.”There’s also the fact that magazines are shuttering at an alarming rate. “It’s undeniably the death of print media and where does that leave culture?” he says. “I grew up wanting to see photographs that I make on the printed page, so it’s quite an interesting time to stop and take stock and decide where I could go next.” Does that mean Walker might stop taking photographs then? “I just need six months off,” he replies, gnomically. “And when I say time out, not really, because I’m going to be reading, watching, looking.” He smiles, “I’ll still be the same old voyeur.”Tim Walker: Wonderful Things is on at the V\u0026ampA from 21 September to 8 March 2020.

I was worried I would feel like a failure, but the celebrations showed me I was loved and appreciatedIt was the start of 2018 and I had six weddings on the calendar, including that of my younger sister. I was to be bridesmaid twice and had four hen dos to attend. As a single 33-year-old woman, this filled me with dread.I hadn’t ever had a bona fide partner and I was living in a shoebox with a single bed there was barely enough room for my stuff, let alone another person. Matters were made worse when people accused me of being jealous of my sister and that, if I wasn’t careful, I would come across as bitter at her wedding.I spent half the year complaining about how much money I was spending on other people’s nuptials and how much time I was spending organising two hen dos and going to all the others. I started thinking about how marriage is a sexist institution and about the symbolism of female subservience in wedding ceremonies, telling anyone who would listen about how the societal ideals that dictate the pinnacle of a women’s success to be securing a husband haven’t really changed. Most of all, though, I felt alone, inadequate and as though all my achievements were worthless, because I had failed at love.My life, my conversations, my wardrobe and my bank account were dominated by weddings, of which one was in Portugal, one in Germany, one in Yorkshire, one in Essex and two in London. I believed marriage and all the trimmings wouldn’t happen for me, so why was I giving so much of myself and not getting anything in return?As the litany of hen dos and weddings came around, however, I surprised myself by enjoying them. Highlights included singing at the top of my voice at a silent disco aboard a boat on the Thames (while purging myself of self-doubt) glamping and roasting marshmallows in a field on the edge of the Yorkshire Dales feasting on a tower of macarons and a huge selection of cheeses at 1am dancing the night away outside a rustic villa overlooking the sea being serenaded and twirled around by a West End actor posing as a waiter and, of course, seeing some of the people I love the most, on the best day of their lives. My attitude had begun to change as I had fun, and my opinion of myself grew because I felt loved and appreciated.I met people who affirmed that my role as a woman in this world was about much more than my love life, or lack thereof. Instead of quizzing me on my marital status, one father of the bride wanted to talk about aspects of global development and films covering the struggle of intelligent women throughout history. A family friend in her 80s told me to stop worrying about being single and to get on with enjoying life. My mother commented on what wonderful company I had been throughout my sister’s four-day-long festivities.It was moments like these that helped me see that I wasn’t deficient, and gave me the ability to laugh at times that, a few months before, would have sent me face-first into a plate of wedding cake.There was the time a guest asked if I was under pressure to find a husband, and why, as a woman, I was making a wedding speech. Another guest lamented that their son, who is my age, had left it too late to have his first child. Before my sister’s wedding, a relative warned me not to upstage the bride.Focusing on the better elements of each event, and valuing my contribution to them, helped me to politely decline the unwanted invitations to consider whichever single man happened to be there as a romantic proposition. Potential suitors included a gay man, someone who had just left his wife and two children and had flirted with another woman all night, and a guest who couldn’t speak and had bloodied his face from falling over because he was so drunk.Alongside these moments of parody, I started to appreciate not having to share the spotlight with, or look after, anyone. I took the opportunity to shine. There were moments of feeling lonely, but the abiding sentiment was one of hope and happiness. A year on, I relish being invited to and going to weddings. I have moved out of the flat with a shoebox room because I feel I deserve more. I am still single, not dating, and that is fine.

It’s aesthetically impressive and has quickly become one of the best venues for large-scale electronic events, and so is ripe for an Aphex Twin brain-tickle – even if free earplugs, sadly, aren’t on offer tonight. Although the musician has never relied on album cycles to draw in new audiences, it is striking how young the audience winding through Printworks is.As well as releasing around a dozen EPs in the past decade on his own label, Rephlex, and Warp, there was mass excitement about Richard David James’s “return” as an album artist in 2014, with the Grammy award-winning Syro – and the memorable flight of a neon-green blimp bearing the Aphex Twin logo over London. Along with the weight of his back catalogue and mythical status, what makes shows such as these sell out in minutes is Aphex Twin’s love of spectacle and keen support for new electronic artists. The former is a perfect fit for this, the Red Bull music festival’s high concept (and budget). In terms of the latter, he’s viewed as a switched-on father figure to younger artists and fans, his hybrid set blending new club tracks with live modular jams, his own music, and ripe selections of 90s UK hardcore.The support acts – Italian electronic minimalist Caterina Barbieri, Ugandan percussion group Nihiloxica, and Manchester electro producer and DJ Afrodeutsche – are all excellent, but Nihiloxica stand out. Part of experimental Kampala label Nyege Nyege Tapes, the group blends Bugandan drumming with a kit player, analogue synthesisers and multilayered vocalisations to twisted effect.When it goes quiet for Aphex Twin, the long concrete room floods with an intense light. The show has been custom built with collaborator Weirdcore – 306 motorised LED screens are staggered on stage and above heads, and move throughout the performance. Cameras film the crowd and images of dancers are digitally manipulated so that logos and manic depictions of Aphex Twin appear on their projected images. It’s a humour that wavers between caustic critique and outright silliness.Cheers ring out for skittering flashes of British celebrities, as reality TV stars such as Amber and Greg from Love Island are spliced into Technicolor flashes of the Queen, Pier Morgan and Boris Johnson – whose image gets a loud boo. The lasers are, bluntly, crazy, an impressive sensory assault. It’s unabashed fun, strangers craning their necks and grinning at each other.Musically, Aphex Twin is on top form, manoeuvring at breakneck speed through genre-melting sounds. Heaving polyrhythmic techno tracks fold into industrial electro pumpers, thundering piano loops and buzzsaw jungle breaks. There are flashes of the past – the Future Sounds of London’s Pulse State, the Octagon Man’s Free-er Than Free, and D-Shake’s Techno Trance (Paradise Is Now) capture that 90s UK hardcore euphoria – and nods to the future, with Egyptian producer Zuli’s Trigger Finger and HVL’s Sallow Myth. For Aphex Twin’s own music, there’s the hiss and funk of 2017’s T16.5 MADMA with nastya+5.2 and aquatic bleeps of 2015’s umil 25-01.Perhaps the sweetest moment comes in the latter movements of the set. After a caustic hardcore breakdown, a wash of ambience: Stone In Focus, from 1994’s Selected Ambient Works Vol II. As everyone takes a breath, a father and son nearby nod at each other knowingly. All told, a faultless performance from a peerless artist."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eef1ed43631aa9088f26fca4a138f6e4250d9319/0_297_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfbcb5eeb3a0b4474c91c81e0ee7cf6c","title":"bridget christie last night of the proms jamie barton laura mvula","story":"Laura Mvula was captivating, and I cried when opera star Jamie Barton took to the stage with a rainbow flag. Shame the conductor spent the entire night with his back to us‘That old lady with the white hair just said ‘Oh fuck off’ to that man playing the guitar” my seven-year-old whispered to me as we arrived at the Royal Albert Hall for the Last Night of the Proms. “Optimism isn’t enough to get us a deal” he sang. “Yes it is,” a union jack-waving man replied. At first, I thought it was all part of the show. A neat conceit I’d often seen used by devised theatre groups at the Edinburgh festival, where they’d start the show outside, interacting with the audience, planting ideas, making us think.“How clever of the Proms director to think of doing this,” I said to my son. “In a time of such political uncertainty, and social ision, they’ve really thought outside the box this year. This is about leaving our disagreements outside, I think, and coming together through a shared love of music. It’s about celebrating Britishness, and British music, and what it means to be British, and leaving politics out of it.”“It’s not as simple as that though is it?” my son replied, “Because when the Proms started 150 years ago, what being British meant wasn’t what being British means today. Britain’s in the midst of an existential crisis. What is British? What is music? Plus the conductor, Sakari Oramo, is Finnish and the guest vocalist is American. Can I have some crisps?”“Stop reading the programme,” I told him, “and look at the attention to detail on the actor’s guitar”, I said, “It must have taken him ages to stick all those ‘Bollocks to Brexit’ stickers on it.” But it wasn’t part of the show. The guitar-playing man was a real man from the anti-Brexit, pro-music campaign group Thank EU for the Music and the angry old lady and the union jack-waving man were just punters wanting to queue in peace.“Oooh!” I thought, “This is going to be a fruity night! My angle can be how even proper music can’t unite us. I’ve got an EU flag poking out of my bag. I hope an old Brexit lady doesn’t flush my head down the toilet in the interval. I’ve just washed my hair.”But unfortunately nothing else happened. Once inside the building, the Proms audience were the gentlest, jolliest, kindest, best-behaved crowd I’ve ever been in. Not a single phone went off in three hours, everyone was nice to one another, no one farted in my vicinity, and apart from the one man in the whole room not holding hands during Auld Lang Syne because he needed both of his hands to hold up his flag, manners were impeccable. The worst behaved person in the whole room was the conductor, who spent the entire night with his back to the audience and going off stage between songs for God knows what.I didn’t know anything about Last Night of the Proms before yesterday. My Irish working-class parents never watched it, I’m not a classical music fan and being surrounded by 5,500 white people waving union flags and bellowing “Rule Britannia!” is not my idea of fun. I thought I’d hate it, but I had one of the best nights of my life. I spent most of the first half either crying or stamping my feet. “Why are we stamping our feet to this one?” I said to the man next to me, “Because it’s upbeat!” he shouted merrily, “And also because why the hell not?!” Laura Mvula’s Sing to the Moon was so captivating you could hear a pin drop. I had to stifle my sobs for some unknown thing I was grieving for (a united Britain?) as the 5,500-strong room fell utterly and completely silent.I cried the entire time opera star Jamie Barton was on stage. I have never seen a performer unite a crowd so immediately and powerfully. I fell instantly and completely in love with her with every fibre of my being.Unable to stand for Rule Britannia, I was brought to my feet by the rainbow flag she waved during the final verse. What an extraordinary act. In a second I went from feeling ashamed to proud. But the standout moment for me was the sight of an enormous, straight banana balloon, wearing an EU cap, gently swaying from side to side during Henry Wood’s Fantasia on British Sea Songs, next to a solitary “For Britain” flag, also gently swaying. I said to my son, “How clever of the director to think of doing that. I think it’s about tolerance and the things that unite us …”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/513cf56bb469051222e92799fde6158c27f4a4dd/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=426c794c4244b6c1055502b3b2a4adb4","title":"its all gone how hurricane dorian devastated the bahamas podcast","story":"Oliver Laughland tells Rachel Humphrys about the destruction he witnessed in the Bahamas in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian.

They have been meeting with Michel Barnier’s team,” he said.“The prime minister will be seeing President Juncker tomorrow, I’ll be meeting with Michel Barnier tomorrow, so there’s extensive talks been happening both at a technical level but also at a political level. So there has been a huge amount of work going on behind the scenes. We can see a landing zone in terms of a future deal but there is significant work still to do.”Johnson is committed to getting rid of the backstop, the guarantee central to Theresa May’s rejected deal in which the UK would effectively stay within the EU’s customs union if no other solution for the Irish border could be reached before the end of a post-exit transition period.The British government’s version of Brexit involves the UK ultimately leaving the single market and customs union, requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland\u0026nbspand the Republic of Ireland. The “backstop” is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU.Theresa May\u0027s withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU’s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements.Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament.If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop.Another option would be a backstop just for Northern Ireland, but the government has rejected this. Barclay said while it was vital for the UK to “leave as a whole”, some ergence already existed between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.“We can get into those details as part of the talks. But that is different from the principle of the backstop, and the backstop needs to go,” he said.In a later interview on BBC Radio 5 Live’s Pienaar’s Politics, Barclay noted that in the event of a deal none of the issues connected to the Irish border would apply “until the end of the implementation period, which is December 2020 or one or two years later by mutual agreement”.Asked about a possible extension, Barclay said he was only stating “what the legal text says” and that “the point is, there is scope for an extension but it is by mutual consent”.Patel was more cautious, saying she did not want to pre-empt the talks, but accepted the Irish border issue had moved on from the backstop in terms of discussions with the EU.“The reality is we have to deal with the backstop issue, and people said, under the Theresa May deal, that the withdrawal agreement would never be considered or looked at again, and neither would the political declaration,” she said.“We are in different territory right now, so it’s no point arguing about the past. We are moving forward now as a government, collectively, focused on leaving but leaving with a deal.”She added: “We have to leave and we have to leave with a deal on 31 October, and there’s no point right now trying to prejudge the discussions that are taking place.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fee7065962c7d058bb38ff3610d3034885e04978/0_129_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92a0df8685c9016c35fb40011bfac3ed","title":"five highlights from the liberal democrat conference","story":"A controversial Brexit motion passed in Bournemouth, and Jo Swinson shared her thoughts on David CameronNo, I don’t forgive David Cameron for calling the referendum.

A motion on Europe contained a policy committing the party to unilaterally revoke Brexit, without a referendum, if it won a majority in the next general election.This caused a fairly robust debate in the hall, with some delegates, among them the party veteran and former MP Simon Hughes, arguing it risked pushing the Lib Dems towards a core remain appeal, which might go down well in some cities but would not win new votes elsewhere.But proponents said it would distinguish the party’s Brexit policy from Labour and would only happen with the democratic endorsement of an election win. The unspoken subtext was that not even die-hard Lib Dems believe they will win a Commons majority, so it is primarily an election ruse. The motion thus passed overwhelmingly.Former leader Vince Cable cheered the faithful with a rousing speech that covered everything from being mistaken for a TV weatherman by a hen party while on a trip to Gibraltar, to comparing Boris Johnson to the briefly reigning 1st-century Roman emperor Galba – with a punchline delivered in Latin.New recruit Sam Gyimah defended his role as a Conservative minister in blocking a backbench bill to retrospectively wipe the criminal records of gay men convicted over now-repealed laws, which has prompted some criticism.The main speeches to come on Monday are from another new recruit, Chuka Umunna, and from Ed Davey, the party’s deputy leader and Treasury spokesman, who lost out to Swinson in the leadership election.

No one was deprived of their British citizenship between 1973 and 2002 but its use escalated from four cases in 2014 and five in 2015 to 14 in 2016 and 104 in 2017.High-profile iniduals who have been deprived of their citizenship include Begum, a British-born woman who left the UK in February 2015, aged 15, to join Isis, El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey, alleged members of the so-called Beatles cell within Isis, a group of British jihadists responsible for the execution of hostages, and the Muslim convert Jack Letts, who is suspected of leaving Britain to join the terror group.Christine Jardine, the home affairs spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, will call for an overhaul of the powers to introduce a requirement by the home secretary to apply to a court to revoke citizenship.A shake-up of the policy would stop the power being used on anyone who was a British citizen at birth, such as Begum, and a requirement that the best interests of any child affected must be taken into account. Begum reportedly had three children after she fled to Syria, all of whom died.Jardine, who will move the motion at the party’s conference in Bournemouth, said: “The decision to strip someone of their citizenship is a very serious one and should only be taken when absolutely necessary. Instead, we have seen Conservative home secretaries abuse this power for political gain with tragic results.“These are people brought up, often born here, with families and loved ones who deserve a government that will take responsibility when they are radicalised and go abroad to join terrorists. They should be prosecuted in the UK for their crimes and interrogated to learn exactly how this happens and prevent terrorists from recruiting more young Brits.“Liberal Democrats demand better. We will introduce new safeguards so that home secretaries must show good reasons for revoking someone’s citizenship. We will also ensure that the best interests of any children involved are taken into account, and that no one is left stateless.”The decision by the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, to strip Begum of her citizenship was met with broad criticism due to her age and apparent vulnerability.A Church of England bishop and a former director of public prosecutions led the chorus of outrage directed at Javid as demand grew for him to review his controversial decision to strip the 19-year-old of British citizenship. The move is being challenged by Begum’s family in the courts.The parents of Letts, who was a dual Canadian national, called Javid’s decision to strip their son of his British citizenship “cowardly”. The couple were convicted in June this year of funding terrorism after sending their son £223.The Lib Dem motion also calls on the UK to ratify the 1997 European convention on nationality, which prevents states from making people stateless unless their citizenship was obtained through fraud.The Lib Dem motion calls for the power to be restricted to to naturalised citizens only in cases of fraud or when the iniduals or when the inidual “has done something seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the United Kingdom, and deprivation of citizenship is a proportionate response to such conduct and necessary for the national security of the United Kingdom”.The party also wants the government to publish annual reports on its use of this power, and the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation to review its use at least once every three years.A Home Office spokesperson said: “Decisions on depriving a dual national of citizenship are based on substantial advice from officials, lawyers and the intelligence agencies and all available information.

They took the glass out and had snipers up there when the president and his wife went in to see Tony and Cherie,” said the 60-year-old builder as he ate sausage and mash in his garden on Thursday.Elliott, whose late father was on the local Labour party executive during the Blair era, saw Nigel Farage on Wednesday’s news telling a marquee full of Brexiters at Sedgefield racecourse that he was declaring an “all-out political war” on the Labour party. It was a threat greeted with cheers by several hundred local Brexiters, many former Labour voters, who had all paid £5 for this audience with the Brexit party leader.The Labour party cannot rely on the north-east any more, conceded Elliott. Even he did not think he could bring himself to vote Labour when the general election rolls around, and will probably abstain. “To be honest, it’s Jeremy Corbyn,” he said. “He’s not the right leader … There are lots of Labour supporters I know who won’t vote Labour because of Jeremy Corbyn.”Farage was rebuffed by the Conservatives this week when he suggested an electoral pact to beat Labour which would see the Tories stand down in seats where – to quote Farage’s press officer, Gawain Towler – “no one has ever kissed a Tory but they kissed us in the Euro elections and voted heavily leave”.Labour ought to have breathed a sigh of relief when a senior Tory said Farage would not be allowed “anywhere near government” because he was not a “fit and proper person”.More than a quarter of the centre’s clients need help because of benefit delays, particularly universal credit – a Tory invention which has resulted in new claimants waiting up to six weeks for payments. And yet it is Labour many seem to blame. “I don’t think Labour is as strong as it used to be,” said 81-year-old Joyce Raine. So much of the industry has gone, she said, conceding that “Thatcher started it but Labour doesn’t seem to have done much to stop it”.Back on Front Street in Trimdon Colliery, 21-year-old Kieron Naylor was getting ready for his shift at Hitachi Rail Europe, a Japanese-owned firm that builds 35 trains a month for the EU market from the north-east’s biggest manufacturing park in Newton Aycliffe.Naylor voted leave, ignoring warnings that exiting the EU could cause problems for Hitachi’s European exports. “I would just rather we were back on our own,” he said. “It’s a risk … but it should make it easier to have closer relations with Japan.” In a general election he would vote Conservative, he said. “People have lost their faith in Labour. I would definitely not vote for them now, not since Jeremy Corbyn. I just don’t trust him. I would probably vote for the Tories. I think the only people around here now who are against them are the miners, the die-hard Labour people.”His view contrasts with research from the University of Bristol this week, which concluded there are “very high levels of antipathy” towards the Conservatives among voters who backed Labour in 2017, no matter how they feel about Brexit.The tribal Labour vote has not totally died out in Sedgefield. In the Trimdon Colliery and Deaf Hill workmen’s club, Denise Hutchinson, 47, whose claim to fame is that she once beat Tony Blair at darts, said she would be sticking with Labour: “I’ve always voted Labour. My grandad worked down the pit. I’m not really into politics but I will carry on with Labour.”In his driveway just around the corner, a former miner, James Skelton, 88, and his wife, Anne, 82, said they would opt for the Brexit party this time. “I don’t class myself as English any more. I’m being made into a European. I have always voted but we are losing our identity,” he said. “I believe Europe is destroying us. I would prefer to be a satellite of America than Europe.”When Blair stood down in 2007, he gathered the world’s media to Trimdon’s Labour club for his resignation speech. The club closed in 2010 and is now a carpet shop.Inside, Paula Brown said she may vote for the Brexit party, despite voting remain in 2016. “I’ve no faith in any of them. I would never in a million years vote for Jeremy Corbyn. I would rather vote Tory, even Lib Dem.” Corbyn, she said, was “IRA”, and frightened her: “I would rather have Piers Morgan as prime minister. I know it seems mad, but he’s consistent and isn’t afraid to say what he thinks. Nigel Farage cuts through in the same way.’”She sent a colleague down to the basement to find some of the Labour “bumpf” the party left behind: a biography of Blair’s local fixer, John Burton, and flyers put out in 2010 by Phil Wilson, Blair’s successor as Sedgefield’s MP.Wilson knows he has not done himself any favours locally by being vocally in favour of remaining in the EU and having a second referendum. He finds himself caught in a perfect storm, faced with constituents who hate his party leader andor want to leave the EU soonest, with or without a deal. One of those factors is problematic two pose him an existential threat.But he says he is not too worried about losing his seat. “I’m more worried that we have a no-deal Brexit or that we have a Brexit of some description without the people having a chance to confirm they want to go along with that deal,” he said.“Otherwise in a few months or a year’s time, when the jobs are starting to go and there is problems at the border, they have an absolute right to turn around and say: ‘Hang on a minute, we didn’t vote for this.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3c9a27895ec0fd8bcdc7944f747482d650269e1/0_0_4957_2975/master/4957.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf6d97f74b464926d74d46412da48c9b","title":"rugby world cup japan","story":"The committee and World Rugby say it will be a will be a “once in a lifetime” experience for all concerned and are certainly confident everything is on track, despite a few logistical issues at the recent Test matches in Kamaishi and Osaka, mainly involving the queues for food and beer. “As Japan prepares to welcome the world, Rugby World Cup fever is well and truly sweeping the nation,” World Rugby Chairman, Bill Beaumont, said following Japan’s recent wins over Fiji, Tonga and the United States in the Pacific Nations Cup.But while there has been plenty of visibility on social media of the teams arriving and taking part in welcome ceremonies this weekend there are still some concerns about how much of an impact the tournament will have. For some, with less than a week remaining until the showpiece begins in Japan, much still needs to be done for the first tournament to be held in Asia to have a long-lasting effect.The journey to the start of the tournament has been tumultuous and one that at times has been overshadowed by next year’s Olympics in Tokyo. Weeks before kick-off, even in Tokyo, it seemed that there were still many who did not fully comprehend what is about to hit Japan. “Really disappointed – I’m teaching in a junior high school in central Tokyo,” one school teacher said. “Literally two or three students out of 200 had the slightest interest or knowledge about rugby or the World Cup.“No posters, nothing. There should be publicity and visits to elementary and high schools. The Olympics has been mentioned every day for ages and will not be until next year. The momentum after 2015 has just vanished. It baffles and infuriates me.”To be fair, many of those students are probably already at school when Japan rugby legend Daisuke Ohata appears every day on morning TV in a segment promoting the tournament. And Ohata is only one of many former internationals who are doing their bit to promote the World Cup. The former Japan captain, Toshiaki Hirose, has been touring Japan teaching fans the national anthems of the 20 teams taking part, to ensure all visitors – be they players, fans or media – feel the Japanese sense of “Omotenashi” or welcome, while Hiroyuki Tanuma, who played for Japan in the 1999 and 2003 tournaments, led a group of players from Yamanashi Gakuin University to the summit of Mount Fuji in August wearing the shirts of the teams taking part in the tournament.Of course, the tournament organisers would point to the statistics to prove everything is fine with 1.6m of the 1.8m tickets sold and a record 38,000 applying for the initial 10,000 places on the volunteer programme for the tournament, forcing an extra 3,000 to be taken on to what has been dubbed “Team No-Side.”The economic benefit to Japan is also without question, with recent estimates saying the economy will benefit by around ¥216.6bn (£1.5bn).But still questions have been raised, particularly away from the 12 host cities. Cities and municipalities hosting the more than 50 training venues have criticised the rules that prohibit them publicising practice locations and schedules for security reasons. The massive crowds that have witnessed teams such as South Africa and Australia at their pre-tournament camps would seem to suggest that a compromise has been reached.Wales, meanwhile, have been running an engagement programme in Kitakyushu, the host for their pre-tournament camp, for a year with refereeing and coaching courses that have extended to other cities. Pictures of the team have been appearing on local buses while there are even Welsh flags on mail vans and fire engines.“The welcome the teams have received so far across the country has been phenomenal. They are telling us that they have never seen anything like it. From the host cities, volunteers and public, everyone is keen and showing their full support, which is fantastic,” said Beaumont.It was a marked change from five months ago, when Yoshiro Mori resigned as Honorary President of the Japan Rugby Football Union, forcing the board to follow suit to take responsibility for what the former prime minister of Japan said was the lack of progress made in promoting the tournament and developing legacy programmes.For most, the feeling here is the tournament itself will be a huge success. “The Webb Ellis Cup is here in Japan. Our host cities are ready. Our stadiums are in immaculate condition and our 20 teams are itching to take the field,” said Japan Rugby World Cup 2019 Organising Committee CEO Akira Shimazu.“I speak on behalf of all Japan, a 127 million-strong welcoming committee, when I say that we are ready to welcome the world to Japan, and ready to host a truly memorable and once in a lifetime Rugby World Cup.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfccd8e9caa7edef92f993b14180459f091116f0/0_133_2860_1716/master/2860.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=200ac56f06661fce0be61c2bedbaa211","title":"ashes 2019 england v australia fifth test day four live","story":"The Oval is still full as the players line up for the presentation ceremony. The chairmen of Cricket Australia and the ECB are handshaking on the dais Tom Harrison and Trevor Bayliss watch from behind the glass high up in the dressing room.Player of the match: Jofra Archer, just a little something to top an unbelievable summer - the World Cup the super over his battle with Steve Smith, the six wickets in the first innings, his eight over stint against Matthew Wade this afternoon. England’s player of the series: Ben Stokes Australia’s player of the series: Steve SmithCompton-Miller medal: For his 774 runs across four matches and 12 catches, Steve Smith. And, at last, I can’t hear a single boo.Smith: “It’s been an amazing couple of months, the cricket has been spectacular, I’ve loved every minute and I’m very proud to bring the urn home “I saw Jofra last year in the IPL and I saw straight away he was a raw talent. He’s got a great set of skills and an incredibly bright futures.”“You always want to get better as a player, nothing is ever too much, I’ll keep working hard for as long as I can.”Take that as a warning!Here’s our snap report of the day:Warney sends out one last last pointed barb: “Tim Paine handed them this Test match on a platter.”Nasser: “I’ve got to applaud the players, people talk about England’s World Cup but Australia had to play a World Cup too. The players have had to dig deep and everyone today, that battle between Archer and Wade summed up the series for me, this is still Australia and England. You have to applaud the players for putting in the shift and in such a congested summer. Gower and Botham raise a glass - a chardonnay - in the commentary box . I raise one to you too OBO-ers. In the dressing room, Justin Langer and Tim Paine stare blankly into the distance, Steve Waugh stands to the side. Go and give them a hug Steve. Here’s a quick reminder of the story of an enthralling seriesEdgbaston :Australia won by 251 runs Headingly: England won by one wicketOld Trafford: Australia won by 185 runsThe Oval: England won by 135 runsWhat a finale! The urn is Australia’s, and deservedly, with Smith a Colossus striding above all others, but this match belongs to England. Australia still haven’t won an Ashes series in England since before Sam Curran was at school (2001.)Four wickets for Leach, four for Broad, two for Root and menaces money for Jofra Archer. Fittingly Ian Botham and David Gower are on to commentate for their own last hurrahs. That winning combination again! A ing catch by Root at short midwicket as Hazlewood tries to chip him away. And Jack Leach will be on a hat-trick next time he picks up the ball.Lyon sucker-punched into a sweep low and straight into Joe Root’s hands at square leg, seconds after he moved himself there. And that is nearly that. 76th over: Australia 260-8 (Lyon 0, Siddle 11) A wicket maiden for Root, who has provided the golden bullet in his own armoury. That was quite something by Wade - a counter-attacking, brave, nimble-footed century - whose Ashes has been book-ended by hundreds. The battle with Archer was one for the memory-vault. Wade strides down the pitch, pushes forward and the ball spins past his bat into the gloves of Bairstow, who makes no mistake. The end of cracking innings, and with it, Australia’s chances of that miracle win.75th over: Australia 260-7 (Wade 117, Siddle 11) You can feel the chill start to descend over The Oval, though the players are still in shirt sleeves. A testing over by Leach, who replaces Broad.74th over: Australia 258-7 (Wade 116, Siddle 10) Root again, four from the over, tick goes the clock, down comes the target. England still hot favourites, but there would be some balance to the universe if Australia did a Headingley...73rd over: Australia 254-7 (Wade 113, Siddle 9) Siddle edges Broad through the empty second slip spot down into the stretching shade for four. Then, take that, a quite charming off drive for another boundary. Australian need another 145“Hi Tanya”, writes Geoff Wignall. “I believe I can top your demanding money with menaces group: I’d send Brian Close, or even his ghost.”While Nuggehalli Nigam has spotted a flaw. “I foresee one problem with your crack team: Miandad and Lillee might end up menacing each other.”72nd over: Australia 244-7 (Wade 113, Siddle 1) Wade starts to open his shoulders. England think they have him caught at slip by Stokes... and so does the umpires but the replay shows the ball just spinning out of the dust. Root is fizzing the ball here!71st over: Australia 244-7 (Wade 111, Siddle 0) Wade, the gimlet eyed cowboy, chews slowly on his hide, pulling Broad for four but he can’t do a thing about Cummins’ loose waft. Fifty minutes left of the day, three wickets to fall and level the series. Cummins drives away from his feet and audibly edges through to Bairstow who takes the ball down by his feet70th over: Australia 239-6 (Wade 107, Cummins 9) Calamity! Two missed chances off Wade in one Root over. First, Bairstow misses a tricky stumping that bounces more than he’d expected and he fumbles, missing vital seconds, then Stokes can’t hold onto a ball at slip that flies high and into his hand but too hard, and he can’t grab the rebound.69th over: Australia 232-6 (Wade 100, Cummins 9) Wade must have been in the 90s for half an hour now.. England ask to change the ball, the umpire pushes it through his equivalent of a set-square with no problem and tosses it back to Broad, who is in again. And there it is, Wade turns the ball round behind him and scampers a single, punching the air, removing his helmet and raising his bat to the dressing room. That’s a cracking hundred!!!68th over: Australia 226-6 (Wade 99, Cummins 4) The cameras pan to the Australian balcony where Wade’s teammates are watching... Cummins sees out five balls, then Root produces a finger-kissing beauty which just misses the edge of Wade’s bat as he leans back.67th over: Australia 225-6 (Wade 99, Cummins 3) Broad again, Wade tips a single to mid-on and scampers through for a quick single ...99...In the unlikely situation that I had to create a crack team to go and menace someone for money I would consider Matthew Wade a good addition to a team consisting of Colin Croft, Ben Stokes, Dennis Lillee, Javed Miandad, Viv Richards, David Warner and Peter Willey.57th over: Australia 201-6 (Wade 79, Cummins 0) Archer v Wade, the Hobart Hurricanes teammates return to the battlefront. Root moves Ben Stokes into a first-slip position, but 50? metres back on the boundary rope. On the forearms of the crowd, goose-pimples start to form. ARcher charges in, a couple of snorting bouncers, a couple of full length 90mph plus toe-crushers. Wade escapes with a single, then Cummins, on a king pair is greeted with a lifter that hits him on the arm guard. 65th over: Australia 222-6 (Wade 97, Cummins 2) And Wade takes a long, smooth, sigh of relief (internally, naturally) . Archer pulls on his sunhat and stays on the boundary, Broad pulls on his mantle. He’s had a wonderful summer in the James Anderson slot. Reliable, clever, on top of his craft. Especially impressive after he spent last winter on the sidelines. Having said that, Wade is prepared to let Cummins face the last three balls of the over. And that, I think, is drinks. 64th over: Australia 221-6 (Wade 96, Cummins 2) And Cummins does his job again, playing out a Leach maiden. Michael Robinson deserves a mention: This an extremely late reply to a comment you made about the melodious score of 123-4. Surely more melodious reading would be 123 for 5? Similar to the old Eric Morecambe East Fife 4, Forfar 5 joke.63rd over: Australia 221-6 (Wade 96, Cummins 2) Archer again - surely his last one, the eighth of this spell. He loses a tiny bit of control with this one. Wade outside edges the first ball tantalisingly close to gully for four. The second he bottom-edges to slip and Archer applauds. No bouquet though. Then a bouncer a wayward knuckle ball and another four through mid-on. Honours to Wade that over. 62nd over: Australia 213-6 (Wade 88, Cummins 2) Cummins sees off Leach’s over, even getting off his pair with an inside edge off his pad for two. 61st over: Australia 211-6 (Wade 88, Cummins 0) This spell of Archer v Wade is feet-tappingly hypnotic. Archer persuades Root he can manage one more over Wade strokes his beard like a Frenchman contemplating a later-afternoon espresso. Archer’s up at 88-90-91-95mph. Vicious bowling, hitting Wade square on the upper arm. Wade is unmoved, hitting him for two fours, one delectable cover drive. 60th over: Australia 202-6 (Wade 80, Cummins 0) Cummins watches Leach carefully and defends, defends, defends, another maiden.... and so the overs tick by “So we’re all set now for Wade to do a Ben Stokes and find the last 175 runs with the tail! Could Siddle be the new Leach? Does he wear specs? writes Peter HigginsonI’m so nervous I’ve nearly eaten a whole box of Smoky Bacon Pringles since tea.Smoky Bacon? Ugh!!!! What were you thinking?At least they weren’t, I almost can’t bear to write it, Frazzles.59th over: Australia 202-6 (Wade 80, Cummins 0) Wade copes relatively easily with four of Archer’s deliveries, until he sends in a rapid yorker that muddles his feet in a powder puff of dust but Wade somehow digs it out. A maiden. And perhaps the end of this spell?Jeremy Pattison has also been squished at The Oval. Patrick Duce is right. It can take 20 mins to get from the Vauxhall end to the Pavilion at lunch as punters squeeze past each other at the pinch points behind the Peter May and the old Surridge stands. It would be better if it was made one-way and we were made to go clockwise.56th over: Australia 200-6 (Wade 78, Cummins 0) A wicket maiden for Leach! The door is open now. And, fittingly, Paine’s final DRS call is a wrong’un. The ball pitches in line, and hits him two-thirds of the way up his back pad. The umpire takes forever to give Paine out lbw.... Paine reviews...54th over: Australia 200-5 (Wade 78, Paine 21) And the number of runs needed drops below 200. Just saying. Wade pulls Archer with a stylish half-pirouette and that’s the fifty partnership off 66 balls. Archer is riled . Three short balls follow, two of them over 90mph as the crowd noise swells behind him, loud and drunk. Archer at the end of the over gives Wade a cold, lingering, stare. 54th over: Australia 196-5 (Wade 74, Paine 21) Leach does get through his overs quickly. Um - just trust me on this one, not much happened.

Commiserations to the USA team, who played a major part in a thrilling contest. And thanks to you for reading this live blog. I wasn’t sure anything in golf this year would top the final day of the Women’s British Open at Woburn, but I think this might have just managed it. What an afternoon! We won’t be forgetting it in a hurry.Juli Inkster’s gracious verdict. “It was great, great for women’s golf. Look at these crowds, it was fabulous. The European crowds have been great to us all week. We’ve had some Scottish weather, some wind, some sunshine, we got the full effect! I’m proud of my team. Everyone got some sort of point. I’m looking forward to 2021 ... watching! Watching! Thanks for having us.”Team Europe, who have won the greatest Solheim Cup in the most amazing circumstances, take to the first tee for the trophy presentation. First up, there’s a warm reception for the Americans, who will be hurting badly, but did so much to contribute to a fantastic week’s golf at Gleneagles. Their captain Juli Inkster allows herself a wry smile. There’s a cheeky glint in her eye as the camera catches her enjoying something cold from a beaker. She deserves a wee dram her team were brilliant in their own way. But somebody had to lose, and so it’s time to hand over that bonny crystal vase to Europe ...Let’s have a look at that scoreboard then, now it’s all done and dusted. And while Europe deservedly celebrate, you have to feel sorry for the Korda sisters, who both launched sensational comebacks to secure points for the USA ... only to see the hosts pull off a late, late counter-attack of their own!The 18th-green hero Suzann Pettersen talks! “It’s all just a big blur. It was a good putt. I was trying to make some kind of birdie. It’s tough mentally. In your wildest dream, I never thought I’d do this again. But you’ve got to grab the moment and trust that you are good enough. This is just a fantastic win for the team. I didn’t feel much pressure, I knew my teammates wanted me on the team, what you guys say is irrelevant!”The winning captain Catriona Matthew speaks! “Just unbelievable! There’s never been a better moment! For it to come down to the last game ... the Americans played great as well, but for Suzann to get the winning putt is phenomenal. Half-an-hour ago it looked like a draw would be a good result, but those last three games were crucial. Just fantastic. I had faith in Pettersen all the time! This is the best moment, nothing tops this. There’s gonna be a party!”The 18th green is taken over by hundreds of well-wishers. Plenty of cavorting going on at the moment. There’ll be a few nippy sweeties downed this evening! That is a quite sensational victory. It really did seem all over for Europe, when Megan Khang wrested a half off Charley Hull and Lizette Salas put Anne van Dam to the sword. The USA were just half a point off retaining their trophy, one point away from overall victory. But right at that moment, Bronte Law and Suzann Pettersen salvaged halves at holes they looked destined to lose. Suddenly, it was possible. And what moxie Law and Pettersen displayed to win their matches and close it out! What a smash-and-grab! What a story! What beautiful, gorgeous nonsense! Pettersen knocks it in! It’s there! It was never missing! A gentle left-to-right slider that was always dropping! Pettersen’s team-mates flood the green with blue, and Gleneagles erupts in celebration! How on earth did Europe salvage that! What a comeback, right at the death! And it’s the captain’s pick Suzann Pettersen with the winning putt. The last putt, in the last match, on the last green! The greatest Solheim Cup win ever? Pretty much, yes!This drama really did explode out of nowhere. Europe looked to be sputtering to quiet defeat, but Pettersen and Law refused to go gentle into the night. On 17, Law lags up to secure her par. Up on 18, Alex’s putt slides by on the right. It’s all down to Pettersen, then ... especially as McDonald can’t get up and down from sand at 17. It really is all down to Pettersen! She steps up ... and ...Pettersen has just played one of the shots of the week! She lands her third 20 feet past the flag, and spins it back to six feet! That’s put so much pressure on Alex. But she sends one over the flag. It’s a fine shot, landing softly 12 feet past. Wow. This really is quite the shootout! Alex will be putting first. And if she makes her birdie, this is all over. If not, Pettersen will have a putt that would effectively win the Solheim Cup!Alex plays the percentages and lays up. Pettersen meanwhile has a good lie in the rough, 220 yards from the pin. But she decides against going for it. Instead she wedges onto the fairway alongside Alex. It’ll set up a shootout. It’s one Pettersen simply has to win. Meanwhile back on 17, Law finds the centre of the green, while McDonald hoicks her tee shot into the bunker at the back. It really is all down to Pettersen now. This approach could win or lose the Solheim Cup for Europe!It had been coming for a very, very, very long time: Anna Nordqvist finishes off Morgan Pressel, 4\u0026amp3. And on 16, Bronte Law guides a 20-foot right-to-left slider in for birdie, and the dream is not quite over for Europe! If Law can hang on ... and if Pettersen can find something up 18 ... if, if, if. We’ll soon find out!Alex splits the 18th fairway. So much pressure now on Pettersen, who has to win this hole if Europe are to retain a chance of victory. But she sends a slice into the thick stuff on the right. Nothing’s lost yet on the par-five, but the USA are in the box seat here.Pettersen and Alex both find 17. Both are faced with long birdie putts. Both nearly make them. Had Alex’s dropped, the US would have retained the cup. But Europe survive. Pettersen and Alex will go up the last, with everything on the line!Pettersen salvages a half on 16 with a lovely lagged putt from off the front of the green. And somehow on 15, McDonald lets Law off with her bunker slip, Europe escaping with a half there as well. Those could prove to be two crucial moments. Huge moments. Because if Pettersen and Law somehow scrap to victory in their matches, Europe can still pip the USA! Some big holes coming up right here, right now!Salas, who made the winning putt two years ago, rolls an almost perfect right-to-left curler to a couple of inches. It’s a par. That leaves Van Dam with a putt to halve the match. She gives it far too much on the high side, and the ball races off to the right. Salas secures her point, and the USA are so close now! She celebrates with her pals, while poor Van Dam dissolves in tears.What a shot by Marina Alex! She whips her third at 16 to kick-in distance. The pressure’s lumped on Suzann Pettersen. Back on 15, Bronte Law takes a couple of shots to get out of a greenside bunker. And up on 18, Salas knocks her third to 20 feet. Van Dam leaves herself an eight-foot birdie putt. It’s one she’ll need to make, because Europe’s hopes are receding with great speed now.Back down the hole, Salas has driven into deep nonsense and can only take her medicine and hack out. Not the end of the world on this par-five, especially as she’s a hole ahead. But the door is slightly ajar for Van Dam, and she blooters a lovely fairway wood up towards the green. She’s just off the front in two.It doesn’t look like it’s going to happen for them, though. On 18, Hull and Khang send their second shots into the swale to the front left of the large undulating green. Hull mishits her chip up, and remains down the bank. Khang however knocks hers to five feet, a quite wonderful shot. It’s real carpe-diem stuff, and it forces Hull to race a wild putt up onto the green and down the swale on the other side. She isn’t able to make the hail-mary par putt, and so the hole’s lost and the match is halved. What a chip by Khang. It could be the shot that does for Europe!Van Dam can’t make her long par saver. She’ll go up the last one down to Salas. Better news for Europe as Bronte Law levels up her match with Ally McDonald on 14. As things stand, the US will retain their trophy after a draw. Europe need something, and fast.Van Dam manages to get her ball out of the trap, but can only thin it through the other side of the green. She’ll have a long putt to scramble an unlikely par. But with Salas 12 feet or so away, this very much looks like the USA’s hole. And back on 16, it’s the USA’s match, as Jessica Korda gets up and down from sand for birdie, while Caroline Masson’s effort for birdie lips out.Van Dam pulls her tee shot at 17, and her ball’s plugged in the bank of a bunker. Right up against the lip. And she’s got no stance. She’ll do well to get that out, never mind close. The door’s open for Salas, who deserves a little good fortune on these shores after her final-green heartbreak in the British Open at Woburn. She creams a delicious tee shot straight at the flag, and it’s very much advantage America there.Neither Hull nor Khang make their birdie putts. Khang refuses to concede Hull’s ten-inch par putt, which is poor form, even under these circumstances. Hull tidies up and they’ll go down the last. Meanwhile Anne van Dam levels her match against Lizette Salas with birdie at 16, but it’s one step forward, another back for Europe, as Marina Alex levels things up against Suzann Pettersen, the momentum in that match very much with the American now.Hull ratchets up the pressure by firing a lovely iron straight at the 17th flag. But Khang isn’t giving up yet, and responds with an equally delightful tee shot. Both will take a look at birdie from 12 feet or so. What moxie under the circumstances!Angel Yin sends a lovely draw into 17. It’s pin high, 15 feet from the flag. A certain par ... and Azahara Munoz can’t make the birdie she requires to extend the match. Munoz battled well to get back into contention, but too much damage was done early doors. Elsewhere, Jessica Korda moves two up on Caroline Masson, but it’s a fine birdie for Charley Hull at 16, the reward for finding the back fringe of the par five in two, and she takes the lead over Megan Khang at a crucial juncture!Suzanne Pettersen nearly chips in from the back of 13. But not quite. She needed it, too, for the half. She’s just one hole up on Marina Alex now. Better news for Europe in the final match, where Anna Nordqvist takes another hole off the hapless Morgan Pressel.It had been a long time coming. Brittany Altomare completes a 5\u0026amp4 rout over Jodi Ewart Shadoff by rolling in a 15-footer on 14. She’s missed nothing with the flat stick today.Boutier beats Park 2\u0026amp1! It was a stunning finish to the match, as the French star nearly chipped in from tight rough on 17, Park then an inch away from holing out from the sand! Both players so unlucky not to end on a high, though Boutier will care not a jot. Meanwhile back on 16, the pendulum swings the other way, as Munoz sees her 30-foot birdie effort lip out, then watches Yin tidy up for birdie from six feet. Another hole for Anna Nordqvist, this time at 10. Meanwhile Celine Boutier has birdied 16 to go dormie two in her match. Neither her nor Annie Park have found the 17th green with their tee shot. Meanwhile Caroline Masson has pulled one back at 14.As if in celebration of her sister’s victory, Jessica Korda trundles an 80-foot putt into the cup at 13! It steals the hole off Caroline Masson, who was looking at a 15-footer to win it herself. Spooked, Masson misses the putt, and she’s two down. But better news for Europe on 17, where Thompson shoves her tee shot into sand, fails to get up and down, and shakes hands with Georgia Hall, who has now delivered four points out of four this week!Nelly Korda closes out the second match with birdie up 18. It’s too much for Hedwall, who can’t bump in a chip from the swale to the side of the hole. A concession, and the US have their first point of the singles!Thompson, from the back of a swale behind the 16th green, hits a hot putt 12 feet past the hole. She can’t make the one coming back, and that’s just a par on the par-five. Hall has a chance to wrap up the match, but can’t do so, her birdie effort from similar distance dribbling past the left lip. She’s dormie two. Meanwhile on 11, Suzann Pettersen rattles in a monster to move two up on Alex.Kang gives it a good old rattle. She’s not going to die wondering. But it drifts by on the right, ending a couple of feet past. She rather generously picks up Ciganda’s marker - she could legitimately have seen the first putt, just in case her opponent froze - conceding the hole and the match. That’s the first point on the board this afternoon ... and it’s Europe’s! Ciganda plays one of the shots of the week! She bumps her chip out of the filth hard, into the upslope of the swale. The slope takes the sting out of the ball, which trundles up onto the green and stops pin high, 20 feet or so from the flag. From where she was, that was quite outstanding! Kang swishes her second sand shot up and out, over a huge lip, and to ten feet. That was pretty special as well, a long relaxed swing that landed her ball delicately on the green. But she’ll need to make this par putt.This is coming to a boil now! Megan Khang misses from eight feet on 13, and she’s all square with Charley Hull. Angel Yin shoves a three footer wide right at 14, and her lead over Azahara Munoz, once four holes, is back down to just one. And drama on 18, as Kang flubs her sand shot, weakly sending it into another trap closer to the green. Advantage Ciganda? Well, maybe, but she’s in tangled nonsense up the bank, with a swale between her ball and the green ... and little dancefloor to play with. A big moment here.Georgia Hall gets up and down from a tight spot to the side of 15. And when Lexi Thompson misses a short par putt, it’s enough for the hole! She moves two clear at a crucial stage. On 17, Caroline Hedwall should level things up in the second match, after swishing a gorgeous tee shot pin high to ten feet, but she misreads the straightest putt at Gleneagles, giving it too much on the right, and Nelly Korda escapes with a par. And trouble for both players currently going up 18: after fine drives, Kang finds a greenside bunker with her second, while Ciganda flays her approach miles to the right. Tricky up and downs for both.Having reduced a four-hole deficit to one, Azahara Munoz undoes some of her good work with a tatty bogey at 13. She’s two down to Angel Yin again. On 16, Caroline Hedwall teases a 30-foot birdie slider across the green and into the cup. You can hear the roar in Aviemore. She’s just one down now, with two still to play. Meanwhile up on 17, Kang splashes out magnificently to ten feet, the best she could do having shortsided herself. And in goes the par saver! She’s scrambled a half, because Ciganda’s birdie putt never looks like dropping. Anna Nordqvist looks in control of the final match right now, by the way. She’s moved three up after seven holes. Which way is this going to go? You wouldn’t bet the farm, would you.Suddenly it all begins to go a bit wrong for Danielle Kang. Carlota Ciganda applies the pressure at the par-three 17th by firing her tee shot straight at the flag, ten feet short. Kang pulls hers into sand on the left. Back on 8, Ally McDonald creams a stunning second to three feet, and tidies up for a birdie that levels her match with Bronte Law.Two putts for Ciganda on 16, and it’s enough for a birdie that wins the hole and ties up the opening match. That one’s sure to go down 18 now. Meanwhile birdie for Altomare on 10, as Ewart Shadoff begins to lose control. But Annie Park’s short par putt on 13 horseshoes out, gifting the lead to the relentless Celine Boutier, while Jessica Korda’s short missed effort on 10 allows Caroline Masson to tie up that match. This is back in Europe’s hands now, but expect plenty of to and fro. The drama’s only just starting!Jodi Ewart Shadoff yips a tiddler on 9 to turn three down against Brittany Altomare. She bends over double in extreme anguish. That could be costly. Caroline Hedwall misses a short one on 15, too, and the Swede has really let this one get away. Having been three up at the turn, she’s now two down. If nothing else, it proves to Ewart Shadoff that all is not yet lost. Although Azahara Munoz’s antics should already be providing succour: she wins another hole, this time 12, to reduce her once-huge deficit against Angel Yin to one hole.Bronte Law isn’t taking this situation lying down. In goes a birdie putt on 7, and she nearly launches herself towards Pitlochry with the force of her celebration. And Carlota Ciganda isn’t done yet either. She smashes two huge shots down the par-five 16th to reach the green and set up a long eagle putt. However Kang puts a little pressure on by knocking her third - having laid up in front of the creek - to six feet. Let’s see how this pans out, then. A couple of big putts coming up, sure to shape the afternoon narrative.Munoz continues to fight back! She wins a second hole in succession, stroking in a birdie putt on 11 from 20 feet. She’s just two holes down against Angel Yin. But elsewhere, the momentum is very much with the USA! The Kordas continue to rise after stuttering starts. Nelly wins 13, Jessica wins 9, and the sisters are now leading their matches after being three and two holes down respectively. And a bogey for Anne van Dam on 10 means Lizette Salas is level. All of a sudden, with Ally McDonald levelling things up against Bronte Law on 6, this is the USA’s to lose!Charley Hull, having finally made a putt on 9, knocks in another at 10. A birdie, and she holds her arms out in mock triumph, having let so many earlier chances slip by. She’s just the one down to Megan Khang now. Meanwhile Brittany Altomare rakes in a long one on 8 to move two up on Jodi Ewart Shadoff, while Anna Nordqvist goes two up in the final match. It could well go down to that last rubber, because as things stand the scores will be level ... and the USA would retain the cup as holders. Best of luck guessing which way this is going to go.Finally a little joy for Azahara Munoz. She smoothly sends her tee shot at 10 to four feet, and the resulting birdie is enough to reduce her arrears to three holes. A round of two halves coming up? Meanwhile on 14 Kang rolls in the six-footer she’d left herself for birdie. Two putts for Ciganda, who birdies as well, but that’ll feel like a win for Kang after their respective tee shots. And back on 6, Pettersen nervelessly guides in a left-to-right slider from 25 feet for birdie, moving two clear of Alex. Ice cold.Ciganda and Kang have been put on the clock. Neither player appears particularly fussed about it. Ciganda drives the short par-five 14th Kang chips on in two. Meanwhile there’s a Korda resurgence: Nelly wins the 13th to draw level with Hedwall, while Jessica ties it up with Masson on 8.Boutier rights the wrongs of 10 by easing her second at 11 to six feet, then nailing the birdie putt. She’s all square with Park again. Meanwhile Hull, who missed two short putts on 7 and 8 to win the hole, knocks in a 12-footer on 9 to save the half. Strange game, golf.Ciganda’s driver cost her on 9. And having gotten out of position at 13, she slips behind in the opening match. Birdie beats bogey. Not a single match is tied right now! Europe would win the cup if everything remains the same, but there’s no more than a hole between the players in all but two of these matches. It’s on the proverbial knife-edge. Lexi Thompson’s putter has played up all year, and her flat stick continues to let her down today. She prods with great uncertainty at a three-footer on 11, and that’s three holes gone in the blink of an eye. And mixed news for Europe elsewhere. Suzann Pettersen moves one up on Marina Alex Charley Hull misses another short chance to win a hole, this time at 8 Angel Yin hits the turn four ahead of Azahara Munoz and Caroline Masson pulls a six-footer at 7 to hand a hole back to Jessica Korda. It is, to quote the great Danny Boon, all happening.A lovely tee shot by Celine Boutier at 10. Pin high to 12 feet. But it earns her nix. Nada. Nothing. Her opponent Annie Park rakes in a monster from the fringe, and Boutier’s birdie effort then fails to drop. Hole to the USA. Better news down the bottom, where Bronte Law scrambles par at 4 with a determined 15-footer, and it’s enough to win the hole and regain the lead over Ally McDonald.Ally McDonald has snatched a hole back off Bronte Law, but in the final game Anna Nordqvist has birdied 2 to start well against Morgan Pressel. A long way to go, of course, but as things stand, Europe will regain the Solheim Cup.Back-to-back holes for Nelly Korda! She follows up birdie at 10 with another at 11, and suddenly she’s only one down against Caroline Hedwell. Meanwhile on 10, Lexi Thompson races her birdie effort ten feet past the hole, and she’s never getting the one coming back. Georgia Hall gets up and down from the top of a rugged mound, and she’s dragged the match back to all-square in short order!Georgia Hall finally gets something going. Birdie at 9, and she hits the turn just one behind Lexi Thompson. The American then lets go of her club after hitting her tee shot at the par-three 10th, twirling it in the air like Stevie Nicks in the video for Tusk, before catching it cleanly. She’s disgusted with herself, but that’s professionals for you, because she’s still found the green. The weekend golfer would be thrilled. Birdie putt coming up.Some truly world-class play on the short par-four 11th. Kang sends her second screeching to 18 inches, a surefire thing for birdie. So Ciganda responds by knocking her ball to 12 inches! A pair of stunning birdies! Back on 6, Van Dam yips from short range to hand a hole back to Salas. And on 7, Hull creams a delicious iron to four feet, but shoves the birdie putt wide right. She’s still a couple down to Khang."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63f577a7fac7e7d251a892875c29c41ad6432bcb/714_527_4279_2567/master/4279.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fc935bef3b8f21c92594b069188e3d5","title":"solaris review royal lyceum edinburgh david greig tarkovsky soderbergh stanislaw lem","story":"Royal Lyceum, EdinburghDavid Greig follows Tarkovsky and Soderbergh with this bold, rewarding take on Stanisław Lem’s novel about a sentient planet speaking to its visitorsIf a sentient planet existed, it would be unfathomably hard to explain. How to put into words a consciousness so vast, ancient and alien? We’d struggle to begin.It seems only right, then, that each time it is told, the story of Solaris shifts in shape. First, came the 1961 novel by Stanisław Lem, coupling dense tracts of tech-speak with an unknown terror worthy of Edgar Allan Poe. Where the 1972 Tarkovsky movie was spare and reflective, the 2002 Soderbergh version was all about the wish-fulfilment romance between George Clooney, as a newly arrived spaceman, and Natascha McElhone, an apparition of his former wife.Likewise, David Greig’s adaptation, the most satisfying of them all, is its own thing. Although rooted in the novel, it takes bold and rewarding liberties with character and plot. This is partly to make theatrical sense the crew of the playwright’s gender-balanced spaceship are now talkative instead of taciturn, their attempts to understand the watery planet a collegiate enterprise, the better for us to know what’s going on.It’s partly also to home in on the themes of loneliness, communication and unknowability. In Greig’s version, Solaris learns to talk to its visitors step by step, manifesting itself in increasingly sophisticated ways. First, it sends gifts of Earth-like objects, and eventually emissaries in human form.The more real these manifestations become, the greater the existential crisis. Polly Frame, excellent as psychologist Kris, is emotionally torn when Keegan Joyce appears as long-lost boyfriend Ray. He is as attractive and as inscrutable as the planet itself. Pulled in two directions – by scientific rigour and human passion – Kris sees an escape from loneliness in the very thing that will make her more isolated. Matters are no easier for Ray, a personality without a past, slowly destroyed by self-awareness.All this is consummately staged by Matthew Lutton in a co-production with Melbourne’s Malthouse theatre, bringing a human scale to the otherworldly seascapes and arid spaceship interiors created by designer Hyemi Shin and the technical team. With its sharp, cinematic cuts and rumbling waves of sound, Solaris troubles and tantalises.• At Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh, until 5 October, then at Lyric Hammersmith, London, 10 October to 2 November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e27676fb9d1ba89a666fe5185149f6d7fadad93/0_213_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4b909ba222631513dda3296fdd854e9","title":"peaky blinders fans birmingham legitimate festival with flat caps","story":"The first Legitimate Peaky Blinders festival promised ‘an immersive re-creation’ of the hit Netflix showPeaky Blinders is among the most-watched dramas on television and has grown into a cultural phenomenon around the world thanks to Netflix viewers. Now the Birmingham-based gangsters are going about conquering the festival world.The two-day Legitimate Peaky Blinders festival took place this weekend in Digbeth, the area of the city centre closely associated with the historical gang, with performances from Primal Scream, Frank Carter and the Rattlesnakes, Anna Calvi and Liam Gallagher.Billed by organisers as an “immersive re-creation of the Peaky Blinders world”, other activities included staged bare-knuckle fights, a Gypsy enclosure with painted caravans, swing bands, a cast Q\u0026ampA featuring Sam Neill (Major Campbell), Paul Anderson (Arthur Shelby) and Kate Phillips (Linda Shelby), a fashion show for the official Peaky Blinders tailoring line, Garrison Tailors, free haircuts and a company of actors walking around in character.A majority of those in attendance wore newsboy caps, some going the extra few miles with an entire outfit of period-correct attire. There were hundreds of flappers and women in cocktail dresses, while other women opted for a more androgynous look, nodding to the Shelby clan’s queen, Polly (Helen McCrory).Sitting about 50 yards from the site of the first recorded Peaky Blinders crime – an assault of March 1890, some 30 years before the events depicted in the series – the show’s creator, Steven Knight, said it was like a “bizarre dream” to see fans sporting severe French crops and flat caps, starched collars and braces inspired by his series.“It’s very humbling,” he said. “These are intelligent human beings who have decided to use their free time to show their love for the series. I see lots of people with tattoos, or decorating their cars and vans. It’s working-class people, it’s middle-class people, and they have responded on an extraordinary level.”“It really shows off the area and it can only be a good thing that so many people are visiting,” says Ellie Bloomfield, who has travelled from nearby Wolverhampton to attend – in full 1920s outfit – with her partner, Joel Tett.Wayne Morris and Jenny Gill were another local couple attending in full Peaky get-up.“The local association is really important for us,” said Morris. “It feels like it’s part of our heritage. We didn’t know anything about that era before the series started. As for the outfits, we only wear these clothes for special occasions, but I’d dress like this every day if it was more acceptable.”“We toyed with doing this in London,” says promoter John Empson, who worked with Knight, the immersive theatre group Dank Parish and Martin Coat, the creative mind behind Boomtown festival, to stage the Peaky weekender. “That felt like a diss to Birmingham. Peaky Blinders has been a massive boost for the city and people here hold it close to their hearts. It had to be here.”In light of the pilgrimage, there is a certain irony to the fact much of the series is filmed in Manchester and Liverpool, but that isn’t going to deter either the organisers or the devoted Peaky fans.The festival was some way off selling out of its 20,000 tickets, perhaps understandable given the short lead time – it was only announced in late July.“Ultimately, this is a new way of staging a festival, with these immersive aspects,” says Empson. “Boomtown is the best at this kind of thing, they do it so well, and we can learn. It took longer for people to connect with this idea than I thought it would, to be honest. I thought this weekend was going to sell out overnight, but no festival sells out its first year. We will be back next year – we have a long-term plan for more festivals, and in different locations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b5072fce4b0e6e1818968ed1a1729696121c5e7/0_832_9000_5401/master/9000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee9b01107a0845d96167058d7dcdbd06","title":"question time 40th anniversary bbc bias brexit fiona bruce","story":"The BBC panel show now causes as much debate as it hosts, accused of bias by all sides. Presenter Fiona Bruce still has hope for the futureQuestion Time turns 40 at the end of this month. The BBC institution is not immune to that birthday’s particular mix of crisis and denial. While the programme’s 25th year was marked with affectionate celebration and nostalgic retrospectives, this time around there will be little fanfare. Mostly, you imagine, like many of us who have experienced that midlife milestone, the show would ideally like to take to its bed in a darkened room to fret about its blood pressure and its sell-by date, and to relive those golden years before any red-faced audience member ever yelled the words “no deal” or “confirmatory vote” or “the Irish backstop”.For those who hold to the idea that politics and journalism should be more about listening than lecturing, more about informed doubt than angry certainty, Question Time has for a long while been an uncomfortable watch. Since the redoubtable charmer David Dimbleby finally threw in the towel after 25 years, aged 80, in December, the hottest seat in British broadcasting has belonged to Fiona Bruce, who maintains a measure of order with a mixture of good humour and exasperation and that judiciously raised eyebrow. Her early outings on the show were praised for their briskness and confidence. As this long year has worn on, however, she has, like the rest of us, looked a little more beleaguered. She was not 20 minutes into the first show after the summer break before she was calling a time-out to the partisan bickering: “We are better than this.” Most evidence in the current public square suggests that we are not.I met her last Monday, at the same moment that her equivalent in the House of Commons, John Bercow, was announcing his departure. She had been instrumental, the week before, in bringing back Question Time earlier than scheduled “because we all felt it was important for people to be able to hold their elected representatives to account in the absence of parliament”. Was there a part of her that wished she had stuck to Fake Or Fortune?, The Antiques Roadshow and the news?The first episode of Question Time is broadcast on BBC One on 25 September, hosted by Robin Day. The panel – “There they are and here we go” – consists of the Labour MP Michael Foot, Edna O’Brien, the Tory MP Teddy Taylor and the archbishop of Liverpool Derek Worlock. The format is based on Radio 4’s Any Questions?A special Question Time episode from Brussels with the former Tory PM Edward Heath, the Labour MP Robin Cook and the SDP co-founder Roy Jenkins.Robin Day announces his retirement. Peter Sissons takes over until 1993. The BBC begins filming the show in different locations.\u0026nbspDavid Dimbleby succeeds Sissons.

David Dimbleby misses chairing an episode for the first time in 15 years, having been injured by a bullock on his farm. John Humphrys steps in.David Dimbleby announces his retirement after 25 years and 914 episodes. Fiona Bruce replaces him.\u0026nbspQuestion Time is the BBC’s most tweeted-about show in 2018.To date, 1,413 episodes of Question Time have aired and the show has about 2 million viewers per episode.I wish I shared her confidence. That first week back she gave in to the inevitable and the audience talked Brexit and prorogation for the whole hour. Why?She began that quest by asking the audience in advance to signal whether they were remainers or leavers, roundheads or cavaliers. The gesture looked like a pre-emptive strike to appease those critics who see bias in the BBC’s every utterance.Of course, it achieved no such thing. Question Time has a bigger Twitter response in the UK than any programme other than Love Island. Each episode of the programme has long since become a real-time media studies lesson. Bruce and the panel and selected members of the audience are freeze-framed for evidence of Brexit collusion or Remoaner conspiracy. No one, it can seem on Twitter at least, is immune to these tribal knee-jerks. Iain Dale, the LBC presenter and Tory commentator, who was a guest on that first show, was thrilled to note the boost it had given to his online following. He immediately fed that crowd by tweeting a tally of the amount of time each panellist had been allowed to speak. Despite the fact that by far the most newsworthy moment of that programme involved Labour’s Emily Thornberry being exposed explaining the absurdist contradictions of her party’s current policy, Dale used the data to support his belief that there was an anti-Brexit conspiracy on the show.Question Time was born in a similar moment of political polarisation: 1979, the first year of the Thatcher government. As the first chair, Sir Robin Day, said, it was an experiment in putting politicians in front of “what’s described in TV circles as ‘real people’ to distinguish them from people who work in television”. It was the third episode before a cabinet minister, Michael Heseltine, appeared, and offered himself as a rather grandiose conductor of the audience’s discontent. Watching those early episodes now, you have a sense of a different kind of relationship between panel and questioners. There is a little more general politeness from the latter, and a degree of anxiety about being the target of Day’s gruff wit. In the years since then, many things have changed. But the most obvious one is that people now have more practice and opportunity in broadcasting opinions – and belief in their need to be heard.In the early days of social media, Dimbleby used to read out the show’s Twitter hashtag in the style of a high court judge presented with the latest fashion in tattoos. Latterly, he acknowledged the highly vocal “audience at home” as a crucial part of the reach of the show. Our greater access to politicians, and to commenting on their every gesture, has led to two things: their calibre has apparently fallen, and the collective mistrust of them has grown. Does Bruce think the relationship is retrievable?“The one thing that Question Time still does which other programmes cannot do is cut through the political messaging,” she says. “I always ask people to be polite sometimes they are very direct. And as any politician knows, if you face the public directly, anything can happen. Look at Boris Johnson in West Yorkshire the other day – you just don’t know who is going to shake your hand and politely tell you to ‘leave their town’. That is where the jeopardy comes on Question Time and not all politicians want to come on it, for that reason.”Those who do rarely seem to have the time or the inclination to utter anything other than practised party lines. Hasn’t it actually become yet another opportunity for the two tribes that now make up our nation to display their colours, and to let off some steam?“It can be cathartic, people like to vent on Brexit, but I still think it works best when people want an answer to a specific question. For example, I remember Nigel Farage was on – he has actually only been on once since I started – and someone asked him: ‘What other country trades only on WTO rules?’ The man in the audience just kept trying to get him to name one, which he didn’t. The best thing, on Question Time, is when the reality confronts the rhetoric.”In his own recollections of the programme, Day mentioned that he regretted not having a greater say in choosing panellists. Has Bruce managed to win that concession?“I do get involved,” she says. “It would be wonderful if I could sit there and say: ‘let’s have Michael Gove this week’, or whatever. But sadly it is not like that. Mostly there is a member of the government and a member of the opposition put forward, and then the rest is worked out over a year to get fair representation.”Farage, who has an amazing appearance record, seems to have been a particularly fortunate beneficiary of that system…“Not as amazing as Ken Clarke, who has been on it 59 times, I think.”But whereas Clarke has held many of the highest offices in the land over half a century, Farage has been on 33 times having never been elected an MP…“I am not fully across why that was,” Bruce says. “It was before my time. He came on with me after the European elections, once, which seemed reasonable, as he led the largest party.”In some ways Bruce’s own appointment appeared an odd choice at the time. It was generally accepted that whoever would replace Dimbleby had to be a woman, but others among what Bruce sweetly calls “the BBC sisterhood” – Mishal Husain, Kirsty Wark, Emily Maitlis – had arguably a greater depth of political experience. Bruce, by all accounts, aced the audition process, which involved a practice live show. Her apparently impermeable good humour was no doubt a factor. Anyone who took the thing more to heart would probably go bonkers after a couple of weeks.You don’t have to spend long in her company to understand that her Antiques Roadshow bonhomie is not just for the cameras. There is a cloak of cheery confidence about her. A 2009 appearance on Who Do You Think You Are? revealed some of the roots of that, when she traced her father’s family back to an impoverished fishing village in Scotland. Her old man had escaped that, a considerable autodidact, to make it from the post room to the boardroom at Unilever.Would she say that he had imbued his youngest child with a sense that anything was possible?“He never said that in so many words. But yes, given where he came from and what he did, I think subconsciously I have always felt that.”When Question Time came her way, she followed Dimbleby’s obvious advice and just tried to be herself.“I am a simple soul,” she says, not quite believably. “And you don’t have time to dissemble on live TV even if you wanted to. Everything is happening around you and you just react. If you were also trying to be a character, I’m not sure how you would do that.”Day in particular gave the show its knockabout gravitas by being a political insider. Would she count politicians among her friends?“That is not the world I have inhabited. God, who knows how long I will do this and if that will change. But I think it is healthy for me to keep a distance.”That sense of perspective, of an outsider’s eye, she suggests, is rooted in a childhood that began in Singapore where her father ran Unilever’s east Asian operation.“I didn’t grow up in this British system,” she says. The family came back briefly to live on the Wirral when she was six. Then later, until she was 14, she was sent to an international school in Milan, “a Tower of Babel of different languages and nationalities”. Her best friend was Norwegian, and they remain close. She returned from Milan, where she mixed with the “kids of international business people”, to a comprehensive in New Cross, south London, another “big adjustment”. From there, she used the language skills she had to win a place at Oxford, where she was “interested in women’s politics and having a good time”. She was very briefly a protester at Greenham Common she fronted a punky band and dyed her hair blue (but only for a week). She was not involved in student party politics, and never a member of any party “because no party has ever had sufficient pull for me. And that is just as well now.”Her desire to go into journalism came quite late. She worked at the management consultancy Accenture for a year, with airy ideas of an MBA, but spent much of it crying in the loos. She escaped to a job in advertising for four years – “had a blast” – and met her husband of 25 years, Nigel Sharrocks, who was a director at the BMP agency. She eventually talked her way into a job as a researcher on Panorama after she met its editor at a wedding.She became the first woman to have presented both News at Six and News at 10. Does she think of herself as a presenter or a journalist?“I think of myself as a journalist first and foremost.”Before Dimbleby took on the Question Time job, Jeremy Paxman auditioned. By some accounts he savaged both the panel and the audience. Does Bruce feel TV journalism has to be combative to get at the truth?“Not always. I had done debate programmes before and quite often you go into them thinking: ‘I might need to build some energy in the room.’ On Question Time, the reverse is true. A lot of the time, I am just trying to not have it turn into a slanging match. You want some heat in the programme, but you need more light than heat. I think if I don’t do that, sometimes it is just going to run away and be incredibly ill tempered. Who wants to watch that?”The answer to that question is perhaps: quite a lot of people. For a while, in more politically stable times, there seemed to be an effort to invite mostly career contrarians on the programme in case it became dull. Ten years ago, there was considerable furore around the appearance of BNP leader Nick Griffin. More than 8 million people – nearly three times the regular audience, and still easily a record – tuned in to see him undone by Jack Straw and Bonnie Greer. Could Bruce imagine having a figure like Tommy Robinson on?The thing about Griffin was that he had become an MEP, Bruce says. “If Robinson hasn’t won representation through a national election, then the question wouldn’t arise.”The audience appetite for something of a political ruck, however, appears to have sharpened, ingrained by the winner-takes-all mentality of first past the post, and a mistrust of coalition and compromise. Since about the time Question Time first appeared on our screens, it could be argued that we have increased the demand for politicians to entertain us, to be colourful rather than competent. We are, you might say, now reaping that particular whirlwind.The present prime minister was a regular fixture on Dimbleby’s Question Time panels. He played a characteristic part in one of the most memorable exchanges on the programme, when the panel debated the award of a knighthood to Salman Rushdie in 2007. Dame Shirley Williams, surprisingly and to her discredit, suggested that the honour was ill judged since it risked insulting some Muslim groups and inflaming tensions. The late Christopher Hitchens made a robust defence of the novelist’s right to offend, with a righteous erudition rarely heard on British TV. When Johnson’s turn came, he inevitably ducked that nuanced and principled argument, and instead mumbled a crowd-pleasing wish that the knighthood had gone to an English novelist with “a grasp of plot and character”: Dick Francis was his suggestion.One result of that ongoing desire for politicians that look for easy applause, rather than confronting hard choices, is a sense of debate as a zero-sum game, rather than an attempt to find consensus. The clips that trend on Twitter from Question Time are often prefaced by the language of cage fighting: “Watch X get owned by Y” “Y tears Z a new one”. The clips are followed by dialogue in which people shout intemperately on Twitter about Question Time being unwatchable because it reflects a nation in which people shout intemperately.It is hard to see that temper cooling. Does Bruce imagine that she might soon have to start programmes by asking everyone to play nicely?“I don’t want to be the schoolmarm. You just have to sense the feeling in the room. We had one guy who became so irate he stood up and started haranguing one of the panellists. I had to tell him to sit down, which sounded a little odd.”The other armchair Question Time sport is the opportunity is provides for the current national pastime of bias-hunting. It is good fodder for those who would rather put our current political impasse down to a misjudged sneer from John Humphrys on the Today programme, or an answer cut short by Fiona Bruce, than to three decades of rising inequality and underinvestment in infrastructure and skills. The BBC has been found wanting in various ways in reporting our political meltdown, but those who, like the Labour peer Andrew Adonis, call it “the Brexit Broadcasting Corporation”, or conversely, along with Nigel Farage, characterise it as “the enemy” should be careful what they wish for.“The BBC value I aspire to represent on Question Time is simply impartiality,” Bruce says. “From what I can tell on social media people think the programme is too rightwing. And when you look at the audience research we get people thinking it is too leftwing. I can only hope we fall between those two and plot a course down the middle.”The problem is that the middle ground no longer appears to exist, even as a widely held aspiration. Bruce can look like an easy target for those political forces that want to suggest the BBC is the voice of a supposed metropolitan elite. She has homes in Hampstead and Oxfordshire, and has been known to write about nice holidays for the . I wonder if she thinks the scrutiny of the corporation in general and Question Time in particular has been helped or hindered by publishing presenters’ and journalists’ salaries? (Bruce’s was reportedly between £350,000 and £400,000 before she accepted the Question Time job.)“I think it’s a good thing,” she says. “I think it has been helpful for women. And I think: why not?”Does she not think average earners might look at those numbers and think: why on earth are taxpayers paying TV presenters four times as much as the prime minister?“I can understand that. And I feel incredibly lucky to be doing the jobs I do and be remunerated as I am.”Does she see any danger of becoming too far removed from the people she is giving voice to, the audience and the viewers?“I don’t think that. But I also think that is partly why I cannot see myself becoming the person who goes to Westminster parties and so on. I see my role on the programme as helping the audience get their answers.”You believe Bruce when she says she has the will to escape from work, though it can be all-encompassing. “I go and walk the dog or go horse-riding or whatever it is in the great outdoors and that, for me, is a switch-off,” she says. “My daughter does not like to talk about politics, though my son does, but that means we talk about it at home less than we might. I try not to look at my phone. There was a period where I had Trump’s tweets coming up and that got in my head, so I stopped. But these last couple of weeks it has been impossible, obviously. We had people round for dinner at the weekend, and it was all dominated by Amber Rudd’s resigning.”We talk a little about the history of Question Time. The time David Steel and David Owen proposed their political pact on air and the time there was a marriage proposal in the audience and an awful delay before a “yes”.“It is clear the tenor of it has changed so much,” she says. “When Jilly Cooper was on she used to bring champagne and smoked salmon for everyone. Then again, someone once threw a bread roll at Tony Blair at the end of the show and we haven’t had that yet.” If the show holds a mirror up to Britain, what does it currently look like from where she is sitting?“We are just so angry,” she says. “And people feel so let down and not listened to and unrepresented, on both sides. It is not a happy country at all at the moment.”Does she not fear, whatever madness happens in the coming months, that if she sits there for another five years, or 10 years, every show is going to be about Brexit and its consequences?She winces at the thought. “That can’t happen can it? Surely years of negotiating the minutiae of trade deals behind closed doors will not be the same?”It only won’t be the same, I suggest, if we belatedly rediscover the arts of consensus, listening, taking on board expert knowledge, and learning how to disagree better. Bruce fervently believes that Question Time has a role to play in that, and also in helping the nation to plot a course through the current mess.I admire her confidence. Of all the mail and reaction she has had over these last nine months, I ask, has she received a single letter or tweet or email from someone saying: ‘Thank you to Question Time for helping me to see things in a different light and for changing my view on this subject?’”She laughs at the idea. “What do you think?” she says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4736d70c6bdc92ae0f02eb54724aebc7bdbab54d/1428_704_1723_1034/master/1723.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ebacf9fc85baef1143c11d1e86da902","title":"netanyahu holds cabinet meeting occupied west bank ahead election","story":"Government meeting is the first in Palestinian territories for almost two decadesBenjamin Netanyahu has held his final pre-election cabinet meeting in the Palestinian territories, in a clear appeal to hardline nationalists two days before a vote in which he is fighting for his political life and possibly his freedom.Locked in a knife-edge race and facing the prospect of criminal corruption charges, the Israeli prime minister promised last week to extend Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley and settlements in the occupied West Bank. The move would likely leave its Palestinian inhabitants completely encircled and largely trapped in isolated enclaves.He said the expansion of Israel to the east would give the country “strategic depth”.The cabinet also approved Mevo’ot Yericho as an official settlement, giving it a permanent status under Israeli law. It was the first time in nearly two decades that the government had held a meeting in the occupied territories, where more than 2.5 million Palestinians live under military rule among roughly 600,000 Israeli settlers.Netanyahu has said he would declare the annexation after the election and hinted it might have already been approved by Washington, adding that his ally Donald Trump was likely to release his long-touted Middle East peace plan soon after the vote.Naftali Bennett, one of Netanyahu’s former ministers, released on Sunday what he said was a map showing details of the unannounced peace plan, which has been a closely guarded secret.The alleged plan, shared by Bennett on Facebook together with a map, showed the disputed city of Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley as part of Israel, while Jewish settlements in the West Bank were connected through a network of roads. Palestine was shown as a disjointed mass in the middle.However, Bennett, a far-right ultranationalist who is running against Netanyahu, released the plan in an effort to show that the prime minister was not doing enough to expand Israeli control over Palestinian land.Bennett, who wants Israel to annex the majority of the West Bank, called the map “hell” for settlers as they would be “islands in an ocean of Palestine”. contacted the US government for comment. Israeli media cited unnamed US officials denying the map was accurate.Israel is due to hold its second election in five months after Netanyahu, the country’s longest-serving prime minister, was unable to form a coalition government. Facing political defeat, he forced a repeat election.Final opinion polls released on Friday suggest razor-thin margins between his ruling Likud party and the centrist Blue and White alliance led by the former military chief Benny Gantz. It is possible there will be no clear winner, which could kick off weeks of political deal-making with smaller parties to decide Israel’s next government.Netanyahu has sought to play up his diplomatic acumen and relationships with strongman leaders, especially Trump, to convince voters they need him. Trump said on Saturday that he and Netanyahu had spoken about a possible US-Israeli defence treaty, comments seen as an 11th-hour election gift to the prime minister.As in previous elections, the 69-year-old leader has been accused of overtly racist messaging that demonises the country’s substantial Arab minority.His Likud party has issued unfounded warnings that the election could be stolen through voter fraud in Arab areas, a move slammed as a scaremongering attempt to rally voters who fear their political power. And on Thursday, Facebook temporarily shut down a chatbot on the prime minister’s official page for breaching the company’s hate speech policy after it warned of Arabs who “want to destroy us all”.Israel’s Arab parties are expected to win significant seats after reunifying into a single alliance, similar to 2015 when they became the third-largest force in the Knesset. It is possible they could gather enough seats to block Netanyahu from continuing as prime minister.Polls also show the far-right extremist Jewish Power party, whose members have called for the expulsion of Arabs, could enter parliament. If it does, Netanyahu is expected to bring it into a coalition government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98c46cd21bf3ca6809b95fe63421168d80f3b23d/0_90_1796_1078/master/1796.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f84ada292f01e70ee7b2df6be2d239d0","title":"the last rickshaws of kolkata in pictures","story":"Kolkata, one of Asia’s great melting pots, is the last place on Earth where rickshaw wallahs still haul people and goods through narrow lanes.

And seeing the way our politics are going, moderation and the application of common sense seems to me to be very valuable.”Around 700 people gathered at the Ulster Hall on Saturday for the event hosted by former Labour party adviser Alastair Campbell.Among the speakers was Alliance Party leader Naomi Long MEP, Green Party NI leader Clare Bailey MLA, and SDLP MLA Claire Hanna.Ms Long reminded the audience that the DUP do not speak for the majority of people in the North who she says want no deal off the table.“Threatening to harm yourself is no negotiation tactic,” she said.Ms Bailey said Northern Ireland was “ignored” in the lead up to the 2016 EU membership referendum, that the leave campaign broke electoral law, lied and spread misinformation.Ms Hanna said the people wanted “stability and our future back”.“We can end austerity, or we can do Brexit but we can definitely no do both,” she said.During a panel discussion among business leaders entrepreneur Bill Wolsey said he had been appalled by the attitude displayed among some to foreign nationals.He said people from other countries have\u0026nbsp“enriched our society” and welcoming people was “something to be proud of”.Defending democracyMr Wolsey said he had been offended by comments made by British prime minister Boris Johnson that he would rather “die in a ditch” than ask for a Brexit delay.He said after 40 years of violence in the North his mind had been “warped” and he thought at the time: “I wish he would come over here, because a couple of boys would put him to the test”, which was met by laughter from the audience.He added that the language used by Mr Johnson was offensive to people in the North, that it was “ludicrous” and that having liberal views was “something you should be proud of”.Mr Wolsey emphasised that defending democracy was essential.“Millions of people died in the ditch for that one,” he said.On a panel for under 25s, a young woman from the Our Future Our Choice campaign group told the audience regarding Brexit, “The children of the peace process deserve better than this”.A handful of protesters stood outside the event.Among them was Raymond Stuart from South Antrim, who wore a Make America Great Again cap and carried a Leave Means Leave placard.He said Mr Grieve and Mr Campbell were not welcome in Belfast “because they have rejected the will of the British people, the 17.4m who voted to leave”.Mr Stuart said he supported Mr Johnson, that he wasn’t sure if the prime minister would betray the DUP and that he wanted him to “stand firm”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Jeff OversBBCPA Wire.Two of Boris Johnson’s senior ministers have talked up the possibility of securing a Brexit deal through some ergence on the rules in Northern Ireland, as the government’s rhetoric showed fresh signs of shifting ahead of crucial talks.With Mr Johnson due to meet Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, on Monday, his Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay and home secretary Priti Patel accepted the Irish border was likely to be a key to any potential agreement.Following weeks of government discussion about preparedness for a no-deal departure, both ministers said the overwhelming focus was leaving with an agreement.“The entire machinery of government, now, is focused on getting that deal and is planning and preparing to leave on October 31st with a deal,” Ms Patel told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show.With Mr Johnson vehemently committed to leaving the EU on that date, but bound by law to seeking an extension if a deal is not in place by the time of the European Council summit on October 17th, there has been intense focus on ways he could find a plan acceptable to Brussels but which would not be seen by Conservative MPs as a betrayal.Mr Johnson is set to tell Mr Juncker that he will defy the new act of parliament and refuse to discuss or accept any offer to extend the UK’s membership even if a Brexit deal cannot be agreed.Frontier checksThis has centred on ways to allow Northern Ireland to stay converged on some regulatory and standards border issues with the Republic of Ireland, preventing frontier checks while not having a full customs border in the Irish Sea.Speaking to Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme, Mr Barclay said it was important to get the consent of all political sides in Northern Ireland, but also to abide by the Belfast Agreement, which could potentially be breached by a hard Irish border.“It is important we move forwards with the consent of both sides of the community in Northern Ireland,” said Mr Barclay, who is this week due to meet the EU’s chief negotiatior, Michel Barnier. “That’s very much part of the thinking and part of the consultations that we’re having.”He insisted there had been definite progress in finding a successful compromise. “There has been detailed technical talks led by David Frost, the prime minister’s Europe adviser. They have been meeting with Michel Barnier’s team,” he said. “The prime minister will be seeing President Juncker tomorrow, I’ll be meeting with Michel Barnier tomorrow, so there’s extensive talks been happening both at a technical level but also at a political level. So there has been a huge amount of work going on behind the scenes. We can see a landing zone in terms of a future deal but there is significant work still to do.”Mr Johnson is committed to getting rid of the backstop, the guarantee central to Theresa May’s rejected deal in which the UK would effectively stay within the EU’s customs union if no other solution for the Irish border could be reached before the end of a post-exit transition period.DivergenceAnother option would be a backstop just for Northern Ireland, but the government has rejected this. Mr Barclay said while it was vital for the UK to “leave as a whole”, some ergence already existed between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.“We can get into those details as part of the talks. But that is different from the principle of the backstop, and the backstop needs to go,” he said.Speaking later, Ms Patel was more cautious, saying she did not want to “pre-empt” the talks, but accepted the border issue had moved on from the backstop in terms of discussions with the EU.“The reality is we have to deal with the backstop issue, and people said, under the Theresa May deal, that the withdrawal agreement would never be considered or looked at again, and neither would the political declaration,” she said.“We are in different territory right now, so it’s no point arguing about the past. We are moving forward now as a government, collectively, focused on leaving but leaving with a deal.”She added: “We have to leave and we have to leave with a deal on 31 October, and there’s no point right now trying to prejudge the discussions that are taking place.” - Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

In fact, the report on which these headlines were based reluctantly admits that net deforestation is actually decreasing, as more felling is offset by new forest being restored or planted. In Britain this is especially true. A century ago, our island was less than 5 per cent woodland. Today woodland covers nearly three times as much land, at 13 per cent, and is probably almost as wooded as it was in mediaeval times. In this we are like other wealthy countries. Europe as a whole is steadily becoming more wooded.

They noticed that on 13 May, the back hole was lit up twice as bright as had ever been before – and it continued to turn incredibly bright on two other nights this year.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red.

As such, it could be just the beginning in a major change in the activity of the black hole.“The big question is whether the black hole is entering a new phase — for example if the spigot has been turned up and the rate of gas falling down the black hole ‘drain’ has increased for an extended period — or whether we have just seen the fireworks from a few unusual blobs of gas falling in,” said Mark Morris, UCLA professor of physics and astronomy and the author of a paper describing the discovery..Scientists will now keep looking at the area and hope that new images can help resolve that question. That could in turn help us understand how black holes grow and the kinds of effects they have on the galaxy and the larger universe.The brightening could have come from the fact that a star was seen going very close to the black hole in summer last year, or that another mysterious object known as G2 had its outer layer ripped off when it passed by in 2014. It might also be the result of big asteroids passing near the black hole, scientists said.The black hole poses no danger to life on Earth. It is 26,000 light years away, and the radiation coming out of it would need to be 10 billion times brighter to have any effect here.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That would speed up progress on a Brexit deal acceptable both to the UK and the EU, as the so-called Irish backstop has been a major stumbling block.DUP leader Arlene Foster rejected the speculation, saying late on Thursday: UK must leave as one nation. We are keen to see a sensible deal but not one that ides the internal market of the UK.”Still, the pound gained more than 1 per cent against the dollar on Friday morning to trade as high as $1.2475, a seven-week high.

The former London mayor and foreign secretary won his leadership bid by beating Jeremy Hunt in the Tory race the day before. Theresa May stepped down following her resignation as Conservative Party leader on 7 June.“It’s clearly about a reduction in no-deal risk being perceived,” said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets. He noted that shorting, or betting against, sterling has become a very “crowded” – and hence less attractive – trade, prompting traders to bet the other way which also lifted the currency.Last week MPs passed a law preventing a no-deal Brexit on 31 October and refused to grant Boris Johnson an early general election, which he hoped would give him a majority in parliament.But the chances of leaving with an exit agreement are also uncertain as the only deal agreed with the EU after two years of talks has been rejected by Britain’s parliament three times.Since the vote to leave the EU, the pound has lost 17 per cent against the dollar and almost 15 per cent against the euro. \u0026nbspAdditional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.Sandé’s new album, Real Life, is out now on Virgin EMI. She is on tour in the UK from 15 November.Bananarama, Clean Bandit, Pet Shop Boys and Westlife are among the acts to perform at Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park on Sunday 15 September.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The new phone includes a chip referred to as U1, and which it says is used for sensing things in space.For now, it is only being used for a new feature that uses Apple\u0027s AirDrop technology, and allows people to point their phones towards another device and send files between the two. The chip can be used to precisely locate other devices, Apple said, meaning it can know exactly where it is pointing.But it is clear that the chip is really meant for a variety of other features, too. What is less clear is what exactly those features are.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

Somewhat ironically, it appears under a heading indicating that it will allow the phone to be more precise.Which new iPhone should you buy? 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max comparedThe new Apple-designed U1 chip uses Ultra Wideband technology for spatial awareness – allowing iPhone 11 Pro to precisely locate other U1-equipped Apple devices, it reads. It\u0027s like adding another sense to iPhone, and it\u0027s going to lead to amazing new capabilities.Apple is already rumoured to be working on small tracking devices that could be added to objects to allow them to be found more easily.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

That would speed up progress on a Brexit deal acceptable both to the UK and the EU, as the so-called Irish backstop has been a major stumbling block.DUP leader Arlene Foster rejected the speculation, saying late on Thursday: UK must leave as one nation. We are keen to see a sensible deal but not one that ides the internal market of the UK.”Still, the pound gained more than 1 per cent against the dollar on Friday morning to trade as high as $1.2475, a seven-week high.

The former London mayor and foreign secretary won his leadership bid by beating Jeremy Hunt in the Tory race the day before. Theresa May stepped down following her resignation as Conservative Party leader on 7 June.“It’s clearly about a reduction in no-deal risk being perceived,” said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets. He noted that shorting, or betting against, sterling has become a very “crowded” – and hence less attractive – trade, prompting traders to bet the other way which also lifted the currency.Last week MPs passed a law preventing a no-deal Brexit on 31 October and refused to grant Boris Johnson an early general election, which he hoped would give him a majority in parliament.But the chances of leaving with an exit agreement are also uncertain as the only deal agreed with the EU after two years of talks has been rejected by Britain’s parliament three times.Since the vote to leave the EU, the pound has lost 17 per cent against the dollar and almost 15 per cent against the euro. \u0026nbspAdditional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It existed during the Cretaceous period, around 76 million years ago.The partial skeleton was found in Dinosaur Provincial Park in southern Alberta in 1992, but had long been confused with another genus of pterosaur until further analysis, published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, showed the creature was unique.“These are among the most popular and charismatic of all fossil animals,” said Michael Habib, research associate at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County’s dinosaur institute.“They have been inspiration for countless movie monsters, they were critical parts of global ecosystems worldwide during the age of dinosaurs, so they are key to understanding the ecology and extinctions of that time.Created with Sketch.Science news in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 Turtle embryos influence sex by shakingThe sex of the turtle is determined by the temperatures at which they are incubated.

The tallest of the skeletons uncovered measured at 1.9mThe definition of a species is not so clear cutResearchers settled upon the name “frozen dragon” as a nod to the now icy landscape in which the skeleton was discovered, but in reality it would have thrived in a temperate climate that supported lizards, turtles and small mammals.Professor Habib, a fan of Game of Thrones, admitted he initially suggested calling the species Cryodrakon viserionin reference to one of the show’s dragons, which was reborn in ice, according to National Geographic.Despite its fearsome name, the dinosaur suffered many battle scars during its lifetime, with scarred bones and the tooth of a velociraptor-esque creature lodged in the remains.Scientists believe that because of its muscular shape it was a ground hunter who used flight to burst away from danger or to seize its prey.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This tells us a great deal about the anatomy of these large flyers, how they flew and how they lived.”For decades, scientists wrongly classified the remains as the Quetzalcoatlus species of pterosaur, first found in Texas.When Professor Habib, who was measuring the bones to map how the creatures flew, saw the skeleton four years ago, he began to suspect it was unique.He was able to establish it was an azhdarchid, one of the largest types of pterosaur ever known. But his real breakthrough came while studying the creature’s neck vertebrae.Prof Habib discovered that the arrangement of pneumatophores – the holes through which air sacs entered the bones’ interior – were unlike that of any other known azhdarchid.Asteroid that killed dinosaurs hit with force of 10bn atomic bombsHigher oxygen levels helped dinosaurs to flourish, say scientists‘Forgotten dinosaurs’ returning from edge of extinction in US rivers“The creature is similar to the largest pterosaurs known, yet key characteristics gleaned from the cache of bones show it’s actually part of a new genus and species,” he said.“This particular group of pterosaurs includes the largest flying animals of all time. Their anatomy holds important clues about the limits of animal flight and may be important in the future for biologically inspired mechanical design for flight.”Researchers next hope to establish how the muscles of the ”frozen dragon” might have attached to its bones to gain better insight into how it moved.Prof Habib wishes to further measure the bones to learn more about how it flew – the scientific process that first led him to the species’ discovery.Additional reporting by SWNSShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The album cover happened by chance – after hanging out on another shoot a few weeks later, Lane heard the band’s art director hassling them to choose an album cover. He’d brought his portfolio with him, which included the now-infamous “ass shot”.230 29) The Notorious BIG – Ready to DieBiggie Smalls picked a baby resembling himself to star on the cover of his debut Ready to Die. By doing so, he summed up the album’s autobiographical content, which begins with childhood and closes with death. He also uses the notion of childhood innocence to foreshadow how our surroundings can have a lasting impact.It might not be the quintessential David Bowie album, or the one that introduced fans to Starman. But the face staring back at you from this particular album cover is, undeniably, the most recognisable Bowie look: red mullet a gaunt, sombre expression and that famous lightning bolt across his face.One of the greatest debut albums – and arguably the best hip hop record – of all time has a fittingly arresting cover image. A photo of a seven-year-old Nas was superimposed over Danny Clinch’s snapshot of one of the housing projects in the New York rapper’s native Queensbridge. Designed by Aimee Macauley, it was intended to reflect how the projects used to be Nas’s entire world, “until I educated myself to see there’s more out there”. But Nas was also inviting you to see through his eyes and into those very projects where he grew up, and feel immersed in that world via the power of his storytelling.Years after its release, Kate Bush noted how The Dreaming was deemed by many to be her “she’s gone mad” album. Its multiple, disparate narratives and metamorphic production intertwine with movie influences, particularly music hall crime capers of Houdini’s era. On the sepia-toned album cover, Bush plays the role of the escapist’s wife, looking to the distance, rather than at his face, as though trying to contact him via a different medium than mere speech. The way she holds his face in her hands gives her an additional, mesmerising power and conjures the old-world, eccentric mysticism with which she was – and still is – associated.Photographer Michael Spencer Jones had a task on his hands organising Oasis for what is indisputably their best album cover. It was different to what the band originally envisioned – Noel Gallagher had spotted a photo of the Beatles sat round a coffee in Japan, so thought Oasis could be photographed at the dining table of guitarist Bonehead’s house in Manchester. Jones didn’t see this working, so spread the members around Bonehead’s living room instead, and asked them to bring objects that were personal to them for decoration. Noel liked Jones’s idea of hanging an inflatable globe (brought by one of the roadies) from the ceiling. “Yeah, global dominance,” he said. Soon after the album’s release, that’s exactly what happened.Andy Warhol conceived the idea of a vinyl cover with working zipper that would reveal a pair of white briefs beneath the bulging jeans of a male model, who has to this day never been identified. Many fans assumed it was Mick Jagger, but people working on the shoot said several models were photographed and Warhol never revealed which one was used. It represented what the Rolling Stones quickly became famous for: an edgy, hyper-sexual kind of swagger.German painter Mati Klarwein – who also created Santana’s artwork for Abraxas – was behind this gatefold cover that served as an embodiment of Davis’s creative manifesto. The surreal and complex renderings mirror what Davis does with the music itself challenging traditional notions of structure and juxtaposing concepts of passivity and aggressiveness, anger and love.930 22) ACDC – Back in BlackBack in Black’s all-black cover design fit the mood of a band emerging from dark times. In the wake of the death of vocalist Bon Scott, ACDC had tracked down Brian Johnson, whom Scott had previously mentioned to the band. Certain people at their record label, Atlantic, weren’t so keen on the cover, but the band were insistent: it was a memorial to Scott. And now one of the most instantly recognisable and best-loved album covers in rock history.Visually striking and symbolic of what Debbie Harry was doing both as a woman and an artist in the music industry, Parallel Lines’ cover was shot by photographer Edo Bertoglio. It was apparently rejected by the band but later chosen by their manager, Peter Leeds. The juxtaposition between the band, who beam in their matching dress suits like a bunch of schoolboys at their senior prom, and Harry, who stands defiant in her white dress, hands on hips, is wonderful. “I’m not impressed,” her stance seems to say. “Try harder.”Dylan walks arm-in-arm with then-girlfriend and muse Suze Rotolo through the West Village in freezing New York, February 1963. Rotolo described the circumstances to the New York Times in 2008: “He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat.” Yet her memoir, A Freewheelin’ Time, also noted the cover’s significance, how it “influenced the look of album covers precisely because of its casual down-home spontaneity and sensibility”.Led Zeppelin couldn’t have picked a better image to serve as a visual introduction to their fans. It’s an easy tactic – using a photo from a real-life tragedy, in this case the Hinderburg disaster, for shock factor. But it worked, and the cover went on to become one of the most indelible images in rock music.1330 18) Never Mind the Bollocks – Here’s the Sex Pistols“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks – Here’s the Sex Pistols. They’d caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Using the word “bollocks” on the front of their artwork caused instant censorship, and more controversy that would only benefit its performance. Despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts. Today, it is arguably the most recognisable punk album cover in music history.For a limited time, The Roots’ Grammy-nominated album Things Fall Apart was available with five different covers, which reflected each of the world’s “greatest turmoils”. The most enduring was a photograph taken during a Civil Rights Movement-era riot – a stark black and white image showing riot police as they chase two terrified black teenagers.Yes, Dark Side of the Moon, with Storm Thorgerson\u0027s geometric design, is the most iconic of Pink Floyd covers. But the shot he conceived for Wish You Were Here – taken by Aubrey ‘Po’ Powell – is by far the more visceral. It shows two businessmen shaking hands, with one of them on fire, and to the band it represented the fear of revealing your true feelings for fear of “getting burnt”. Two stuntmen were involved, with one (Ronnie Rondell Jr) dressed in a fire-retardant outfit covered by a business suit, and his head protected by a hood, covered beneath a wig. Unfortunately, high winds meant he lost his moustache and eyebrows to the flames. Hopefully he felt the resulting shot was worth it. Fans definitely think so.Just two of Fleetwood Mac’s then-five members appear on the cover of their best-selling and arguably greatest album. Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood’s legs are entwined, which serves as a pretty good metaphor for the entanglement between band members that resulted in so many of the record’s lyrical back-and-forths. And really it’s just a gorgeous, classic image, photographed and conceived by Herbert W Worthington with the band, and designed by Desmond Strobel.The instantly iconic cover of It’s Blitz! shows little but says a lot. There’s a sense of female defiance in showing the woman’s hand, nails in red polish, crushing the egg, a symbol of fertility. It also embodies what the Yeah Yeah Yeahs did on this album, which is take traditional sounds, equipment and ideas and scramble them into something completely subversive.This shot was taken by celebrated photographer Herb Ritts, who later teamed up with Madonna for the “Like a Prayer” and “You Can Dance” covers. It is one of her most recognisable images, inspired in part by Andy Warhol’s pop art and also by the iconography of Madonna’s idol Marilyn Monroe. Here, she invites fans to make the immediate connection between pop art and commercial value, making her the first to exploit the late Eighties concept of pop artist as brand.The Clash paid tribute to Elvis Presley by mimicking the pink and green lettering from his 1956 self-titled album. Yet the image, one of the most iconic in rock history, blows that version of rock and roll to kingdom come: everything “safe” that the King had offered was replaced by Pennie Smith’s photograph of “the ultimate rock’n’roll moment – total loss of control”. Bassist Paul Simonon later told Fender that he’d smashed his guitar out of frustration with bouncers for not letting fans stand up from their seats at the Palladium in New York City. The captured moment is visceral, dangerous and anti-establishment – just like The Clash.Elvis Presley appears mid-belt on the cover of his self-titled album, clearly performing one of those iconic vocal whoops. It’s a visual introduction to rock’n’roll for his unsuspecting American audience, done 20 years before The Clash would replicate that classic pink and green lettering to do the same for their British fans.Six guys stare down toward the ground, one pointing a handgun right at the viewer. This is the cover art for Straight Outta Compton, the pioneering debut by NWA. The photographer was a 28-year-old white guy, Eric Poppleton, who was struggling to make ends meet after graduating from art school. He and his art director Kevin Hosman spent a day following the guys around alleys in LA, until Poppleton found a spot where he got on the ground and asked NWA’s members to stand over him, with one holding “what was hopefully an unloaded” gun. He had no idea the photograph would become one of the most iconic images in gangsta rap. Poppleton would go on to shoot four other NWA album covers.2230 9) Bruce Springsteen – Born in the USAThe Boss tells you everything you need to know about him with one image. An epitome of the blue collar American, Springsteen’s seventh album cover was shot by Annie Leibowitz and shows the artist’s from behind, dressed in worn blue jeans and a simple white t-shirt, with a red cap hanging out of the back pocket after a long day’s grind. “We took a lot of different types of pictures,” said Springsteen, “and in the end, the picture of my ass looked better than the picture of my face.” Combined with the American flag in the background, the cover parallels the themes of Springsteen’s music.An album cover that would inspire future generations of bands to slouch moodily against brick walls. The Ramones were near-impossible to gather together for a posed photograph, but Robert Bayley – a photographer for Punk magazine, managed to get a shot that captured the band perfectly. Wearing ripped jeans and leather jackets, they stare blankly at the camera through sunglasses, or fringes that half-conceal their eyes.Few album covers can profess to have literally stopped traffic, and it’s testament to the iconic status of Abbey Road’s artwork that thousands of fans have attempted to recreate it. The band, and photographer Iain McMillan, had just 10 minutes to get the shot, which was taken from a step-ladder while a police officer held up traffic behind the scenes. Six photos were taken, which McCartney later examined with a magnifying glass before making his decision.Before he tried to “break the internet” with a nude Kim Kardashian on the cover of Paper magazine, Jean-Paul Goude took some of the most memorable images of the Eighties for Grace Jones’s album Island Life. She appears on the cover in what looks like an impossible pose it is, in fact, a composite of her in different positions, cut and pasted together for one of the most striking images in music history.2630 5) The Velvet Underground and Nico – The Velvet Underground and NicoLike the working zipper of The Rolling Stones’ Sticky Fingers, early versions of The Velvet Underground and Nico asked the owner to “Peel slowly and see”, upon which they’d peel the banana skin to reveal a flesh-coloured banana beneath. MGM was happy to fork out for the additional costs of manufacturing the vinyl, with the assumption that its ties to Warhol would help boost sales. It’s one of very few albums where the person behind the album art, rather than the band themselves or the album title, are named on the cover.The cover art for Joy Division’s debut album was designed by Peter Saville, who had previously created posters for Manchester’s Factor Club in the late Seventies. The chosen image, which was picked by Bernard Sumner, is based on radio waves from pulsar CP 1919 – from the Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy. “The duochrome Peter Saville cover of this first Joy Division album speaks volumes,” Susie Goldring said in a review for BBC Online. “Its white on black lines reflect a pulse of power, a surge of bass, and raw angst. If the cover doesn\u0027t draw you in, the music will.With its star-studded cast and bold colour scheme, the cover of Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band came to define artist Peter Blake and also The Beatles themselves. There are 88 figures in all, including the band themselves, on a set photographed by Michael Cooper. Blake collected a list of names from three of the four Beatles. The list included Tony Curtis, Marilyn Monroe, Aubrey Beardsley, Oscar Wilde, and even Adolf Hitler (requested by John Lennon, and hidden behind other figures). If you bought the record, Blake later said, “you also bought a piece of art on exactly the level that I was aiming for”.Critic Camille Paglia once suggested that Robert Mapplethorpe’s photo of his former lover, friend and collaborator Patti Smith is the greatest ever taken of a woman, and seeing it, you feel inclined to agree. The godmother of punk herself said she thought she looked like Frank Sinatra, dressed in a crisp white shirt with a black ribbon around her neck. A black jacket with a horse brooch on the lapel is slung casually over her shoulder.  “The only rule we had was, Robert told me if I wore a white shirt, not to wear a dirty one,” Smith told NPR in 2010. “I got my favourite ribbon and my favourite jacket, and he took about 12 pictures. By the eighth one he said, \u0027I got it\u0027.”Photographer Colin Lane met the Strokes in early 2001, after being commissioned to shoot them for The Face magazine. The album cover happened by chance – after hanging out on another shoot a few weeks later, Lane heard the band’s art director hassling them to choose an album cover. He’d brought his portfolio with him, which included the now-infamous “ass shot”.230 29) The Notorious BIG – Ready to DieBiggie Smalls picked a baby resembling himself to star on the cover of his debut Ready to Die.

But the shot he conceived for Wish You Were Here – taken by Aubrey ‘Po’ Powell – is by far the more visceral. It shows two businessmen shaking hands, with one of them on fire, and to the band it represented the fear of revealing your true feelings for fear of “getting burnt”. Two stuntmen were involved, with one (Ronnie Rondell Jr) dressed in a fire-retardant outfit covered by a business suit, and his head protected by a hood, covered beneath a wig. Unfortunately, high winds meant he lost his moustache and eyebrows to the flames. Hopefully he felt the resulting shot was worth it. Fans definitely think so.Just two of Fleetwood Mac’s then-five members appear on the cover of their best-selling and arguably greatest album. Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood’s legs are entwined, which serves as a pretty good metaphor for the entanglement between band members that resulted in so many of the record’s lyrical back-and-forths. And really it’s just a gorgeous, classic image, photographed and conceived by Herbert W Worthington with the band, and designed by Desmond Strobel.The instantly iconic cover of It’s Blitz! shows little but says a lot. There’s a sense of female defiance in showing the woman’s hand, nails in red polish, crushing the egg, a symbol of fertility. It also embodies what the Yeah Yeah Yeahs did on this album, which is take traditional sounds, equipment and ideas and scramble them into something completely subversive.This shot was taken by celebrated photographer Herb Ritts, who later teamed up with Madonna for the “Like a Prayer” and “You Can Dance” covers. It is one of her most recognisable images, inspired in part by Andy Warhol’s pop art and also by the iconography of Madonna’s idol Marilyn Monroe. Here, she invites fans to make the immediate connection between pop art and commercial value, making her the first to exploit the late Eighties concept of pop artist as brand.The Clash paid tribute to Elvis Presley by mimicking the pink and green lettering from his 1956 self-titled album. Yet the image, one of the most iconic in rock history, blows that version of rock and roll to kingdom come: everything “safe” that the King had offered was replaced by Pennie Smith’s photograph of “the ultimate rock’n’roll moment – total loss of control”. Bassist Paul Simonon later told Fender that he’d smashed his guitar out of frustration with bouncers for not letting fans stand up from their seats at the Palladium in New York City. The captured moment is visceral, dangerous and anti-establishment – just like The Clash.Elvis Presley appears mid-belt on the cover of his self-titled album, clearly performing one of those iconic vocal whoops. It’s a visual introduction to rock’n’roll for his unsuspecting American audience, done 20 years before The Clash would replicate that classic pink and green lettering to do the same for their British fans.Six guys stare down toward the ground, one pointing a handgun right at the viewer. This is the cover art for Straight Outta Compton, the pioneering debut by NWA. The photographer was a 28-year-old white guy, Eric Poppleton, who was struggling to make ends meet after graduating from art school. He and his art director Kevin Hosman spent a day following the guys around alleys in LA, until Poppleton found a spot where he got on the ground and asked NWA’s members to stand over him, with one holding “what was hopefully an unloaded” gun. He had no idea the photograph would become one of the most iconic images in gangsta rap. Poppleton would go on to shoot four other NWA album covers.2230 9) Bruce Springsteen – Born in the USAThe Boss tells you everything you need to know about him with one image. An epitome of the blue collar American, Springsteen’s seventh album cover was shot by Annie Leibowitz and shows the artist’s from behind, dressed in worn blue jeans and a simple white t-shirt, with a red cap hanging out of the back pocket after a long day’s grind. “We took a lot of different types of pictures,” said Springsteen, “and in the end, the picture of my ass looked better than the picture of my face.” Combined with the American flag in the background, the cover parallels the themes of Springsteen’s music.An album cover that would inspire future generations of bands to slouch moodily against brick walls. The Ramones were near-impossible to gather together for a posed photograph, but Robert Bayley – a photographer for Punk magazine, managed to get a shot that captured the band perfectly. Wearing ripped jeans and leather jackets, they stare blankly at the camera through sunglasses, or fringes that half-conceal their eyes.Few album covers can profess to have literally stopped traffic, and it’s testament to the iconic status of Abbey Road’s artwork that thousands of fans have attempted to recreate it. The band, and photographer Iain McMillan, had just 10 minutes to get the shot, which was taken from a step-ladder while a police officer held up traffic behind the scenes. Six photos were taken, which McCartney later examined with a magnifying glass before making his decision.Before he tried to “break the internet” with a nude Kim Kardashian on the cover of Paper magazine, Jean-Paul Goude took some of the most memorable images of the Eighties for Grace Jones’s album Island Life. She appears on the cover in what looks like an impossible pose it is, in fact, a composite of her in different positions, cut and pasted together for one of the most striking images in music history.2630 5) The Velvet Underground and Nico – The Velvet Underground and NicoLike the working zipper of The Rolling Stones’ Sticky Fingers, early versions of The Velvet Underground and Nico asked the owner to “Peel slowly and see”, upon which they’d peel the banana skin to reveal a flesh-coloured banana beneath. MGM was happy to fork out for the additional costs of manufacturing the vinyl, with the assumption that its ties to Warhol would help boost sales. It’s one of very few albums where the person behind the album art, rather than the band themselves or the album title, are named on the cover.The cover art for Joy Division’s debut album was designed by Peter Saville, who had previously created posters for Manchester’s Factor Club in the late Seventies. The chosen image, which was picked by Bernard Sumner, is based on radio waves from pulsar CP 1919 – from the Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy. “The duochrome Peter Saville cover of this first Joy Division album speaks volumes,” Susie Goldring said in a review for BBC Online. “Its white on black lines reflect a pulse of power, a surge of bass, and raw angst. If the cover doesn\u0027t draw you in, the music will.With its star-studded cast and bold colour scheme, the cover of Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band came to define artist Peter Blake and also The Beatles themselves. There are 88 figures in all, including the band themselves, on a set photographed by Michael Cooper. Blake collected a list of names from three of the four Beatles. The list included Tony Curtis, Marilyn Monroe, Aubrey Beardsley, Oscar Wilde, and even Adolf Hitler (requested by John Lennon, and hidden behind other figures). If you bought the record, Blake later said, “you also bought a piece of art on exactly the level that I was aiming for”.Critic Camille Paglia once suggested that Robert Mapplethorpe’s photo of his former lover, friend and collaborator Patti Smith is the greatest ever taken of a woman, and seeing it, you feel inclined to agree. The godmother of punk herself said she thought she looked like Frank Sinatra, dressed in a crisp white shirt with a black ribbon around her neck. A black jacket with a horse brooch on the lapel is slung casually over her shoulder.  “The only rule we had was, Robert told me if I wore a white shirt, not to wear a dirty one,” Smith told NPR in 2010. “I got my favourite ribbon and my favourite jacket, and he took about 12 pictures. By the eighth one he said, \u0027I got it\u0027.”Brown, whose stage name is Mel B,\u0026nbspalso recently announced she has plans to reunite the full Spice Girls lineup for the Glastonbury Festival‘s 50th anniversary next year.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Usually we’re scared, we’re having things shouted at us, we’re humiliated and just really embarrassed.“Social interactions aren’t usually that relaxing so today is all about being together in public and keeping each other safe and uplifted.

When don’t knows are removed the margin is 73-27.Lord Hain said: “Brexit, especially a hard Brexit, is a green light to Scottish nationalists to push for a referendum, and similarly for Irish republicans.“I’ve always been fearful that Brexit would make the break-up of the UK more likely, and this poll confirms it. We’ve already seen in other surveys that Tory Leave voters want Brexit even if it means Scotland and Northern Ireland leaving the UK.”Nicola Sturgeon has said she intends to table a formal request before Christmas for the power to stage a new referendum, and the issue is set to be a central plank of the SNP’s campaign in the expected snap election.Corbyn backs fresh Scottish independence referendum in coming yearsHow could Scotland secure a second independence referendum?Brexit paves way for Scottish independence, Sturgeon saysRees Mogg says Scotland not due independence referendum for 20 yearsBut Mr Johnson said during a visit to Scotland that he did not see why he should “go back” on the result of the 2014 referendum, which delivered a 55-45 per cent margin in favour of staying in the UK.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Throughout the Brexit process we have been completely ignored. The past three years have underlined the rising and unsustainable cost to Scotland of not being independent.“It is no wonder that support for independence is at record levels. The people of Scotland deserve the choice of a better future than the Brexit Britain being imposed upon us against our will.”The BMG study did not include the views of\u0026nbsppeople in\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland, but a recent survey by pollster Lord Ashcroft found the outcome of a border poll would be on a knife-edge, with 45 per cent saying they would vote to stay in the UK and 46 per cent to join the Republic.The DUP’s MP for Belfast East,\u0026nbspGavin Robinson, said, “Northern Ireland’s future is best served inside the United Kingdom for economic, social, cultural and historic reasons.“The criteria for holding a border poll are clearly outlined and have not been met. However, the focus should not be on holding a isive border poll and creating further community tension in Northern Ireland.“We want to see the Northern Ireland assembly and devolved institutions restored so that decisions can be taken on schools, hospitals and the other vital public services which everyone relies on.”BMG questioned 1,504 adults in England, Scotland and Wales between 3 and 6 September.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Don’t muddle it up with the very specific issue of Brexit, because if we end up with another hung parliament then nothing is resolved.”Mr Blair said Britain had traded with its fellow European Union members for almost half a century, and described the EU as “the biggest commercial market and political alliance in the world right on our doorstep”.He also said Labour, working with other parties, including rebel Tories, now had control of what happened with Brexit, adding they must not give up this advantage.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Agon TV, launched in 2013 with ambitions of turning tiny Albania into a European media hub, was uncompromising in its coverage from the off, and in 2015 began airing reports alleging fraud in local elections, including a report about the same man voting 20 times with different identification cards.\u0026nbspSonila Meco, a leading Albanian broadcast journalist, at the 2014 launch party of Agon TVThe reports caused a stir. But few anticipated what would come next.\u0026nbspThen everything went black.\u0026nbsp“I want to say that at this moment the electricity to our channel has been cut,” she announced.\u0026nbspIn the ensuing days, authorities seized the station’s equipment and almost all of its archives.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In addition, Albanian partners to the station were indirectly awarded roughly €30m.The decision also required that Albania pay interest on any money owed.The case illustrates how a group of authoritarians in eastern and southeastern Europe is attempting to squelch press freedoms, often abusing legal tools. EU officials are beginning to take notice, voicing concern this week after Albania proposed a law to tighten controls on online media. \u0026nbspThe Albanian government contends that seizing the station was a legitimate use of executive and police powers in accord with Albanian law. The Independent sought comment from Albanian officials and the law firms that represented the country in the arbitration matter, but received no substantive reply by publication. One UK law firm representing Albania said its barristers were “all just too thinly spread with client work” to comment.\u0026nbspOf the tens of millions of euros Albania was ordered to pay, it has so far yet to pay a penny.Becchetti (centre)\u0026nbspappeared at the 2014 launch partyIt was with high hopes that Becchetti and his business partners entered the country as investors in the hydro-electric industry during the 1990s as it emerged from one of the most repressive communist dictatorships in Europe. He\u0026nbspfirst launched the free daily newspaper AgonFree in 2006, applying to open a satellite TV station in 2013. \u0026nbspThe station expanded rapidly, launching 24-hour broadcasts the next year, and starting an Italian-language sister channel in 2015.\u0026nbsp“We were fiercely independent and unafraid of criticising the ruling parties,” says Becchetti, best known in the UK as owner of the football club Leyton Orient for several unhappy years – the club was relegated and racked up over £5m in debts during his tenure.\u0026nbspBecchetti hoped to build on his investment in Albania, using low production costs to launch Italian broadcasts and perhaps eventually English and other language channels.Journalists like Meco who worked at the channel describe it as a haven for professionals. It used up-to-date HD quality broadcast technology. Some 500 employees were housed in an office just outside the centre of Tirana.\u0026nbspThe station employed top-notch editors and producers, paying salaries three or four times what other Albanian journalists were making.\u0026nbspBut troubles between Rama’s government and the station began immediately. In one incident, Erion Veliaj – a Rama ally who is now mayor of Tirana – was upset that Agon covered his fancy September 2014 wedding.\u0026nbspThe battle between the station and the government escalated, perhaps exacerbated by tensions between Albania and Becchetti over his energy sector investments.\u0026nbspAgon reported what it described as widespread allegations of electoral fraud in 2015 municipal elections that saw victories for Rama and his party.Meanwhile, Albanian prosecutors formally charged Becchetti and his partner Mauro De Renzis with forgery, money laundering and tax evasion, and launched legal manoeuvres to take control of Agon.\u0026nbspRama railed against the channel in television interviews, describing it as a “scandalous phenomenon against which we have declared war”, and accusing it of being funded by “dirty money”.Agon continued to broadcast, though its employees couldn’t get paid. Attempts to wire them money from Italy were blocked by Albanian banks. The government upped the pressure: Agon’s journalists, editors, analysts, cameramen and even hair stylists were stopped at Albania’s borders and forbidden to travel abroad.\u0026nbspCourt orders were drawn up to seize the channel, but few believed a government aspiring to join the European Union would take so drastic a move.\u0026nbsp“I was shocked,” says Meco, now 42 and still working as a journalist in Albania. She still hasn’t gotten over the government-backed seizure of Agon. “I didn’t think things would come to this end.”Agon TV, which was one of the most technologically advanced news channels in the tiny nation of Albania\u0026nbsp(Agon TV)For three years Meco struggled to find work as a journalist, before eventually landing a job at another channel. But she continues to long for the stature and resources of Agon.\u0026nbsp“It was a channel where as a journalist you could exercise liberty and freedom of information,” she says. “This is very important not only for me, but Albania also had this great opportunity to be represented in the world with such a project. Everything after is like being downgraded. Nothing is like what we had.”The arbitration panel found the accusations of money laundering and tax evasion against Becchetti unfounded.\u0026nbspHe suspects the Albanian campaign against him was rooted in his energy dealings as well as the content of Agon TV, with powerful competitors in Italy and Albania egging on Rama.Western governments have repeatedly refused to honour\u0026nbspInterpol red notices that Albania issued against Becchetti and his partners, and Albania has quietly withdrawn the requests.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRama, asked earlier this year about the case, refused to disclose details about the case or comment on the ruling, citing a confidentiality agreement. The case has cost the impoverished country millions of euros in legal fees.\u0026nbspBecchetti\u0026nbspnow spends much of his time overseeing his various legal battles with Albania, but\u0026nbspis also attempting to\u0026nbspstart\u0026nbspan investment fund for entrepreneurs pursuing international ventures. He says he is also writing a screenplay about his Albania misadventures.The battle for Agon TV has cost him four years of his life, but he says the real loss is what Albania could have become.\u0026nbspSince shutting down Agon, Albania has increased attempts to impose restrictions and pressure on the press. Since last year, it has fallen from 75th to 82nd in the Reporters Sans Frontier ranking of countries’\u0026nbspmedia freedom.Rama is said to repeatedly refer to Albanian journalists as “trash bins” – though he promised a group of international media freedom advocates he met in Tirana in June that he would refrain from continuing to use the smear.\u0026nbspOver the summer, Adi Krasta and Ylli Rakipi – both journalists who are critical of Rama and his protege Veliaj – were fired from talk shows on the Albanian News24 TV channel, under alleged government pressure.\u0026nbsp“After the fall of the communist regime, Albania started to build up its democracy from scratch – and thanks to the hard work of the Albanian people, aided by international investors like myself,\u0026nbspthe country broke through the inertia of its past and had made great strides forward,” says Becchetti.\u0026nbsp“But the Rama government then put in place a series of actions against the freedom of people, including the closure of Agon channel and the attempt to arrest me, which was a huge step backwards.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

CubaResearchers for global animal welfare organisation Four Paws filmed a brown bear made to perform tricks including riding a skateboard and dancing with a hula hoop for cheering crowds at the Czech Republic’s Cirkus Humberto.Other shows featured lions, zebras and elephants, according to the witnesses, who said the conditions and displays were “far from the life the animals would have in the wild” and that their “ecological needs simply cannot be met”.Cirkus Humberto says none of its animals is forced to do anything, that play stimulates their brains and that activist groups who “spread misinformation” whip up xenophobia against circus people.\u0026nbspAt a medieval festival in France, a muzzled bear on a leash performed on a stool and a slide, and wolves had to jump through hoops.“The wolves look emaciated and seem stressed, while the bear appears visibly uncomfortable with the leash and muzzle,” said Kieran Harkin, of Four Paws.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the

None of their ecological needs are considered.”Gekoski)Four Paws\u0026nbspsaid in many cases during the investigation across Europe last month animals were seen kept in small enclosures or cages, causing psychological and physical damage.The group says while Asia’s wildlife tourism industry is widely reported, little is known about the “ruthless” abuse closer to home and the evidence found was “horrendous”.\u0026nbspIs elephant riding in Thailand abuse?At German circuses, visitors rode on elephants’ backs – controversial because behind-the-scenes training often involves hitting the animals with sharp hooks.In circus rings they were made to sit on small chairs, play football and stand on one leg.Researchers say that every year there is a tug-of-war between the elephants and villagers, and in winter the animals have to pull sledges.“Elephants are highly intelligent herd animals who migrate and occupy vast areas of land. It is extremely cruel to keep them enclosed in small spaces and exploit them,” said Mr Harkin.“Lack of movement in captivity can result in joint or back problems, in addition to the indeterminable psychological distress.”Tourists in Spain were put at risk when they played and took selfies with a tiger, the researchers said.“The footage shows how the tiger snaps at a visitor while playing chase – behaviour expected from a tiger but that makes interactions extremely dangerous for humans.“The tiger is a predator weighing about 300kg with sharp teeth and claws. Her natural instincts cannot be suppressed.”The female tiger is among more than 100 other wild animals rented out for film productions and used as tourist photo props.“Tigers are commercially traded and treated as a commodity throughout Europe, can overlap with illegal tiger trade,” said Mr Harkin.Elephants poked with pointed sticks for UK tourists at Indian resortAt a French zoo an animal tamer went into a cage alone with up to 10 tigers elsewhere orangutans were kept in small cages.“Ironically a video is played before the show pointing out the importance of conservation of tigers. The commercialisation and exploitation of these animals have nothing to do with the conservation of wild tigers – on the contrary,” he said.\u0026nbspBack in the Czech Republic, at a castle in\u0026nbspCesky Krumlov, investigators also saw three bears kept in a stone moat, denied the chance to climb or roam free.\u0026nbspThe Independent has asked the castle authorities and a\u0026nbspSpanish company\u0026nbspwhere tourists take selfies with tigers\u0026nbspto comment.“It is unacceptable that in the 21st century it’s legal in Europe to abuse wild animals for entertainment,” said Mr\u0026nbspHarkin.“What happens to the animals once they become too old or sick to perform or when the cubs are too old for petting?”Wales may ban ‘cruel practice’ of using wild animals in circusesHynek\u0026nbspNavratil, director of\u0026nbspCirkus\u0026nbspHumberto, said their animals, which were in “perfect condition, better than in zoos”, were regularly checked by vets and were considered family members and colleagues, trained with a rewards system.Stereotypic behaviour, from stress, is never seen in Czech circuses, he said. “We play with them, it keeps their brains working.”“Activist groups spread disinformation and stimulate xenophobic behaviour towards people in circuses. Because of that, we are reporting death treats to police, every week,” Mr\u0026nbspNavratil\u0026nbspsaid.But the circus “defeated” the groups by\u0026nbspopening its gates\u0026nbspto the public, including training, so people can see the conditions. “We have nothing to hide,” he went on.“We do not take Four Paws and suchlike organisations as partners to dialogue. They do not not know anything about us, nor they do not know anything about our animals... We cannot respect them.”\u0026nbspIllegal breeding was not possible, he said, adding: “Our animals are not slaves. Sometimes some animal does not want to perform on a certain day. Then it does not.“These animals cannot be considered wild. According to modern genome studies, it has been proven that domestication takes a sudden twist within five generations.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Bigger than  football pitches, it has room for , staff.It’s now clear that, far from harming the Square Mile, Brexit will help London cement its place as the world’s leading financial hub.Now the Project Fear merchants issue blood-curdling warnings against a No Deal Brexit, making it impossible for Boris Johnson to negotiate with Brussels.Ex-Chancellor Philip Hammond says leaving against the EU’s wishes would cost Britain £billion — equivalent to a whopping four per cent of our annual GDP — doing damage “equivalent to the  financial crash”.Spreadsheet Phil’s meltdown scenario, based on those same  Treasury forecasts, lacks all credibility.EU trade accounts for barely a tenth of the UK economy. Just eight per cent of our firms do business with the -member bloc.The idea Brexit would cause a shock equal to the largest peace-time slowdown in a century, when the entire world economy slumped, is absurd.No Deal is constantly demonised by those who “respect the Referendum result” but are really Brexit-blockers. Preparations have been made on all sides to minimise any disruption.Agreements have been struck so exports will keep flowing and planes will fly.Phone roaming charges won’t change, as the big ­telecom outfits have now ­confirmed.Trade agreements with our most important global customers have been agreed or are in the works.What the doom-mongers don’t mention is that No Deal could mean lower prices for food and consumer goods such as clothing and footwearthe UK drops high tarfs on imports from outside the EU which, for now, Brussels forces us to impose.It is rarely acknowledged that the Irish government has admitted there won’t be new physical infrastructure in ­sensitive locations, and customs checks can happen away from the Irish border.When did you last hear on the TV news that UK exports to the EU have fallen from  per cent of goods we sold abroad  years ago to just  per cent now — despite the much-vaunted single market and customs union it would apparently be so disastrous to leave And why are we never told UK trade outside the EU is now not only the majority of our trade, but is fast-growing, produces a surplus and is conducted largely under World Trade Organisation rules Of course the future is not without danger. Indeed, there is a huge great threat on the horizon that could smash this prosperity to smithereens.And that is a hard-Left Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn, who this week pledged to make it easier for workers to strike, threatening ato the dark days of the s.Polling from Financial News suggests City investors would rather a No Deal Brexit than Corbyn taking over as Prime Minister — and rightly so.Speaking to his trade union paymasters at the TUC on Tuesday, this Magic Grandpa pledged to sweep aside long-standing anti-strike rules, opening the floodgates to widespread industrial action.A Corbyn government would cause havoc — threatening ato the Britain of my childhood, when we ended up being bailed out, going “cap in hand” to the International Monetary Fund.The damage he would inflict would be catastrophic. What forward-thinking firm would want to invest in a country where the government would take ten per cent of your companyyou happen to be successful enough to employ more than  people That’s what Corbyn and his Marxist dreamers are planning.And the wind in their sails blows hard, thanks not to their appeal on the doorstep — two thirds of Brits think him indecisive and incompetent, according to a recent YouGov poll.No, Comrade Corbyn has been helped by the Remainer corporate establishment, in turn assisted by gloomy Remainer economists and an overwhelmingly Remainer media class, which has railed against a genuine Brexit.It’s now threatening to overturn the  Referendum result altogether. That would mean thwarting Prime Minister Boris Johnson, evenhe can only offer No Deal, which could easily result in Corbyn entering No.But any No Deal damage would be minimal and ­temporary.

Presumably their own ­unelected pseudo-Government will see to it, since Boris Johnson won’t agree.This pro-EU elite — Letwin, Blair, Mandelson and the rest, in treacherous collusion with Brussels — want to “resolve” Brexit. They mean “reverse” it, with a referendum question splitting the Leave vote and stitched up for Remain.Brexit won’t be “resolved”we back Leave again. They won’t accept that result any more than the last. Their referendum would be utterly illegitimate.To cap it all, ex-Tory Remainers are now plotting for Rory Stewart to stand against Boris in Uxbridge.Remember Amber Rudd and others throwing hissy fits when he kicked these wreckers out  What  did they deserve THE Sun has repeatedly predicted No Deal would cause turbulence. Leavers expect it.Most know it could hit them in the pocket too. But maintaining a fat bank balance and a comfortable existence isn’t the argument-clincher for them that it is for many Remainers.It’s no surprise Remain MPs are gleefully deploying the “Yellowhammer” report to ratchet up the hysteria about Brexit. It won’t impress Leavers.And we would love to read an “impact assessment” into telling a .million majority their votes didn’t count and surrendering our economy to Marxists.No Deal risks short-term disruption. No Brexit guarantees the annihilation of trust in our democracy, a rapid surge in extremism and probable disorder.No one should gamble on the latter.NIGEL Farage is still a magnet for Brexit voters. The Tories are crazy to rubbish him.Read on Pages  and  how he enthralled paying punters at a packed venue in a diehard Labour constituency.Some in No cannot shake off their ­dislike of Farage. They must rethink. It will be extremely tough to switch Labour-voting northern Leavers to the Tories to counter Tory losses to Remainers. A smart deal with Farage could secure an election majority, and Brexit.Reject that and it looks bleak.MEGHAN’S clothing campaign is a top idea.Every item bought means an identical one is donated to a group which provides smart outfits to help unemployed women find work.We hope it is a massive success.

For a packet of  cigarettes the saving will be as much as £. But Hancock, it appears, will not be celebrating.He has complained that he wasn’t consulted about the Chancellor’s plan to reintroduce duty free on trips from EU countries, and that it will help to undermine the Department of Health’s campaigns to persuade us to smoke and drink less.Obviously, that is good advice. But is anyone really going to take up smoking or go on a drinking binge just because it becomes a little cheaper to buy cigarettes and alcohol at an airport Duty free is a harmless little treat for ing holiday- makers — something to ensure we remain in good cheer for a few weeks after wefrom holiday, or a little in the way of compensationit rained all week on our Spanish beach.Duty free, as anyone over  will remember, used to be a staple part of a foreign holiday. The concept arose because once we have passed through security at a port or airport, we are deemed for tax purposes already to have left the country.Customs and Excise authorities concluded, there- fore, that they had no right to charge us duties designed to capture taxes from domestic consumption.We are theoretically still liable to pay duty on goods when we are entering a country. But in practice most countries will waive duty on small quantities of alcoholic drinks and tobacco products brought in by arriving passengers.As a result, passengers arriving in Britain from non-EU countries are currently allowed to bring back up to four litres of still wine, a litre of spirits,  litres of beer and  cigarettes without paying duty.For passengers arriving in Britain from other EU countries, however, the rules changed in  — seven years after the creation of the single market.Duty free was abolished for people travelling between EU countries. In some ways, the single market was more generous than the previous duty-free regime.Rather than just four litres of wine, for example, we are now allowed to bring unlimited quantities of wine without paying UK duty, so long as it is only for personal consumption.Given that the duty on wine is a lot lower in France than in Britain, we can save a small fortune by stocking up in a French hypermarket.What the EU single market did stop, however, was our ability to travel, say, from France to Britain without paying duty in either country. What Sajid Javid wants to do is to give us the best of both worlds.From October  — assuming we leave the EU without continuing to be subject to the rules of the single market — we will regain our duty-free allowances.But, in addition, we will continue to be allowed to bring unlimited quantities of alcohol and tobacco which we bought in France and which we intend to use only for personal consumption.The main beneficiaries of duty free, needless to say, are smokers and drinkers. But you don’t have to smoke or drink in order to benefit from its existence.The profits from duty free allow airlines and ferry operators to keep their ticket prices down. When the EU proposed to abolish duty free in the s, the travel industry calculated that , jobs in the UK were dependent on its existence.That was no doubt exaggerated for effect, and of course the budget airline industry has grown hugely in the past  years.Butwe want to be able to continue to fly to Spain for a tenner , the reintroduction of duty free is going to be a signicant influence on what airlines can offer by way of cheap tickets.The fuss over Sajid Javid’s proposal has reopened isions in the Government over so-called “sin taxes” on booze and fags.For some, like Matt Hancock, who this week praised the sugar levy on fizzy drinks, sin taxes are a useful instrument for persuading us to lead healthier lives. Others, the Prime Minister included, are more guarded.The problem with slapping taxes on alcohol, cigarettes and unhealthy food is that they are regressive taxes which impact disproportionately on the poor.I would say to Matt Hancock: Give us all the advice on healthy living that you can. And I don’t object to proportionate taxes which reflect the cost of medical care for smokers and excessive drinkers.But leave it to us to decide how we want to lead our lives — and don’t deny us a small pleasure like being able to buy a small duty-free treat on our way home.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is because they are so far apart that architects had to factor in the curvature of Earth.Today, it’s still as unnecessary as it ever was. And it’s no longer the longest suspension bridge in the world. But it remains, in my opinion, the most beautul.In fact, and I’ve said this often, it’s the most beautul man-made thing of all time. Apart from maybe the Riva Aquarama speedboat.When I stand on the south shore on a misty morning and see the wafer-thin road disappearing off into the sea, it takes my breath away. It really does.So I’m glad it was made. And I’m glad too that the Labour government also built the Post Office Tower, even though it is now just a hazard to aircraft.Then there’s Concorde. The world did not need such a thing.And the technical challenges facing the engineers were huge. A Nasa boffin once told me that getting a passenger plane up beyond Mach  was more dficult than putting a man on the moon.But that old commie Tony Benn had decided Concorde was going to succeed, so he pushed and he pushed and, by God, are we glad he did.Can you imagine such a thing Because even though the beautul white bird is now grounded, we still have those memories of the shattering noise it made and the way it could make the sun rise in the West.I remember once, standing on a beach in Barbados as a British Airways Concorde roared overhead at treetop height.After it had passed, a stunned American on the next sun lounger looked at me and said: “You Brits.”I was so proud, I didn’t get round to telling him it was half French.Since Concorde though, Britain hasn’t really done anything of any great importance. There’s been talk of a new railway line from London to Manchester, but in evolutionary terms that’s just a shuffle. And now it probably won’t happen anyway.Which is why I am SO excited about the idea of a bridge linking Larne, in Northern Ireland with Portpatrick, in Scotland.Weirdly, the Labour Party — the party that created the Post Office Tower and Concorde and the Humber Bridge — are furious, saying it’s not needed and will be too expensive and it’s only been suggested to get Boris out of his backstop hole.But can you imagine such a thing A -mile bridge supported on columns ,ft high, and rising even higher in the middle so ships can pass underneath. It would be magnicent.Yes, it would be dficult to make. The seas there are rough and deep and the seabed is littered with discarded Second World War mines and bombs.But as John F Kennedy once said: “We choose to go to the moon and do the other things not because they are easy, but because they are hard.”ACCORDING to a headline in The Times this week, The Handmaid’s Tale is increasingly ringing true.Really  We are heading for the terrying society portrayed in Margaret Atwood’s brilliant book A society where women are kept either for breeding or cleaning  Where girls can be killed for speaking  Or mutilated for looking at someone in a funny way And where children are taken away at birth and given to someone  I know cricket fan and woman Theresa May has suggested that Geoffrey Boycott, who has a conviction for domestic abuse, should be given a knighthood.But that’s a long, long way from sewing up the vagina of the woman he beat.I once saw a sufferer in Burma and the pain was so excruciating that powerful muscle spasms had snapped both his legs.And it wasn’t ordinary rabies our man in Morocco had caught either. It was “furious rabies” which causes extreme thirst and a morbid fear of water. At the same time.Mercully, he has now died. And we, meanwhile, are left to ponder what sort of a God comes up with a disease like that to end nearly , lives every year.ON the basis you should know your enemy, I read a book on holiday this year about why we shouldn’t kill animals.It wasn’t called – “If you eat meat, you’re a bastard”, but that was the thrust.And after a while, I deliberately left it in the rain, so I didn’t have to finish it.However, since I ed to Britain about a month ago, I still haven’t been able to eat pork.Cows  Chickens  Sheep  Not really bothered.But some of the things I read in that book about how pigs can play video games and feel love – they stuck.And so did the bit about how frightened they look when they are being taken to the slaughterhouse.I tried this morning to have a bacon sandwich but I couldn’t bring myself to put it in my mouth.It’s annoying. Pork was always my favourite meat but I’ll have to find a substitute.I’m thinking badger. Or maybe a nice roast fox.I know people who’ve found lost phones in their trouser pockets, and most women are of capable losing anything up to a medium-sized dog in their handbags.But I’ve never heard of anyone losing themselves. Until now.A party of tourists on a bus tour of Iceland spent hours searching for a missing passenger only to find she was in the search party.She hadn’t recognised the description of herself and it wasn’t until three in the morning that her mistake became clear.Bet she was popular.AT long last, space boffins have found a planet which they reckon could be capable of supporting le.They will know soonit has an atmosphere but they’ve already worked out that the romantically named K-b does have water. And it’s only million million miles away, which means that with current technology, we could reach it in just two million years.The only problem I can see is that it’s twice the size of Earth, with eight times the mass, so any astronaut who had survived the -light year journey would weigh quite a lot when he arrivedSo much, in fact, that after a little while, his brain would be dragged into his spinal cord.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Second, it must protect the integrity of the EU’s single market. Third, it must not involve any checks on the island of Ireland.Barclay said the UK could meet the first two of these tests, but not the third. He said there was no point in presenting any detailed proposals until the EU shted on the question of checks.One Government source explains thatthe UK did, the “EU would nuke the proposals and we would be in chaos”.So the challenge for Boris is to get the EU to move on this third point. His Monday meeting with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker gives him a chance to lobby him on this very issue.Juncker is an instinctive deal-maker and, with his term as president due to end on October , he will be keen to resolve Brexit before he goes.I also understand that several EU governments, including in France, are now apprehensive about the possibility of a second referendum.They believe it would be bad for the EU for the UK to stay in given how contested UK membership now is.They fear this would lead to every Council decision, all new EU legislation and every European Court of Justice judgment becoming a matter of controversy.The EU, though, will not abandon Ireland. This means that whatever proposal Boris comes up with will have to be something Leo Varadkar is prepared to swallow.The first meeting between the two men has given Downing Street some hope that they can find something that works for Dublin, them and the DUP.The DUP’s willingness to entertain Northern Ireland continuing to follow EU rules on agriculture has opened the door to further discussions.If Parliament had not tied Boris’s hands, he could have seenthe risk of No Deal would have pushed Dublin and the EU to compromise on the checks front. But his ability to negotiate is now weakened.For this and other reasons, the odds are still against a deal. But there is a greater chance of one than a week ago.The Liberal Democrats start their conference today in their strongest position for years.They are polling around  per cent and in line to make major gains at the next election.At conference next week they are expected to adopt as their position that a Lib Dem government – stop laughing at the back – would simply revoke Article , cancelling the referendum result.This will establish them as the most unambiguously anti-Brexit party, a development that concerns a growing number of Labour MPs in Remain seats who want their party to take a clearer line on the issue for fear of losing ground to the Lib Dems.At the same time, the policy means that the Liberal Democrats can tell voters they will make the whole issue go away. By contrast, a second referendum would drag things out.If politics is now about Leave v Remain, rather than Left v Right, expect the Lib Dems to come back with more MPs than they have ever had before, following the next election.One of the things that urgently needs sorting out in this country is technical education.Those who don’t want to do an academic degree are being ill-served by further education.Gavin Williamson, the new Education Secretary, told Cabinet this week that there are up to , people trained in Hair  Beauty yet only a need for about , new recruits to work in this industry each year.The result is tens of thousands of people doing courses that don’t lead to them getting jobs or boost this country’s productivity.Those who want a second Brexit referendum are now arguing there shouldn’t be a General Election until a second referendum has taken place.Tony Blair, Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson and Tory rebel Oliver Letwin have all made that case this week.Leave aside the massive issue of whether there should be a second referendum before the result of the first one has even been implemented, this plan would mean that this Parliament would have to carry on sitting until well into .This is a disastrous idea. This is a useless Parliament and keeping it going will just add to the national paralysis.With no party able to command a majority in the Commons, nothing can get done. Eventhis Parliament could muster a majority for a referendum, which is far from certain, it could do so for little .It is hard to see what meaningful domestic legislation can come out of this Parliament given that neither Boris Johnson nor Jeremy Corbyn can secure the backing of most MPs.The public desire for politicians to get on with both Brexit and the domestic agenda is why No will spend next week trying to emphasise its tough-on-crime policies.I understand Boris Johnson will put flesh on the bones of his plan to end early release for violent and unrepentant criminals.Friends are urging Amber Rudd to stand in the West London seat of Kensington at the next election.Its controversial Labour MP, Emma Dent Coad, has a majority of just .The thinking goes that the constituency isn’t keen on either No Deal or Jeremy Corbyn, so Rudd could do well standing as an independent.But it is exceptionally hard for independents to win seats, andRudd were to go down this course, she would be standing in the constituency for the first time – she is currently MP for Hastings, down on the south coast. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some of us voted for Theresa May’s deal, not because it was perfect but because it delivered on the result of the referendum.Others couldn’t support it because they felt it was a ‘blind Brexit’ — a leap into the unknown — and asked May to come back with something better.But we are all agreed on one thing.After May held cross-party talks with Labour in May  she came back with ten changes to her deal, and we all believe that this compromise package was more likely to get through Parliament.We all believed at the time that MPs should have been able to debate and vote on this, but sadly it was rejected by second referendum advocates and no-dealers.The Withdrawal Agreement Bill, as it’s known, included protection of workers’ rights, food standards and the environment, which would have benefited us all.We now hope that Boris Johnson brings a similar offer back to Parliament so we can vote on it.Sometimes it’s easy to forget that  Conservative MPs backed May’s deal in March this year while more than  other MPs voted for dferent forms of a Brexit in indicative votes.The desire to agree a Brexit deal is there.A failure to do so may well result in the consequences set out in the government’s own ‘Operation Yellowhammer’ no-deal report.Sensible MPs desperately need to face down the isive voices on either side and come together in the national interest.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It tasted good.He said the flavours appealed to him, especially mango, and the nicotine provided a buzz.He would wake up in the morning and would puff on that Juul and then cough, said mum Polly.Eventually, he went from vaping over-the-counter e-liquids to vaping THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana.But it was soon after that he started to feel unwell and eventually ended up in hospital.Adam said: If I had known what it was doing to my body, I would have never even touched it, but I didnt know. I wasnt educated.San Francisco-based Juul said in a statement that its never marketed to youth and has ongoing campaigns to combat underage use.It added that its products are meant to help adult smokers wean themselves off traditional paper-and-tobacco cigarettes, which Juul called the deadliest legal consumer product known to man.Among the precautions Juul said its taken to ensure young people arent drawn to its e-cigarettes was to close Juuls Facebook and Instagram accounts.The firm said it has also deployed technology that restricts a sale until someones age is veried.Theyre not completely risk free, but they carry a small fraction of the risk of cigarettes.E-cigarettes do not produce tar or carbon monoxide, two of the most harmful elements in tobacco smoke.The liquid and vapour contain some potentially harmful chemicals also found in cigarette smoke, but at much lower levels.While nicotine is the addictive substance in cigarettes, its relatively harmless.Almost all of the harm from smoking comes from the thousands of other chemicals in tobacco smoke, many of which are toxic.Nicotine replacement therapy has been widely used for many years to help people stop smoking and is a safe treatment.Theres no evidence so far that vaping causes harm to other people around you.This is in contrast to secondhand smoke from smoking, which is known to be very harmful to health.Source: NHSHis ordeal follows a spike of mysterious and le-threatening lung diseases - believed to be linked to vaping - over the summer.In the US, six people are now reported to have died from vaping-related lung illnesses.The latest person to die was in their s and from Kansas.They were in hospital with symptoms that progressed rapidly, but also to have had a history of underlying health issues.While more than  people, mostly otherwise healthy and in their teens or s, have shown up at hospitals with breathing dficulties.Often theyve also suffered with vomiting, fever and fatigue for several days prior.Some have even ended up in intensive care on a ventilator for several weeks.Its prompted health bosses to issue a warning while they investigate the issue.The USs health protection agency, the Centres for Disease Control and Preventionsaid earlier this month that people should consider restraining from using e-cigarette products.So far, officials say the cause is unknown, but they are carrying out investigations."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy vine accidentally love you radio","story":"The BBC presenter was speaking to guest Anne Mantel on his lunchtime radio show on when – as he put it - the words just came out.Ms Mantel from Chichester, had called in and the pair had a pleasant chat about a peacock butterfly that had been hibernating for two months after it had flown into her house.As he rounded up the call, Mr Vine said: Thanks for listening - look after that butterfly.Ms Mantel replied: Will do, thank you.

These have been bolstered as part of our preparations. In addition we have put in place extra measures.”Suppliers have been given special documentation to help them get across the border and avoid any delay.

For insulin, for example, there is four months supply in the country at the moment.”He moved to calm fears of a sudden shortage, adding: “Production of medicine will stay the same, demand is going to stay the same. The challenge for EU exit is in the logistics – getting it from where it is produced to the patient.“If there are some travel delays then the buffer stocks will cover that and they will be topped up, so it’s not going to be the case of having six weeks from October  then at some point in mid-December we will run out.”Extra freight capacity has been secured and NHS staff have been told the main message is “Keep Calm and Carry On” but not to stockpile.In his briefing, Mr Fear stressed: “Just because we are planning for it, doesn’t mean we think it’s going to happen. We are just saying this is the possibility so we are going to plan for it.“We are trying to be as well prepared as we possibly can.

People deserve better than Boris Johnson’s No Deal Brexit and Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Brexit. At the next election, voters can instead choose the Liberal Democrats, and our clear and unequivocal policy to Stop Brexit.Before an election is called, the Lib Dems will continue to work cross-party to prevent a dangerous No Deal Brexit, and support a People’s Vote, with the option to remain. We will do all we can to fight for our place in Europe, and to stop Brexit altogether. Introducing the motion, the partyaposs Brexit spokesman Tom Brake MP outlined the proposal. He told conference delegates: A Liberal Democratic majority government will revoke Article . We will put an end then and there to the Brexit nightmare that is tearing the country apart. But he explained thatthe party falls short of governing alone, which with just  MPs currently seems likely , the priority remains to back a Peopleaposs Vote    Mr Brake said that Lib Dem performance in local and European elections show that revoking is no longer a pipedream We are in reach of forming a democratic majority government, Mr Brake added.

My disagreements with Jeremy ­Corbyn are well known. They remain. But he has co-operated with other parties in the last weeks very sensibly and skilfully to stop a No Deal Brexit. Parliament is blocked and Boris Johnson completely boxed in. The blockage is not – as Farage and Johnson insist – because MPs are a bunch of “Remoaners” thwarting the will of the people.There is a substantial majority for doing Brexit with an agreement to replace the existing arrangements with the ­European Union. There is, however, also a big majority against No Deal Brexit for the simple reason that it is a massive gamble with the British economy that no responsible prime minister or ­government would take. And the reason Parliament has had dficulty, under both May and Johnson, of reaching agreement on the type of deal which would work, is that Brexit was an easy instruction to give but a hugely complicated one to do.We have traded and operated as a nation within Europe for almost half a century. It is the biggest commercial market and political alliance in the world right on our doorstep. Divorce was always going to be dficult.    Contrary to what we are told by the Tories, it isn’t really a negotiation with Europe. It starts with a choice. Stay in Europe’s trading structure to ­minimise economic pain and keep borders, not least in Ireland, open . Or exit, in which case the adjustment will be painful, ­particularly in Ireland. Both May and Johnson have tried to have it both ways and that was never going to work.  So the question now is how to break the blockage, because the one thing everyone wants is for the Brexit nightmare to end. Johnson wants to go back to the people in a General Election. This is crazy. We decided Brexit by a ­referendum. If we’re to reconsider it, do it the same way. An election is about masses of dferent things and is to elect a government. Don’t muddle it up with the very specic issue of Brexit, becausewe end up with another hung Parliament then nothing is resolved.

When she was just  years old Melanie Blake left her working class family home in Stockport and started le on the streets of Oldham and Salford. Desperate to carve a career for herself in  the music industry but estranged from her family, she spent several months sleeping rough while juggling part time jobs, Manchester Evening News reported. On many of the freezing cold nights she spent on the streets or in squats with strangers, her career ambitions seemed impossible to fulfill. “That first nightwas so cold I thought I was going to die,” she said. “I huddled up with these two girls and five lads, we would lie on the floor and try and keep warm. The place we stayed in was so rough...    Desperately trying to save up any money she earned as a receptionist and shop assistant to follow her dream of getting into the music business, Melanie was bereft when she came back to the squat one night and saw it boarded up. She said: “I was gutted. I had to sleep in the shed in the garden. In hindsight I should have got a BB for the night, but I was young and had this little Halax account with my running away fund and desperately didn’t want to spend any money.” A chance conversation with a squatter about a housing initiative in Salford saw Melanieaposs fortunes change. She went to the council and within the same day was given a set of keys and her own flat.    Melanie said the authorityaposs help saved her le. Within three months of moving into her own place she had saved £,. She left Greater Manchester for London on the day of her th birthday. After grafting away in temp jobs, Melanie won herself an entry-level gig at Top of the Pops, where she rubbed shoulders with s musical greats including Spice Girls and Kylie Minogue.    She caught the eye of higher ups when she began working with Claire Richards from Steps - a job that led her to launch the Nolan Sistersapos reunion tour. It was with the aposIaposm in the mood for dancingapos songsters that Melanie bagged her first million. “Everyone said I wouldn’t be able to do it. They said no one wanted to see  and -something women on stage - but they were wrong. It made millions,” said Melanie.    The experience with the Nolans inspired her to take on sexism in the music industry via a fiction book called aposThunder Girlsapos. Following the lives of a aposs girl band savagely dropped by their label, the book proved a big success and sparked a stage adaptation. Having got her first chance in Salford, Melanie is keen to bring the show to the city.    Melanie, who now lives in Crouch End, London, said: “When the show hits the Lowry Theatre stage, it will be exactly  years to the day that I left Salford for my new le in London. Itaposs been particularly emotional ing to the city for the launch It still feels like home. “Yes I live in a fancy house now and am living the dream, but when I got my chance, I wanted to bring it all back to the city that saved me.    “I was keen to invest back in the north, cast women from the north and bring the show back to the very city I was homeless in. I could have launched the show in London but for me, the Lowry Theatre was the perfect choice.” Melanie has paid for  tickets to her own show, which will be given to people in the area who wouldnapost normally be able to afford the theatre. “I only ever went to the theatre once growing up, she said. I saw Blithe Spirit at the Royal Exchange and loved it.

While drugs to shrink the tumours are available on the NHS, the coffee shop worker says le expectancy is currently still only around seven years, LancashireLive reports.  Joanna, who describes herself as an ALK-positive lung cancer warrior, has set up the @justamammafightingcancer Instagram blog.

She said: “It is affecting more and more young people and not every hospital offers the testing of cells that finds these rare forms. “Not every oncologist in the country knows about it, which is quite scary. Sharing knowledge is sharing power against this awful disease.”  Joanna, who is originally from Southport, is on a daily treatment of tablets for le, however when she grows immune to the drug after three to five years she will require an alternative. She added: “Whenever this one stops working for me the next one will be available. “They’re very expensive, which is why they don’t offer genetic testing to everybody. “I’m still breathless and cannot walk very far. I’m now classed as disabled. I get quite a lot of nerve pain.” Joanna, of Peel Street, says writing the blog has helped her greatly to stay in an optimistic frame of mind and also helped her friends and family to deal with what she is going through.

The number of cattle slaughtered because of TB rose from , in , when badger culling began, to , in -. It is estimated , badgers are likely to suffer “immense pain” in culls, according to former government adviser Prof Ranald Munro, with % taking more than five minutes to die after being shot. Prof Munro’s remarks come as he and  other vets, scientists and animal welfare campaigners wrote to Natural England, the body that oversees the culls. A  independent review of strategies for tackling tuberculosis also warned against an “over-emphasis” on the role of wildle in its spread and concluded badgers were not the primary cause. It said transmission was greater from cattle to cattle and suggested farmers needed to do more to prevent it.  It also found culling had only a modest effect in curbing TB. But the government never responded, instead prioritising the views of Tory-voting farmers and landowners over those of highly respected scientists.

Diana ripped up the Royal Family rulebook when it came to raising William and Harry. Before her, royal children were mainly raised by Palace staff including a team of dedicated nannies. The Queen wasnapost particularly involved in raising her children, and was often away for a months at a time when they were young.    But after the birth of Princes William and Harry, Diana changed all this with her hands-on approach. Even though she was only  when she became a mum, she was determined to do a lot of the day-to-day child care and refused to leave her boys at home when she went away on Royal Tours, taking them with her instead. But her parenting reportedly didnapost go down well with other members of the family.

Oscar Lundahl, , nearly jumped out of his fishing boat when he saw the bizarre-looking species with bulbous eyes on the end of his line. The specimen is in actual fact a ratfish, whose Latin name Chimaeras Monstrosa Linnaeus is aptly derived from a Greek mythical monster that had the head of a lion and tail of a dragon. The fish - a relative of the shark that dates back  million years - live in deep water and are very rarely caught.  Although ratfish are harmless to humans and feed on crustaceans like crabs and sea snails, their odd appearance is enough give any angler worth their salt the creeps. Their huge eyes are believed to have been developed to help them see at such dark depths. Oscar was fishing for the blue halibut when he caught the ratfish by mistake off the island of Andoya in northern Norway. He had four hooks on his line with mackerel as bait and was fishing in ,ft of water at the time. Oscar, a fishing guide for Nordic Sea Angling, said: We were looking for blue halibut which is a rare species about five miles off shore.

Victoria Hunter had no idea she had driven through an enforcement zone off limits to regular traffic during a temporary trial in her home county of Gloucestershire. She was unaware she had done anything wrong until an enforcement officer arrived at her Cheltenham home, Gloucestershire Live reported. The original £ fine issued on November  last year had grown to £ due to all of the subsequent late payment add-ons.    The escalated total struck the single mother as unfair however, because she had not been aware of the fine until the bailf knocked on her door. Victoria, who is mum to two-year-old Harry, said: “I didn’t get any warning letter. Genuinely, the first I knew of it was when there was an enforcement agent at my door. “It’s brought me to tears. I had a panic attack that day he knocked on my door.” Since the -year-old was visited on August  she has contacted Gloucestershire County Council complaing about not receiving a warning about the fine. She was asked to put the matter in writing and told she would receive a response in  days. Victoria suggested the council may have been sending letters to her old address in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, which she left on October  last year. The car she had driven during the offence had been registered to that address. Now the mum is worried she may have to sell her car to cover the debt.

Heading east towards City Square, to the right past Daniels brae, you pass the Burn Bar.“A quick look inside would probably see brothers Pat and Jim Sturrock pouring sumptuous pints of heavy, and Eddie Greenan would normally be standing at the far end of the bar.“A bit further on, you would be at the Blackness Road junction before heading down the Blackie past the Blue Mountains, and now entering the bustling shopping expanse of the West Port.“With the Globe Bar visible in a rear-view mirror, crossing over Tay Street reveals the Overgate. This historic artery had a pulse and an energy all to itself.“Those memorable stretches of the old town nurtured the players who turned out for Dundee Harp FC.”Rob revealed that Arbroath had a star defender, a local lad called Tom O’Kane.Rob went on: “He took no prisoners and could leather a ball from one end of the pitch to the other.“At the beginning of the - season, Tom was poached and somehow persuaded to leave his home team to sign for Dundee Harp.“The town of Arbroath was outraged at the smash-and-grab by Harp.“Were underhand means used to attract O’Kane “Probably.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/06/image.jpg1_.396679.jpg ","title":"blether exhibition on dundee uniteds greatest gaffer jim mclean is wonderful","story":"Tannadice Park currently hosts a wonderful initiative as Dundee United remembers the glory years under their greatest-ever manager.Tom Cairns, chairman of the Dundee United Business Club, along with several other volunteers, host the ‘The United in Memories’ display at the ground.Said Tom: “This year, it features The Jim McLean Years and can be viewed every Wednesday until late November .“On display is an array of interesting memorabilia encompassing the managerial career of the most successful manager in Dundee United’s history.“The event is staffed by knowledgeable volunteers from Dundee United Business Club.”This has got to be a must-see event for every United fan – and, indeed, every football fan.Admission is free via the main door at Tannadice Park from pm until .pm and has easy disabled persons access."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/07/5d382714055389.83294295-e1564477706176.jpg ","title":"dundee boss mcpake to shake things up for alloa clash following recent losses","story":"Dundee boss James McPake will ring the changes for tomorrow’s Championship clash with Alloa Athletic.On the back of a disastrous derby display in their - defeat at Tannadice, the Dark Blues were dumped out of the Challenge Cup by League Two Elgin.Manager James McPake will certainly make one change but is likely to make more after two disappointing results.Goalkeeper Calum Ferrie was sent off last Sunday and will serve a suspension this weekend.

That early-season success, however, has come as no surprise to Robbie.“I know Ian, I meet him now and again because he stays near me.

He gets them working for each other and they get good energy in their team. They’ll be a force this year.”On top of that, Robbie admires the way the man who had a troubled spell at Tannadice more than a decade ago has resurrected his managerial career.He added: “As all managers know, we go up and down. We have good periods, then we have dficult periods.“I’ve had that as well and it’s about resilience. Ian’s had that and he’s shown it. He’s gone to a club and shown what capabilities he’s got.“He’s built something at Ayr and it’s like anything, it’s about getting time.“If you get three or four years, you get the chance to build something and get stability.“The problem in the game now is that you are getting two or three months.

It will fit in well with all of the regeneration that has taken place at the waterfront.#But Ashley Squire, from Coldside, insisted there were other issues that also had to be ironed out, saying: “It’s a nice design but there are issues with parking at the Waterfront.“Perhaps they could revise the design to include more parking spaces for families wishing to use the playground.”Council officers say they have only “very high” aspirations for the design and features of the play park, which is expected to have large numbers of visitors due to its proximity to the VA.In a design brief published as part of the bidding process, they express the hope that the facility will be “unique and very memorable”, with interactive elements such as keypads, buttons and features triggered by sensors.#Planners also want to see it illuminated at night, like the VA and the adjacent Discovery. “The intention for the play area is that it should be innovative in design, and ambitious in its unique identity,” they said.“There are fundamental starting points for the designers involved: that it is to be themed on whales, and that a digital element should be included.“The play area needs to be suitable for all ages and needs.”The council is leaning heavily on Dundee’s historical whaling trade as inspiration for the play area. As well as specying that the play area should be the shape of a whale it also wants kids to be able to create whale song.Officers have even alluded to the bowhead whale – the preferred whale of the one-time Dundee whaler – as the ideal inspiration for any design.Following the construction and opening of the park, the council aims to form a Whale Park Engagement Group with experts from Dundee Science Centre and the University of St Andrews to promote sustainable marine practices.The launch of the design competition comes after Andy Scott, creator of the Kelpies sculptures in Falkirk, scrapped a plan for a whale sculpture in Waterfront Place.Much like the play area, Mr Scott’s steel design would have been le-sized, inspired by the bowhead whale, and built as a tribute to the whaling trade.However, the Scottish sculptor had to let his design – which he drew up at no cost to the council – “swim off into the sunset” after agents acting for the local authority ignored his pitch."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-2-e1553252194766-940x564.jpg ","title":"the first thing i did in the morning was make myself a double vodka and water dundee man turns his life around with the help of community group","story":"“The first thing I did in the morning was make myself a double vodka and water,” said Ian Thomas, speaking of his -year alcohol addiction.“I’d have a few of those for my breakfast.“I would wake up and vomit, have diarrhoea.“I was delirious, tremors, no appetite. I was drinking to knock myself out.”Ian, , of Earn Crescent, said his le was so low he had suicidal thoughts of slitting his wrists and jumping off the Tay Road Bridge.He said: “I kept a diary. I wrote in it every day the amount of times I was sick, bleeding, diarrhoea, then wrote that I just wanted to go to sleep and not wake up.”Ian desperately wanted out of the le of alcoholism but he did not know how he could escape it without dying.He said: “I was hospitalised dozens of times.“I wasn’t the master of my le anymore, alcohol was the master of me, everything I did revolved around it.“I lived in a slum.“There was blood everywhere, spewing everywhere, mouldy drink cans, pee all over the place – I knew it was a slum but I didn’t care.”It got so bad that Ian could not walk or talk and was checked into former psychiatric hospital Sunnyside in Montrose three times for detoxication by his family.But it was only following the third time Ian made the conscious decision to stay sober – a feat he’s managed for  years now.He said: “I’m not proud of myself.“I don’t look at the past, I just take each day at a time.“I tell myself I’m sober today and the rest slowly takes care of itself.”Ian now keeps himself busy with activities such as drawing and creative projects at Just Bee Productions.The community group offers people a safe space to be creative and connect with others at vulnerable times in their lives.Ian said: “Getting involved with Just Bee is one of the best things that’s ever happened to me.“It keeps my mind busy and gives me something positive to focus on and it’s good to be around people again, instead of sitting in the house on my own all day with just my thoughts.”Ian and about  other participants in the group are gearing up to start working on a musical theatre show called This is a Mental Musical.Claire Bee, founder of Just Bee Productions, said: “The show is about mental health and everything that goes along with that.“It’s also about giving people a  to have a voice to say what they want to say.”The show will be performed in Dundee and the group hopes to take it to Edinburgh Fringe Festival next year.Former plays performed by Just Bee include Drink, The Musical which toured community venues in Dundee, including nearby prisons, and another musical called Next Stop Please.Former heroin addict Cheryl Ferguson, , said: “Doing the musicals has helped to build up my confidence, self worth and a feeling that I belong.“It’s opened up opportunities which I wouldn’t have thought were possible and I’ve met loads of brilliant people who are like family now.“I love it.

loss to Celtic on December  last year.Boss Derek McInnes retained faith with the same starting line-up that defeated Ross County - at Pittodrie before the international break.Shay Logan ed to the squad having missed the match against the Staggies with a groin problem but had to be content with a spot on the substitutes# bench.The goal scoring heroics of Connor McLennan on international duty was not enough to elevate the winger into the starting .McLennan came off the bench for the Scotland U#s and netted two late goals to secure a - European championships qualier away win.In a low key opening Saints created the first opportunity in the th minute when Matty Kennedy picked out Murray Davidson  yards out but his shot trundled wide.The woodwork denied Aberdeen in the th minute when superb skill from Greg Leigh saw the left#back control the ball then step wide of his marker before firing in a dangerous ball into the box.Leading scorer Sam Cosgrove met the cross and his header cracked off the base of the far post.Aberdeen went ahead in the th minute when the impressive Leigh burst towards the left side of the box. He was tenacious and drove forward only to be tackled.The ball broke to HEDGES who clinically shot beyond Zander Clark from  yards.St Johnstone equalized in the nd minute courtesy of a rare mistake from keeper Joe Lewis.A pass from Scott Tanser was cut back to Michael O#HALLORAN who shot low from  yards out. There was no power in the trundler but somehow the ing Lewis let the effort go under his hands.The goal came completely out of the blue.In the th minute Saints won a free-kick  yards out. May#s weak effort was straight at keeper Lewis who easily saved.Moments later St Johnstone again threatened when Davidson latched onto a Jason Holt corner only to send a ing  yard header just wide.Saints were looking the more likely to score and Lewis redeemed his earlier mistake in the th minute with a strong near post block to push behind a vicious Davidson  yard drive.St Johnstone were raging in the th minute when referee Steven McLean pointed to the penalty spot # only to change his mind following a conversation with his official.The penalty was initially given when Kennedy went down and appeared to have his heel clipped by Andy Considine.McLean gave the penalty, which appeared soft. However, so rare in Scottish football, the refereeing not only took time to think he also used common sense.Following consultation with assistant Graeme Stewart on the touch-line McLean over-ruled his initial decision.Aberdeen were denied by a superb save from Clark in injury time when Ferguson#s powerful  yard free kick took a defection off the defensive wall but the keeper did brilliantly to adjust and save to secure a deserved point for St Johnstone.ABERDEEN: Lewis, Vyner, Devlin, Considine, Leigh, Ojo, Ferguson, Bryson, McGinn, Hedges, Cosgrove.Subs: Gallagher , McLennan , Wilson Subs not used: Cerny, Logan,  Anderson, Main.ST JOHNSTONE:  Clark, Ralston, Kerr, Gordon, Tanser, O’Halloran, McCann, Davidson, Holt, Kennedy, May.Subs: Wright , Hendry , Kennedy Subs not used:  Parish, Vihmann,  Duffy, Swanson.Referee: Steven McLean"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.43843109-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.43843109-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.43843109-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.43843109-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"aberdeen pupils asked to pick items for new time capsule","story":"Aberdeen school pupils are being invited to choose items that will be placed in a time capsule.Aberdeen Science Centre will bury the capsule in the structure of its building which is currently undergoing a major refurbishment.The centre launched a competition, open until next week, asking pupils to come forward with suggestions as to what items will be included.All the suggested items will be put to a public vote and the most popular will be placed inside.

Congratulations to the committee, helpers, exhibitors, sponsors and everyone  involved on another cracking day out."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor august 16 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,I would like to record my thanks to everyone who contributed to the running of the Mid Argyll Show this year.It is great for visitors to see these traditions and talent brought together and seeing young people participating in events assuring that these customs are in safe hands for the future.Thank you again to all involved in running the show.Councillor Anne HornSir,I read with some interest that a new dentist was coming to town in Lochgilphead to set up a practice, which I am sure we look forward to.The local NHS trust cannot seem to lure one to the area to work at the Mid Argyll Hospital practice, which I think is unfortunate for all concerned. We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives. There is also support for parents and carers.At SDS centres customers can get information, advice and guidance about jobs, the local labour market, training courses and apprenticeships as well as how to prepare for interviews and help with CVs and applications.The work of SDS careers advisers in schools and centres is supported by Scotland’s careers website myworldofwork, where you can access advice  hours a day. It is packed with career information, advice and tools such as the CV builder. There is also a dedicated exam results section.Details of the local SDS centres are available at myworldofwork centres and information about events and opportunities is also available on Facebook.Pauline Graham, Project Manager for the SDS Exam Results HelplineSir,I had a great time at this year#s Islay Show. It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 16 2019","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Colin MacInnes captured this photo of these two fluffy cygnets at the Corran Burn in Lochgilphead back in July.A couple of adult swans were spotted floating nearby at the time on Loch Fyne and Loch Gilp around Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"an album with atmosphere and depth","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowExtract of an album review by Marc HigginsThis striking album is a collaboration between singer songwriter Sheila K Cameron and John Saich and Mags Russell of Argyll#s Wild Biscuit productions.In  they collaborated on an album called More Like a River than a Road. These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll course draws skippers and compliments","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Radio Sailing put its toe in the water last Saturday when skippers arrived with their model radio controlled yachts from the club#s first competition.Several Scottish clubs # Ayr Bay Radio Yacht Club, Greenock, Rhu and Paisley # travelled to Mid Argyll joined by others from as far afield as the Preston area.A total of  yachts raced each other around the club#s Loch a Bahrain course near Cairnbaan.A steady wind from the south produced some exciting close encounters results and near misses.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

With the world championship they also secured the Champion of Champions accolade for the fourth year in a row.The band#s success has been remarkable since being formed with Inveraray  youngsters just  years ago by current leaders Pipe Major Stuart Liddell and lead drummer Steven McWhirter. The band rose rapidly through the ranks, winning the world title, and many others besides, at every grade in which it competed.Inveraray is now established as the Grade  band to beat and players are attracted from around the world # but regardless of its international make-up, Inveraray still lies at its heart.That fact was clearly in evidence as the reception was crowned by a magical performance by the world champions, enjoyed by all and captured for posterity on the many mobile phones raised to the heavens.Speaking as he presented the quaich, Councillor MacMillan congratulated the band on its success, achieved in a relatively short period of time thanks to the dedication of all concerned.Argyll and Bute MP Brenan O#Hara said the band#s success has been #absolutely remarkable# and quipped that Inveraray#s success had turned him into a #born-again piper#, so inspired has he been.Pipe Major Stuart Liddell, Inveraray born and bred and from a line of superb pipers, said: #I want to thank all band members for their hard work over the past several years, and of course their families who have put up with so much and made sacrices for it to happen # particularly those with young families. It is greatly appreciated.#He added: #Thanks to the town of Inveraray and everyone  who has supported us. We couldn#t have done it without you.#And it was on to a selection of brilliant tunes to entertain the adoring fans clustered around the green.Speaking after the event, Inveraray Community Council convenor Linda Divers said: #Thanks to everyone who came out to show their support to Inveraray and District Pipe Band, and to Councillor Donnie MacMillan for coming along tonight.#The community council would like to thank all helpers as well as the British Legion and the band for the use of their tents.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Last weekend, we were fortunate to be invited to an orchard in East Lothian to pick some apples.As we entered Lewis stopped for a moment and said ldquoWow.He has seen apples growing on trees before, but I think it was the sight of so many apple trees together all in fruit. It was a visual feast, even for me.And so we picked some apples, in the company of a friend who uses local fruits to make juices. Lewis just couldnrsquot decide which apple tree to pick from first. He wandered about in awe, eyeing the apples.There were many ieties in the orchard, but I sadly canrsquot remember all their names.ldquoI think Lewis is in paradise, I remarked as I watched him.ldquoWhatrsquos paradise  asked my nearly six-year-old inquisitive daughter Skye. I had to think about my answer.ldquoSome people say itrsquos a perfect place, but other people say itrsquos a perfect feeling.ldquoCan be both then, maybe at the same time Skye replied.I smiled and agreed. We both watched Lewis, as he wondered under the small trees, dancing with delight at the sight of so many delicious looking ripe apples.ldquoYea said Skye, ldquoLewis is definitely having paradykes.ldquoWe say in paradise I said, in a bit of a teachery tone.ldquoBut you can have it too insisted Skye ldquobecause itrsquos a happy feeling.How could I disagree  ldquoYoursquore right I smiled.ldquoThis one Lewis called out. The apple was just out of reach and so his sister ran up and carefully picked it for him, in the way she had been shown. Lewis studied the apple before eating, savouring the moment.He was indeed both in, and having, paradise.We collected a small basket full of apples of dferent ieties, and after giving our thanks we started our walk back to the car. As we meandered along the path Skye asked for a story about an apple.So I told the story of Johnny Appleseed. Then a riddle ldquoA wee roond hoose, sometimes red, sometimes green, the maist bent lum ye hae ersquoer seen. Nae windaes or doors tae open or slide, it has a secret, therersquos a star inside.The answer of course is an apple. The bent lumbeing the stalk, and the star being the seed core when the apple is cut horizontally through the middle.As we walked, I reflected on the symbolism of the apple, and how it has been used in folklore and legend. And of course there is the famous apple which fell on Newtonrsquos head.Well it probably didnrsquot really fall on his head, as that seems a later embellishment, but for sure Newton himself often told the tale of the falling apple and the inspiration it gave him. He lived well into old age, and I think he understood the power of a story to convey the meaning of an event or idea.We approached our car and I took my sonrsquos hand to keep him safe as we crossed the road.ldquoDad he said looking up at me, ldquoyou are my walking apple.I laughed at the image and wondered what he meant. Was he referring to my rotund body shape perhaps ldquoWhy am I your walking apple  I asked him.ldquoCause I love apples and you are walking with me he said, with a sense of poetic meaning only a young child can convey.I was momentarily overwhelmed by this simple but moving comment. Lewis, aged only four, conveyed a powerful symbolism for apples that morning.The apple falling from the tree in front of Isaac Newton was a symbol of scientic discovery. For my son, an apple is a symbol of love. And my son loves the apples he eats, and the ones which walk with him.

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-39-s-tales-magic-real-39-s-around-us","story":"Of course, in stories magic is very real a frog or beast can transform into a prince, dragons and witches can fly, animals can talk, wishes can be granted by faeries and spells cast by wizards.

Itrsquos just that we have stopped noticing the magic that is real.In our world, a frog may not turn into a prince with a kiss, but a caterpillar turns into a butterfly, a tadpole into a frog.And such magic is all around us. Leaves change colour with the seasons, magic transformation is everywhere. Animals do talk, any dog lover will tell us that.Have you ever seen a hare and made eye contact and felt the connection or watched a squirrel hide nuts, and then come up to you asking for more Walk in a wood, or by a riverbank, or just sit in your garden or a park and the magic is all around you. We watched wood pigeons nest in a small elder tree outside our front window over the summer. Two eggs hatched and we watched as they were fed and finally flew the nest. It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it. And when we donrsquot care about it we donrsquot protect or value it.And when we donrsquot value it, we canrsquot feel the wonder and sense of awe it creates. And so we trash it, ignore and neglect it, exploit it. And we forget we are part of this magic that we are sons and daughters of nature too. And so we disconnect ourselves from what can truly make us feel happy, and instead drug ourselves with the articial magic of our own technology which makes us feel all powerful.But the truth is we are not.Ultimately we rely on the natural environment for our physical and emotional well-being, as much as the creatures we are making extinct.We need nature, it doesnrsquot need us, and eventually it is in control. Asto make this point huge waves hit the rocks of Prestonpans in a storm not so long ago, drenching the nearby houses in a display of naturersquos power. It was scary but also spectacular.In  such a storm was believed to have been the result of magic conjured by the ldquoNorth Berwick Witches.That storm, like the recent one, was indeed magic, conjured by nature, which can whip up a whirlwind more effectively than any wizard or witch.Magic is real.

The organ was out of action for two years while all the conservation work at St Michaelrsquos was being done but has been played again since mid-July.During this time a digital organ, linked to the kirkrsquos sound system, was used as a temporary measure.Restoration work to the Lewis organ, which is situated in the church sanctuary, included some leathering work to the bellows and electrical and mechanical repairs carried out including replacement of the old electrical transformer unit.The instrument was originally made by Lewis and Company, founded by Thomas Christopher Lewis , one of the leading organ builders of late th century Britain.Mr Shaw said further restoration of the organ would be carried out in the futurefunding was obtained.

The locals know the neighbourhood as J.P. As to its name, one theory, according to the local TV station WBZ-TV, is that it came about because local people benefited from the Triangle trade of sugar, rum and slaves.The Haven is owned by Jason Waddleton, . He attended school in Stonehaven, then went to Glasgow University. His kitchen career had begun in Stonehavens Tolbooth restaurant in Glasgow he worked in Blackfriars, in the Merchant City, and Jinty McGintys, on Ashton Lane. He moved to Boston in , was named Best Bartender in Boston , and started The Haven in , naming it after the Stonehaven fish and chip shop that created the Deep Fried Mars Bar.The idea behind the new operation was, he says, to bring authentic Scottish cuisine to the United States. \"We make our own haggis, black pudding and Lorne sausage, and we serve tattie scones, Scotch eggs, bridies, oatcakes instead of bread we serve haddock for fish and chips. We do cranachan ndash and, of course, deep-fried Mars bars.\"Funny thing, the haggis. Before opening The Haven, he was asked repeatedly, \"Youre not going to sell haggis, are you \" And suddenly he knew that, yes, he had to serve it. \"Because people have a strong opinion about it,\" he told the Eater Boston food magazine a couple of years ago. \"Theres this interplay over a dish, which is hilarious. I dont know many dishes that can create that level of interest or harmony or disharmony at the same moment.\"\"We serve exclusively Scottish beer,\" he tells us. \"Last year we were the biggest seller of Belhaven in the US. Harviestoun, Orkney Brewery, Thistly Cross Cider, Traquair House and Innis and Gunn all feature on the menu as well as Tennents.\" Whisky  \"Only single malt,\" he says firmly. \"No bourbon, rye or Irish whiskey. No rum or vodka. We do sell Scottish gins, though: Rock Rose, Edinburgh Gin, Caorunn, Hendricks.\"In common with many bars, The Haven stages regular events, including some with local purveyors. The Spurs-Newcastle English Premier game was screened recently. It partners with the Scotch Malt Whisky Society for monthly Scotch nights. Its annual Burns Night runs to five nights a week. Waddleton says his pub was integral to the upcoming moving of the Burns Statue to its original location in the Fenway area after being in the wrong place for  years. ldquoAt Hogmanay in  and  we replicated the famed Stonehaven Hogmanay fireballs ndash on a much smaller scale, of course ndash to local fascination and it become the first time the Fireballs were displayed outside Scotland.\"He remembers the crowds that surged into The Haven on the night of Scotlands independence referendum, to watch the unfolding coverage on television when the bar became the \"de facto media centre for US TV coverage\".What are the joys and challenges of running a busy pub in a city like Boston  \"I love the hustle and bustle where every day is dferent and there are always new challenges and another event just round the corner,\" he says. \"Being in a tourist-centric city like Boston affords the opportunity to meet people from all over the world throughout the year whilst keeping a connection to home.\"The Haven, it turns out, is a home-from-home for touring Scottish musicians when they play in Boston.

As it says on its website, it brings the \"true essence of pub culture\" to the Windy City. Its pedigree is illustrated by the fact that it holds a certicate, awarded by Whisky Magazine, as A Great Whisky Bar of the World.Theres an unmistakeable Scottish flavour to its extensive menu: Christine MacLeods smoked mackerel patetattie skins, a Robert the Bruce burger, the James Watt sandwich, Hebridean leek pie.The pub, on North Clark Street, is run by Colin Cameron, who was born and raised in Broughty Ferry. \"I was a police officer in Forfar, leaving in  after becoming disillusioned after seeing so many of my friends growing moustaches and buying Ford Fiestas ndash not that theres anything wrong with either, but I was looking for something dferent,\" Cameron says.\"I came to Chicago to visit a cousin who was living here and after a few months of vacation we were talking and decided Chicago needed a Scottish pub. He owned a building that had an old closed restaurant space that had been proving dficult to rent and we decided to give it a go. Our joint restaurant experience was I worked for a couple of months as a bartender in the railway workers social club in Dundee before I joined the police.\"He spent the next two months repurposing the space to resemble what he and his cousin thought a pub should be. It was all done on a shoestring budget, using the equipment from the closed restaurant, and antique furniture. Most of the antiques, it turns out, came from Loves Auctions in Perth.\"We finally opened the doors in July of  on a wing and a prayer. I stumbled along learning lessons every day and gradually turned the Duke of Perth into a thriving business. We concentrated on having the best Scottish beer and whisky we could get our hands on.\"Very few people had any knowledge of single malt at this time but we went out and procured every malt we could get our hands on starting with about a dozen which gradually grew to over . We also started selling McEwanrsquos export, which we were able to get in draught.\"At this time there were no micro-brews available and most beer sold in the States was American-style lagers. We found ourselves in a great situation with great products we were passionate about. Very quickly we became McEwanrsquos number one seller in the States ndash we might have been one of only a few places selling it, though.\"We also set out wanting to have good-quality, home-made comfort food. We decided to have a few traditional pub items like fish and chips and shepherdrsquos pie but also to have the American staples like first-class burgers that we gave names to, such as the Sean Connery burger ndash broiled, not shhhhtirrred.\"After a few months we decided to Americanise our fish and chips by making it All You Can Eat, which really started things moving for us. After a few years McEwanrsquos became unavailable in Chicago but Belhaven stepped in, filling the void.\"The Duke of Perth has just marked its th anniversary and is now one of the older establishments in the city.It has been a \"wonderful\" experience, reflects Cameron. \"Over the years Ive tried to do what feels right, putting the essence of the pub before short-term commercial gratication. The most obvious example of this is the absence of televisions: we lose considerable business when the sports teams are playing but our customers over the years love that you actually can have a conversation without your attention being constantly dragged away.\"Our customer base has been primarily neighbourhood with the occasional Scottish or UK visitor. The Scottish UK expats I know in the States all share a common trait in that they truly assimilate with the American culture. They donrsquot tend to flock together, trying to create a home from home.

It has already secured some Scottish Government funding to convert some of its snow-clearers in to dual-fuel hydrogen power. Its aim  N t just to make its own services green but to seed a market so commercial operators can change too. In the long run electric vehicles have lower running costs, experts believe. But they are more expensive to buy than their diesel equivalents. At least for now.Such initiatives will take municipal leadership. And municipal cash.The council has set up a working group to trash out how it gets to zero net carbon. Its recommendations are still under consideration. One is for climate bonds. That means the up-front costs of things like new vehicles could be spread out over years.In its report, the group said it ldquoheard of action by other cities to develop municipal climate bonds in order to fund low carbon developments.ldquoWe commend this model and think the city should explore its potential application to Glasgow.ldquoWe recommend that the cityrsquos partners work together to develop business cases for low carbon energy and transport investments through examination of alternative financing models, including the use of municipal climate bonds.The city councilrsquos buildings, vehicles and services only account for around % of CO emissions. So its efforts to reduce carbon output are often designed as a laboratory of good practice.This includes efforts to improve its own premises. Here too there are capital costs that can lead to revenue savings.

The report suggests problems in the ventilation system in other parts of the hospitals.A report by Health Protection Scotland was also passed to The Herald on Sunday, expressing concerns about plans to address problems with bone marrow transplant units, and minutes of a meeting with health chiefs about issues with the childrenrsquos bone marrow units just months after they opened.Today we can reveal the contents of the documents for the first time.WardsBoth the cancer ward in the RHC and the adult bone marrow transplant ward at the QEUH are described as having not been built for their purpose.Private contractor Innovated Design Solutions concluded in its investigation into ward A: ldquoWe anticipate the original accommodation design was not intended for use by patients with immune response impairment deficiency. On the contrary, the existing ventilation strategy would appear only likely to promote the risks associated with uncontrolled ingress of infectious aerosols into patient areas.On the adult bone marrow unit, Health Protection Scotland reports from October  state: ldquoThe decision to transfer the care of bone marrow transplant patients from the Beatson oncology unit to the QEUH was made in June . Construction of the QEUH was well established at this point and therefore the new unit was not purpose built.VentilationThe size of the device which takes air in and out of the hospital was selected incorrectly, according to the Innovated Design Solutions report. The document explains that the devices are only able to take in % of the air needed when filters inside the ventilation system are clean. As soon as filters start to get dirty, the amount of air the system can take in falls, reducing the number of times air can be circulated through the hospital. The report indicates the devices would need to be able to take in % of the air required to account for dirty filters.The report explains: ldquoAir handling units [AHUs] fans were not sized or selected to afford a spare % capacity, as suggested by record documentation.ldquoWhilst technical literature would suggest there is % capacity available in AHUs, the manufacturer has advised that fans motors were selected based on % duty with clean air filters .ldquoWe would emphasise the probability of these issues inadequacies being applicable to other air handling equipment installed within the AC [adult and childrenrsquos] hospital.The number of times air is circulated around wards is vital to patient safety. Patients with severely restricted immune systems should be in rooms with  air changes per hour, while people with more robust immune systems should have six air changes per hour. The ventilation report reveals that there were only three air changes per hour in the childrenrsquos cancer ward, describing this as ldquosignicantly lower than would normally be expected.The report states: ldquoIt should also be noted that current air change rates are not in accordance with recommendations defined within either [Scottish or UK guidelines on hospital ventilation].ldquoWhilst we were unable to locate documentation defining system design criteria, [UK guidelines on hospital ventilation] were available in . If there was an agreed deviation from recommendations defined within guidance documents, available at the time of design, we would expect this to be claried within the Health and Safety File documentation.Energy-saving devicesThermal wheels, which help to capture heat and save energy from ventilation systems, are common in large buildings but scientists have begun questioning their use in hospitals as they carry a risk of contamination. The devices are widely used in both the QEUH and RHC, as well as in the nearby Imaging Centre for Excellence and the learning and teaching facility on the campus.Investigators said they ldquoConsider this to identy a potential risk associated with cross-contamination and added: ldquoWe recommend this be further investigated and level of associated risk considered against the use of facilities. We anticipate the majority of AHUs installed within the building are also equipped with thermal wheels ie Critical Care, General Theatres, Theatre Recovery, Endoscopy, Ultra CT Suite, Nuclear Medicine. Again, we recommend this be further investigated.Record keepingSeveral anomalies were picked up by investigators at the private consultancy firm in terms of the records held for the RHC. During their investigations into ward A, they found ldquoevident anomalies with records such as those for the size of air handling units which did not match those installed.They said there was no record about why the number of air changes in the bedrooms was lower than the required amount and added: ldquoWe were unable to locate any detailshellip pertaining to an agreed deviation from recommended guidance.The device which supplies air into bedrooms was also noted as being incorrect in the records, with investigators finding the devices were ldquoincorrectly identied within record documentation, albeit ality is very similar. The sizes of pipes which carry air into the hospital were recorded dferently on two separate drawings ndash one stated they were xmm and another said they were xmm.Drawings of ventilation systems on other floors were also found to be inaccurate.Bone marrow unitsNHS Greater Glasgow and Clydemedical director Jenner Armstrong, Grant Archibald, the then-head of acute services, and Billy Hunter, head of facilities, as well as five other senior colleagues held a meeting in September  to discuss apparent problems with the childrenrsquos bone marrow transplant suites.The minutes of this meeting state they ldquoacknowledged clinical frustration about progress and the need to plan for patients currently waiting transplant.They also state that ldquotwo suites have been sealedto avoid air penetration from a source outwith the air handling unit and add ldquoBrookfield [contractor] could retrofit air handling unit modications hellip at an approximate cost of poundk per room.NHSGGC confirmed that upgrades were made to four of the suites, which had been used for bone marrow transplant patients, while four of the other suites were used to accommodate other children with cancer and were not upgraded.Health Protection Scotland documents raise concerns about plans to fix the adult bone marrow transplant suites in the QEUH, which had been emptied of patients several months after the hospital opened.The document states: ldquoThe decision to transfer the care of bone marrow transplant patients from the Beatson oncology unit to the QEUH was made in June . Construction of the QEUH was well established at this point and therefore the new unit was not purpose built.ldquoWhilst NHSGGC has continued to work towards recommendations, it is noted that the solution proposed does not meet guidance, nor does it seek to address all the recommendations hellip As a result, HFS cannot comment on the effectiveness of the measures intended to be put in place.Bone marrow transplant patients have now ed to the QEUH, following work undertaken in , according to NHSGGC.Experts opinionChristopher Shaw, director of the Medical Architecture design practice, said: ldquoThese are new buildings and there are errors. How it happened is a consequence of the complexity and unique nature of the projects and the mismatch of control systems to those projects.ldquoIn a building of this type there are hundreds of thousands of components. These are brought together by specication, design and construction through tens of thousands of controlling documents and databases. Itrsquos then assembled through thousands of contracts and warranties.ldquoItrsquos a one-off product. The complexity should be mitigated by guidance and standards. Those can be managed and maintained where there is a rolling programme of projects to recycle knowledge from mistakes and introduce evolutionary improvements.ldquoHowever, change in the procurement process has pushed lsquoriskrsquo to the contractor and since the banking crisis there has been a broken pipeline of work. Both of these have undermined that status and effectiveness of performance specication.Shaw added that while he was not an engineer, and had no in-depth knowledge of the Glasgow hospitals specically, he believed ldquothe issues identied are likely to be generic and occur where.He added: ldquoThey are undoubtedly serious and, in the case of an oncology unit, I would say critical. These faults will need to be corrected."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-labour-leader-richard-leonard-quizzed-plan-help-dump-labour-msps","story":"Leonard was quizzed by colleagues last week over fears he wants to give thousands of trade unionists a vote in the selection of candidates for Holyrood, a move which would likely tilt his party to the Left.It is understood he was non committal when pushed, with one party source saying this change would create a ldquohuge rt.Leonard, a left wing ally of Jeremy Corbyn, has struggled to assert his authority on his MSPs, a majority of whom backed moderate Anas Sarwar in the  contest.Opinion polls also show that Labour stands to lose many of their MSPs at the next election, a prospect that will lead to a scramble for prized slots on the eight regional lists the party depends on.The internal election to decide who tops each list is crucial and Leonardrsquos allies are determined left wingers will get the best places.In past contests, Scottish Labour members have ranked the candidates, but two changes have been discussed internally by left-wingers.One is for the partyrsquos governing body, not members, to appoint candidates, a plan that is unlikely to pass as it deemed to be extreme.The second idea is to expand the franchise so that a tier of ldquoaffiliated supporters - trade unionists who back Labour - also get a vote.Supporters can vote in leadership contests, but not candidate selections, and their inclusion could be problematic for moderate MSPs who are sceptical of Leonard and Corbyn.At the last Scottish Labour leadership contest, .% of the , affiliated supporters who took part in the ballot supported Leonard. If the contest had been restricted to party members, the result would have been much tighter.It is understood that ldquolist selections were on the agenda for the MSP group meeting last week and Leonard was asked about extending the franchise to trade union supporters.Leonard is said to have ruled nothing in or out, which his critics have interpreted as him trying to buy time ahead of a final decision next year.Such a move would likely give Labourrsquos biggest affiliated trade union, Unite, a huge say in candidate selections.The bulk of supporters who were recruited during the  contest were from Unite and the , amounted to around % of all voters.Asked earlier this year about the idea of trade union supporters having a vote in List selections, Leonard told this newspaper:ldquoI donrsquot anticipate having US-style primaries for the selection of candidates for the Scottish Labour party.Scottish Tory chief whip Maurice Golden said: ldquoRichard Leonard has scared off voters and alienated party members.

But he was downbeat. I asked why and his response still lingers: ldquoThis is the beginning, not the end.And so it has proven.

On both occasions, the same voters did not flinch from rejecting a political union and poking an old order in the eye.While the Yes campaign was in no way comparable to the malevolence of many elements of Vote Leave, the indyref also showcased the nastier side of politics ... on both sides. The media, particularly the BBC, was baited by an unsavoury minority, political opponents were intimidated on the street, and social media was often a cesspit.But the indyref was also a le-affirming experience for many Scots. An .% turnout ndash the highest of any referendum in UK history ndash was astonishing. Tens of thousands of people who had never shown an interest in politics were now switched on. Scotland has one of the most politically engaged citizenries in the world.Although independence and Brexit are fuelled by nationalism, one key dference separates both causes. Support for leaving the EU is disproportionately backed by the -plus age group, and opposed by the younger generation. Independence is hugely popular among the socially liberal --year-olds and resisted by older, wealthier voters. The demographics are not the same.A political realignment was the inevitable consequence of the referendum, with the SNP reaping the rewards. Independence used to be a niche interest for % of voters, but it became the main iding line in Scottish politics. Your view on the constitution now often determined your vote in elections.The SNP was on the losing side on September , but the Nationalists quickly became the main winner. Party membership shot up to , and they won an incredible  seats at the  general election. It was a sign of the SNPrsquos dominance that falling back to  seats two years later was portrayed as a failure.:Willie Rennie: Indyref should be blocked eventhe SNP Greens win Holyrood electionThe indyref, paradoxically, was also good for the Scottish Tories, who over the previous two decades had secured the patent of irrelevant also-rans. Just as the plebiscite served as a political awakening for nationalists, so too did it lead to a revival in unionism. The threat of independence is the Scottish Toriesrsquo political meal ticket.Scottish Labour, already in decline prior to the indyref, were the main losers from the campaign. The conventional narrative is that Labourrsquos participation in Better Together, alongside the Tories, hurt them electorally, but this is a flimsy argument.If Labour had campaigned separately for a No vote, the Yes sidersquos lethal \"red Tory\" insult would simply have been adapted. The indyref was always going to be a disaster for Labour. Once a lion, the party is now a mouse.The main lesson from  was confirmation,it was needed, that a referendum does not resolve binary constitutional issues. The  vote on joining the European Communities fuelled a bitter, -year debate. The devolution referendum in  led to an endless debate on Holyroodrsquos powers. The same is true of the indyref and the Brexit melodrama.And therein lies a challenge for Nicola Sturgeon. A second independence referendum looks likely and the bookies are predicting a Yes vote, but the First Minister should be mindful of the state of Scotland after another referendum and the effect a Yes vote would have.The stakes are much higher for the Unionist side. A Yes vote would never be overturned there would be no re-run five years later. Hundreds of thousands of voters would feel like the UK had been broken up, and that their identity had been shattered.It would be the heartbreak of a letime for these people.

However, what makes this yearrsquos descent from the Arctic a little out of the ordinary, is that there is currently roughly seven times the number than would normally be expected for this time of year.The geese are on the move early and in signicantly greater numbers, the rowan trees are heaving with plump red berries, and therersquos a definite fading of colour from the ash, beech and oaks.All of this and yet it seems only moments since social media was packed with pictures of children ing to school, while that lsquoblink and yoursquove missed itrsquo weekend of August sun just three weeks ago is starting to feel like it never happened.Of course, we just have to check the calendar to know that winter is heading our way. But could all those geese be trying to tell us something about what may lie ahead And should we be paying more heed to nature and the folklore of the past to find out whether this winter will strike earlier, hit harder and be even more bitter In the lush green surroundings of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, botanist Dr Gregory Kenicer agrees there has been a slightly early change in the colour of the leaves on the trees and a vibrant burst of berries on some bushes, but that is likely to be more a sign of seasons past than those to come.ldquoThe colour of the trees may be turning just a tad early, but plants respond to changes in climate in dferent ways.ldquoAnd as far as I know, we donrsquot have any psychic plants, he adds.ldquoThe classic lsquoold wivesrsquo talersquo is the one about rowan berries ndashthe rowan berries are out in force early, then a hard winter is on the way.ldquoItrsquos true that there are a lot more berries around at the moment, but that is more to do with the year that has past rather than what is happening in the future.ldquoThe rowan tree needs a bit of sun to get fruits prepared, and this year there was some early sun that resulted in lots of flowers being produced.ldquoAs long as you donrsquot get big storms or a very dry spell over summer, the berries from the flowers will survive and grow.The rowan treersquos links with one of our most familiar winter predictions are rooted in druid and pagan ritual. Known as the witch tree or wicken tree, in some areas once forbade the use of its timber, leaves, bark or flower except for sacred purposes, while it has been associated with healing and as a protection against evil spirits.But perhaps a better indicator of the weather to come could lie by the seashore  Long ribbon-like fronds of sugar kelp were once hung outside to dry and used to predict the weather ndashit stayed dry, the weather would be fine,it softened and became limp, rain was on the way.It was so trusted, that it became known as Poor Manrsquos Weather Glass. However, Dr Kenicer suggests there is little science to back up the folklore.ldquoAny time we have looked at it not surprisingly wersquove found that when itrsquos raining itrsquos wet and when itrsquos dry, the weather is dry. Which is exactly what yoursquod expect.ldquoIt might predict slight changes in humidity, but yoursquod probably be better just looking at the sky and carrying an umbrella.He believes much of folklorersquos weather sayings linked to plants and trees are rooted in hopes and fears for crops and livestock, rather than serious scientic fact.ldquoWhether itrsquos dry or hot or wet within every plant there is a strategy to deal with the weather, he adds.Even the autumn glory of dazzling coloured leaves has been suggested as an indicator of a harsh winter ahead ndash the more vibrant the colour is said to be a sign to batten down the hatches.But rather than foretelling dramatic events Dr Kenicer says there is a less mystical reason for the colours.ldquoThe green pigment in leaves break down dferently depending on the tree, and the chemicals present in the leaf. The green is there to capture sunlight, but there are other chemicals that can act like anti freeze or to deter insects.ldquoItrsquos those colours that emerge, rather than it being linked to what might happen in the future.Meanwhile, in Montrose, around  pink-footed geese are settling in nicely, but even their arrival may be more to do with events where than what may be heading our way.A blast of bad weather in Iceland is thought to have pushed the birds further south earlier than normal, with the first flock making their descent as the calendar turned to September.That compares to three years ago when the first pink-footed geese delayed their arrival until mid-September, and even this time last year when there were just  in the basin.Eventually, they will continue their migration to Morecombe Bay and The Wash, with numbers falling to just a few thousands in December and January.Rory Syme, Scottish Wildle Trust, says: ldquoThere are currently about , pink-footed geese gathered at our Montrose Basin Wildle Reserve.ldquoDuring a full moon they can travel through the night so numbers could rise quickly over the next few days.ldquoWe would only expect to see a few hundred at this point in the season, but cold and wet weather in Iceland seems to have pushed some birds south sooner than usual.ldquoMost of the geese at Montrose are stopping to refuel for a few days before heading further south. Itrsquos too early to say what will happen with their numbers this year.ldquoHowever, a quick start to the season may mean we donrsquot see the big peaks of up to , birds that wersquove had in recent years.At the Met Office, where sensible science takes precedence over nut-hoarding squirrels or the number of spiders in our homes ndash even modern technology canrsquot predict the future terribly far in advance.ldquoThere is some truth in the lsquored sky at night, shepherdrsquos delightrsquo saying, admits meteorologist Greg Dewhurst, ldquoand a lot of these old sayings have some sort of method behind the madness.ldquoBut we generally only forecast general weather trends  days ahead.Tie pieceOld wivesrsquo tales, folklore or fact  Could nature be telling us something we need to know Flowering ivy in autumn is said to indicate the weather to come ndash lots of yellow-green flowers attracting dozens of insects has been linked to the onset of a cold snap.Late falling leaves and berry-laden holly and rowan trees are said to be another sign, along with thick shells on acorns, brighter autumn foliage and higher than usual activity among nut-gathering squirrels.Check the family pets for signs of a thickening of their fur ndash apparently another sign of falling temperatures, along with high numbers of spiders.Early bird migration is said to signy a particularly harsh season ahead, while a warmer than normal November could also be a warning sign for a bad winter."},{"url":null,"title":"fifty-years-ago-struck-first-north-sea-oil-now-time-turn-tap-off","story":"Itrsquos now half a century since that eureka moment and around  billion barrels of oil equivalent have been extracted from the North Sea. Though the Arbroath field was considered too small to warrant development at that time, it wouldnrsquot be long before a vast reservoir of crude oil was struck in , the Forties field, and our time as a signicant oil-producing nation had come.ldquoIts Scotlands oil soon became the slogan of the Scottish National Party. Oil and who we were, as well as how we lived, became entwined. We were still some way from learning that our black gold came with an atmospheric side-effect, though, as it happens, in , The Stanford Research Institute presented a report to the American Petroleum Institute that warned the release of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels could carry harmful consequences for the planet.There has been a lot of good news stories lately from the world of North Sea oil. Last year BP opened Clair Ridge, targeting, it said, ldquo million barrels of recoverable resource. In August, Equinor began extracting oil from the Mariner field,  miles east of Shetland, which is expected to yield  million barrels of heavy crude oil.Drilling activity is increasing following record-low levels in recent years. The Oil and Gas Authority has increased central production projection out to  so that it is ldquonow . billion barrels higher than it was in . There is talk that another  billion barrels could remain, to be exploited, in the UK Continental Shelf.Nevertheless a dark cloud ndash the climate crisis ndash threatens. Every one of these barrels comes with a carbon emissions price tag. The big issue is, in an era of climate emergency, should we even be extracting it at all  Its no longer simply a question of how much more we can find, but how much we may need to leave in the ground. Can we continue to extract from the North Sea and yet still hit our targets of net zero by  in Scotland, or  in the UK Some believe we canrsquot. One of the big ideas being discussed by environmentalists is the need for a ldquomanaged phase-out ndash a plan for how we turn off the taps while making sure not only that we provide enough green energy, but that those with industry jobs are not left behind.Greg Muttitt, research director at climate and energy think-tank Oil Change International, is author of a report called Sea Change: Climate Emergency, Jobs And Managing The Phase-out Of UK Oil And Gas Extraction. He believes it is time to put a stop on further exploration and begin a retreat from oil.At an event this week in Edinburgh, he and co-author Anna Markova argued that those who once had jobs in the oil sector could be retrained with skills for the renewables sectors or in retrofitting homes. As many as , new jobs, they estimated, could be createdwe went fully renewable.But there are still few signs that politicians have an appetite for a deliberate retreat from oil and gas. Just over a week ago Nicola Sturgeon, asked whether she planned to ldquoturn off the taps, replied: \"Irsquom not going to do that because these are complex issues. What would happen is that we would have to have substituted imports of oil and gas, perhaps from countries, with a higher carbon density because there are less rigid regulations.Sturgeon is right that it is a complex issue. The industry provides , jobs across the UK. Energy security is crucial. According to UK Committee on Climate Change modellings, demand for oil and gas, even in , looks likely to remain fairly high. If predictions are accurate, given our reserves, the native UK oil industry would be able to provide only % of our fossil fuels, by comparison with the % it is now.So its not surprising that the oil industry still sees itself as having a huge role in the future. Deirdre Michie, chief executive of Oil and Gas UK which recently published its Roadmap To : A Blueprint For Net Zero, says: ldquoOur projections are consistent with the Climate Change Committee projections which show a continued need for oil and gas out to  as part of a erse energy mix.\"Itrsquos important we meet as much of that demand from domestic production, providing security of energy supply while retaining the skills and expertise of the sector to support the development of low-carbon technologies.Roadmap  appears to be the oil and gas industryrsquos pitching of themselves as the solution to climate change, rather than the problem ndash its argument for why the oil industry is who we need to sort it out while continuing to provide us with the stuff that is the prime source of emissions . The roadmap report frequently mentions \"maximising economic recovery\", a strategy that chiefly involves maxing out the reserves. Among its plans are to reduce the emissions associated with production of oil and gas and support and develop mitigation technologies.But in the years leading up to now, the oil sector has clearly been the problem rather than the solution. A  report by CDP found that the worldrsquos oil companies were spending a tiny fraction of their investment budgets on low-carbon projects ndash on aggregate just .% of their total  capital expenditure.A study by the International Institute for Sustainable Development found that, globally, coal, oil and gas were getting . times the subsidies renewables were, and estimated that just -% of those fossil fuel subsidies would pay for a global transition to clean energy.Oil and gas have been deemed among our greatest national assets for so long that itrsquos hard to let go of the idea that it isnrsquot best for the oil industry to extract as much as it can and make the most of it. That, after all, is essentially what the government has asked the industry to do in its Maximise Economic Recovery strategy.Yet, according to a  study in the scientic journal Nature, an estimated third of oil reserves, half of gas reserves and more than % of known coal reserves should remain unused in order to meet global temperature targets under the Paris Agreement.Of course, the  billion barrels still left in the UK Continental Shelf is a small fraction of the wider global reserves, which according to a  estimate were about . trillion barrels. We could say, they are not so signicant. But at the same time, our extracting every barrel we can sends out a message to the world. We are not leaving our third in the ground.If all countries were to follow our approach of phasing out coal while maximising oil and gas extraction, the Sea Change report says, \"resulting warming would signicantly exceed degC\". According to a  report in Nature Climate Change,we were, globally, to burn all global fossil fuels, we could be on a journey to a degC global temperature rise.Scotland may be otherwise well placed to tell a story about itself as a forward-thinking pioneer towards net zero, but others are being more bold than the UK on this issue ndash for instance New Zealands Jacinda Ardern, who last year announced a ban on all new offshore oil exploration permits. As Muttitt puts it: \"The elephant in the room is Scotlands policy to Maximise Economic Recovery of oil and gas. When the global climate summit comes to Glasgow next year, this contradiction could become an embarrassment.\"No one is looking for us to turn off the oil and gas tap today. What groups like Friends of the Earth Scotland are calling for is the establishing of an \"end date\". There is no avoiding the fact that a dramatic transition is necessary ndash the question is who will define it, and what its timeline will be.Who creates the story of climate emergency Scotland  The oil industry  The renewables sector  Civil society The taps are set to turn off at some point, evenit is in the worst case scenario of a climate crisis stricken world, in which we finally have taken the last economically viable barrel of oil from the ground. Better to fully grapple with the transition now, campaigners say, to start creating a new Scotland in which our economic and political future is not dependent on how much oil we can find and extract.Andwe do embrance that fossil fuel-free future, we might want to think about a new slogan for our times. Not, \"Its Scotlands oil\", but \"Its Scotlands carbon budget.\"The environmentalist roadmapFor many climate change campaigners, the bottom line is that every barrel of crude oil or equivalent gas, adds more carbon dioxide into our atmosphere.According to Greg Muttitt, , globally, all countries were only to use their already developed reserves, in the absence of any properly effective negative emissions technologies, that would set us on a course towards degC rise ndash and that, as last yearrsquos ominous IPCC . degC report described, brings a strong risk of climate disaster.However, the current plan in the UK is not just to stop at the six billion barrels there already is in developed fields. Itrsquos to find still more oil and gas, to pursue the  billion barrels they think are out there. This summer, the UK issued  new licences for exploration and production rights.Echoing Murtittrsquos call for a phased taps-off is Professor Kevin Anderson of the Tyndall Institute.ldquoThe UK, he says, ldquoshould rapidly put in place a phased shutdown of all fossil fuel production, to be completed by around . This needs to begin now and broadly be cutting output at something approaching-% each year. This matches the mitigation rate of the UKrsquos Paris-compliant emission pathway and carbon budget .Andersonrsquos figures dfer from those of the UK Committee on Climate Change in that, unlike theirs, his do not rely ldquoon planetary-scale negative emission technologies, which he believes have shown insufficient promise. They also factor in a greater level of global fairness.Essentially the issue around how much oil we can afford to extract boils down to a number of dferent debates. Among them is the question of how much of the global pie of carbon budget that Scotland, an already developed country, should in all fairness get. Another is what proportion of emissions can be mitigated through carbon capture or negative emissions technologies ndash some say that we are putting too many hopes on this yet to be perfected technology given there are only  working carbon capture projects in the world.Our relationship to oil is indeed complex. Beyond our need for it in our cars, homes, aeroplanes and other aspects, we remain wedded to oil and gas because of what  it brings us, or we believe it brings us. Taxes for instance ndash though we might want to look what fiscal benefits the UK is really getting from oil. In the tax years - and -, the Treasury gave more money to oil companies than it took from them in taxes, although in that time BP and ExxonMobil made more than pound billion in profits.Then there are the jobs the oil industry has provided. Thinking about turning off the taps means also thinking about how we ensure employment for all in the sector.Mary Church, campaign director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, which published the Sea Change report, describes a so-called Just Transition as a process that would involve all the relevant stakeholders, particularly the workers and communities. If we dont commit to this, she says, we \"face a deeply damaging deferred collapse of the oil and gas sector, that will hurt workers and communities the most, as the reality of the climate crisis hits home and forces a shutdown.Jobs on tapComment by Anna Markova, Sea Change report author:We know that tackling the climate emergency means quickly scaling back the amount of oil, gas and coal that we take out of the ground and burn. This means oil-extracting countries have a choice:bull Option A: start scaling back the drilling now, in a gradual way, with time to build up alternative industries and take care of the communities that depend on oil now.bull Option B: wait until later and face a much quicker, chaotic shutdown. I know which option Irsquod choose, but what does it look like Scotlandrsquos potential for concentrating clean energy industries is huge: an estimated  gigawatts viable fixed offshore wind resource , and even bigger potential for floating offshore windfarms , not to mention pioneering centres for tidal and wave energy.And offshore renewable energy is a viable pathway for firms and workers in the oil and gas supply chains. Many Scottish specialist scaffolding and construction firms as well as marine crews already work interchangeably on oil rigs and offshore windfarms.Other oil and gas supply companies will find applications in advanced water and waste treatment and innovative heat networks, according to research by Arup. Undoubtedly, workers and supply chain firms need support and guarantees to make the leap from old industries to new securely.Two big questions remain. First, can there be enough jobs in the clean energy economy We modelled how many jobs could be created over time in some of the most compatible clean energy industries ndash wind, wave, tidal and energy efficiency retrofits ndash in three possible futures.In the first future, neither the Scottish nor UK governments do anything  to help the industries grow. In this case, the number of jobs in wind energy is similar to the number of oil and gas workers potentially affected by the transition, but nowhere near enough to actually replace oil and gas employment.But in the second future,Scotland and the rest of the UK build as many new windfarms and tidal and wave energy generators as industry and politicians currently say is feasible, and retrofit their housing stock to boot, over three new clean energy jobs can be created per oil worker affected.And in the third, \"fully renewable\" future , job creation over time is even greater.So itrsquos perfectly possible to fully replace the economic contribution of the oil and gas industry by betting on renewable energy ndashgovernment does its job right."},{"url":null,"title":"friends-25th-anniversary-25-fact-much-loved-sitcom","story":" Initially Friends was going to be called Insomnia Cafe. It was inspired by the real-le friendship of creators Marta Kauffman and David Crane. The pair met as drama students and were part of a group of university friends they saw as a surrogate family. The pitch for the show was simple: ldquoItrsquos about friendship, because when yoursquore young and single in the city, your friends are your family. Crane and Kaufmann also wrote the theme song Irsquoll Be There For You. David Schwimmer was the only cast member to have a part written for him ndash but he turned it down. Schwimmerrsquos first love was theatre, and hersquod had a bad taste of Hollywood when he ended up waiting tables while trying to get a break on screen. Schwimmer was happily back in theatre when he was offered the role of Ross. Crane and Kauffman had met him in LA and been impressed. He refused. They persisted. Eventually he relented. Matthew Perry knew he had to play Chandler when actor friends started asking him to coach them to audition for the part. Perry had been to primary school with Justin Trudeau, and beat up the Canadian premier because he was jealous of his sporting talent. He was broke when he got the role ndash his hopes of becoming a professional tennis player dashed. Lisa Kudrow was on her way to becoming a successful scientist when the acting bug bit. Her TV career seemed to be taking off when she was cast as Roz in the series Frasier ndash but she was fired after four days, and left fearing her career was over. When she auditioned for Phoebe, Kudrow had to read for James Burrows ndash whorsquod directed Frasier. She thought shersquod no chance ndash but he thought she was perfect. Courtney Cox had an eclectic career before becoming Monica. Shersquod studied architecture, but with Stewart Copeland of The Police as a relative she ended up cast in Bruce Springsteenrsquos Dancing in the Dark video. In , she caused a stir when she said \"period\" for the first time on US TV in a Tampax advert. She later starred in Ace Venture Pet Detective, and a doomed sitcom called The Trouble with Larry ndash about a man captured by baboons on honeymoon. Matt LeBlanc auditioned for the role of Joey with a bloody nose and killer hangover. The night before, hersquod got drunk. Groggy in the morning, he tripped and smashed his face against a toilet. As Ky Miller, author of a new book about Friends called Irsquoll Be There for You, says: \"LeBlanc Joeyrsquod his way into stardom.\" The creators wanted Jenner Aniston to play Monica ndash but even though she was eventually cast as Rachel, the future of her role was in jeopardy. Shersquod already shot another sitcom called Muddling Through, and there was a risk Aniston would have to honour commitments, meaning another Rachel would have to be cast. Muddling Through was finally canned, freeing Aniston up. When filming started in  nobody liked LeBlanc. In reality, softly-spoken LeBlanc worried Joey was too boorish, but the actor was initially perceived as a swaggering macho man. Schwimmer said: ldquoI thought, lsquooh great, herersquos this guy Irsquom going to have to work with for maybe five years, and hersquos f**king Joe Cool Studrsquo. They all quickly became firm friends, however ndash just like the show. The cast hated working with Marcel ndash Rossrsquos pet monkey in the first two series. Played by a Capuchin called Katie, Marcel was retired and drted into TV obscurity. Oprah Winfrey was the first to raise the lack of black actors on Friends. In , in the first big interview with the cast, she said: ldquoIrsquod like for you all to get a black friend. The debate about the lack of ersity on the show continues ndash as do concerns about misogyny and fat-shaming. Homophobia also haunts Friends today. One campaigner edited together every \"gay joke\" in the show and it ran for  minutes. Many are offended by the writersrsquo treatment of Carol and Susan ndash Rossrsquos lesbian we and her partner. However, in an era when homophobia was endemic, others say that at least there were gay characters in the show ndash in most other series everyone was straight. Crane, whorsquos gay, and Kauffman based Carol and Susan on close friends. Friends had a huge cultural impact. It sparked a boom in coffee shops like Central Perk. But its biggest spin-off was The Rachel hairstyle. In Britain alone, some  million women got The Rachel cut at one time or another. Ky Miller says: ldquoGenerational theorists claimed it as the definitive series of Generation X. The show suffered a backlash when it began to cash in on success. In , Friends paired with Diet Coke in a m ad campaign. The ads became ubiquitous ndash and the cast pocketed cheques for up to ,. Over exposure saw ratings decline. One newspaper described it as \"The One Where the Show Crosses the Line from Promiscuity to Prostitution\". Friends had an incredible roll-call of guest stars. At least  big names appeared including George Clooney, Bruce Willis, Robin Williams, Brad Pitt, Winona Ryder, Reese Witherspoon, Sean Penn, Elle Macpherson, Sarah Ferguson, and Richard Branson. Although Ross and Rachelrsquos off-again-on-again love affair is remembered as the central storyline, in reality the pair were only a couple in % of the showrsquos  episodes across ten seasons. Friends was performed in front of a live studio audience anda joke didnrsquot work writers would rewrite on set. Producers even asked for a show of hands from the audience to seecertain jokes worked. This meant recordings took hours ndash often running until am, with sleepy audiences switched out mid-way. Producers initially wanted Liza Minnelli to play Chandlerrsquos transgender father ndash Helena Handbasket. Eventually, they hired Kathleen Turner ndash and played it for laughs, much to the disgust of trans campaigners today. The best that can be said is that in the Friends era, the rest of society was just as ignorant. September  helped Friends bounce back from a ratings slump. When Season Eight began on September , , it became the leading show on television. Season Eight also won Friends its first Emmy. Ky Miller says the quintessentially New York show ldquowas revived by the tens of millions who turned to it for comfort, distraction, escape, hope. Although Friends is set in Manhattan, writers decided not to mention September . Instead, the atrocity was only referenced visually ndash with US flags in Central Perk, or stars wearing sweatshirts commemorating New York firefighters. Producers had to reshoot an episode where Chandler jokes about bombs at an airport. By the final season, the cast were earning  million per episode making them among the highest-paid stars on TV. Theyrsquod started out on pound,. The cast had been able to make such sums not just because of the popularity of the show, but because ndash as friends ndash they negotiated together, never allowing executives to ide and conquer. Friends helped get Donald Trump elected. Friends was essential to NBC viewing figures. When channel boss Jeff Zucker realised the show was coming to an end he needed a replacement hit. Zucker went for a show called The Apprentice ndash credited with helping Trumprsquos rise to power. The final episode ndash The Last One ndash ended with the entire cast weeping. As filming began on January  , the stars were sitting on the famous orange couch in Central Perk. LeBlanc said: \"Do you realise this is the last coffee shop scene \" They all began crying and filming had to stop until theyrsquod calmed down. Amaani Lyle, who worked for Friends, claimed the writersrsquo room was a hotbed of racism and misogyny. She said writers fantasised about Joey raping Rachel, and referred to Kauffman as a \"c**t\". Lyle, whorsquos black, was fired but took out a harassment suit. She lost when a court found the writersrsquo behaviour reflected a ldquocreative workplace in a show dealing with sexual themes. Itrsquos unlikely but there might be reunion. Although Schwimmer says he doesnrsquot want to see the castldquowith crutches and walkers, therersquos been a spate of classic sitcom remakes, including Roseanne and Will  Grace, which has fuelled speculation that Friends may one day . As Jenner Aniston, who \"fantasises\" about a comeback, says: ldquoAnything is possible. I mean George Clooney got married. Friends is bigger today than it was in the s. Itrsquos the most-watched show on Netflix UK, beating The Crown and Stranger Things. Comedy Central UK paid a \"colossal\" figure to rerun the series. Back-to-back episodes go out daily, and ratings never falter. Friends continues to air in  countries. Therersquos been many homegrown rip-offs from Indiarsquos Hello Friends, to Spainrsquos  Vidas ndash the nationrsquos longest-running sitcom. Critics say its success is because itrsquos the ultimate in unthreatening entertainment \"comfort food\"."},{"url":null,"title":"zero-carbon-means-new-plan-scotland-39-s-cities","story":"What zero-carbon means for you: the new plan for Scotland#s citiesDelicious fresh produce from the Stroud Valleys Project allotment - get in touchltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt to find out more Why  Because under planning rules, this is the space builders must leave between two facing windows.The eighteen-metre standard means back gardens are often a standard nine meters long. It also means Scottish people, even those lucky enough to have front and back doors and a bit of space, do not have enough room to grow some fruit and vegetables.The climate emergency might just change the old rules. And, with them, the very look of our towns and suburbs and the green belts which surround them.That is because scientists believe that,we are serious about slashing greenhouse gases, we need to grow more of our food locally. And in towns and cities the only way iniduals and communities can plant more fruit and vegetables iscouncils make space for them to do so.Gardens. Allotments. Orchards. This is one of the front lines in the battle to mitigate against destructive global heating. It is where council planning rules meet a world imperative.Glasgow has ambitious plans to become the first city in the UK to get to zero-net carbon, when it takes out as much of the greenhouse gas from the atmosphere as it puts in.It has set up a working group to figure out how. One of the proposals, quietly published last month, is an overhaul of planning.New developments, said members of the working group, should always have local food at their heart. Housebuilders, in short, will have to show where their future customers will plant their greens. That  metres between windows, neatly ided by a fence or a hedge, just will not cut it.The working group report concluded: \"Emissions from livestock farming are a signicant element of greenhouse gas production.\"The global food production system also contributes to carbon emissions through transport and is itself highly vulnerable to future changes in climate. A healthier diet involves less consumption of processed foods and meat. A more resilient food system involves more locally sourced produce and a recognition of seasonality in that production. An approach which is informed by Fairtrade principles can also reflect our local responsibility to the development of a more sustainable and just global food system.\"The working group surveyed Glaswegians. They found more and more people want to grow their own food.According to an ancient rule of thumb, it takes \" poles\", in old Anglo-Saxon measures a plot of  meters by  metres, to feed a family of four. That is still the gold standard for a British allotment, evenmany do not reach such expanses. Less would still cut bills ndash and emissions ndash in season.The working group reported: \"There is clearly an opportunity to do better here and many of our survey respondents talked of the need to promote a plant-based diet as well as to provide more opportunities for local food growing.\"We recommend that the council and its partners publish a sustainable food strategy for the city within the next year and that the council considers making space for food growing a requirement of new housing developments.\"The councils ruling SNP administration is understood to be giving this recommendation serious thought. This will not just encourage bigger gardens in the lower-density areas. It will spur, insiders say, growing developments on gap and \"stalled sites\". And roof garden and aquaponic growing opportunities even in the most densely developed areas of the city centre.Last week The Herald revealed council officials were being urged to reforest golf courses whose future is in doubt. Such green spaces may also find they become community assets.Existing new rules mean local authorities across Scotland have to ask communities about places where they would like more gardens or allotments.The now semi-derelict Cowlairs Park ndash essentially disused football pitches in the north of the city ndash is one.Anna Richardson, Glasgows Convener for Sustainability and Carbon Reduction, said: ldquoOur food growing strategy is starting to take shape and council-owned sites where therersquos potential for food growing are beginning to be identied.ldquoFrom our engagement with communities so far, there appears to be a strong appetite for people to be able to grow their own food.ldquoAs part of the community empowerment process, it is the councilrsquos role to find ways to harness and facilitate the considerable ambition for growing food that already exists across the city.ldquoEnsuring Glasgow becomes a sustainable food city will help the city tackle the challenges of climate change, but also address issues of food poverty and general well-being.ldquoInitiatives such as the overall master plan for the largely disused Cowlairs Park in the north of the city point towards food growing being incorporated in major developments from the start.ldquoThe vision for Cowlairs is that gardens attached to homes are large enough for families to grow their own food while a communal garden would have facilities such as a shared tool shed for the community.ldquoThese plans are at very early stage and will the subject of detailed work by the community and developers but show we are already heading in the right direction.\"Local groups of councillors are already looking at potential gap sites for good across the city. There are already some community gardens, such as that run for the last decade by the Woodside Community Development Trust on West Prince Street. It can feed  families.Read more: How green is Scotland  Climate change map for YOUR area revealedNobody, however, is suggesting a new \"Good Le\" Glasgow of self-sufficient families like in the s sitcom. Realistically, getting to zero-net carbon will involve developing a market for more local food from farmers.Here again there is a huge role for councils and the rest of the public sector ndash using their procurement might to build up capacity.These, again, are policies that could change our suburban and green-belt landscapes as more land is turned to food.Ms Richardson explained: ldquoIt is also essential the council does whatever it can to ensure the food we provide is sourced as locally as possible.ldquoAnd at least % of food provided in our museums and art galleries comes from local or Scottish providers and that gives us a very solid base to build on.ldquoIrsquom very hopeful our food growing strategy will capture the imagination of the cityrsquos growing communities and show the huge potential there is growing food in Glasgow.The Scottish Government is looking at changing rules to make it easier to procure local foodThe working group concluded: \"Procurement has always been a dficult area in which to incorporate social and environmental objectives because it is highly constrained by a narrow legal focus on budgetary value. Good progress has been made by the Scottish Government and the Council in broadening this focus to embrace sustainability considerations.\"We think more can be done to bring climate issues to the fore and especially to look at how local food production can be encouraged through public sector purchasing power. \"Other big public-sector food buyers are keen too. But they have un in to problems. The Scottish Prison Service, for example, sources all its milk north of the border. and is talking to its suppliers about other produce.A spokesman said: \"These conversations have, however, revealed that there is presently a signicant premium attached to sourcing some local food products.\"This can make it cost prohibitive, particularly in an environment where prisoner numbers have been increasing and budgets are decreasing.\"It is against this backdrop that the SPS regularly discusses opportunities to buy Scottish produce with all its food suppliers. Feedback from our suppliers is that they too are keen to look to source locally where possible but, for some areasthis has proven extremely dficult.\"Glasgow knows that partners like the SPS need to get on board with local foodthe whole city will get to zero-net carbon.NHS Greater Glasgow spends poundm a year with suppliers. A spokesman said: \"As Scotlandrsquos largest health board we are determined to use our high-profile as a buyer of goods and services to make a positive impact on our local area while reducing our impact on the environment.\"Local small and medium sized businesses and third sector organisations are being helped to bid for contracts with the board. A dedicated group has also been set with a focus on sustainability being a signicant factor in contracts.\"These aspirations please Scottish farmers. Vice President of the National Farmers Union, Martin Kennedy, welcomed procurement reform: ldquoThe proposed statutory framework must be the catalyst for Scottish Government to work with local authorities to ensure they do the right thing when it comes to feeding a locally-sourced, healthy, balanced diet to those who use our public services.ldquoIt would genuinely help. Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal ndash but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers to consider what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world  These products certainly donrsquot meet our standards ndash not to mention the impact on climate change when food miles are taken into consideration.\"Itrsquos only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but itrsquos still not Scottish chicken.ldquoSuch an approach does work. Tayside contracts worked with NFU Scotland last year to get Scottish lamb back on the school menu after a very successful pilot in Perth and Kinross. That has resulted in lamb now being on the menu throughout the Tayside area. A massive thanks must go to this local authority for being so enthusiastic about promoting good local food. We must build on this enthusiasm across all local authorities in Scotland.ldquoAnd itrsquos down to the government to support this for three very good reasons. The provision of high quality food to our citizens support for sourcing locally and better recognition of Scotland iconic climate-friendly farming."},{"url":null,"title":"independent-scotland-walk-eu-membership","story":"Mike Russell said there has been a ldquohuge change in the EUrsquos attitude towards Scotland, where % of people voted remain in the  referendum.He was speaking after a former president of the European Council said he thinks EU attitudes towards Scottish independence have changed due to Brexit.Herman Van Rompuy told the BBC: ldquoI think there is a change, yes, because for a lot of people they are looking at what Scottish people are in favour of.ldquoThey want to stay in the European Union and at the same time they are prevented to stay in the European Union because there is this Brexit case, and there is not much sympathy for the Brexit case in the European Union, not among the leaders and not among the men and women in the street.He added: ldquoThere is much more sympathy for regions ndash parts of a country ndash that want to join the European Union.:Poll: Support for EU and holding a new Indyref risesMr Van Rompuy said that the result of any Scottish independence referendum would have to be considered ldquovery seriously by the EUit had been legally agreed and was constitutional.He also said that all  member states would have to agree for Scotland to join.Mr Russell told BBC Sunday Politics Scotland: ldquoThere is a sea change in attitude.

A number of alternative sites had been discounted as a result of being either too large, too small, or unavailable.A planning report to committee stated: “The proposals would provide both local trades and members of the public with a range of DIY products from an established home improvement company and thus can be considered as a benefit to the local community.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"These are the most popular Disney inspired names\"  These are the  most popular Disney-inspired names viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"call for shops to close on new year s day","story":"The shopworkers# trade union is urging all MSPs to back a motion calling for the closure of large shops in New Year#s Day.A survey of Scottish retail staff by the union Usdaw shows overwhelming support for the closure of stores on January .And the union is now calling on all MSPs to support the motion tabled by Jackie Baillie MSP in the Scottish Parliament seeking to ensure shop workers can enjoy some time off at New Year.The survey of more than  shop workers revealed:•  per cent believed stores should close on New Year’s Day, with  per cent saying they should also close on January .• Three quarters feel they spend too little time with friends and family over New Year.•  per cent have come under pressure to work on New Year’s Day or January .• Four in ten don’t receive any premium pay for working on New Year’s Day.•  per cent are not happy to work on New Year’s Day or January .Stewart Forrest, Usdaw’s Scottish isional officer, said: “This survey clearly demonstrates the strength feeling among our members. “We have written to all MSPs asking them to support Jackie Baillie’s motion calling for a decent break at New Year after the busy Christmas period.“I have also written to the Scottish Retail Consortium urging them to reconsider their opposition to large stores closing on New Year’s Day.”Mr Forrest stressed the union was fully supportive of efforts to revitalise our high streets as the livelihoods of its members depended on a thriving retail sector.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.carricktoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Rev Ian McLachlan\"  Sad farewell at Girvan South Parish ChurchviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.carricktoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The taskforce will examine the causes of drug-related deaths, and seek solutions to prevent the use of drugs resulting in the loss of so many lives.\"  New taskforce begins work to tackle rise in drug deaths viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"CARR | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"CARR | Article Teaser\"But he added: “Usdaw does not accept that giving retail workers in large stores just one more day of guaranteed time off would have a negative impact on our high streets, as  per cent of our members who worked on New Year’s Day  said that their store was either very quiet or fairly quiet.”Jackie Baillie MSP said retail staff worked incredibly hard all year round, and were often on their feet for long shts. She added: “Christmas and New Year is a time which should be spent with family, and there are few days in the year when families are off at the same time. “The results of Usdaw’s survey show that the overwhelming majority of respondents want to spend more time with their families during Christmas and New Year.“I hope all of my MSP colleagues will recognise that everyone deserves a day off for New Year and will support the motion that I have tabled in the Scottish Parliament.”"},{"url":null,"title":"garioch sports centre serves up an ace with new tennis plans","story":"With the nation currently hooked on Wimbledon, it#s a fitting time for Garioch Sports Centre to unveil its new tennis-focused proposals.Inverurie Community Council has submitted fresh expansion plans to Aberdeenshire Council on behalf of Garioch Sports Holdings.Full planning permission was secured last year for a major extension of the Inverurie facility, but changes in the community’s requirements and pressures on funding have prompted a reduced development.Initially the plans would have seen the Burghmuir Drive centre expanding into one of the largest amenities of its kind in Scotland, incorporating tennis courts, a multi-sports arena, fitness suites and an all-weather G pitch for Inverurie Loco Works FC which has now been dropped.But while the scale of the expansion might not be as ambitious, the new plans do reveal tennis courts and improvements for fitness along with an Early Learning Centre for younger children.Thanks to signicant input from Judy Murray – mother of tennis stars Andy and Jamie – the plans feature three dedicated tennis courts and the centre has committed to a three-year partnership with the JM Foundation, highlighting the commitment of the centre to develop the sport across Garioch.The centre and JM Foundation will work in partnership in upskilling their workforce and identying potential coaches while funding coach education.In a supporting statement the centre writes: “The matter of securing the appropriate funding for the ious options which have been considered over the last couple of years has impacted upon how the plans have altered with the focus very much now being on the new tennis provision.“The most recent plans reflect the discussions with the Lawn Tennis Association and also Tennis Scotland.“The advice and guidance of Judy Murray has also been pivotal in how the plans particularly for the tennis courts have progressed.”The applicants also believe that despite the downturn in oil and gas and other industries, there is still a demand for its facilities.It reports: “As many of the activities and programmes now carry waiting lists, there is proof that despite a downturn in many industries the timing is now right to expand in tandem with the growth in participation and the increase in the town and rural residency.“An expansion of the present facility and delivery of its sporting, health and wellbeing activities has many positive additions as the market town itself strives to increase its provision to its residents.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

Last year, , Scottish volunteers took part, removing an incredible , inidual items of litter at  beach cleans along , metres of Scottish coastline.Data collected by volunteers from over  years of MCS-led Great British Beach Cleans has been instrumental in the introduction of Scotland’s p single-use carrier bag charge, commitments to implement a ban on plastic stemmed cotton buds and to introduce a depositscheme for bottles and cans.Mr McArthur will be joining the citizen science project to help clear and survey the litter found on Echna Loch Bay, Burray on Monday, September .“Orkney has a fine tradition when it comes to ‘bag the bruck’,# says Mr McArthur.#I have been involved in such clean up efforts since I was at school in Sanday.“Of course, these days there is a greater public awareness of marine litter, and concern about the problems caused by plastic pollution in our seas.“I’m looking forward to joining volunteers of all ages at Echna Loch Bay to support the Great British Beach Clean campaign. This will be just one of many such clean ups taking place across the country. As well as helping tidy up our beaches and coastlines, I hope the initiative helps highlight the importance of reducing waste and protecting our precious marine environment”.Lizzie Prior, MCS Beachwatch Officer said: “It’s fantastic to see that local MSP, Liam McArthur, will be joining us at Echna Loch Bay to support our Great British Beach Clean it’s really important for decision-makers to see how much litter, especially plastic, makes its way on to our beaches. We hope that Liam’s attendance at the Great British Beach Clean will encourage local constituents to join us for an eye-opening day on the beaches of Orkney. It#s vital that we all continue to work together to stop the tide of plastic in our oceans.”Constituents looking to join Liam McArthur at the Great British Beach Clean can sign up to volunteer at: www.mcsuk.org greatbritishbeachcleancopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The ladies, who were already interested in the issues raised, said their desire to act was further strengthened by the meeting. at the Broadford Growers Hub last week, Anne MacLennan, Dorothy Jackson, Lysana Robinson, Pat McNicol, and Trish Rogers outlined why they felt action was required and what they hoped to achieve by holding the meeting.Dorothy Jackson from Tokavaig said #I have been working on environmental campaigns and I think climate change is the big one that I want to do my best on personally, as well as working upwards to try to get more government action.#This all originated from the Government#s Big Climate Conversation meeting in Portree at which there were about  people who had never acted on climate before. Now we know some of those people so we can get together again and join forces.#Pat McNicol who lives in Broadford said that after hearing about the local group #Broadford plastic free and beyond# she started to gather all the plastic from her weekly shop and was #horried# at the volume of plastic which was going to landfill.She said: #As iniduals, we can do something, and thenwe are a group of people acting collectively we can make changes.#Anne MacLennan from Lower Breakish commented: #I was in New Zealand for  years and was a climate activist there.I was heartened that the Government was doing the workshops # we need government action but they also need to know that there#s action from the bottom upwards.#Ardvasar resident Lysana Robinson said: #My father taught rural science and environmental studies, so I was the one in the greenhouse.#I have been an environmental activist for many years, I do moth trapping because it tells you more about the environment than looking at the flora because when things go wrong the population is decimated.#Trish Rogers from Broadford said: #I agree with Dorothy that climate change is the big one and I#ll do everything I can to get people involved.#Addressing what measures people could take to make a dference, she added: #There are things such as the circular economy, where people can recycle to avoid throwing things away.#She also went on to highlight the benefit of local and seasonal food, energy-efficient heating, and transport efficiency options like using public transport, car-sharing and cycling.Touching on the upcoming meeting, Ms Jackson said: #We will share some of the things that are already happening # there will be brief presentations. Then the idea is for people to go into local groups and talk about what they can do locally.#We will then have a picture of who is interested in doing what and come up with possibilities for people to link up and then we will try and work out where we can go from there.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September. Acts on the bill include Niteworks, Elephant Sessions, Lau, Tide Lines and Peat and Diesel as well as DJs Erol Alkan, Optimoand Leon Vynehall.."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2471_6September19_Page_01crop.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 6th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

Launched officially on July , it was a case of getting straight down to business! The volunteers cover quite a large area, including Broughshane, Kells, Ballymena and the surrounding rural local areas.The group has  volunteers, however by August it had responded to  purple and red incidents in support of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service.This translates into  inidual responses. The group prefers to send more than one responder to each patient in case their needs are beyond the capacity of a single person. Cardiac arrest is a case in point and while only three of patients have been in this specic condition, many more have been suffering from chest pain.Responders grow in experience and expertise, with the group aiming to have an experienced person at each incident to support them. The four committee members have ided this task between them.The more active members are learning fast, particularly through their exposure to NIAS crews and rapid response paramedics, who have been patient and helpful with them.The group held their second monthly members meeting and training event at the end of August and used this to reflect on their experiences, share what they had learned and build vital patient care competence.More members are needed and they are asking people to get in touchthey want to volunteer. Working with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and Dalriada Urgent Care, there is a planning and training programme organised for January soyou are interested check the group out on Facebook.The group posted recently: “One thing has become clear in the course of our first month’s activity -we need to recruit and train more responders. “We are working with NIAS on dates for another training course and this will determine our recruitment timetable.”A spokesperson added: “We owe huge thanks to those who made our new service possible.“The people and organisations who contributed so generously to help us meet our funding needs.“The NIAS Community Resuscitation Development Team, who guided us through the complexities of setting up the scheme, trained our members for us and continue to support us.“The Governance team at Dalriada Urgent Care, who supported us in our recruitment efforts and other vital matters such as insurance.“The front line staff of NIAS who have supported and guided us on scene.“And, last but certainly not least, our volunteers, who continue to give the community their time and newly-acquired expertise and to meet their new challenges with great resilience and good humour.“Its a privilege to work with you.”Follow the Braid Valley Community First Responders on Facebook to keep up to date with all their news and to see how you can become involved.

In truth, the margin of defeat flattered St John’s who, for the second game running, failed to fire.They got out of jail at the weekend when an injury-time Pearse Donnelly goal almost plundered an unlikely victory before Conal Delargy kicked the equaliser. The general consensus was that Casements had missed the boat and that the Johnnies would win the replay, but Portglenone boss Barry Dillon said he knew his players could better Sunday’s performance. “We sat back too deep on Sunday, it was our own fault,” said Dillon. “Maybe the fear of winning made them a bit apprehensive, but we knew we had more in us. “In the first half of the drawn game, we showed we are the better team and we had that belief coming into this game that we could go and finish it.” While Portglenone fielded an unchanged team from Sunday’s drawn game, St John’s started Domhnall Nugent, Brian ‘Bam’ Neeson and Sunday’s goal-scorer Donnelly. Yet, as was the case on Sunday, it was Casements who made the brighter start with a hat-trick of frees from Conal Delargy and Ronan Kellyhelping them establish a - to no score lead after a cagey opening  minutes. It took the Johnnies  minutes to open their account following a well-worked move finished by Matthew Fitzpatrick, but Paddy Kelly responded in kind for Portglenone minutes later. Peter McCallin got his side’s second score on  minutes with St John’s struggling to break down a well-organised Portglenone defence. The Whiterock Road men then lost Donnelly to a black card and Delargy converted another free to move his side - to - ahead. When Kieron McKenna added another from play, Portglenone looked in a strong position approaching half-time and a Paddy McBride free with the last kick of the half was badly needed by the under-par West Belfast outfit. The second half was just four minutes old when Portglenone cut a dash through the heart of the St John’s defence to score a brilliant goal with full-forward Michael Donnelly firing past Padraig Nugent. Less than a minute later, St John’s hit back with a goal of their own. Having been off-target with a few efforts from frees,Neeson’s fortunes changed when an attempt at a point dipped under the crossbar and beyond the reach of Portglenone goalkeeper Ryan O’Neill. That should have been the catalyst for St John’s to kick on, but instead it was Portglenone who regained control of proceedings as another Delargy score moved them four clear once more. St John’s continued to squander chances at the other end with Neesonand Fitzpatrick firing wide of the posts. McBride converted a free before Dermot McAleese broke forward to score for Casements. Ryan McNulty landed a stunning point from play with  minutes of normal time remaining, yet their hopes of another rousing comeback were dented when they lost centre-forward Conal Kelly to a second booking. McBride briefly reduced the gap to two points while Nugent was forced to make a great save to deny Niall McKeever at the other end. Michael Kelly scored an excellent point moments after his introduction for Portglenone and a Ronan Kelly free gave them a four-point cushion approaching full-time. Rather than sit back and defend their lead as they did last Sunday, Dillon’s men went for the jugular and further points from McKeever and midfielder Fergal O’Kane put them six clear. There was one last surge from St John’s with Michael Bradley’s sideline being fisted into the net by Fitzpatrick deep into stoppage time and the Antrim star had a second goal-bound shot blocked with the final play of the game. Yet Portglenone were the better team over the two games and they progress to a semi-final meeting with Lámh Dhearg on Saturday, September  at Creggan.

For Martin Moreland, Principal of Mercy College, it was very dferent indeed.Born on the Ormeau Road in South Belfast, Martin was the youngest of six children. Having left school with no exams, Martin’s road to the classroom and education sector began as an engineer.“I never really thought I would be a teacher because I never had the confidence to be one,” he explained.“It was a dream in a sense but I never really thought it would be a reality.“I left secondary school with no exams. I went out into the world of work – it gives you a lot of le experiences or the real world as I call it.“I went into engineering and had several jobs. My we has a job in education and she told me about a course up in Derry that gave you access into university. I went and got a GCSE in English and Maths and spent three years up in Derry doing the course.Martin was accepted into St Mary’s University College and after his first teaching job in West Belfast, has moved to the North of the city.“With my engineering background, my first job was a Technology and Design teacher in St Colm’s in Twinbrook and I spent  years there. I loved it there, it was a great community and a school that was thriving.“I moved on to Mercy where there was just  kids. I started off as a teacher before becoming Principal and I’ve been in the role for ten years.”Martin then reflected on the many changes in education over the years, not least the challenges and successes of Mercy College.“When I came in, it was about building up confidence and profile of the school, given our location in North Belfast.“Pupil numbers now are  but our challenges now is very much to do with space and classrooms.“We have been co-educational for a few years now which is fantastic. We have a   ratio girls and boys in Year . Our LLS programme is still really successful and we were the first school to start that.“The standards are amazing – % of girls are getting three A-Levels from A* to C which is very unique. % of our GCSE students got five GCSE’s at the top grades and there are not many other schools in the North that can boast such results.“Finances remain a huge challenge for us. There is no room for any extra money in the system. It is not easy at all.”Away from school, Martin is kept a busy man being a father of ten children.“I am a family man. I am a father-of-ten so at home it is a very busy household, with the kids ranging from  to .“I am very much an outdoor person. I like nature and sunshine. I am also big into running and gardening.

I’ve been singing every year since.”Méabh spoke of how the club’s Cultural Officer, Ronan McHugh “asked me to come back last year to teach the kids how to sing the anthem”. “That is the thing about our club, the kids that attend the summer schemes, and there are now three running, end up coaching younger kids coming through which is fantastic,especially the U- girls.”“I then started singing the national anthem at club events such as juvenile and senior dinners. “Antrim Cultural Officer Bronagh Lennon asked my dadI could sing at some championship games and then onto County Antrim league games. Bronagh has been a great influence and mentor, not only to me but to other kids in the county with her encouragement.”Méabh’s extremely proud dad Joe said all the family will be travelling down to Dublin to support her on Sunday.“There is a big festival on at the club on Sunday and the game will be on in the club after that.

Everything was going to be OK.”Scots voted by % to % against independence, with Mr Salmond announcing within hours of the result being declared that he would be stepping down as SNP leader and first minister.The former first minister said that Mr Cameron’s “comments about me seem rather mild compared to the venom he has reserved for his erstwhile Tory chums”.He added: “The extract from his book shows how rattled David Cameron was in the final stages of the  campaign, lying awake at night worrying about what the Queen would think of himthere was a Yes vote!“In reality David wasn’t a great negotiator and the Scottish side achieved most of what we wanted from the Edinburgh Agreement of , hence his petulance even now about the negotiations. Cameron’s response was to increasingly let George Osborne do his thinking for him.“In the end Cameron squeaked through only by combining with the other unionist parties and promising Scots near federal powers in “The Vow” the same type of powers which he previously had refused to even countenance as a possibility. Inevitably these promises were broken by Westminster, which is why five years on independence has become the majority position in Scotland.”"},{"url":null,"title":"evasive little goat halts traffic on busy motorway","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There are other guys in Derry who are on the edge of that, the problem with this is and Declan Morgan was right, there is a human cost, a psychological cost, a physical cost.“People are getting their hopes built up thinking something is going to happen and then they’re deflated again, you can only pull yourself up so many times.“I’m having dficulty pulling myself up week by week, to continue fighting this, and it would be a hell of a lot more dficult for people who aren’t aware of the detail and the argument that goes into getting this far.”For victims it is about much more than monetary compensation, that comes secondary to an apology from the state and institutions responsible and a package that enables them to move on with their lives in a better way – which includes appropriate healthcare and support.Last Friday, Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland Sir Declan Morgan said it was \"shocking\" that victims are still awaiting action.He revealed that before Sir Anthony Harte, who chaired the Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry, died, he had expressed \"profound disappointment\" at the lack of progress.Sir Declan said it \"epitomises how the lack of an assembly impacts negatively on the lives of Northern Irelands citizens\".‘Absolute disgrace’The Historical Institutional Abuse Redress Bill was listed amongst parliament business on Monday but was not dealt with because of prorogation.Mr McCourt believes the suspension of parliament by Prime Minister Boris Johnson has essentially “killed off” the Redress Bill.“To all intents and purposes the Redress Bill is killed off. If the legislation is not passed and hasn’t gone through the House of Lords and received the royal seal of approval then it is killed off.“The fact that it hasn’t been dealt with at this stage is an absolute disgrace, Declan Morgan is right to bring it back up again.“Even at this point they are still talking about it being a devolved matter, the hope of having this dealt with through the NI Assembly does not exist, the only avenue for this to go forward is through Westminster.\"Speaking at Westminster on Tuesday, Independent Unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon said she was \"extremely annoyed and disgusted\" that the motion to discuss historical abuse in NI wasnt even moved because of prorogation.\"By proroguing parliament tonight, the Prime Minister has wilfully and deliberately deprived victims of a -minute debate. He has sent out a clear signal that those victims to not even merit a debate.“It’s appalling, I ask the Secretary of State to demand that the Prime Minister comes to NI, sits at the meeting and looks the victims of HIA in the face and explains to them why he is so disrespectful and discourteous of the hurt and the suffering that they have had to endure.”Unexpected and emergency debates were to blame, Julian Smith explained, and he apologised for the change in business which he said “in no way diminishes how seriously I’m progressing the issues or affected the commitments I have made.”Mr Smith said officials have prepared the policy and lawyers the draft law and he has asked that it be included in the Queen’s speech as a matter of urgent priority.He was however challenged about why legislation hasn’t been brought forward and was told that the state is failing victims yet again.Scotland’s progressIn Scotland their inquiry is ongoing, the report is not written, but the Scottish First Minister has instructed the civil service to initiate an advanced payment scheme. Anyone over  years of age or with a terminal illness can now apply for an award of £, – which is not their full and final settlement.Some child migrants who were taken from homes in Northern Ireland and shipped off to Australia have also received payments.Mr McCourt believes the same could have been done for victims in Northern Irelandthere had been the political will to do it.The HIA inquiry studied allegations of abuse in  homes and other residential institutions between  to .These were run by the state, local authorities, the Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland and the children’s charity Barnardo’s. The largest number of complaints related to four Catholic-run homes.A report in  recommended that victims should receive compensation, however, the process of securing compensation stalled when devolution collapsed in the same week.After a four-year Inquiry and over two and a half years since the publication of the report, the government has still failed to deliver a promised apology and financial redress.In recent weeks Secretary of State for NI, Julian Smith, gave assurances to victims that a Redress Bill would be fast-tracked through Westminster. But Brexit, and the suspension of parliament, has placed yet another roadblock in front of victims.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: Termonbacca where historical institutional abuse took place.  Campaigner Jon McCourt has highlighted that another HIA victim has passed away before receiving compensation."},{"url":null,"title":"derry homeowners left shaken burglary waterside area city","story":"Detectives are appealing for witnesses and information following the report of a burglary at a house in the Grovemount Court area of Altnagelvin, Derry, on Thursday  September.Detective Sergeant Boyd said: “It was reported that entry was gained to the property between am and pm on Thursday.

Members were told that a key element of this innovation project was the provision of mechanism to support the transfer of skills and expertise to company staff and university students.Personalised MedicineIn relation to the prioritisation of the Future Fund of £m and the further anticipated match funding from NI Government and other partners, the emphasis is on advancing with projects such as the Graduate Medical School as a key catalyst for the much-needed expansion of the Ulster University Magee Campus. The delivery of a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellenceat Ulster University and Altnagelvin is also a priority for this fund as is the provision of an integrated, Council-wide, multi-skills employment pathways intervention support programme.The report advised that work on these innovation projects as well as the proposed SMART and digital city projects were advancing in close collaboration with local industry and partners and relevant government departments, while the strategic outline cases for major regeneration projects for Derry City and Strabane Town Centre are at an advanced stage of progress.The Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence intends on harnessing the power of Genomics to predict and diagnose inherited and acquired disease, and to personalise treatments and interventions.The Ulster University representatives said it will expand its partnership with Genomics Ireland and other commercial enterprises to sequence the genomes of % of NI’s population contributing to a research database that can be interrogated to develop personalised medicine solutions with worldwide application and valuable I.P. and how it will also contribute to health improvement locally through a unique ‘community buy-in’ approach.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8wOVxcXC8wOTEyMTkwNlxcXC9TVFJBQkFORS1ERVZJQ0UtLnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo2NDcsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjozNDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2NhY2hlLnJlc2l6ZWQuY29cXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjhlOTFmNGZjY2ExNDE2YjZiOGFkN2MwMzExOGY0ZWQ0NThmOWJlMmIifQ==/strabane-device.png","title":"security operation creggan area derry following discovery mortar device strabane","story":"District Commander Superintendent Gordon McCalmont said: \"It is our assessment that the New IRA is responsible for the mortar device that was discovered outside homes in Church View Close in Strabane on Saturday morning th September.

For example, can lessons be learned from other towns which experienced similar problems or what about changing the sequencing of traffic lights in the town centre  he asked.ldquoIt has been said many times that there is no quick fix solution to Downpatrickrsquos congestion problem and while the layout of the town may pose problems for engineers, surely it is time for some innovative thinking Cllr Curran said he believes that all the key players need to get together, suggesting years of inaction has exacerbated the congestion nightmare faced by residents, businesses and visitors to the town.He added: ldquoIt is time to forensically examine the problem and come up with ideas on the way forward.

It was also an effective way to promote the work that we do and raise awareness among the regular customers to Asda. ldquoThe foodbank has noticed an increase in donations to our permanent collection point in the store since the campaign ands partnerships like this make our work so much more effective.Downpatrick store manager, Roger Croskery, said Asda has always always been proud to support the communities it serves.ldquoOur community champions work tirelessly to support charities, projects and initiatives that make a real dference to the people living around their Asda shop, he said.ldquoBut we want to do even more to help local communities across the UK to save money so they can live better. Wersquoll do this is by doing our part to tackle the growing issue of poverty in the UK and our Fight Hunger campaign is part of this work.Roger and Linda, along withy other staff members from the Downpatrick store, recently visited the Fountain Foodbank to see the impact the donations have made, to meet volunteers and find out more about how the foodbank works.The foodbank provides emergency food parcels to those who find themselves in dficult circumstances and has distributed over three thousand food parcels in the local area since opening in March .It also receives weekly donations of fresh food from Asda as part of an ongoing scheme with FareShare which has  yearsrsquo experience working with the food industry to safely ert edible surplus through a UK-wide network of frontline charities fighting food poverty.FareShare works with businesses and charities to get food to good causes in a way thatrsquos cost effective and makes sense for the business and the charities, with the Fountain Foodbank registered to receive some of this food.The volunteers say this particular initiative is an effective way to cut down on waste and help those who find themselves in dficult circumstances.Asda says that by the end of the Fight Hunger campaign, it aims to provide an additional  million meals every year by investing in the charitiesrsquo infrastructure and services so they can collect, store and transport more food.In addition, the store aims to provide , vulnerable people access to fresh food every year and make fresh food the norm in food banks and not the exception.Asda also wants to tackle the root causes of poverty, helping one million people with the food and support they need to help them out of the situation they are in and expand the companyrsquos existing food donation activities so every one of its stores has the ability to donate edible surplus food to local food banks and community groups..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C September 4%2C 1979  ","story":"WARRENPOINT mdash A plea by Official Unionists to adjourn this weekrsquos meeting of Down Council because of the murders at Warrenpoint and Mullaghmore was rejected the SDLP and Alliance members.The motion to adjourn was defeated by ten votes to six and immediately the Unionists walked out mdash not in protest but as a gesture of sympathy to those bereaved by the murders.The motion was introduced by Saintfield councillor, Mr William Finlay, who said he looked back with horror at the murders, the victims including  soldiers at Warrenpoint, Lord Mountbatten, his grandson, Nicholas , the Dowager Lady Brabourne, and a  year-old boy, Paul Maxwell.Acting chairman, Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghuesaid he would be impartial in the matter and was quite sure they all shared the revulsion, horror and disgust and would like to show their sympathy with those were bereaved ldquoin such a dreadful way.He pointed out that there had been two committee meetings of the council since the murders occurred, but since Mr Finlayrsquos motion was a procedural matter councillors must decide without any debate whether or not they wanted to adjourn the meeting.He added: ldquoHowever, whether or not the council decides to adjourn should not be interpreted as to whether or not councillors approve of the vile deeds which have been perpetrated.After the vote, in which the SDLP and Alliance members voted against the Unionists, Mr Finlay said he was sorry about the decision which the majority had made.NEWCASTLE mdash The fireworks display organised as the climax of the Newcastle summer season did not go down with a bang, but instead fizzled out.Torrential rain minutes before the fireworks bonanza was due to begin washed the show out and it now seems likely that the display will be held at Halloween at Downpatrick racecourse instead.Drumgath Accordion Band and Ballykeel Pipe Band were about to march into the arena to put on a marching exhibition when the rain came down.More than pound had been spent on the fireworks, but the rockets, roman candles, catherine wheels, shells, mortars and numerous other favourites were saved from the rain. Disappointed spectators had their money refunded.The fireworks bonanza, sponsored by Down District Council, was to have marked the end of the Percy French Festival.However, the stage will now switch to Downpatrick in October where a successful display was staged last year.ARDGLASS mdash Suki, the cat escaped a horrible death at Ardglass harbour recently, has found a new home in Lisburn.The story about how Suki survived an attempt to have her drowned aroused so much interest that the person who found her, Mrs Joan Owens, was inundated with phone calls to give the cat a home.Mrs Owens, of Ardgtreenan Crescent, Belfast, accepted the first of more than  calls and the cat left for its new home in Dundrod Walk, Lisburn, earlier this week.ldquoSomeone had tried to get rid of the cat, Mrs Owens explained. ldquoSuki was tied in a paper bag and thrown off the side of the harbour, but instead of hitting the waves she landed in our cabin cruiser, which was anchored.ldquoWhen we were taking our boat out of the water for repairs to the hull we came across a torn bag on the deck. Then we heard noises from a cabin mdash and found Suki mothering three new kittens.ldquoUnfortunately, we had to have the three kittens put down and Suki neutered. And then when our two tom cats took a dislike to Suki we were forced to appeal for a home for her.Mrs Owens added: ldquoThe response was overwhelming and the first of many callers took Suki away. My husband, Jim, and I will be ing to our caravan at Ardtole, near Ardglass, this weekend. We hope we donrsquot find any more animals in distress!DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrickrsquos new maternity hospital, which is due to replace the Hardy Greer House unit early in the New Year, will not become fully operational until staffing dficulties can be resolved.It is expected that an advertising campaign is to be mounted shortly for all grades of staff required in the bright, new up-to-date hospital.The -bed unit in the grounds of the Downshire Hospital will require up to % more midwery staff than the -bed Hardy Greer House on the Strangford Road, which seems to be permanently under-staffed and struggling along.The new unit will also accommodate an out-patient centre which will mean the transfer of ante-natal and post-natal work which is currently conducted at Downe Hospital.The expected completion date for the new building is November. It is already a couple of months behind schedule because of a host of supply dficulties, the cement strike among them.Once it is handed over it will have to be equipped and sterilised before it can be commissioned. That could take a couple of months.BALLYNAHINCH mdash The September Flower Show organised by the Presbyterian Womenrsquos Association connected to st Ballynahinch Presbyterian Church proved to be a huge success.The Huston Hall was crammed full of baking, handiwork, flowers and vegetables.

The proposed new school will also be in the trusteeship of the De La Salle Congregation.St Patrickrsquos Grammar has maintained its opposition to the merger proposal since it was muted in , while both De La Salle and St Maryrsquos support the merger.Mr Joe McCann, St Patrickrsquos Grammar principal, said he is ldquodisappointed that an apparent EA source had broken the news of the merger plan locally before his and the other schools were formally notied.St Patrickrsquos parent body mdash The Parents and Friends Associationmdash said that it will ldquovehemently fight these proposals with every means necessary, through the courts and, unfortunately, in the media.PFA spokesperson, Cormac Artt, criticised the EA on how the news was leaked ahead of the schools being notied last Thursday and the argument that local children will be educated together and the likelihood of capital funding for a single-site school build.Mr Artt continued: ldquoThis proposal cites an enrolment of  pupils and alleges that this yearly intake will be made up of up to % who will be admitted by academic selection.ldquoHowever, the census figures suggest thatall those who live within a three-mile radius and those for whom the school is the nearest Catholic grammar are admitted automatically without sitting the GL entrance assessment, there will be very few,any, places for those applicants seeking admission via academic selection.Mr Artt suggested that the outworking of this means that the rural communities and primary schools who have been an integral part of the grammar schoolrsquos -year history, will no longer have a place in this proposed super school, including those in Teconnaught, Loughinisland, Strangford, Kilclief, Dundrum, the Ards peninsula, Castlewellan and Newcastle.ldquoThe choice for boys in these areas who wish an academically selective education will therefore be travel to Newry or Belfast to try to secure a selective grammar school place in Catholic schools that are already heavily oversubscribed, he said.ldquoThe alternative for those who wish to keep the tradition and connection with Downpatrick will be to attend the state academically selective, Down High School. Aside from the injustice of this on the rural communities, is the impact this will have on families.While the EA said that the proposals have ldquoalready been subject to formal stakeholder consultation with parents, staff, governors and pupils, Mr Artt disputed that.ldquoParents of students from St Patrickrsquos Grammar requested a meeting with the De La Salle Trustees in April to discuss the Trusteesrsquo vision going forward. They finally responded in June by refusing to meet the parents citing rsquoit is not clear what,anything, will be gained by a meeting,rsquo which clearly makes the parents think that they do not care about the pupils of the school where they are Trustees.ldquoThe Board of Governors, staff and parents are overwhelmingly opposed to this proposal and for the De La Salle Trustees, who are the only stakeholder supporting this vision, to refuse to speak to the current parents is a disgrace.De La Salle principal, Ciaran Maguire, said he was ldquodelighted to see the proposal going to full public consultation.He told the Recorder: ldquoItrsquos been a long time coming. I am reassured now that the families of the greater Downpatrick area will have an opportunity to finally get behind the vision to secure the town as a model of good practice, where childrenrsquos education is a priority.ldquoThe De La Salle Congregation have been working on bringing post primary education in Downpatrick into the st century. In , they first proposed that St Patrickrsquos Grammar should become a co-educational school.ldquoThe Department of Education at the time wanted to see a proposal that was reflective and inclusive of all schools in the Downpatrick area. That advice was taken by the De La Salle congregation and they have been working, in partnership, on a solution to ensure that all children in the greater Downpatrick area have an education system that they can be proud of.Mr Maguire said the origin of the transfer test ldquowas a solution to a problem back then, suggesting the problem is dferent now and a new solution is needed.He added: ldquoWhat we need now for our children is something radical and exciting for all those involved. If we are the child-centred schools we say we are, then this is undeniably the right thing to do, not just for my pupils, but for the St Maryrsquos girls and St Patrickrsquos boys.Mr Maguire contended that while some may see the proposal as ldquoas an attempt to wipe out a schoolrsquos history and tradition, itrsquos an opportunity for them to continue their great work in preparing our children for le.He said that it will cater for all children from the local feeder schools, without the fear of having to sit and possibly fail a test.Mr Maguire added: ldquoWe are removing barriers those same barriers that our children currently struggle with, the fear and anxiety of not fitting in, not being good enough. I urge all parents to get behind this proposal, your opinion matters and should count.Welcoming the proposed merger, St Maryrsquos High School principal, Ms Rosemary McLaughlin, said ldquoit has the ability to deliver.She added: ldquoWe are very proud of our school as a centre of excellence and we look forward to this new opportunity of proposed change to serve all young people..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th September 2019 Migle.jpg","title":"Migle thanks foster parents for help in education success  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH woman has thanked her foster carers for the key role they played in her educational success.Miglehas revealed how growing up in foster care helped shape her future career as the Regional Adoption and Fostering Service launches a new campaign encouraging more people to become foster carers across the Provincersquos health trusts.Migle was fostered by South Eastern Trust foster carers Michael and Martha eight years ago and is currently studying Computer Science at Queenrsquos University Belfast.She moved in her with foster parents when she was  and admits she would not be where she is today without their support.ldquoBefore I went to live with Michael and Martha I never even thought about going to university, said Migle who moved to Northern Ireland in  from Lithuania.ldquoThey were able to help me choose what I wanted to do with my le.

Over the past three years Irish Lights has proactively engaged with the local community and relevant state agencies to establish the best approach to the site. he continued.ldquoWe have now developed and tested new technology to achieve a sustainable solution that will enable retention of the historic lens and sweeping beam at St. Johnrsquos Point. I look forward to meeting with the community to discuss these plans in more detail.The Lecale Lightkeepers say that while they accept there is some concession on CILrsquos part in proposing to keep the sweeping beam at the lighthouse, they have been informed by the Commissioner that the range of the beam will be reduced by up to nine miles. They also claim that the beamrsquos iconic ldquoloom will be lost, robbing the lighthouse of what they describe as its ldquointangible heritage.A spokesperson for campaigners said that through their freedom of information requests for communication between CIL and others, they have found a ldquolack of appreciation for the intangible heritage of lighthouses and a disregard of the views of coastal communities.ldquoWe have seen examples of modernised lights and none have retained their original characteristics. The new light source proposed for St Johnrsquos Point would be an LED which, in itself is suspect, as according to the Royal Society Publication April , LEDs have detrimental effects on Epaunal Marine Communities.Campaigners say Newry Mourne and Down Council has already voted unanimously to protect the sweeping beamrsquos current mechanism and trustsrsquos that CIL will not be given planning permission to proceed with its proposal.ldquoThe lighthouse is a listed building and its character, the light, must be protected, declared the campaignersrsquo spokesperson.ldquoWith the loss of the historic lights at Fastnet, Mew and Tory it is even more vital that St Johnrsquos Point should be kept for heritage purposes. Moreover, it is a beautul feature of our nocturnal landscape, much loved by the local communities.Turning to concerns about the mercury in the current lighthouse mechanism, the spokesperson said mercury vapour is a known toxic substance, arguing that vaporisation only occurs in certain circumstances, notably in very warm conditions where there is poor ventilation.ldquoThe St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is fully automated and the lantern room is well ventilated.ldquoAccording to the late attendant Henry Henvey, the mercury had not needed any attention in at least  years nor were there ever any concerns about its safety.Next Wednesday eveningrsquos meeting in Ardglass starts at pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th September 2019 Red.jpg","title":"Red High 25 group in fundraising drive  ","story":"NEARLY  years on, the loss of Ballynahinch teenager Mark Quinn is still keenly felt today mdash by his grieving family, schoolmates and his fellow soccer players.The  year-old took his own le on December , , with his funeral service one of the biggest his home town has ever seen.Earlier this year, Markrsquos former classmates at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School in Downpatrick joined together to fundraise in support of community mental health initiatives in his memory coming up to his anniversary.The former students, now grown men, many with sons of their own, all found that Markrsquos death hit them in dferent ways then and throughout the following years.The group, known as Red High , decided that they wanted to raise money to help support other young men who may feel in despair.Markrsquos family is fully behind the initiative and other planned events which will go to support Ballynahinch Counselling Services and The Edge Youth and Community Centre.The gesture comes with the knowledge that Ballynahinch has one of the highest suicide rates in the district.World Suicide Prevention Day was marked yesterday and Department of Health officials announced plans to reduce suicide rates in Northern Ireland by % over the next five years.Speaking of behalf of her parents, Peg, and the late Hugh Quinn, and siblings Lynda, Michael, John, Patrick, Jarlath, David and Jemma, Markrsquos sister Katie Cassidy said they were ldquooverwhelmed to have been contacted during the summer holidays by Markrsquos school friends from the Red High.Katie said: ldquoTheir effort to keep Markrsquos memory alive while also raising awareness about mental health issues is more relevant now than ever.

Talking can make all the dference, we wish we knew then what we know now.ldquoThe pain and devastating reality of living without your son, brother, nephew or uncle truly causes physical pain. But there is also help in dealing with the loss of someone to suicide. In the early days after Markrsquos death when our faith was extremely tested, we received tremendous support from our parish community.Katie also asked for support for the upcoming football tournament at St Patrickrsquos Grammar next Saturday, September  and for Ballynahinch Olympicrsquos annual fundraising effort.She said: ldquoWe hope everyone will come along to the Red High next weekend to enjoy the football tournament. Itrsquos sure to be good day and all money raised will go to Ballynahinch counselling services and The Edge, as we feel that the Edge contributes enormously to the youth of our town.

Mental health awareness is something that people are much more open about these days.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Several motorists were warned about their speed but the sad thing was that two motorists received Fixed Penalty Notices for speeding.“On top of this one motorist obviously didn’t see us driving behind him when he decided to lt his mobile and start chatting to a friend instead of concentrating on the road. As a result this motorist also received a Fixed Penalty Notice for his misjudged action.“I would prefer to inform you that we had a successful day and caught nobody as it truly saddens me to issue these fixed penalty notices but some people just will not learn.“What I also noticed today was that not one person waved to us.

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland.

Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/greggssss.jpg","title":"greggs to open new belfast city centre store","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Greggs looks set to open a new store in the heart of Belfast city centre, it can be revealed.

Trade NI – the new alliance between Hospitality Ulster, Manufacturing NI and Retail NI – is unveiling a -year plan called ‘Vision ’ at a Westminster reception on Wednesday afternoon, as the UK’s political system enters its most volatile period in a generation. With just weeks before the UK is expected to leave the EU, more than  guests are confirmed to attend the event that will be addressed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith MP and the shadow Secretary of State, Tony Lloyd MP. Business leaders are also due to attend a later event at Downing Street, and a lunch at the Irish Embassy. Trade NI’s “transformative economic plan” will set out key policy priorities that have the potential to create , jobs and to make Northern Ireland a high growth economy. In a joint statement, Trade NIs Colin Neill , Stephen Kellyand Glyn Roberts , said: “Northern Ireland is facing a huge challenge as it struggles politically and economically with a growth forecast of around % or below. This is simply not good enough and we can’t sit idly by and let events overtake us. We must break the cycle of limited economic growth.” “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “We need to be bold and ambitious about creating % or even % growth over the next few years, but that requires decision makers to be pressed into action and a series of policy and legislative decisions to be taken and driven through. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer.” “Our Vision  document sets out a bold new ten-year plan for creating , new jobs and creating a high growth economy. We want to make Northern Ireland the best place in the UK and Ireland to shop, socialise, locate and start a business “The Vision  plan sets out to create a better ing business environment and attract further inward investment that will lead to a revitalised economy taking on the challenge in turbulent times.” “We want to make Northern Ireland an eco-system of innovation.Trade NI is keen to work with all business organisations, chambers of commerce, trade unions and voluntary sector representation to create a new progressive partnership for change in Northern Ireland.” And Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, sponsor of Trade NI’s Westminster reception, said: Danske Bank is proud to be one of the main sponsors of Trade NI’s Westminster reception. Trade NI is seizing the initiative and ensuring that the voice of the local business community is being heard loud and clear at a time of upheaval and uncertainty.” “The vibrancy of the Northern Ireland private sector is imperative to the strength of our economy and we need to ensure that local businesses are protected and well positioned to be able to compete globally in the post-Brexit environment.” Emma Gilthorpe, executive director, Heathrow Expansion, said: “Heathrow is delighted to support the launch of Trade NI, echoing Heathrow’s commitment to connect Northern Ireland to global growth and to share the benefits of an expanded Heathrow with the businesses and communities of Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/dm11.jpg","title":"tech entrepreneur named catalysts innovation founder","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by Ulster Business A top tech entrepreneur has been named as Catalyst’s Innovation Founder for  by a  of leading judges.
