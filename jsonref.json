And of course it was all about the dress.The Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s Alexander McQueen gown has got to be one of the most copied styles of all time, and this breathtaking design is destined to be just as iconic. We were speculating for months as to who Meghan might ask to create the all-important dress. Stella McCartney, Ralph \u0026amp Russo, Burberry or perhaps Erdem? She kept us all guessing right up until the last moment, and as she arrived at St. George\u0026#39s Chapel in Windsor it was announced that it\u0026#39s the work of British designer Clare Waight Keller, Artistic Director at Givenchy. We love the elegant simplicity of this dress. The slight off shoulder neckline, the train... it\u0026#39s perfection. When teamed with Cartier jewellery, a dramatic veil and Queen Mary\u0026#39s diamond tiara, it\u0026#39s a fairy tale come true.

She was also said to have warned her grandson about their behaviour.It is understood that the request to use the atomisers – hand-held devices for spraying water or perfume – to create a pleasant aroma for guests at St George\u0027s Chapel specifically came from Meghan\u0027s office at Kensington Palace.Although she and Harry organised the wedding themselves with an in-house team, anything to do with the chapel – the venue for several royal marriages including Queen Victoria\u0027s and burial place of ten monarchs – is a matter for the Queen, who had to give them permission to use it.    St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle couldn\u0027t have been more to Meghan Markle\u0027s liking – historic and picturesque with long family ties... it had it all.

Harry and Meghan also became the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on their big dayThat meant all of the arrangements needed to be passed by the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office at Buckingham Palace, which is in charge of ceremonial matters such as state visits and garden parties. And when the request to use the atomisers was raised, the response was, well, a little sniffy.The source said: \u0027Apparently Meghan didn\u0027t like the smell of the chapel, which, as you would expect, is a little musty. It\u0027s not unpleasant at all, though. \u0027It just smells how you would expect an old building to smell. And that\u0027s something the Royal Family are particularly used to.Royal organist, 38, who played at Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding...¿Ladies and gentlemen, this is your King speaking¿:...Share this article\u0027Meghan wanted staff to go around with these atomisers, like spritzer guns, and spray the chapel with scent before anyone arrived.\u0027Royal Household staff stepped in and told her office politely, but firmly, that this was the Queen\u0027s Chapel and it simply wasn\u0027t appropriate. \u0027I don\u0027t believe they said no because they thought it could affect the chapel in any way.

She’s a woman of today, she’s got her will and she’s a leader.’Meghan made her name in the legal drama Suits and had mainly small parts in films, but she would win starring roles on her return.‘She’ll definitely do something serious,’ Gina says. ‘She’s not going to be a frivolous little girl like she’s been before. And she’s a great actress.’The Hollywood return will not happen until Meghan, 37, has had a number of children. ‘I know how much she wanted babies — plural,’ Gina adds.‘She’s going to be a lovely mummy — she’s very nurturing and that’s probably why Harry fell for her.’    Jacob Rees-Mogg has been appointed as a trustee of Charlton ParkAlthough a pin-up of the hard Brexiteers, Jacob Rees-Mogg denies he has his eyes on No. 10. But does the double-breasted MP have designs on an even grander address?I ask only because Rees-Mogg has been appointed as a trustee of Charlton Park, ancestral Wiltshire seat of the Earl of Suffolk.Jacob and his wife Helena already own a £5 million townhouse near Parliament and a 400-year-old Somerset mansion. But a friend jokes: ‘With six children, Jacob could do with even more space.’The turrets of Charlton Park were converted into flats in the Seventies.

That is what the deal that has been negotiated delivers.\u0027It comes after Mrs May was warned by Japan\u0027s Prime Minister to avoid a no-deal Brexit amid warnings from the country\u0027s car manufacturers.

bilateral meeting at the G20 in Buenos Aires where they discussed Brexit and trade between the two countries Shinzo Abe made the appeal to his British counterpart during talks at the G20 summit in Argentina, as Mrs May looks for partners to help her deliver the promised trading benefits of Brexit. It follows warnings from Honda and Nissan that their UK operations would face huge extra costs and bureaucracy in the event of a cliff-edge Brexit in March 2019.Earlier Britain\u0027s PM spoke to Australian leader Scott Morrison who praised Mrs May\u0027s \u0027resilience and determination\u0027 on Brexit and signalled a new trading relationship could be on the cards.  Honda has said a no-deal Brexit would cost it tens of millions of pounds in additional tariffs and would damage the competitiveness of its Swindon plant.Nissan, which employs 7,000 at Britain\u0027s biggest car factory in Sunderland, has said that a sudden change to World Trade Organisation rules would have \u0027serious implications for British industry\u0027. Meeting Mrs May for talks on the margins of the summit, Mr Abe said: \u0027I would like to take this opportunity to express my tribute to your leadership in realising the Withdrawal Agreement as well as the EU\u0027s agreement on the Political Declaration.\u0027Also I would like to once again ask for your support to avoid no deal as well as to ensure transparency, predictability as well as legal stability in the Brexit process.\u0027 Mrs May said the agreement she has reached with the EU \u0027is a good deal for the UK, it is a good deal for businesses in the UK, including the many Japanese companies who have made significant investment into the UK and who will be able to continue on the basis of our deal to trade well with the European Union from the UK\u0027. She faces an uphill battle to force her isive withdrawal agreement through the House of Commons where many Conservative MPs have vowed to vote against the deal.If Parliament rejects the deal there will be little time for Mrs May to prevent a no-deal departure before exit day on March 29 next year.      Earlier Australian PM Mr Morrison told Mrs May: \u0027I think you\u0027ve shown great resilience and great determination on one of the most vexed issues I think there is.\u0027 The Australian leader praised her \u0027determination to do that in typical British fashion with clear sight of the end goal and to bring some stability on what is a very difficult issue for you and your colleagues.\u0027  He said: \u0027I think you know you have our strong support in continuing to bring it to a good resolution.\u0027 Referring to BAE Systems\u0027 £20 billion contract to build new Australian naval frigates, Mr Morrison said: \u0027Trade relationships

shaking hands, Mrs May joked that the relationship was not always friendly when it came to sporting events, saying: \u0027I should have worn my MCC scarf\u0027. The PM was also meeting Canadian PM Justin Trudeau and Chilean president Sebastian Pinera. Leaders will face tricky negotiations on the final day of the G20 summit as President Donald Trump meets Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping amid threats of a trade war while leaders grapple with addressing climate change despite Mr Trump\u0027s withdrawal from an international deal. A later meeting with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan is expected to focus on Ankara\u0027s investigation into the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at Saudi Arabia\u0027s consulate in Istanbul in October.On Friday, Mrs May delivered a \u0027robust\u0027 message to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that the UK expected his country to co-operate fully with the Turkish probe and to conduct its own investigation in a \u0027credible and transparent\u0027 way.British officials said trade was not on the agenda for the talks with the Saudi heir apparent, known as MBS.Mrs May shook hands with the Saudi prince, who was also berated by French president Emmanuel Macron in a terse conversation captured on video.  European leaders said all-night talks at the summit had resulted in a possible \u0027breakthrough\u0027 on fixing the global trading system.  Countries are making progress on a final statement that will acknowledge problems with the World Trade Organization but commit to reforming it, amid fierce criticism

The prince is at the summit but denies any knowledge of or involvement in Khashoggi\u0027s death.  World leaders did have a brief moment of unity early on Sunday as tributes poured in for former U.S. President George H.W. Bush who died on Friday evening. Mr Trump hailed his predecessor, saying he had \u0027inspired Americans\u0027 with his \u0027essential authenticity, disarming wit, and unwavering commitment to faith, family, and country\u0027. Vladimir Putin joined the tributes, saying: \u0027A distinguished man has passed away.

The worst was dubbed \u0027Armageddon\u0027, with the port of Dover (where a third of all our food supplies arrive from Europe) grinding to a halt. Lorries might then be stuck for days on motorways waiting for import checks as their loads of fresh produce rot.\u0027The supermarkets in Cornwall and Scotland will run out of food within a couple of days, and hospitals will run out of medicines within two weeks,\u0027 said a Government source.The boss of Amazon UK, Doug Gurr, also warned the then Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, that no deal could lead to civil unrest \u0027within days\u0027, leading Raab to confirm the Government was planning to stockpile food. For the first time since the end of rationing in the 1950s, it appointed a Minister responsible for food supplies.          Nevine Mann, 36, and her 37-year-old husband Richard have been buying extra ingredients each time they go shoppingAnd as the clock ticks down on Brexit, it appears increasing numbers aren\u0027t willing to leave things to chance. According to the emergency supplies and survival equipment store Evaq8, in recent weeks sales for items such as water-purification systems and emergency food rations have risen by 103 per cent.\u0027We\u0027ve had at least double the amount of normal orders, and a lot of them were stockpiling food,\u0027 says Zaid Almufti, the company\u0027s sales director. \u0027There\u0027s definitely a stigma attached to prepping but it\u0027s always good to have a plan B.\u0027Like many Brexit preppers, Nevine was braced for ridicule when she disclosed her plans to friends. \u0027Some do think we\u0027re absolutely barmy,\u0027 she admits. \u0027They ask, \u0027Is no-deal Brexit really going to be that much of a problem?\u0027\u0027I say, \u0027Well, yes, potentially. We are planning for the worst although we are hoping for the best.\u0027 \u0027While the traditional image of a prepper is a hippy living in the countryside, Jen McEnhill, 36, is very much an urban professional. A project manager for an advertising agency, she lives alone in a flat in Stoke Newington, North London, and has been stockpiling food since the summer.          Dominic Raab (pictured above) has previously confirmed that the government was planning to stock pile food\u0027When I tell friends and family I have a Brexit box full of provisions in my living room – where they are out of sight so I\u0027m not tempted to use them – they\u0027re like, \u0027What?\u0027 They think I\u0027m prepping for the apocalypse. But some of my friends with young children agree it\u0027s a good idea and want to follow suit. A few years ago I\u0027d have found the idea of stockpiling a bit nutty, but for the past five months, since it became clear there are no clear plans for coping with a no deal, I\u0027ve been buying double amounts of food with a long-shelf life, such as pasta, as well as medicines such as antihistamines and a few treats – like nice vinegars. I\u0027m also filling the freezer with vegetables.\u0027She now has enough to last about three months.\u0027People can\u0027t cope if the supermarkets are closed just for Christmas Day and we can\u0027t necessarily put our trust in the Government to solve this issue quickly, so it\u0027s best to look after ourselves,\u0027 Jen says.Jo Elgarf, 42, who lives in South London with her husband and children Youssef, six, and twins Layla and Nora, four, has compelling reasons to fear the practicalities of a no-deal Brexit.\u0027This isn\u0027t about Remain or Leave, I\u0027m a normal, everyday mum with little interest in politics and I\u0027m not a panicky type,\u0027 she says. \u0027But I used to work for a big food company so I understand the supermarket supply chain and how it can be disrupted.          The amassed goods  are enough to survive a no-deal Brexit for at least four months\u0027It only takes a couple of days\u0027 snow for shelves to empty. So over the past few months, I\u0027ve been doing my shopping for next April now – stockpiling enough food, powdered milk and things like washing-up liquid to keep the family going for six weeks. I\u0027ve also been buying compost to sow seeds in my tiny garden because fresh vegetables may be scarce for a while.\u0027But what Jo fears most is the one thing she can\u0027t prepare for. \u0027My biggest worry is for my daughter Nora: she has cerebral palsy and severe epilepsy and is prescribed lots of imported medicines I can\u0027t buy over the counter. If she doesn\u0027t take them, she can have uncontrollable seizures that could lead to sudden death. If I could store up those medicines in advance, I would, but that\u0027s not possible.\u0027I\u0027ve sought reassurance her medication will be available after a no-deal Brexit, but received none. Not being able to help her is beyond worrying, I feel physically sick thinking about it.\u0027Back in Cornwall, Nevine and Richard have taken Brexit prepping a step further than adding to the weekly shop.Having never been green-fingered, when they moved into their four-bedroom house this summer, the couple started tending a blackberry and raspberry patch to give them fruit in summer and are now growing vegetables, too, studying gardening books for guidance.          Having never been green-fingered, the family started tending a blackberry and raspberry patch to give them fruit in summer and are now growing vegetables\u0027Even the odd carrot or potato will be better than nothing,\u0027 says Nevine.The couple have also prepared \u0027bug out boxes\u0027 – bags stocked with three days\u0027 worth of essentials that can be grabbed quickly in the event of a fast evacuation. They\u0027ve also made it a priority to install solar panels in case of power cuts – a lot of our electricity is imported from France. \u0027We\u0027d always intended to do it, but getting them up became a matter of urgency because a lot of equipment is imported and may not be so readily available after March,\u0027 she says.\u0027There\u0027s the same worry about water, as a lot of the chemicals used to purify our tap water come from Europe, but we have a big rain butt and the equipment to make its water drinkable cost less than £35.\u0027What\u0027s still of concern to the couple are items they can\u0027t stock up on in advance, such as petrol (you\u0027re allowed to store only 30 litres at home) and medicines, many of which are imported and have a short shelf life.The Government has asked pharmaceutical companies to store six weeks\u0027 supply of medication, but what happens after that remains unclear.\u0027My 13-year-old has a severe grass allergy and takes prescription antihistamines – if he can\u0027t get those, then he can\u0027t leave the house for six months,\u0027 says Nevine, who takes medication herself for mild epilepsy.She hopes to get a little extra of the family\u0027s medicines from her GP before the end of March and admits: \u0027At least our conditions aren\u0027t life-threatening. I have a friend whose child has cancer and is receiving chemotherapy where the drugs are very time-sensitive. If she can\u0027t get them, she doesn\u0027t stand a chance. It\u0027s desperately worrying.\u0027Retired police officer James Patrick is the author of a leaflet, Getting Ready Together, with advice for preparing for a no-deal Brexit.While it covers subjects such as how to keep warm in a house with no central heating, he says there\u0027s no need to stockpile more than a week\u0027s supply of food because the delays predicted at the port of Dover for delivery lorries are for about five days.\u0027This is a case of having some candles as well as a torch, a battery-powered radio, perhaps a solar-powered phone-charger,\u0027 he says.\u0027You just need two cupboards of food and some extra toilet roll and coffee – because a lot of it comes through Germany – unless you fancy roasting acorns.\u0027On December 11, the Prime Minister\u0027s Brexit deal will be put to the vote in the House of Commons. Whether it is approved or rejected will be key in establishing the likelihood of a no-deal scenario in March.          Prime Minister Theresa May\u0027s deal will be put to the vote on December 11As Nevine says: \u0027If Brexit passes smoothly, we\u0027ll just eat all the stuff we bought in time, and take any extra to a food bank.\u0027What we\u0027re doing is an insurance policy. We hope never to need it but peace of mind is there.\u0027It\u0027s easy to mock people like Nevine. But if Theresa May\u0027s plans are rejected, it\u0027s safe to say that the ranks of Brexit preppers will be swelling."},{"url":null,"title":"Hunt Palace mole revealed news rift Kate Meghan","story":"Feeling the strain: William, Harry, Meghan and Kate gather at Westminster Abbey for the Armistice centenary service in NovemberIndeed, it now seems likely that William and Kate will spend Christmas not only apart from Harry and his pregnant wife Meghan, but many miles away.So is this further evidence that the two brothers are now more determined than ever to live their lives separately?While the Middletons watch Christmas Strictly and play board games, Royal sources suggest that Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, will be with the Queen and Prince Philip in Norfolk.Speculation has been mounting about the tensions between the two couples for some weeks, particularly since it was revealed that Harry and Meghan are to abandon Kensington Palace, the home and office space they share with William and Kate, in favour of Frogmore Cottage in the grounds of Windsor Castle.This is a striking move – dramatic even – partly because it is rare for a member of the Royal Family as important as Harry not to have Central London base. But more because the brothers have seemed so close throughout their lives. Until now, that is.    It now seems likely that William and Kate will spend Christmas not only apart from Harry and his pregnant wife Meghan, but many miles awayWith the stream of disclosures threatening to become a torrent, The Mail on Sunday understands courtiers at Kensington Palace have started a ‘mole hunt’ in an attempt to stop leaks to the media that have led to so many unfavourable reports.They have certainly not made for comfortable reading. Insiders have claimed, for example, that a rather ‘dictatorial’ Harry has been throwing his weight around, aggrieved that neither his brother nor courtiers and servants have been ‘rolling out the red carpet’ for his new American bride.It has been suggested that Meghan has been brusque with servants and that her exacting wedding preparations led Kate to burst into tears following a bridesmaid fitting for daughter Charlotte. It has been a stressful time all round, it is true. Kate has only recently given birth to her third child, Louis, while Meghan finds herself a newcomer in a foreign land – and a member of the most extraordinary family in Britain. Perhaps a few early false steps and antagonisms were to be expected.Kid Rock gets booted from his grand marshal gig at Nashville...Carole Middleton says she has stopped reading stories about...Kicking up a stink: \u0027Dictatorial\u0027 bride Meghan wanted air...Furious Duchess of Cambridge \u0027fell out with Meghan Markle...Share this articleMeghan, who has worked hard to master her new Royal brief, is well-liked not just by the public, but by her new father-in-law, Prince Charles. He admires her work ethic and shares an interest in the arts.But the MoS understands that the unease between the Cambridges and the Sussexes is more long-standing and has been deeper than has so far been suggested.As early as last Christmas, well before the May wedding, Meghan was suggesting she didn’t feel entirely welcome with all members of the family. And it was in response that Charles attempted to smooth things over by engineering an invitation to Anmer Hall – William and Kate’s country home near Sandringham. He hoped it might bring the couples together.It didn’t go well. Indeed, one well-placed source says the occasion was marred by a ‘ghastly row’ between the couples – one reason there will be no repeat this Christmas. A senior Royal aide has revealed that the atmosphere at Anmer soured shortly after Harry and his then fiancee had arrived, and Meghan was judged to have been ‘downright rude’.          The MoS understands that as early as last Christmas, well before the May wedding, Meghan was suggesting she didn’t feel entirely welcome with all members of the family‘Kate had a quiet word with Meghan,’ says the aide. ‘It escalated rapidly after Meghan complained to Harry that she had been “told off”.‘He took her side, while William defended Kate, who was five months pregnant with Louis and certainly didn’t want this sort of confrontation.’Kate, it is said, already felt put upon in being asked to host Meghan and Harry. Tired and pregnant, she had been hoping for a quiet Christmas. Perhaps the strain showed.At any rate, the atmosphere was ‘poisonous’ for a while, continues the aide, and only thawed with a visit by Charles, who was told by William what had happened and did his best to jolly everyone along.This is by no means an isolated example of Meghan’s supposed high-handedness, according to chatter in Royal circles.A new book by Royal commentator Robert Jobson even claimed Harry had previously told one staff member: \u0027What Meghan wants, she gets.\u0027The MoS understands that the unease between the Cambridges and the Sussexes is more long-standing and has been deeper than has so far been suggested (pictured: Meghan and Kate at the wedding of Princess Eugenie)This newspaper has learned from one of William’s closest friends that the Prince had doubts about how suitable Meghan might be as his brother’s bride – and that he voiced them.It is understood William’s concerns reached the ears of the Queen and, more pertinently, of Harry himself. One member of William’s circle told the MoS: ‘The problem is that the Cambridges felt things had moved very quickly between Harry and Meghan. Wills particularly was worried and felt close enough to Harry to voice his thoughts.’The two boys were brought especially close by the death of their mother, and William has always kept an eye out for his younger brother. But few of us like it when our romantic choice is questioned – and this appears to be the case with Harry now.Royal observers are asking, too, if William fears that Meghan is in some way assuming the space occupied by his late mother Diana. A beautiful, fashion-loving Royal determined to make her mark through charitable works? The parallels are inevitable.          The two boys were brought especially close by the death of their mother, and William has always kept an eye out for his younger brotherKate, in contrast, has taken a less showy approach to her role. She has dutifully accepted advice on how to dress and how to deport herself as a Royal, whereas Meghan has so far seemed determined to strike out on her own – on occasion at least.It is understood that Kate has had a number of meetings over tea in which she has attempted to explain the rules of The Firm to Meghan – and that her advice didn’t go down well. Kate is said to have told friends she was very sad about what was happening and felt that Harry was ‘changing’.‘She and Harry have always had a very close relationship, but she said things were different,’ says one. But if William’s wife has become adept at fading into the background, that does not make her soft.On the contrary. ‘Meghan’s a strong character and so is Kate, so it doesn’t surprise me there have been clashes,’ said the source.Indeed, some are calling her a Steel Marshmallow, a phrase first applied to William and Harry’s great-grandmother, the late Queen Mother.With the days that William, Kate and Harry went around together as a dynamic team now decisively over, they are leading lives that are not only increasingly separate, but very different.Harry and Meghan spent a considerable part of the summer in their rented house in Oxfordshire where they entertained friends including George and Amal Clooney, and tennis star Serena Williams. Theirs is a markedly more celebrity-driven ‘court’ than has been normal for the Royals in recent times, and quite different from the so-called Turnip Toffs who make up William and Kate’s group of friends in Norfolk.And with the celebrity associates, it seems, come celebrity anxieties.So uncomfortable have they grown with a steady stream of media disclosures, it seems that Harry and Meghan are now determined to bring them to a halt.It will be fascinating to see just what or who the Royal ‘mole-hunt’ unearths."},{"url":null,"title":"Let women paid surrogate mums says family judge","story":"    Sir James Munby also defended the right of women in their 50s and 60s to have children because ‘today’s 60 is like yesterday’s 40’\u0027I would rather die on the operating table than have a...Britain\u0027s first cloned dog Minnie Winnie - the duplicated...Share this articleWomen are banned from advertising themselves as surrogates or receiving payment other than to cover ‘reasonable expenses’, but Sir James argued that in reality a market already exists in the UK as payments are frequently ‘dressed up as expenses’.He added: ‘How is a judge supposed to assess whether the £10,000 paid, for example, is a genuine expense. By and large even in the cases the court says it’s not a proper expense, the judge waves it through because otherwise what do you do?‘It’s probably better to face up to reality and move to a proper system of regulation rather than prohibition.’During 20 years at the High Court, Sir James, 70, said he had witnessed ‘an incredible change’ in family life.Citing a landmark case involving a transgender man, born female, who wanted to become the first woman in history to be legally registered as the father, rather than the mother, on their baby’s birth certificate, Sir James said: ‘If someone would have said ten years ago that, in a decade’s time, there’s going to be a case in the family ision on whether you can have a father without having a mother, people would have thought you were bonkers.‘Every concept of what a family is, every concept of what a parent-child relationship is, is very much back in the melting pot.‘Society is moving on and the challenge for lawmakers is what steps, if any, we take to accommodate those changes into our legal framework.’ He added: ‘Many people have experience of people who have gone down the IVF route, surrogacy route or same-sex marriage route and they’ve realised that these are not people with horns. They are very nice people – they just happen to have a different lifestyle.’          Sir James was the most senior family court judge in England and Wales before his retirement in JulySir James also spoke about the controversial rise in older women having babies. The Mail on Sunday revealed earlier this year that in England and Wales the number of babies born to women over 50 had risen by more than 300 per cent compared to 15 years ago.Under NHS rules, women over the age of 42 cannot receive free fertility treatment due to the low chance of success, although IVF clinics are free to set their own criteria.Some critics have argued that having a baby at such an advanced age is ‘selfish’ because they will not be around to see their child grow up, but Sir James argued the growth in life expectancy means many over-60s will see their children into adulthood.‘Modern 60-year-old grannies don’t look like grannies did 50 years ago,’ said Sir James, ahead of a speech at the Progress Educational Trust annual conference this week.‘There is the question of whether it is right and fair to be mothering a child if you’re unlikely to live until it’s an adult,’ he said.‘But the expectation of life for women is 85 give or take. Well if it’s 85 you will comfortably live to see your child become an adult if you have an artificial baby at 60. Today’s 60 is like yesterday’s 40.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"What dates food choice says big night going","story":"    If your date chooses steak and chips in preference to a rocket salad, it might be that he or she just isn’t that into youRevealed: First pictures of Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra\u0027s...\u0027It\u0027s a bit more up to date than my studio\u0027: Stockton shed...Share this articleExperiments found that if the companion across the table is attractive, both men and women will reduce their calorie count by up to 20 per cent. Experts suspect ‘signalling theory’ – where ‘people show their desire to be healthy to a potential mate by eating less’ – may explain the results. ‘It could be said that people adhere to the mantra of “you are what you eat”, eating low-calorie meals in an effort to appear healthier and more attractive in the presence of a dining partner,’ say researchers writing in the journal Appetite.‘If one orders a high-calorie meal, this behaviour may signal a lack of concern regarding personal health.’The researchers from East Carolina in the US analysed what 600 men and women ate when faced with dining in different scenarios. "},{"url":null,"title":"Simon Cowell talks ITV hold Brexit debate no politicians","story":"Simon Cowell is in talks with ITV to hold a Brexit debate without any politiciansSimon Cowell is in talks with ITV to hold a Brexit debate featuring business leaders and 500 members of the public – but no politicians.A source close to Cowell’s TV production company Syco Entertainment said the audience would be representative of the result of the 2016 referendum.‘Simon wants to see how many change their stance during the debate,’ the insider said.Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have agreed in principle to go head-to-head on television next Sunday, but the Prime Minister wants the debate to be aired on the BBC while the Labour leader favours rival ITV.Meanwhile, Cowell, pictured left, has also revealed plans for a celebrity version of The X Factor – similar to the format of the BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing – in an effort to revive flagging ratings.

Nor would the government, he said, be a \u0027simple facilitator of pillaging, as it has been.\u0027 Lopez Obrador later addressed a massive crowd of supporters in the heart of the capital, promising to put Mexico\u0027s sizeable indigenous minority first in his drive to root out inequality.Referencing one of his heroes, the 19th-century Mexican President Benito Juarez, who separated the church and the state, Lopez Obrador said his government would ensure a ide between economic and political power in the country.Making 16 references to \u0027neo-liberal\u0027 policies in his speech, he vowed to abolish the \u0027regime\u0027 he said it had created.He blamed the government of his predecessor, Enrique Pena Nieto, for causing a plunge in oil output by opening the energy industry in Latin America\u0027s no. 2 economy to private investment.Instead, he vowed to ramp up public investment to rescue state oil company Pemex, which is suffering from heavy debts.At the end of the celebrations in the main square he gave a 90-minute speech to the thousands of jubilant fans jamming the Zocalo, vowing to help the poor in a nation where almost half the population lives in poverty. \u0027We are going to govern for everyone, but we are going to give preference to the most impoverished and vulnerable,\u0027 Mr Lopez Obrador said.\u0027For the good of all, the poor come first. \u0027Be patient and have confidence in me.\u0027 More than 30 million Mexicans voted for Mr Lopez Obrador in a sweeping July 1 election victory that also gave his party a majority in congress. Despite the landslide of support for the new leader,  worries are mounting among critics who see an expanding authoritarian streak.\u0027The country is completely ided,\u0027 said Valeria Moy, director of the Mexico, Como Vamos? think tank.Ms Moy said she had expected a more conciliatory tone from the president, who instead blamed many of Mexico\u0027s ills on decades of neoliberal policies that opened the country to greater trade and foreign investment.

He\u0027s hard-working.

Mexico\u0027s President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador addresses supporters after receiving the staff of command from indigenous people during the AMLO Fest at Zocalo square in Mexico City,          At the end of the festivities, the president gave a 90-minute speech to his adoring crowd in which he pledged to bring about a \u0027radical\u0027 rebirth of Mexico to overturn what he called a disastrous legacy of decades of \u0027neo-liberal\u0027 governments.Traditional healers brushed him with bunches of herbs and blew incense smoke over him to purify him, and they invoked the spirits of their ancestors and the land to liberate him from any bad influences.\u0027What we want, what we desire is to purify public life in Mexico,\u0027 Mr Lopez Obrador said during the ceremony.\u0027I repeat my commitment: I will not lie, I will not steal or betray the people of Mexico.\u0027His vow to root out government graft resonates with many, including some who have disagreements with him on other matters.Mexico\u0027s richest man, telecom magnate Carlos Slim, whose companies were major investors in the cancelled airport project, said there is common ground with Mr Lopez Obrador\u0027s promises to rein in wasteful spending and corruption.\u0027Everybody wants spending to be efficiently managed,\u0027 Mr Slim said.As part of his inauguration day, Mr Andres Lopez Obrador and his wife Beatriz Gutierrez Mueller met Spain\u0027s King Felipe VI at the National Palace in Mexico City Mr Lopez Obrador breezed through a day of public appearances that included taking the oath of office and speaking to congress before attending the inauguration.      "},{"url":null,"title":"Adult asylum seeker posed child treated child British authorities","story":"Siavash, the refugee student removed from Stoke High School in Ipswich (pictured by another student on Snapchat) has been confirmed as an adult by the Home Office after they initially accepted he was 15Stoke High School, whose principal is Caroline Wilson, has also been accused of failing  its children with critics saying his true age should have been \u0027spotted from day one\u0027.Desmond Newby, 51, kept his daughters Jamie, 15, and Alicia, 13, out of class while the man was there and said today: \u0027All I wanted in the first place was for him to be removed. I\u0027m ashamed both for the school and the Government for allowing this to happen. They have both failed to protect our children. The teachers should be sacked\u0027.He added: \u0027If the kids knew he\u0027s the age he is, how come the school didn\u0027t know?\u0027How come the school that\u0027s supposed to take care of our children have let this happen? They\u0027re supposed to safeguard them.\u0027The student was suspended earlier this month after a fellow student posted a Snapchat picture of him in uniform in a classroom with the message: \u0027How\u0027s there a 30-year-old man in our maths class?\u0027Mr Newby, who lives with his wife Victoria, 32, said Jamie had sat an exam with the alleged asylum seeker.The father said: \u0027We took our kids out of school as soon as it happened.\u0027I went down there and asked them about it. I said you don\u0027t know who he is, what he\u0027s there for.\u0027I said what about the safety of the kids?\u0027 The professional driver from Ipswich, Suffolk added that he was \u0027furious\u0027 that parents had not been kept better informed about the investigation into the alleged asylum seeker\u0027s age.He said: \u0027The school are keeping their mouths shut about it.\u0027If there\u0027s nothing to hide, why don\u0027t they just tell everyone?\u0027The student\u0027s classmates had also discovered what appeared to be old pictures of him on Facebook, showing him with a full beard, a hairy chest and swigging a beer.          The man was suspended from school after classmates started questioning his age and also claimed they found  pictures of him on Facebook swigging a beer in Germany (pictured) with a full beardOne boy even claimed he confessed to being a married father-of-two during a game of football in the playground.The man\u0027s brother was in Year 7 but the Home Office insists he is a child, but he has been moved to a new school.Mr Newby said of the GCSE pupil: \u0027The children are worried because being in that position, he could have been anyone.\u0027If the Home Office is supposed to be checking the immigrants when they come into the country, how come they just turn around and look at someone and say yes, they\u0027re 15 years old?Who cares about Thanksgiving! Shoppers hit the stores to...\u0027The Government must take the gloves off\u0027: Manchester...MI5 and police\u0027s inquiry into themselves finds they made NO...Share this article     The Year 11 pupil who claimed to be aged 15 but looks far older with Facebook posts alleged to show him with a thick beard and sipping beers Pupils became suspicious when they saw that the clean shaven pupil appeared to have the shadow of a beard on his face.They then discovered the Facebook profile in his name which described him as having been an architecture student at the Islamic Azad University in Abadan, Iran, before living in Erfurt, Germany.The pictures on the now deleted profile showed him with a beard and drinking a bottle of beer on a street, and also included an image of the boy who was said to be his younger brother.          Caroline Wilson is the executive principal of Stoke High School – Ormiston Academy, which has 668 students It was also revealed that the pupil allegedly bombarded a 15-year-old girl classmate with text messages, prompting her to complain to safeguarding staff - because she was worried about his true age.But the girl was told that there was nothing \u0027sinister\u0027 about the texts as they were not of a sexual nature. When shown the alleged Facebook picture of the pupil with a beard, the teacher allegedly said that people matured at different ages. She stopped receiving messages from him after she complained.A mother of another pupil said the man had told her son that he was aged 25 and was married with two children when he was asked if he wanted to join in a game of football at break time.Some outraged parents withdrew their children from the school over the scandal, forcing senior staff to remove the asylum seeker from class.Mother and fathers claimed children were potentially being put in danger by the presence of a man posing as a boy.The Home Office has refused to reveal the newly assessed age of the man or any details of his background due to data protection issues. Officials who rubber-stamped his status as a child now face an investigation into how and why they came to that decision amid claims they just took him at \u0027face value\u0027. The school, whose principal is Caroline Wilson, also faces safeguarding questions.   The Home Office is currently investigating how the man\u0027s claim to be aged 15 came to be believed and he is believed to have been moved from the area.A Home Office spokesman said: \u0027We are fully committed to safeguarding children and are looking into the circumstances of this case to understand how it was handled.\u0027Age-disputed cases remain a challenging area of work in which no single assessment technique, or combination of techniques, is likely to determine an inidual\u0027s age with precision.\u0027In the absence of clear and credible documentary evidence, Home Office staff must rely on physical appearance and demeanour to make an initial assessment on whether a person claiming to be a child is under 18.\u0027If an inidual is assessed to be under 18, but subsequent concerns about their age are raised - for example by a school - we will act quickly to reconsider the case.\u0027 The spokesman confirmed that asylum seekers claiming to be aged under 18 are believed and treated as children by the Home Office unless they meet one of three criteria.They are only assessed as adults if there is \u0027clear and credible documentary evidence\u0027 that they are, an approved local authority assessment reaches the conclusion or if two immigration officers rule that their \u0027physical appearance or demeanour very strongly suggests they are significantly over 18 years of age\u0027.          The man\u0027s brother was also at Stoke High in Ipswich, but the Home Office say they are sure he is a child. He has been moved to another schoolIn the case of immigration officers making the ruling, at least one of them has to be of Chief Immigration Officer grade or above.The Home Office spokesperson added: \u0027When there is doubt about an inidual\u0027s claim to be a child, the inidual will be referred to a local authority\u0027s social services department for a careful, case law-compliant age assessment and they will be treated as a child until a decision on their age is made.\u0027If an inidual is assessed to be over 18, we will process any asylum claim as being made by an adult. If the application is unsuccessful, and appeal rights are exhausted, removal action will be pursued as appropriate.\u0027In the absence of documentary evidence, Home Office staff are only able to treat a claimant as an adult if their physical appearance and demeanour very strongly suggest that they are significantly over 18 years of age - and where two officers have reached this conclusion independently.\u0027The threshold is set deliberately high so that only those who are very clearly over 18 are assessed as adults.\u0027The man started at Stoke High School which is run by the Ormiston Academies Trust soon after the start of term in September. The pupil was removed from the school earlier this month on the day he was due to sit a mock GCSE maths exam and has not been seen there since. The younger pupil who claimed to be his brother was taken out of school at the same time.The Ormiston Academies Trust confirmed at the time that the pupils were \u0027not attending the school\u0027 and that it had asked the Home Office to investigate the case. The stepfather of a girl in the same class as the pupil said he had gone to the school to complain before the man was removed and had contacted Suffolk Police to make a complaint that a grown man was \u0027posing as a pupil\u0027 in her class.He said: \u0027They logged my call and advised me to go back to the school and demand what action they were going to take.\u0027I ended up speaking to this teacher who said that the Facebook picture of the boy was a case of mistaken identity.\u0027The teacher actually threatened that all the parents who were jumping on the bandwagon could face legal action because complaining about the pupil was a criminal offence. He was basically calling all the parents bullies. \u0027The teacher told me that he had children himself and all the paperwork and been looked at for this person and had been passed by the Home Office. I was absolutely livid and was trying to behave myself.\u0027He was so ignorant and not really listening to what I was saying. I wanted to kick him up the backside and tell him not to be so naïve. My last words to him were, \u0027You have not heard the last about this\u0027. A spokesman for Suffolk County Council denied that it was involved in the age assessment of the pupil and Suffolk Police said they do not believe there is any police investigation into the case. Migrant man who posed as a schoolboy still classed as a child despite stubble and receding hairline"},{"url":null,"title":"Apprentice fans clock Sir Alan Sugar wearing SEVEN different Rolexes nine episodes","story":"    Sir Alan Sugar wore a silver Rolex Daytona worth £20,000 on episode one of series 14 of The Apprentice          On episode two, the business tycoon flashed a silver and black Sky-dweller Rolex worth £20,000He also donned an 18 carat yellow gold Yacht-Master II worth £30,000 in episode five where Rick Monk was booted from the show after contestants created their own footwear brand.In one episode Lord Sugar flashed a watch, originally designed for Pan American Airways pilots, worth an impressive £90,000. The Apprentice EXCLUSIVE: Tom admits he felt \u0027relaxed\u0027 going...\u0027A load of Jackson Pollocks!\u0027 Lord Sugar\u0027s barb about the...Share this articleAnd the seven Rolexes worn throughout the latest series are estimated to have cost Lord Sugar around £230,000.Eagle-eyed viewers were quick to point out the tycoon\u0027s varied collection of expensive wrist wear throughout the series.

Sally Rooney, by her own admission, has observed the former to the exclusion of the latter. “I’ve never attempted to write from the perspective of someone older than me so my novels are all about my cohort,” she says. “That’s not about making a statement but it’s what I can do.”Given that she had written two novels by her mid-20s, her cohort was inevitably limited. The main characters of both are Dublin university students – as Rooney herself was when she began to write them. Frances and Bobbi, from her debut Conversations With Friends, are ex-lovers with a burgeoning performance poetry partnership, while Marianne and Connell, in its follow-up Normal People, are “culchie” schoolfriends who, like their creator, move to the big city from small-town Ireland.The history of fiction is littered with callow university novels, so what happened next was extraordinary: almost as soon as Conversations with Friends appeared in the spring of 2017, Rooney was being hailed as the voice of the millennials, a Snapchat Salinger. It was an intensity of acclaim that happens once or twice in a generation, placing her alongside Donna Tartt or Zadie Smith as a writer who appeared to emerge fully formed, not only in her craft but as a literary celebrity and a mouthpiece for something in the culture that needed to be articulated.Unlike Tartt or Smith, she already had a second novel ready to roll: in a rare state of excitability, the literary world held its breath for the arrival of Normal People, and before it had even been published it was longlisted for the Man Booker prize. Though it didn’t make the Booker shortlist, it has just been announced as Waterstones book of the year and won Rooney the award for international author of 2018 at the Specsavers national book awards. It is also shortlisted for the Costa book awards.The woman who arrives to meet me at a stylish new coffee and yoga joint around the corner from the flat she shares with her maths teacher partner, is now all of 27 years old. Neatly and unobtrusively dressed, she talks rapidly in a manner that is simultaneously confident and self-deprecating.Her characters drift in and out of relationships and talk earnestly of politics and literary theory they holiday in France or Italy but sometimes don’t have enough money to eat. But Rooney is quick to brush away any suggestion that she is a cultural pundit, saying: “I certainly never intended to speak for anyone other than myself. Even myself I find it difficult to speak for. My books may well fail as artistic endeavours but I don’t want them to fail for failing to speak for a generation for which I never intended to speak in the first place.”So what was the journey that brought her to this destination? “I can’t look back and say I was clearly on a trajectory. For ages it just seemed I was going round and round in circles, getting nowhere,” she says. Her biography, for someone who only broke the surface less than two years ago, is well rehearsed. In her own construction: “I was born in the same year a Virgin megastore was raided for selling condoms without a pharmacist present. Two years before the decriminalisation of homosexuality. Four years before the legalisation of orce.”In a more prosaic version, she was the middle of three children born in the county town of Castlebar to a father who worked for Telecom Éireann and a mother who ran the local arts centre. There were always books around the house and they encouraged her to read but, though she joined a creative writing group at 15, she didn’t take to school. “I think a large part of it was that it was being a teenager, which I didn’t enjoy,” she says. “But I don’t respond to authority very well. I fundamentally don’t agree with accepting authority that you haven’t agreed to in some way. As a funnel – as a way of making children into adults – I don’t think it’s good practice.”She did not see herself as a high achiever. “I was not a precocious child. Before I went to do my degree I told my mother I was never going to read anything written before 1920. School was all about learning by rote and I can do that to a very passable degree, but I’d never do homework or assignments. I wasn’t failing, but I didn’t have any opportunity to pursue what interested me.”She nevertheless won a place at Trinity College Dublin, which – numbering Oscar Wilde and Samuel Beckett, not to mention Enright, among its alumni – must surely have seemed pretty prestigious. Ah, she parries, but she didn’t get on to her first choice of course, being consigned to English literature when she had elected to study English and sociology. “I guess in a way maybe I was lucky. It was a completely new way of thinking about books and literature and it felt intellectually challenging. I was grappling with the modernists and 19th-century novels and even now I’m still developing the ability to read intelligently, which I hope will continue for the rest of my life.”In her second year she took up debating, which took her on a team outing to Manchester, where she won the 2013 European University Debating Championships. But once again she is keen to play it down. “It was definitely interesting, though my experience with the competitive side of things is that it’s actually like a game. I was going to say like football but I think it’s less intellectually involved than football. Really it’s more like Scrabble.”Her writing life also began to take shape in her second year, after – like the two central characters in Normal People – she was awarded a scholarship that would pay her food, rent and tuition and enable her to stay on for an MA. In the novel this experience is bisected along class lines, with well-to-do Marianne accepting it as a personal validation, while for Connell – whose single mother cleans for Marianne’s family – it is an intellectual lifeline. Which was it for Rooney herself? “It meant a huge amount to me,” she says. “My parents had been supporting me and I don’t think it would have been realistic for them to go on doing so for a master’s degree. It gave me a sense of security, and permission just to keep my place there for a longer period of time.”She enrolled for a master’s in politics but dropped it after a few weeks in favour of American studies, completing a draft of Conversations With Friends in three months. “But it was a very drafty draft,” she says, so she put it away and wrote the first of two Connell and Marianne stories, in which they were in their mid-20s but clearly had a backstory dating to their school days. That first story went nowhere but the second, At the Clinic, was published in a literary magazine.After she went back to Conversations and knocked it into shape, things began to move quickly: it was snapped up by Faber in a seven-way auction, and a month after delivering her MA thesis she began work on Normal People. “I thought of Conversations as my trial novel,” she says drily, “so it gave me a huge amount of permission to write the same thing over again.”Student milieu aside, Normal People is not in fact the same novel over again. If Jane Austen could construct worlds on “two inches of ivory” Rooney has built them on a wafer of silicon: her characters are inhabitants of the networked society: they communicate by instant messaging, texts and email, but what it means to them is singular. For Frances, the scratchy first-person narrator of Conversations, it’s a way of keeping control when both her emotions and her body are in constant danger of letting her down, while Normal People’s Connell perceives it as a loss of autonomy. “He and Marianne can only talk over email, using the same communication technologies they now know are under surveillance, and it feels at times like their relationship has been captured in a complex network of state power, that the network is a form of intelligence in itself, containing them both, and containing their feelings for each other.”The one area of personal relationships that cannot be electronically controlled is sex, which links lovers to friends in shifting and unpredictable combinations. The style in which Rooney writes about it is disarmingly plain. “In bed he asked me what felt good a lot,” says Frances, when she first sleeps with the married actor Nick, in Conversations With Friends. “I said everything felt good, I felt very flushed and I could hear myself making a lot of noise but only syllables, no real words. I closed my eyes. The inside of my body was hot like oil, I was possessed by an overwhelming and intense energy which seemed to threaten me. Please, I was saying. Please, please … But I surrendered without a struggle.”“So much of our sexual culture and vocabulary has the potential to be degrading,” says Rooney, “There’s an archaic language which is guaranteed to sound false or the language of pornography which is not actually true. I was trying to be true. What I’m interested in to a large extent is intimacy, the discomfort, the loss of self – of being penetrated literally and also psychologically.”Both novels are, to some extent, accounts of sexual obsessions. “Some people feel the sex isn’t very sexy but I’m not writing them for that,” she says. “Perhaps I’m trying to learn something about the characters through it, so it would be coy to have the scenes all off page.” Yet when her editor suggested that the sex in Normal People was a little too coy, Rooney resisted, arguing that, in the early stages of their relationship at least, Connell and Marianne didn’t have a sexual vocabulary “so to over-literalise would be to put ways of thinking into their heads that they wouldn’t have been able to articulate for themselves. On the other hand,” she says, “I was probably trying to avoid writing it. That’s the gift of being able to come up with a plausible argument.”The politics of surrender is a recurrent theme, though the symmetries in which her characters find themselves are far from templates of #MeToo injustice. Nick might be older and married but he is in some ways weaker, less fully formed, than Frances Connell might betray Marianne early on, but he is also her saviour. The monsters – a fascist boyfriend, an abusive brother – are pushed firmly to the margins. “There’s so much fiction and general cultural discourse around #MeToo, but it’s something I just don’t find very interesting to explore. I’m not interested in the psychology of cruel, abusive, exploitative people.”But there’s something else going on too, which is central to how she identifies her cohort: “Men,” she says, “are not so dissimilar really. It didn’t feel that writing about them was a leap because the thing about gender is that I don’t really believe in it. It’s a series of cultural practices, whereas being in your 40s and with children, for instance, is something I can’t imagine myself to be.”Both novels have a moment in which a character thinks they, or their lover, might be pregnant – and it’s here that they are in some ways at their most culturally particular. When she wrote the books, abortion was illegal in Ireland. This spring, a referendum changed the law so, for all the apparent currency of their fears, her characters already occupy a space that is sealed in the past.The long-running debate over abortion gave Rooney her political voice as a teenager outraged by activists who rolled up at her school to show pro-life propaganda videos. In a powerful essay for the London Review of Books earlier this year she deployed the full might of her debating skills in articulating her rage, concluding a thorough demolition of the case against abortion with the conclusion that “in the relationship between foetus and woman, the woman is granted fewer rights than a corpse”.Shortly after the referendum she announced her decision to stop tweeting, saying “novelists are given too much political prominence”. Several times in our conversation she invokes footballers as an elite that puts writers in their place. When I point this out, she explains that it is because “through no fault of their own they have a sublime gift and there’s nothing in their personality that would necessarily mean they enjoy fame. They don’t choose to be celebrities in the way that actors do. They just have it heaped on them.” For all her demurrals, it’s an analysis that clearly speaks for her own anxieties.How does she account for the way that Ireland’s literary culture has not only survived the economic crash but flourished in it? “I’m assuming that there are weirdos everywhere who like writing prose and poetry but not everywhere has the literary heritage and the support for little magazines that enables them to be published,” she says. “Then there’s the particular nature of the crash, which came out of our first ever period of prosperity and revealed it to be a mirage.”“Capitalism is to Rooney’s young women what Catholicism was to Joyce’s young men, a rotten national faith to contend with,” wrote one reviewer. Rooney is happy with that. For all her fascination with the human condition, with the pain and pleasures of the romantic merry-go-round, one thing’s for sure: “As a writer in Dublin it’s hard not to think about property.”Conversations With Friends and Normal People are published by Faber (£8.99, £14.99) To order a copy for £7.91 or £10.49 go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846 Free UK p\u0026ampp over £10, online orders only.

The company’s answer? Move the cityThe crack appeared a few years ago, and has been creeping towards the town of Kiruna ever since.“The mines are underneath us,” says Göran Cars. It’s early afternoon but the sun is already setting behind the mountain, colouring the clouds and outlining the town’s most prominent feature: two huge smokestacks. “And you can see the direction of the cracks – coming from the mine, and going straight up to the city centre.”The mine, Kiirunavaara, is the reason this Swedish town of roughly 20,000 people deep in northern Lapland exists at all. It is the world’s largest iron ore mine, and it dominates both economically and visually, the smokestacks sending up twin plumes of black smoke from the denuded mountain like a kind of Arctic Mordor.Over a century, the miners have tunnelled so deep into the earth – 2km at some points – that they have now literally undermined the town. The caverns are causing subsidence, weakening the structure of the buildings, and opening a great crack in the earth itself, which grows wider and several metres closer to the city every year. Kiruna is about to be swallowed by the very mine that gave it life.So, in 2004, a plan was hatched. Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB (LKAB), the gigantic state-owned company that operates the mine, would simply move the city – houses and all.It was Cars who was given the responsibility to plan that new city.“The basic idea here was to have a town square, because the present town doesn’t have a town square,” Cars said last week at the ribbon-cutting for City Hall, the first building in the new Kiruna. A very modern and very gold building designed by the Danish architects Henning Larsen, its most notable feature is that it has an art gallery built into it – the new Konstmuseet i Norr – a rectangular structure that squats inside the atrium like a cube of potato wrapped in smoked salmon.Currently, City Hall sits more or less alone in what feels like the middle of nowhere. In fact the site was the former city dump, and then a succession of factories and junkyards known locally as Death Valley. But if Cars is to be believed, by no later than 1 September 2020 there will be an entire town on this spot.The plans show mixed-use commercial and residential buildings, cinemas, libraries and hotels, radiating in broad avenues from City Hall – and all of it built at the kind of super-dense scale you expect in a capital city, not a sprawling town 100 miles north of the Arctic Circle.The scale of the project is unprecedented. Several dozen buildings will be moved by a specially assembled team of experts who have become so good at their jobs that Cars claims it’s now usually cheaper to move a home than to demolish and rebuild. The huge wooden church will be hoisted and moved other buildings, such as the current city hall and the railway station, will be stripped of aesthetic elements, including lampposts and iron railings, to be incorporated into new structures.And all of it will be paid for by LKAB. It’s not exactly generosity that is motivating the company. “The law is crystal clear,” Cars says. “The mine is required by Swedish national law to compensate for the structural damage it has caused.”It’s also about survival. “Part of Kiruna’s absolute problem is that women have been moving away from the town while men have been staying on,” Cars says. He tells of efforts to attract foreign women to marry mineworkers. “Russians were popular. You had ads: ‘Wealthy miners looking for female company’, he says, adding: “This was some time ago.”The deeper the mine, the more expensive it becomes to remove the iron – and the number of jobs is dropping, too, due to automation. In a globalised age it is increasingly hard to convince young people with university degrees to live deep inside the Arctic Circle.“Our employees live here,” says Johan Mäkitaavola, project manager of LKAB. “I live in Kiruna. I want to have a nice city to live in. I hope my children will stay here or at least come back when they have studied. We need educated people to move to Kiruna and work.”To survive, the city needs to ersify. It is already home to a budding space industry, and in the winter there are direct flights from Tokyo and Shanghai for sightseers eager to glimpse the northern lights. It remains impossible, however, to imagine Kiruna without LKAB, and vice versa.“It’s a big deal,” says Alice Bah Kuhnke, the Swedish minister for culture and democracy, who attended the opening ceremony along with the king of Sweden. “Big. For Swedes, LKAB has almost been part of our DNA – they are so important to the finances of the Swedish state. So for us that’s a really challenging thought, because since it’s such a big deal it’s hard as a politician and as a Swede to really be critical enough.”Part of that means acknowledging an inconvenient truth – the fact that the new town sits on the territory of the Sami, the indigenous people of Lapland, whose reindeer herding is frequently disrupted by mining. The Sami convene their Swedish parliament in Kiruna – though you wouldn’t know it from the opening ceremony.“They just don’t need to give a fuck so they don’t give a fuck,” says Nils Johan Labba with a shrug. A traditional craftsman with an 18-month waiting list for his knives, he is also a member of the Sami parliament. “We have a reindeer community here, this is their moving territory. Or it was – everything changed with the city. Kiruna as a city doesn’t take much consideration about Sami people or Sami lifestyles.”A sense of betrayal is rooted in the Sami experience in Kiruna several Sami told me versions of an apocryphal story about a Sami man discovering a special heavy stone, and being tricked by a Swedish prospector into revealing the location of the iron ore deposits.The company seems exasperated by the issue. “They have their interest in this land and we have ours,” says Mäkitaavola. “So it’s a problem. It’s not easy.”Stefan Sydberg, Kiruna’s deputy mayor, acknowledges the Sami people’s interests must be respected. “But moving the city centre to this area has the least impact, because this is an old industrial area. There haven’t been any reindeer in this area since before the city transformation.“We can’t just sit and say we can’t do anything because we have the reindeer herders. We have to evolve as a city. Because they prosper from that as well.”The impression Kiruna’s officials clearly want to give is of a kind of northern Swedish pragmatism. The city wouldn’t exist without the mine, so it had to be moved yes, of course that is expensive true, it’s Sami territory, but what isn’t? Up here, you simply get the job done.The townspeople are less sanguine. Jan Lindgren is the third-generation owner of Centrum JW Lindgren clothing store (“They always film our sign when they shoot something in Kiruna – the sign and the mountain”) and speaks with a mixture of anxiety and resignation about having to move in 2022. “At first we were negative,” he says. “But we thought it would be very good if they do the right things from the beginning. If they do what they say they will do.”He’ll be renting in the new town, and the shop will be smaller. “There’s a lot of history here,” he says. “But we have planned for 10 or 12 years. We discussed. Would it be the same views? We can see the mountains on a clear day here, but not in the new place. That’s sad.”As well as being less picturesque, the new city centre is colder: flatter, windier and more exposed, though presumably the new buildings will mitigate that barrenness.Mixed feelings abound. “It’s complicated. Even Sami people work in the mine sometimes,” says Grahn. “So it’s not simple to take a stand.”But she says it remains important to show that there is more to Kiruna than the wishes of the company. One of her artworks displayed at the gallery is a bouncy castle, shaped and painted to resemble a mountain. A window beside it has a view of an actual mountain, Luossavaara – a disused mine – as well as tiny mountains of rubble: the first construction sites of the new Kiruna buildings. “I don’t think I need to explain the sadness,” she says, and mentions another mining project – this one in Jokkmokk, in Sami territory south of Kiruna.“I mean, look how right he is,” she says, her eyes wide as she looks out past her inflatable mountain to the actual one. “They’re moving a whole town.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57597775796b3ff16059168d3cf842d409ae645e/0_0_3302_1982/master/3302.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90e5c7e58df44b7a39072ebc52b2342a","title":"cinema journalism defence peterloo","story":"I asked a few cinephiles to name some popular movies that had raised public awareness about an important issue. Before we come to their suggestions, some context. The stories of journalism and of democracy are entwined. Agitation for universal suffrage, pressure for better representation, coverage of campaigns, scrutiny of vote counts and a chronicle of the action and inaction of those who win elections – all are threads in the development of journalism, just as the details form the fabric of democratic governance itself, in every country where it survives.At this time of challenge to journalism – commercially and otherwise from social media rhetorically and otherwise from some politicians – it might help for the story of journalismdemocracy to be told afresh, and in a way that reminds us of the indispensability of journalism to democracy. Cultures are supple. They can inform, persuade, shift opinion by means other than headlines and bulletins. A new film, Peterloo, made me wonder whether the links between journalism and democracy might be reaffirmed for our times through a movie, a really good and popularly accessible movie or TV series.Peterloo is not that, though it is in many respects fine film-making. It tells the story of how democratic sentiments simmered in industrialising, post-French revolution England, and it climaxes at a reform rally at Manchester in 1819 that was broken up with lethal violence by the authorities. The film touches on the journalism of the day, but it is not the focus. Near the end the reporters disperse to spread their accounts of the repression they have witnessed. We don’t see the outcome, but we can anticipate the role newspapers played in the years that led to the reform acts of 1832, which expanded the franchise, though not to those without property, or to women. Democracy is a long, unfinished story.John Edward Taylor, who was among those to report Peterloo, founded the Manchester  in 1821. Along with other newspaper voices – including the Observer, established in 1791 – the  helped to spread the information and arguments that pressed reluctant authorities to take important democratic steps. The paintings and prints of those days show the power and shared excitement of news circulating. The illiterate gather to hear others read aloud. Laughing faces gaze together through the windows of shops displaying the latest satirical prints. I hope a film or TV producer (the BBC? Netflix?) will tap the talent – and the costume department – and tell some of that great story, mixing the love interest, over-reach, courage, obduracy, wit, frailty, redemption and other ingredients into a popular success.Asked for examples of movies (and TV) that affected public opinion, film buffs mentioned: To Kill a Mockingbird, confronting the US with its racial prejudice Cathy Come Home, homelessness in the UK The China Syndrome and Silkwood, the nuclear power industry and Born Free, the environment.Other nominations are welcome.

These are the real milestones to aim forPoor Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. I mean that literally, by the way, as it appears the 29-year-old US politician is embarrassingly impecunious. Ocasio-Cortez, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, reportedly has less than $7,000 (£5,500) in savings. Shocking, right? Obviously I am aware that poor people exist, but I had no idea they were allowed to become politicians.CNBC appears to have been similarly appalled – it recently devoted an article to the sorry state of Ocasio-Cortez’s savings. It is true, it noted, that research shows the median amount millennials have saved is $2,430 (£1,900), but “while Ocasio-Cortez’s situation is normal, it’s not ideal”. According to several financial experts that CNBC consulted, Ocasio-Cortez should have around $27,000 (£21,100) saved for retirement. (A calculation based on the popular benchmark that you should have a year’s worth of salary saved by the age of 30.)Now, as you may have noticed, a fail-safe way to rile millennials, who are poorer than previous generations, is to lecture them on money it being somewhat difficult to squirrel away savings when wages are stagnant, house prices are bonkers and student debt has soared. CNBC’s tone-deaf analysis of Ocasio-Cortez’s finances was not well received on the internet. Indeed, it was promptly given the meme treatment, with people tweeting their own advice about important things one ought to have achieved by age 30. Like deciding on “a favourite spoon”, for example. Or developing “a maniacal laugh at the mention of ‘trickle down’”.The meme got me thinking. You see, back when I was young and delusional, I was under the impression that, by the time I was as ancient as 30, I would be very rich (in an ethical way, obviously) and incredibly successful. I would have won a couple of Nobel prizes. I would have thought to myself, “oops, I’ve got a lot of money” and live in a house, a very big house, in the country. Long story short, I am 35 now and have won zero Nobel prizes, and do not live in a very big house in the country. I do not even have a favourite spoon. While my situation is normal, it’s not ideal.But I am not here to complain I am here to reveal the actual milestones one ought to have achieved by the age of 30. The milestones the mainstream media dare not talk about. Let’s start at the beginning of the alphabet, shall we? With adult-onset allergies. You see, I don’t mean to boast, but in my late 20s I developed a brand new allergy to trees and now sneeze more than I ever thought possible. As it turns out, my immune system is at the forefront of an emerging trend: various reports suggest adult-onset allergies are becoming increasingly common. So, if your body hasn’t turned against you by the time you reach 30, I’d get a little worried. Why are you still so chummy with pollen? Why is it still pleasurable to breathe? There’s clearly something wrong with you.Next, I want to talk about receipts. One of the non-negotiable markers of being a proper adult is being terrified to throw away receipts just in case you need them in the future for Serious Finance Things. At this point I was going to move onto the fascinating subject of chin hair, but I’m afraid I will have to skip to the end. Once one is over the age of 30, it is important you are able to stick to the strict word count you have been given and not finish articles abrup …"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc47b519b6bea52b6d806dc27b7933b44d2f68ce/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d84d10cf908ebf81b85a21125ffb032","title":"honest brexit bigotry ugly chapter history","story":"Today, I shall go to the German embassy in London to sign the necessary forms so that my half-German sons may apply for dual citizenship. My father and one of my brothers have already been granted Maltese passports (my family hails from the tiny Mediterranean island). I am glad that such options are available, as a Brexit of unknowable character approaches, and at a time when the prime minister sees fit to label those of us with funny continental names “queue-jumpers”. It is fair to say that, in the circumstances, we are fortunate.Yet I think it is time to be a bit more honest and plain-speaking about those circumstances. For the most part, the debate about Brexit since the 2016 referendum has been framed primarily in economic terms. The leavers have spoken excitedly about the free-trade bonanza that supposedly lies the other side of 29 March. Remainers point out that Britain is cutting itself off from the largest single market in the world.But this to-and-fro is a polite fiction draped over a much uglier reality, and one that has little to do with GDP. I keep hearing that it is rude and counterproductive to suggest that xenophobia played a significant part in the 2016 result, and it is certainly true that such accusations should never be made lightly.All the same: there are moments when politeness is not always the highest priority, and reticence more closely resembles cowardice than civility. As Clint Eastwood’s Dirty Harry reminds us: a man’s got to know his limitations – and I’m afraid I’ve reached mine. I’m done with the whole pretence that the argument about Brexit is, and has always been, a subtle jurisprudential discussion about sovereignty, or an exciting debate about the business plan for UK plc.Look at the evidence. In June 2017, a report collated from the British Social Attitudes survey showed that the most significant factor in the leave vote was anxiety about the number of people coming to the UK. A comprehensive study published by Nuffield College in April drew similar conclusions about the salience of immigration in attitudes to Brexit. “Take back control” was indeed the slogan of the leave campaign, but it was “control” with one purpose, above all others, at its heart.Which is why Theresa May was so uncompromising last week when urged by cabinet colleagues that it was not too late to reconsider the impact of tighter immigration policy on British companies. An end to free movement, the prime minister informed them, was a non-negotiable feature of the deal that she will first put to the Commons on 4 December.It is for this reason, too, that she is uninterested in the thoughtful proposal by the Conservative backbencher Nick Boles that she should contemplate a Norway-style interim arrangement with the EU, if MPs reject her agreement with Brussels. The Norwegian model preserves freedom of movement, which, for May, is the most garish of red lines.I think something profound, unsettling but still underexplored, underpins this scale of priorities: a fundamental change that needs to be understood outside the day-to-day disasters of this useless government and even of the Brexit process itself.For decades there was something close to a political consensus that the most important metric was economic prosperity. A wealthy nation was essential both to the aspirations of inidual households and the funding of public services. The Tories might give greater weight to the former, Labour to the latter. Margaret Thatcher and Gordon Brown had radically different visions of social justice and collective responsibility, of the relationship between taxation and public spending. But they were as one in their conviction that nothing much was possible without a strong economy.Brexit is both symptom and cause of a breakdown in this consensus. It can no longer be taken for granted that senior politicians, or the voters themselves, will automatically and reflexively put national wealth first.As long ago as January 2014, Nigel Farage was explicit about this: “If you said to me, would I like to see over the next 10 years a further 5 million people come into Britain and if that happened we’d all be slightly richer, I’d say, I’d rather we weren’t slightly richer.”Of course, such statistics are now routinely dismissed as the latest iteration of “project fear”. But the more intriguing (and alarming) point is that so many senior figures in the political class responded with such comparative calm to these appalling prognoses. We have reached the point where, to an extraordinary extent, the implementation of the 2016 referendum result trumps all else.Why so? Because, as Farage declared with more candour than most mainstream politicians can yet muster, culture is nudging old-fashioned political economy out of its prime spot. Immigration is now the gravitational centre of the whole debate: a debate much less about national wealth or national sovereignty than national identity.Beneath all the talk of “control” and “global Britain”, there is the germ of an extremely unpleasant nativism. Again, we pesky centrists are told to be quiet and to heed the concerns of those who have been “left behind”. But since there is not a shred of respectable evidence that immigration has had more than a marginal impact upon public service capacity, wage levels or net welfare costs, I am forced to conclude that there is now a sufficiency of Britons who just don’t much like people of foreign extraction, and certainly don’t want many more of them around the place.So often one hears that the British people “were not consulted” about immigration levels. To which the answer is: oh yes you damn well were. Every time you insisted on a properly staffed NHS, on social care that was halfway decent, on a service economy that worked, on affordable decorators, on your Tesco and Amazon deliveries arriving on time. Each time you took that landscape for granted, you were complicit in the immigration policy that preceded the Brexit vote.We live in a world defined by the economic, social and cultural interdependence of nation states. And those who promise that leaving the EU will deliver “control” are really promising something quite specific: a social and cultural reboot. As well as being morally contemptible, of course, this is also a complete impossibility.

My relative who wanted to get rid of Pakistanis and Indians, and other people from the far south-eastern region of the EU, finds they are still here, curing him, presenting the news and cooking delicious baltis.The Welsh railway worker who Paul Mason overheard in July 2016 saying that he was voting out because “you can’t buy girls pink toys any more, they have to be grey” (while his colleague thought she should be allowed to say “gollywog”), has discovered there is no EU toy colour diktat. Toybox gender miscegenation will continue unabated, cloth rabbits and robot cars changing colour and sex at will, like gender-fluid frogs spawning in a filthy pond.Those wooed, understandably, by the bus-borne “£350m a week for the NHS” bullshit now know it was just one of Boris Piccaninny Watermelon Letterbox Cake Disaster Johnson’s many self-serving falsehoods. But even now it is being regurgitated by Theresa May, a horrible vomiting cormorant sicking up lies into the squawking beaks of the terminally and furiously disappointed, hoping that if their gullets are at least full of something, anything, however baseless, they will at last shut up.Those who voted Leave as a protest, hoping to give the elite a scare, reluctantly admit they overplayed their hands somewhat. Even Michael Gove who, in the words of his Daily Mail wife, was “only supposed to blow the bloody doors off”, now chooses to attach himself, the limpet of regret, to the hulls of various blameless environmental causes, in an attempt to disassociate himself from the national catastrophe his pitiful vanity has initiated. Michael Gove hopes to be remembered, instead, as the Dian Fossey of Surrey’s hedgehogs. But Brexit is Michael Gove’s only legacy. And the shame of it will outlive all of his hedgehogs.Only Jacob Rees-Mogg, one of our few conviction politicians, can still hold his head up high and say that he had a reason to leave the EU that remains not demonstrably untrue. For, in the early days of the Leave campaign, Rees-Mogg nailed his colours to the same mast of hope that he was again saluting last Monday morning, when he made the case for Hard Brexit once more to his familiar, Nick Ferrari, on LBC: the benefits of free trade focused through the lens of Cheaper Footwear.It is true that in 2006, the shoe-producing EU nations slapped blocks on Asian shoe imports that drove up high street prices. But only a genius like Rees-Mogg could realise how emotive this footwear issue was for the UkipBrexit axis. Brexit supporters, it appears, get through a lot of shoes, after hurling them at the television whenever Gina Miller comes on Question Time.And now, long since all other supposed good reasons for exiting the EU have been invalidated by facts, Rees-Mogg’s “cheaper footwear” gambit remains undiscredited. But this is largely, it must be said, because no one from the corrupt pro-EU elite thought it important enough to try and discredit, which just shows how out of touch they are with what ordinary people care about.For many Brexit voters, the financial benefits of EU membership – investment in rural infrastructure, sharing of scientific research, work and education opportunities – remain tantalisingly abstract, and seem geared to the needs of the metropolitan liberal elite. But the cost of footwear is a tangible concrete concept, and it is this notion that Rees-Mogg harnessed to arouse the Europhobia of the British people.After all, everyone has feet, or knows someone who has, whereas not everyone knows someone who has benefited from the work of the European Space Agency. And if it is trying to contact queue-jumping aliens, that is hardly likely to endear it to the Brexit voter.But even Brexit supporters with no feet might want to buy a shoe, if only to hurl at the television in case Gina Miller comes on Question Time. And they would probably want that shoe to cost as little as possible. And they wouldn’t care if it was an Asian shoe, as long as it wasn’t jumping the shoe queue.Rees-Mogg’s own two feet continue to fascinate all of us, and one can see why footwear would be of such importance to him. Rees-Mogg has always looked younger than 49, especially when he was a child, though he is finally beginning to decay. However, a swift internet image search will show that Rees-Mogg’s shoes have remained unchanged throughout Rees-Mogg’s life.Either Rees-Mogg is wearing a new pair of shoes every day, in which case one could understand his obsession with footwear prices and their relationship with EU membership, or some more sinister factor is at play. Rees-Mogg’s shoes, always shiny, always bright, never scuff or age. I looked at 570 consecutive photographs of Jacob Rees-Mogg’s unchanged shoes online and then gave up, the horror seeming to tear at my throat.In The Picture of Dorian Gray, by Oscar Wilde, a man sells his soul to the devil or something, I expect, and there’s a drawing of him and it gets old and he stays the same. Brexit rots in front of our eyes, wilting on the vine. But Rees-Mogg’s shoes remain unchanged. And who is this “nanny” who has accompanied him since birth, guiding his political progress, steering us toward our doom? Whatever diabolical deal the footwear-obsessed free trade evangelist struck, I just hope it was worth it.Stewart Lee is appearing with Liza Tarbuck in Comedians Sing the Christmas Hits!, a benefit for Action Duchenne, at the Bloomsbury theatre, London, on 4 December with Mawaan Rizwan in Choose Laughs Festive Special (in aid of Help Refugees) at the Playhouse, London, on 9 December and with Athena Kugblenu and Rosie Jones in A Belter for the Shelter at the Hackney Empire, London, on 19 February "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d80f67a1e74bb0777bbc90222f02aca470241d2/0_26_4134_2481/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=885252a9404a5627b717bb09b64b35cc","title":"the guardian view on parliaments brexit debate time to choose","story":"The televised debate that Britain needs is not a joust between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn but the one that actually begins in the House of Commons on Tuesday. This will be the most consequential parliamentary event for a generation, and perhaps since Britain joined the old European community in 1973. British politics have been building up to this since the 2016 referendum and ever since parliament insisted on having a “meaningful” vote on the deal. Now we are on the eve of that. The voting at the end of this five-day debate on 11 December will decide whether, and if so on what terms, Britain departs from the European Union or whether, perhaps, the issue will be returned to the voters for another referendum and for a possible democratic reversal of Brexit.The question that faces MPs is whether the EU withdrawal agreement and the declaration on the future framework of relations, both of which were signed off by the EU and the UK last month, are an acceptable basis for Brexit to go ahead. In this newspaper’s view they are not.  opposed and opposes withdrawal. The declaration, in particular, is simply too vague a prospectus for relations with the EU to be an acceptable basis for Brexit. It does nothing to protect the economy through commitments to remain in the single market and customs union. It offers no guarantee that jobs, interests and regulatory regimes are protected from the fanatics and fantasists who want to drive wages and standards down and turn our backs on Europe.The events of the next week will be increasingly fast-moving. The precise political options and effects of the votes on 11 December will be difficult to judge until the day itself. At the outset, however, there seem currently to be four main options: no deal at all, Mrs May’s deal, a softer form of Brexit deal, and a second referendum. Of these, two are clearly ruled out. No pro-European and no social justice supporter should countenance the multiple risks and damage of no deal under any circumstances, while Mrs May’s deal is, as stated above, too full of dangerous holes.The two options that deserve more thought by MPs are a softer deal and a second referendum. The choice will depend, in part, on how the domestic Brexit endgame evolves over the next week. The way the Commons votes on Tuesday to sequence the different amendments to the May deal will have significant consequences. Given the vital importance of Britain’s relations with Europe, and the existence of the 2016 vote to leave, it is important that this hung parliament comes together across party lines as much as it can.The most viable form of softer Brexit on offer now would have Britain leaving the EU on the basis of Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement. But it would also specify that, at the end of the planned withdrawal transition, the UK would rejoin the European Free Trade Association (of which Norway is the most important current member) and join the European Economic Area and the single market. In addition, under this “Norway plus” option, the UK would remain in a customs union with the EU. Economic integration and freedom of movement would continue, largely on EU terms, but Britain would have left the EU. This would draw the sting of the Northern Ireland border argument. It would leave Liam Fox’s Department for International Trade largely redundant.A second referendum has growing support outside parliament and backing within it. It is the only route open to MPs to keep the UK in the EU. Yet that outcome is not certain. Leave could win again. Either way it is a daunting prospect. It would deepen bitter national arguments still further. It would demand a far better and more reasoned pro-European campaign. But we can see more starkly now what Brexit would actually mean. If MPs do not support the May deal or the Norway-plus option, there are clear circumstances in which a second referendum becomes the only supportable alternative to no deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4920acc5c4c37cc9d641a79f07baf06e345c49df/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=751e9a6bd9c1be8f7cb4c673c0857599","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of wait","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘wait’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘wait’ (please note that these are no longer published online).Share your photos of what wait means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 5 December at 10am.

Alas, it is in fact Dame Joan’s husband Percy, the famous Percy, who is suntanned, jolly and very amused that I have mistaken him for the PR guy.“Jeffrey has been detained,” he explains, in his cheery international accent, then adds hastily, “not by the police!” Then he gets confused and calls me Sarah, takes me up to their apartment and introduces me to his wife as Sarah, too, by which point it’s far too late for me to correct anyone.Percy has read in an article that tea tastes better in a mug, so would I like mine in a mug? Of course, I reply, much to their surprise. Joan invites me to stretch out with her on a large white sofa, above which hangs a painting of Joan stretching out on a large white sofa. “Oh, you are wonderful, darling,” she says from behind her sunglasses when Percy returns with her dainty teacup, alongside my gigantic mug, which is perched on a tiny saucer. “You can go swimming in it!” he beams at me. Just as I am putting a biscuit into my drink, Dame Joan says she won’t be eating any of them. “Oh, you’re a dunker, Sarah,” she observes, as the morsel disintegrates into my massive mug. I don’t mind the attention at all. Sarah, however, is mortified.Joan Collins, now 85, is of course a household name, a world-famous actor who has been awarded an OBE for her work which now s three-quarters of a century, from 1950s Hollywood movies to Dynasty to her new role in American Horror Story. South American theatre producer Percy Gibson, 32 years her junior, is her fifth husband, immortalised in the tabloid headline the day after their wedding: “Joan says I do to young Percy from Peru.”Joan is also a Thatcherite who once voiced her support for Ukip. This is one of their three homes, along with London’s Belgravia and the south of France, so she seems pleasantly surprised when she says how nice it was of the Observer to send me to meet her – she only reads the Daily Mail and the  herself. Then she enquires politely about my journey, asks if I have kids, and says I should have brought my daughter to LA with me, “because she could have played with Piers Morgan’s children.” The dark glasses she is wearing indoors make it hard to see if there is a twinkle in her eye, but I am already starting to wonder – just possibly – if Joan Collins is trolling me.But then Percy goes out, leaving us to talk, and a small fly starts buzzing around her head, and she looks a little upset and says something I did not expect. “Do you believe that little flies or butterflies or something can be old souls, people that you knew? I have this little fly that comes near me all the time. It’s really strange.”Who do you think it is? “I think it might be my sister,” she says, looking quite serious. The novelist Jackie Collins died three years ago, after seven years of keeping her cancer diagnosis a secret, even from Joan. “I know that sounds weird, and I don’t know whether I believe in the afterlife or not,” she continues. “My opinion is still out to lunch about that, but it is weird that wherever I go, at least two or three times a week – wherever I am, France, London, here – this little fly comes. Now maybe it’s because the fruit’s rotting in the kitchen!” She laughs. “I don’t know. But anyway…” her voice goes low and familiar and rather sad, “If it is: hello Jack.”The apartment is like something out of Dynasty, and Dame Joan says she bought a lot of this glitzy furniture at that time. She shows me various sculptures and paintings around her sitting room that were presents from Jackie, and stresses how close they were. “You know, like sisters, we all have our problems, which the press loved to exacerbate, or exaggerate. But I mean, she was the closest person to me for many years and with me being the older sister she kind of worshipped me in a way.”And is it really true that she didn’t tell anyone about her illness? “Only her daughters. Thank God she didn’t tell me. I mean, I wish she had. But she didn’t want pity, and that’s what happens – in this town particularly, you know, gossip.” I am about to enquire more about this when Joan receives a call, asks who it is, then is upset again when she is informed that a friend of hers has been rushed to hospital. She promises the caller she will stay in touch and not tell anyone. “They’re dropping like flies,” she says, when she gets off the phone. I don’t think the pun is intentional.This place has only been her LA base for a couple of years, but she couldn’t love the location more, as it’s only a few blocks from her new job on American Horror Story on the Fox lot, “which is where I started, when I was 20 years old and under contract to Fox. And then when I started Dynasty, for the first two seasons, we did it there as well. Third time lucky.” She plays three different characters in AHS, which is now in its eighth year. It is made by Ryan Murphy, who also made Glee, “Or the $300m man, as they call him in Hollywood. So everybody commits to doing this without even knowing what they’re going to play. Ryan told me it was a wonderful meaty role – and next thing I know I’m a cannibal, eating human flesh. Oh God, but they actually gave us some kind of gruel – quinoa – and I had to eat it like I was really loving it.”And the quinoa, was it as revolting as human flesh?“Well,” says Joan, staring at me through her sunglasses: “I wouldn’t know what human flesh was like, would I?”In February 2019, Dame Joan will be touring her one-woman show around English regional theatres. It is not her first such show, but the previous ones were scripted, whereas this will be conversational, “so I can have a rapport with the audience, who can ask questions, and Percy will be on the stage with me as well, which is great. So we can have banter.” She then queries her own choice of words. “Banter – hmmm, that’s a Philip Green word isn’t it?” Joan plans to show clips of all the amazing people she has worked with: Bette Davis, Richard Burton, Gene Kelly. It does feel like you’ve outlived everyone, I say. “I hope so!” she says. But there are all these amazing people you’ve worked with and…“And they’re all dead! Is that what you’re trying to say Sarah? Yeah, great. Thank you,” she replies.But it must feel wonderful – “It’s not wonderful” – to have this great body of work and still be working.“Basically, I came here and I was the youngest person on the set. The youngest person in the movie, the youngest person at the parties. And now I’m practically the oldest. So it comes full circle. But no, there are still people around who – well – let me just see. I mean Shirley MacLaine. Warren is still around, Warren Beatty.” (She was once engaged to Beatty, and has written in her memoirs about their pregnancy ending in abortion.)“Sophia Loren, who I still see sometimes in Europe. Brigitte Bardot – well I spend a lot of time in St Tropez, but I never see her, she’s like a recluse. Doris Day.”“But you’re right, I’m a sort of bridge between the Golden Age of Hollywood, which I came in at the end of, when the gilt was beginning to tarnish, as I say in my one-woman show. Yes, and then now I’m sort of relevant in a way, with American Horror Story, which is really nice, and it’s nice that people are still interested in wanting to go and see my one-woman show. And I hear Joanna Lumley has a one-woman show.”“Don’t you read the papers?”Inevitably, we discuss Dynasty. I tell her that Alexis Carrington was my childhood introduction to the idea of a woman being bad and good at the same time, and that I was mesmerised by her. Joan is appreciative, but stresses passionately that, “she was not bad. First of all, Alexis was chucked by Blake when she was 18 because he was off making oil deals. Then he killed or maimed her boyfriend. And he murdered someone later. He was the bad one!”But we like to punish women for having desire.“Yes that’s true. And she was also beautifully dressed.”Is it true that you were the highest-paid woman on TV?“I became the highest-paid woman on television only on the last season, and when I reported to work, they said: ‘Oh, you’re only going to be in 10 episodes because we can’t afford you now.’ I thought that was a bit mean. But then it’s a very harsh town, this – you’ve got to have balls of brass. And you have to be able to absolutely take rejection.”But have you ever had days where you’re hiding in a bathroom on set, weeping, thinking I can’t take this any more? “No,” says Dame Joan. She giggles. “Sorry!”Her views on the #MeToo movement are mixed. On the one hand, she herself was drugged and raped by the actor Maxwell Reed when she was a teenage virgin. She then married him “which I know is hard to understand”, and wrote all about it in her first autobiography, Past Imperfect. “So when people ask why I wasn’t speaking out about this – I’ve been speaking out about it for 40 years.” On the other hand, she says she would never have gone up to a producer’s hotel room, knowing what men are like. “It seems to me actresses who are saying, you know, ‘I went up to this producer and he took his dick out and I froze.’ I mean, I’m sorry, you don’t freeze you go, ‘Stop that, I’m leaving.’ I just gave them a knee in the groin. It’s hardly suffering. You just didn’t put up with it.”She is not without sympathy for the bigger picture, though. “My daughter Tara is a pioneer for women’s rights.” They have marched together for women’s rights and they delivered a petition to Downing Street to save funding for women’s refuges, because Tara worked in one for three years.“These women in the refuges are having to hide their identities. They’ve got children and babies and then the husbands try to find them. I remember Tara was crying to me about a year and a half ago because one of the women had gone back and been murdered – that’s what happens. Women are abused all over the world. Everybody’s very adamant and strong and #MeToo here in Hollywood, but I don’t see them opening refuges for women who have been abused.”We discuss Joan’s other marriages, two of which were because she was desperate to have children. “Then there was that stupid thing with Peter Holm – whom Michael Caine refers to as ‘the Swedish comedian’, because he was about as funny as this pillow.” She looks at it. “Well actually this pillow is quite funny. Anyway, that lasted a year. And after that I didn’t get married again for 15 years.”But she continued to believe in marriage very strongly. “I think there’s a wonderful commitment to it.” With Percy, the difference was a real friendship at the start and the heart of it. He is a theatre producer they met at work. “And you know, we of course thought about the age difference, but that didn’t bother him at all. He’s South American and they don’t have this hang-up about, you know, everybody’s got to look like Britt Ekland in her prime! And so it just grew and developed, and when 911 happened, we were in London and we were doing a play at the Old Vic, and we realised we really wanted to commit ourselves to each other. We were in love with each other, and we had a proper wedding, at Claridge’s. It did feel very different.”They now spend every day together: “247, which can be wonderful most of the time. It can be a bit annoying sometimes, you know, but he likes to do it. And he likes to drive, I don’t like to drive. So today when I went to get my hair done I said, ‘I’ll just take an Uber,’ and he said, ‘No no no, I’ll drive you.’ He just wants to do everything for me. And he’s wonderful with my children and the grandchildren. He says that we are partners in crime.”They don’t go out to parties much any more “because they don’t have them any more – very few people have really good parties. We do. I had a great party here for Percy’s birthday about three weeks ago. We had about 50 people, Mexican food stands. We only invite our friends – no boring industry people.” They also went to her god-daughter Cara Delevingne’s birthday party at the Chateau Marmont in LA, which was “very weird, because it was out by the dark swimming pool and you couldn’t see anything. And yes, there were half-naked mermaid underwater strippers, but we left early because you know, I like to be in bed by 10.” She wasn’t convinced by the casual dress code either.Joan and Percy went for dinner with Piers Morgan and his wife recently. “I don’t know whether you like him. I like him a lot. He says this thing on Good Morning Britain – “The world’s gone mad!” And it has! I mean, they’re making it an offence to whistle at a woman in the street?” She tries to recall when she first met Piers. “Oh it was when we did the last flight of Concorde together – when he threw a glass of water over somebody. Or somebody threw a glass of water over him. It was all very dramatique.”When Joan married Percy, she was asked if the age gap didn’t worry her, and she replied, “If he dies, he dies.” So how’s it looking – is he hanging in there? “Ha!” She cackles, but then looks alarmed and sprints from her sofa across the room to grab the dining table, “Oh please, let me touch wood.” She returns to her seat. “He’s only 53! No, he’s wonderful. It was one of my off-the-cuff rude remarks, but for some reason everybody liked it,” she says. “Another one of my best remarks, I was with this boy who I’d been dating for about eight months, and it was New Year’s Eve and we were on the dancefloor, and the relationship was drawing to a close as they do in your 20s, you know, they don’t last. And he said to me: ‘Oh you are a fucking bore,’ and I said, ‘And you are a boring fuck.’ So that was that.”As I am leaving, Dame Joan asks if I want to look at her wall of shame, as she calls it – a wall of framed photos of Joan with all sorts of people including the Queen, Thatcher, Reagan – she tells me she loved them all. There is a typed letter from Noël Coward and a hand-written one from Princess Diana thanking Joan for sending “her latest edition” over. I mention Meghan Markle, whom Joan likes, but has not met. “She’s more than three months pregnant don’t you think, though?” she says, raising a discreet eyebrow. Then we come to a couple of Joan-with-prime-minister photos that are so low on the wall they’re practically falling down the back of the sofa. “He’ll have to go,” she says, jabbing at Tony Blair, the only non-Tory on there. “But I think he’ll have to go, too,” she says, pointing at David Cameron.Well it’s him who got us into this Brexit mess in the first place, I say. “Mmm,” she says, possibly agreeing, though I suspect she means he should have stuck around and seen us all the way out of Europe. We say our goodbyes and I nip to the loo before I leave. It is all black and shiny, like something from one of Jackie’s novels, and there is a photo on the wall of the two of them in the back of a limousine. On the marble basin is a silver mirror, a bunch of flowers and a bottle of Tom Ford perfume called Fucking Fabulous.

It will be a familiar experience for many. For 24 years the annual UN climate conference has served up a reliable diet of rhetoric, backroom talks and dramatic last-minute deals aimed at halting global warming.But this year’s will be a grimmer affair – by far. As recent reports have made clear, the world may no longer be hovering at the edge of destruction but has probably staggered beyond a crucial point of no return. Climate catastrophe is now looking inevitable. We have simply left it too late to hold rising global temperatures to under 1.5C and so prevent a future of drowned coasts, ruined coral reefs, spreading deserts and melted glaciers.One example was provided last week by a UN report that revealed attempts to ensure fossil fuel emissions peak by 2020 will fail. Indeed the target will not even be reached by 2030. Another, by the World Meteorological Organization, said the past four years had been the warmest on record and warned that global temperatures could easily rise by 3-5C by 2100, well above that sought-after goal of 1.5C. The UK will not be exempt either. The Met Office said summer temperatures could now be 5.4C hotter by 2070.At the same time, prospects of reaching global deals to halt emissions have been weakened by the spread of rightwing populism. Not much to smile about in Katowice.Nor will the planet’s woes end in 2100. Although most discussions use the year as a convenient cut-off point for describing Earth’s likely fate, the changes we have already triggered will last well beyond that date, said Svetlana Jevrejeva, at the National Oceanography Centre, Liverpool. She has studied sea-level rises that will be triggered by melting ice sheets and expanding warm seawater in a world 3-5C hotter than it was in pre-industrial times, and concludes these could reach 0.74 to 1.8 metres by 2100. This would be enough to deluge Pacific and Indian Ocean island states and displace millions from Miami, Guangzhou, Mumbai and other low-lying cities. The total cost to the planet could top £11trillion.Even then the seas will not stop rising, Jevrejeva added. “They will continue to climb for centuries even after greenhouse-gas levels have been stabilised. We could experience the highest-ever global sea-level rise in the history of human civilisation.”Vast tracts of prime real estate will be destroyed – at a time when land will be needed with unprecedented desperation. Earth’s population stands at seven billion today and is predicted to rise to nine billion by 2050 and settle at over 11 billion by 2100 – when climate change will have wrecked major ecosystems and turned farmlands to dust bowls.Unfortunately many experts believe Earth’s population will actually peak well beyond 11 billion. “It could reach 15 billion,” said Sarah Harper, of Oxford’s Institute of Population Ageing. “All sorts of factors suggest women, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, will still want to have relatively high numbers of children and this might keep the world’s population approaching 15 billion rather than 12 billion.”The world will have double its present numbers – but with hugely reduced areas of fertile land to provide food. We will be living in a shrunken, scorched planet bursting with human beings. Somaliland gives a grim vision of this future.Sudan and Kenya are also victims of a drought that has dried the Horn of Africa faster than at any other time in the past 2,000 years. Similarly, in Vietnam, thousands a year are abandoning the once fertile Mekong Delta as rising seawater pollutes paddy fields. By 2050, the World Bank says more than 140 million will become climate refugees.It will be bad for humans, but catastrophic for Earth’s other inhabitants. Arctic ice loss threatens polar bears, droughts imperil monarch butterflies, and koala habitats are being destroyed by bush fires. In all, about a sixth of all species now face extinction, say scientists, although in the end no creature or plant will be safe. “Even the most resilient species will inevitably fall victim as extreme stresses drive ecosystems to collapse,” said Giovanni Strona of Europe’s Joint Research Centre in a report last week on climate change.Scientists warned more than 30 years ago that such a future lay ahead, but nothing was done to stave it off. Only dramatic measures are now left to those seeking to save our burning planet, and these can have grim political consequences. In France, for example, President Macron’s new levies on fossil fuels, introduced to cut emissions and to fund renewable energy projects, triggered riots. Had only modest changes been enacted a few decades ago there would be no trouble today, say analysts.But the most telling example is provided by the US, which has emitted about a third of the carbon responsible for global warming. Yet it has essentially done nothing to check its annual rises in output. Lobbying by the fossil fuel industry has proved highly effective at blocking political change – a point most recently demonstrated by groups such as the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Heartland Institute, which helped persuade President Trump to pull out of the Paris agreement, thus dashing the planet’s last hope of ecological salvation. “The coalition used its power to slow us down precisely at the moment when we needed to speed up,” said the environmentalist Bill McKibben in the New Yorker. “As a result, the particular politics of one country for one half-century will have changed the geological history of the Earth.”No region of the US has more to lose from climate change than southern Florida. If scientists’ worst predictions are realised, an entire metropolitan area, currently inhabited by more than six million people, is likely to be swamped by a 1.5-metre sea-level rise before the end of this century, a rise that could see the tourist mecca of Miami simply disappear.It’s a doomsday scenario that has united the leaders of Miami-Dade county and the cities of Miami and Miami Beach in an attempt to find solutions to the most severe effects of rising oceans before it is too late. Their plan to combat the physical, economic and social challenges of climate change, as part of the global 100 Resilient Cities programme, will play a key role in determining whether the low-lying region will still be habitable in the coming decades or surrendered to the ever-rising Atlantic.“It’s a problem that can be managed, it’s not a problem that can be fixed and you walk away from,” said Susanne Torriente, chief resilience officer for Miami Beach, where hundreds of millions of taxpayers’ dollars have already been spent elevating roads, constructing higher sea walls and investing in modern, high-capacity pumps and stormwater drainage systems.“Every generation will add to the work that we have begun,” Torriente says. “We are always learning, it’s a constant process of learning, re-evaluating and improving.”Up to a million Florida homes, worth an estimated $371bn (£290bn, are at risk of tidal flooding by 2100, one recent study calculated, but the threats facing the greater Miami region are not just coastal. Hurricanes are becoming more powerful because of global warming, say scientists, who point to the destruction wrought by Hurricane Michael in October, while the combination of a low water table and high “king” tides – occurring in autumn – causes regular inland flooding even on dry days.These moves reflect the sense of urgency being felt in Florida, where the state leadership has been criticised for neglecting the environment. Its newly elected senator, Rick Scott, banned staff from using the term climate change during his time as governor of Florida, and will be a close Washington ally of President Donald Trump, who took the US out of the Paris climate agreement.It’s a 45-minute canoe journey along the coast from regional capital Morombe to Kivalo in south-west Madagascar. Children frolic in the water, palm trees sway, and fishing nets hang along the beach. This tranquillity is deceptive, however – for Madagascar is ranked as one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. Higher temperatures, extended drought periods in the south, intensification of cyclones and rising sea levels are all forecast. For good measure, the country’s pervasive poverty restricts its capacity to adapt to such changes.In Kivalo, this is already a familiar picture. “The southern wind used to start in January and last until July,” says Bikison Thomas, a fisherman. “But it’s still going now in November.” On very windy days, he cannot put out to sea. “There is also more fog,” he adds. Overfishing, higher sea temperatures and the loss of mangrove, a crucial habitat for fish stocks, are also reducing catches.The Madagascar government is aware of the country’s vulnerability and has ratified the Paris agreement. Climate change is listed in every major policy document but budgets usually fall short of producing effective measures, a point that is demonstrated dramatically down the coast in the town of Morondava, where hotels are grappling with sea-level rise.Two years ago, Chayune Badouraly bought the Coco Beach hotel. It had a few bungalows and a lovely beach. Badouraly added more bedrooms, a reception area and a restaurant.But in September, powerful tides destroyed two of his bungalows, and the sea has not returned to its previous level. “We used to have 150 metres of beach,” he says bitterly. “Now it’s minus five.” Although there are plans to build sea defences, Badouraly says that could take months, even years, so he’s taken the problem into his own hands and built a 60-metre-long sea wall, a mixture of stone blocks, steel rods and sandbags. “I knew we had coastal erosion problems, but I didn’t think it would be that bad,” he adds. “I would never have bought.”It is hard to get a grip of the sheerscale of the Thwaites glacier in west Antarctica. It’s more than 300 miles long and 200 wide – and more than a mile thick. It drains an area of ice that is larger than England and stealthily slides towards the sea by several metres every day. Only from satellite images have we understood the shape and power of this ice monster.These now show the beast is waking up. Thwaites’s uptake of falling snow was once matched, fairly finely, by snow and ice being lost as icebergs. Now it has begun to flow faster, along with some of its neighbouring glaciers. More ice is being lost into the ocean than is being replaced, speeding up global sea-level rise.Research on the ice and frigid waters around Thwaites Glacier is urgently needed but carrying that out is tough. Even by Antarctic standards, this area is cold and remote. I have been working in Antarctica for more than 30 years, and I’ve never managed to reach Thwaites. However, the UK and US governments have agreed to send in scientists as part of the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration. We are finally going to get the chance to understand this waking monster. At the moment, it is merely yawning and stretching. The question we must answer, urgently, is whether it is about to wake up and roar.Rising sea temperatures are already causing irreparable bleaching of reefs, while rising sea levels threaten to engulf reefs at a faster rate than they can grow upwards. Few scientists believe coral reefs – which are made of simple invertebrates related to sea anemones – can survive for more than a few decades.Yet those who have sounded clear warnings about our reefs have received little reward. Professor Terry Hughes, a coral expert at James Cook University in Queensland, Australia, recently studied the impact of El Niño warmings in 2016 and 2017 on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, the world’s largest coral reef and its largest living entity – and wept when he saw the damage.For his pains, Hughes has faced demands from tourist firms for his funding to be halted because he was ruining their business. “The Australian government is still promoting new developments of coal mines and fracking for gas,” Hughes said, after being named joint recipient of the John Maddox prize, given to those who champion science in the face of hostility and legal threats. “If we want to save the Great Barrier Reef, these outdated ambitions need to be abandoned. Yet Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions are rising, not falling. It’s a national disgrace.”This grim picture is summed up by the ethnographer Irus Braverman in her book Coral Whisperers: “The Barrier Reef has changed for ever. The largest living structure in the world has become the largest dying structure in the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60a962a55735f2246230c6dc5145a081e872864c/0_425_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ea02549d5304e3bde561d02b192c926","title":"jeremy lees cake and pudding recipes","story":"Tarts and cakes, custards and creams to warm up chilly winter eveningsAs the early evenings of late autumn make way for the darkening skies of winter, thoughts turn to tarts and cakes, custards and creams. The bustle of the kitchen is cheery. The clutter and clatter of pans, tart cases and cake tins is as invigorating as the purpose of nourishing and warming those we hold dear. The home warms to the aromas caught on the steam, filling the house and sending spirits and appetites soaring at the delightful promise of eating well.The pleasing pairing of buttermilk and lemon curd with a small spoonful of the very best Jersey cream is a happy conceit.Make 8 pots or glassessilver gelatine sheets 1½ vanilla pod 1 buttermilk 350g caster sugar 60g best double cream 250ml lemon curd 8 tsp (see recipe below)Jersey cream thick or pouring, to serveLay out white pots or glasses. Soak the gelatine sheets in cold water and let soften.Cut the vanilla pod in half lengthways and scrape out the seeds with a knife. Put the seeds into a pan and add the pod. Pour in the buttermilk. Add the sugar and double cream. Heat all this to just below a boil. Remove from the heat and remove the vanilla pod.Lift the gelatine from the water and squeeze out any excess. Add the gelatine to the infused cream and stir well, ensuring the gelatine dissolves completely. Stir well. Strain the mixture through a sieve and pour into the pots or glasses. Cool, then cover and refrigerate.When all is ready and requiring to be served, place a teaspoon of lemon curd on each buttermilk pudding then a modest pouring or dollop of Jersey cream.Make lots, for it is very good for so many other lovely things.Set a pan of water to simmer on the cooker. Zest the rind from the lemons very finely, then juice the fruit. Crack the eggs into a bowl large enough to sit on the pan. Whisk the eggs with the sugar, then add the butter and zest and juice of the lemons. Stirring all the while, cook the lemon curd for 20-25 minutes, or until it thickens. Should the curd be on the thin side after this time, cook for a further 10 minutes or so. Pass through a sieve then transfer into a pot or jar. Cool and store in the refrigerator till needed.A harmonious trinity of chocolate, prunes and almonds makes a splendid tart.For the pastry:plain flour 250g icing sugar 25g unsalted butter 125g, cold and cut in piecesegg yolks 2 salt 1 pinch cold water 1 tspFor the frangipane:blanched whole almonds 500g unsalted butter 500g, softenedcaster sugar 250g eggs 4, at room temperatureFor the pastry, sift the flour and icing sugar over the cold butter. With nimble moves make this into a fine crumb. Add in the egg, salt and water. Knead this deftly, though lightly, into a dough. Form the dough into a flattened round and wrap well in clingfilm. Refrigerate. This will benefit being made the night before.For the frangipane, grind the nuts into a coarse crumb. In a bowl, beat the butter and sugar well until mixed. Crack the eggs into a jug and mix with a fork. Pour the eggs gradually on to the butter and sugar, mixing in. Add the almonds and mix well. Refrigerate until needed. This also benefits greatly from being made the night before.Roll out the pastry into a large disc and line a 30cm diameter x 4cm deep-fluted, loose-bottomed tart case. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.Coarsely chop the chocolate. Stone and coarsely chop the prunes, then mix both roughly through the frangipane. Handle the mixture in clods into the tart, resisting the urge to smooth and even the finish.Heat the oven to 150Cgas mark 2. Place the tart on a baking sheet and bake for 1 hour. Reduce the temperature to 120Cgas mark ½ and bake for a further 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool.Best served with the finest Jersey cream. A smattering of roast chopped almonds and a dusting of icing sugar is always rather jolly for a final flourish.I have always adored the elegant simplicity of this dish and in particular their puddings.

Line a 22cm diameter cake tin with greaseproof paper, then lightly butter the paper.Separate the egg yolks into one bowl and the whites, and 2 additional whites, into another. Add three-quarters of the sugar to the yolks and beat until they are voluminous. Whisk the whites until they are peaked, then whisk in the remaining sugar until peaked once more.Alternate spoonfuls of beaten egg whites and flour to the yolks and sugar, incorporating the pared citrus rind. Then alternate the olive oil and Sauternes. Decant the cake batter into the tin.Place the cake in the oven, lower the temperature to 160Cgas mark 3 and bake for 20 minutes. Lower the temperature to 120Cgas mark ½ and bake for a further 20 minutes. Remove the cake from the oven, and cool on a wire rack.Meanwhile, make the poached pears. Peel the rinds from the lemon and orange. Place the rinds in a large pan with the vanilla, bay, sugar, ginger, wine and water. Bring this to a simmer.Squeeze the lemon juice into a bowl. Peel the pears and rub each with lemon juice. Place the pears in the simmering syrup and cover with a disc of paper. Place a plate atop to ensure the fruits are submerged and cook evenly. Pears cook differently depending on ripeness and size. They will certainly take 40 minutes on a gentle simmer, requiring a check every few minutes thereafter. When they have a beautiful translucence, and piercing with a sharp knife causes the flesh to yield, remove the pot from the stove and let cool.To make the custard, place the bay leaves, strip of lemon and vanilla pod in a pot with the milk. Bring this to a simmer, then let it sit and infuse for 10 minutes. Stir together the sugar and the egg yolks until combined. Stir in the infused milk. Place the pot on the stove, pour in the custard and cook gently, stirring all the while until quite cooked through and thickened. Remove from the heat and pour through a sieve into a jug. Cool, then refrigerate until needed.The prettiest serving is the cake dusted with icing sugar, the pears in their syrup in a bowl, and the cold custard in a jug.

Unai Emery and his re-energerised team have built momentum and belief during the sequence, although they had not been able to beat a Big Six Premier League rival.That changed on a wild afternoon in north London when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang continued his dead-eyed scoring exploits and Arsenal fought back from 2-1 down to register yet another come-from-behind win.Aubameyang got the equaliser for 2-2 – his second of the game – and he has now scored with his last 10 shots on target in the league. It was the substitute, Alexandre Lacazette, who put Arsenal in front with a shot that deflected off Eric Dier after a lapse from Juan Foyth and the outstanding Lucas Torreira added the gloss with his first goal in Arsenal colours.Tottenham’s frustration was complete when Jan Vertonghen jumped into a rash challenge on Lacazette to earn a second yellow card on 85 minutes. They will reflect on how they had stabilised after Aubameyang’s early penalty only to be overrun towards the end. Mauricio Pochettino mentioned fatigue as a factor, in the wake of his team’s Champions League exertions against Internazionale last Wednesday. After six straight wins in all competitions this was a jolt.Emery deserved credit for how he reacted at 2-1 down, making bold attacking changes, the first of which saw Aaron Ramsey and a second striker, Lacazette, come on for the second half. At 2-2 Emery moved to a 4-4-2 diamond midfield system and, on each occasion, the idends were immediate.It was a rip-roaring derby, in which tempers were never far from boiling point and the atmosphere pulsed from the first whistle. Things spilled over after Dier had equalised for 1-1 when some of the Arsenal substitutes took exception to the Tottenham midfielder’s celebrations with his teammates. Stephan Lichtsteiner appeared to tap Dier and, as projectiles were thrown from the stand, players in red and white came together in a mass confrontation.Ramsey, who was then off the field, had to be pulled apart from Dele Alli while another Arsenal substitute, Mattéo Guendouzi, rowed with Jesús Pérez, the Spurs assistant manager. There was plenty of pushing and shoving. Pochettino had run up the touchline to act as a peacemaker.Arsenal started at breakneck pace and the touchpaper was lit when Aubameyang opened the scoring from the penalty spot and celebrated in front of the away supporters, who pelted him with missiles, including – most regrettably – a banana skin. The penalty was awarded when Vertonghen touched Granit Xhaka’s free-kick away from Shkodran Mustafi with his hand. Vertonghen was booked for the offence.Arsenal were irrepressible in the opening 20 minutes, with Sead Kolasinac, in particular, making inroads from left wing-back. He cut one cross back for Alex Iwobi, who forced Hugo Lloris into a smart save with his legs. Moments later the other wing-back, Héctor Bellerín, saw a volley at the far post blocked by Ben Davies.It felt as though Arsenal might struggle to maintain the intensity and Spurs roared back into the game, turning it on its head before half-time. Alli had started off the left but he regularly tucked in behind Harry Kane and Son Heung-min and the visitors gained a foothold. Son showed his pace and threat with a series of darts, two of which saw him test Bernd Leno from tight angles.The equaliser came from a Christian Eriksen free-kick, whipped in towards the near post, and it was a horror moment for Leno as he allowed Dier’s flick header to bounce, rear up above his hands and squirm inside the near post.There was controversy when Spurs went ahead. Son had sprinted through again and Rob Holding jumped into a risky tackle but, when Son checked back, there was no contact from the Arsenal defender on him. Mike Dean still awarded the penalty and, after further arguments between rival players, Kane converted for his eighth goal in eight games against Arsenal. He has equalled Emmanuel Adebayor’s scoring record in north London derbies.Mustafi hit the crossbar with a looping header in first-half stoppage time but Spurs were in the ascendancy and Emery made his double substitution at the interval. Arsenal were level soon enough. Bellerín curved a ball in behind Vertonghen and Ramsey twisted to hook it inside for Aubameyang. The striker bent a precision first-time finish inside the near post.Amid the bedlam it was easy to forget the sub-plot of Mesut Özil’s absence. Arsenal said that the playmaker had felt another of his back spasms but there was nevertheless plenty of eye-rolling when the teamsheets landed. It was easy to wonder whether Özil would have worked in Emery’s starting 3-4-2-1 formation.Spurs flickered at the start of the second half, with Kane twice going close, but Arsenal – and Emery – turned the screw after the equaliser. Mustafi was denied by a goalline clearance by Alli and, after Son had tested Leno following a Bellerín error, Emery swapped Mustafi for Guendouzi and went to the midfield diamond.Ramsey initiated Arsenal’s third goal when he robbed the dawdling Foyth and found Lacazette. There was fortune because the striker was slipping as he shot – there was also the deflection off Dier – and the best day of Arsenal’s season was complete when Torreira rolled away from Dier on to Aubameyang’s pass and shot into the corner.

The midfielder spent a season and a half on loan at Aberdeen, Celtic’s League Cup final opponents, with the Pittodrie club hopeful of coaxing Christie north permanently as recently as last summer. Christie edged back into Rodgers’ plans to the point where he has become a key team component, signed a new contract and became part of the Scotland side within a matter of weeks. This fairy tale rather sums up the majority of Rodgers’ time in Scotland.Rodgers insists – quite rightly – that Christie’s talent was never in question. Rather Celtic’s manager allowed the Aberdeen spell so the 23-year-old would add physicality and power to his game. “Ryan always had quality,”said Rodgers. “He came back from Aberdeen and it was about waiting for the moment. In big games he is now showing he has the quality to play for the biggest teams.”Christie’s father, Charlie, was once a classy midfielder who failed to settle upon leaving his Inverness home for Celtic. “When I came here, Ryan was Charlie Christie’s son,” Rodgers added. “Now Charlie is Ryan Christie’s dad.”A penny for the thoughts of Derek McInnes, the Aberdeen manager, who admitted he kept shirt number 22 – Christie’s favourite – free in the close season in case he could lure the player. Aberdeen continue to suffer frustration at Celtic’s hands, though in this final they put up a spirited fight.“Any final defeat is sore,” said McInnes. “Celtic have a bigger, better squad, better players, but my players gave absolutely everything. We restricted Celtic to very few opportunities which isn’t easy. We played with tenacity, aggression and common sense. I’m really proud of my team.”Aberdeen’s issue, as has been recurrent this season, was a lack of punch. Celtic did not play particularly well – and, as Rodgers acknowledged, were not clinical enough themselves – but the mental approach of a side that has been peerless in Scotland for so long must be recognised. Rodgers has now won all seven competitions entered by Celtic and 22 cup ties out of 22.Christie’s latest moment arrived during a lengthy first-half stoppage time, necessary after a serious clash of heads between Gary Mackay-Steven and Dedryck Boyata. Celtic’s centre-half was able to play on but Mackay-Steven, who had been knocked unconscious, required hospital assessment. Thankfully McInnes later revealed the winger was okay and sitting up. But the scale of worry from fellow players at the time was obvious.Boyata played the long pass that was collected by Christie in more space than Aberdeen should have allowed. Christie’s initial shot was well saved by Joe Lewis but the Celtic player retained his footing sufficiently to scoop home the rebound.Celtic’s best chance for a second goal owed everything to woeful officiating after Dominic Ball was wrongly penalised for a handball which occurred outside the penalty area. But Andrew Dallas awarded a spot-kick. Even Celtic’s most fervent supporters would admit justice was done when Lewis batted away Scott Sinclair’s shot.Jozo Simunovic came closest to hauling Aberdeen back into the game when the Celtic substitute miscued a clearance on to his own bar. Sinclair fluffed his lines again after terrific build-up play from Callum McGregor but there was never any strong sense Celtic would require a second goal.Can Rodgers now contemplate a third domestic clean sweep, a treble treble? “That’s a long, long way away,” he said. The last two months have seen a stark upturn in Celtic fortunes, after a start to the season when Rodgers made his concerns perfectly plain.When asked how this situation was corrected, the former Liverpool manager said he took his team “back to basics” in terms of how they managed games. “Forget all the technical jargon, it’s about denying the opponent time to play and then technically playing at a quicker and faster level.” Basics, in the context of Celtic and Rodgers, means winning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/855003296c952aa19bf758afe6c59f9d80850a2d/0_67_2535_1520/master/2535.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f60181ae5fad1607b3e5a66606aeff03","title":"liverpool everton premier league match report","story":"When the decisive moment arrived, almost six minutes into stoppage time, Jürgen Klopp was on the pitch, David Pleat-style minus the brown shoes, and the victory run took him all the way to his goalkeeper, Alisson, some 40 yards from Liverpool’s dugout. It was bedlam, absolute bedlam, and amid all the chaos an unlikely hero had emerged in the shape of Divock Origi, scoring a late, dramatic winner beneath the Kop with one of the more eccentric and ecstatic goals of any Merseyside derby.In the long history of this fixture the supporters of Liverpool will cherish that freakish moment when Virgil van Dijk tried his luck with a 25-yard volley in the final seconds and miscued it so badly that there was an audible groan from the home crowd, as if they suspected that was their final chance to win. Van Dijk turned away in disgust, furious with himself for not making a cleaner connection. Except the spin on the ball took it high and then down and, suddenly, Jordan Pickford in the Everton goal was in trouble. The ball dropped on to the crossbar and, astonishingly, bounced on top of the woodwork again. Pickford was flailing and Origi, an 84th-minute substitute, was there to apply the finishing nod.And Klopp was off, pumping his fists, celebrating so wildly he had a moment of remorse afterwards and claimed he had apologised to Marco Silva, the Everton manager, in case it seemed disrespectful. Silva, intriguingly, seemed nonplussed, saying there had been zero apology.That aside, how vital could that goal be? Without it Liverpool would have left the pitch knowing Manchester City’s vastly superior goal difference at the top of the Premier League put the champions, in effect, five points clear. Origi’s winner dramatically changes the picture again. It was an incredible way to settle any match, let alone a derby, and Klopp’s celebration told its own story.For Everton it was a crushing way to lose, culminating in a crestfallen Pickford holding up an apologetic hand to the corner of Anfield Road where their supporters were congregated. For long spells Everton had been superb, attacking stylishly, defending stubbornly and playing with an ambition that has rarely been associated with their visits to Anfield since the turn of the century. The bottom line, however, is that their miserable run against Liverpool is now 16 league games without a win, going back to October 2010, and to lose in such devastating circumstances will make it little consolation that they had contributed so richly to an absorbing contest.Pickford’s role in the goal will inevitably be scrutinised and, plainly, the England international goalkeeper badly misjudged the trajectory of the ball. He was not alone, in fairness, but once he realised it was not going into the crowd he should probably have tried to tip the ball over for a corner. Maybe, so late into the game, he decided in that split second he would rather catch it. But he could not manage either, his fingertips helping to keep the ball in play, and his net was hopelessly exposed when – almost in slow motion – the ball dropped to Origi a yard or so from the line.Until that point it would have been difficult to begrudge Everton a share of the points. Liverpool’s inability to break them down had already prompted Klopp to substitute Mohamed Salah with a quarter of an hour to play. Roberto Firmino was also removed, allowing Origi on the pitch. Sadio Mané and Xherdan Shaqiri had squandered Liverpool’s better opportunities and, when Origi had his first chance to be the hero, in the 87th minute, he could not take it, turning a close-range shot against the crossbar.If nothing else, it must be encouraging for Everton’s supporters that their team could play so enterprisingly at the home of their nearest rivals. Too often Everton have made the trip across Stanley Park and seemed painfully aware of the imbalance of talent between the sides. Not here, though. Everton played with spirit, ambition and courage on the ball as if affronted by the fact they had not won a league game here since 1999.As they reflect on how brutal this sport can be, Silva and his players will also think back to a number of scoring chances, particularly in the opening half. Yerry Mina headed the game’s first clear opportunity wide, six yards out, from a free-kick. Yet the biggest let-off for Liverpool came in the 20th minute when Alisson saved a point-blank header from André Gomes and, among a scramble of bodies, Joe Gomez managed to hook the ricochet off the goal-line. Gylfi Sigurdsson turned the loose ball against the post and that was a key moment. Gomes played well but really ought to have done better with the initial opportunity.Ultimately, though, this match will always be remembered for what happened in the 96th minute – an injury to Idrissa Gueye had delayed the game after four minutes of stoppages were shown on the electronic board – and the wild scenes that followed. Silva tried to console Pickford at the final whistle but the damage was done and Anfield celebrated an extraordinary victory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa49233fa44407332a66945d9ebaffbc3dc80246/0_37_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bf9b17ca48fb7ab8945223edbc061b5","title":"uefa new european club competition 2021","story":"• Governing body says 32 teams will take part in ‘UEL2’• Fixtures to be played on Thursday alongside Europa LeagueThere will be a third European club competition from 2021, Uefa has announced. President Aleksander Ceferin said a “widespread demand” for participation at European level had led to the formation of the new tournament, which will sit under the Champions and Europa Leagues.With a working title of ‘UEL2’, the 32-team competition will start at the beginning of the new Uefa cycle, which runs from 2021-2024. Eight groups of four will be whittled down to a round of 16, following a play-off between the second-placed teams and those who finish third in the Europa League. Quarter-finals and semi-finals will then follow, before a 141st game, the final.“The new Uefa club competition makes Uefa’s club competitions more inclusive than ever before,” Ceferin said.“There will be more matches for more clubs, with more associations represented in the group stages. This competition was borne out of ongoing dialogue with clubs through the European Club Association (ECA).“There was a widespread demand by all clubs to increase their chances of participating more regularly in European competition. This has been achieved with a strategic approach, and in accordance with Uefa’s objective of having both more quality and more inclusivity in our club competitions.”The winner of the new tournament will then earn a place in the Europa League. Uefa added that the fixtures will be played on a Thursday, the same day as the Europa League, with some games in a new time slot of 1530 GMT.The governing body will leave it to inidual associations to decide the criteria for earning a place, be it through league placing or cup.ECA chairman Andrea Agnelli welcomed the news, saying: “I am delighted that the Uefa Executive Committee has agreed to the changes ECA member clubs have been calling for.“We believe that this outcome ensures that the Uefa club competitions continue to develop in a manner which is fair and balanced, meeting the demands and requirements necessary to ensure that football remains the number one sport globally.“I would like to add that this whole process is testimony to the strong collaborative efforts of both ECA and Uefaat all levels.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed1ec75b276c66d54dfec4b588a75ec9f35e0f17/0_46_2725_1635/master/2725.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a0053c66a33cdeb6d7bd1f887df9fe0","title":"liverpool v everton premier league live","story":"Substitute Divock Origi scored a bizarre 96th minute winner to give Liverpool an unforgettable victory after a pulsating Merseyside derby at AnfieldAn unbelievable end to a very, very good derby in which both teams played well. Nobody who watched that will forget it in a hurry. I’m off to lie down in a darkened room, and wish you a pleasant finish to the weekend!Enjoywallow in Daniel Taylor’s match report here:Even after about a dozen replays it’s hard to work out quite what happened between Pickford, the crossbar and Van Dijk’s spinning shot. Was he trying to keep the ball in play or, in fact, tip it over? Either way it was unnecessary and he seemed to catch his hands on the bar, helping the ball down. What a freak mistake.Yes – winning by a jammy goal in the dying seconds tends to be the best way.Absolutely true – that was, and will be, a folkloric moment. Van Dijk had turned away in disgust after his miscue and started running back into his own half!So does Van Dijk: “Obviously in the end it’s such a great feeling. We had great chances. They had a good side but we were better. Last-minute goals are always a bit special. They gave us a good game today and I think we deserved the win. We don’t need to look at City. They are doing an amazing job but we need to look at ourselves.”“Man City – Mahrez misses a penalty, we get a lucky draw, and now this. Didn’t deserve either, but of course we will take it,” opines Richard McGahey.I wonder if Klopp will hear more about that – ahem – enthusiastic celebration, not that you’d expect him to care a jot.If Pickford had just left the ball alone. If Gueye hadn’t been injured, adding that extra couple of minutes on. It’s if, if, if for Everton – who played so well from beginning to, almost, end.The scenes there! Klopp was on the pitch, completely beside himself. They celebrate now and there’s Klopp again, bellowing into the camera. Liverpool didn’t quite deserve that, in my view, but they’ve won it in freakish, utterly unbelievable fashion. Origi was indeed the hero – but did anyone think he could win it quite like that?I don’t believe what I’ve just seen! That was incredible! Alexander-Arnold aims a deep delivery towards Liverpool’s box and it’s headed away. Van Dijk tries a speculative volley from 25 yards but totally messes it up and it spoons high into the air, on course to drop over the bar. But Pickford isn’t sure about it and, instead of watching it over, jumps up – clawing it down and onto the crossbar! It then pops off the frame a second time and Origi, staying lively, finishes from a yard. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a goal like that, especially in these circumstances!This is extraordinary! Wait until you see this goal! Klopp is on the pitch and Anfield has gone BERSERK!90+5 min: Richarlison instigates a little skirmish by the Liverpool corner flag, Alexander-Arnold and Van Dijk getting involved, but it’s a storm in a teacup.90+4 min: Gueye takes some treatment so we should carry on for another minute or so beyond the allotted four.90+2 min: Sturridge dances into the box beautifully and just for a second seems to have contrived a half-chance to win it, but Richarlison is back to win the ball cleanly. What a shift Everton have put in here, from back to front.90+1 min: Sigurdsson is booked for fouling Robertson – and stopping a useful counter. He is rewarded with the chance to sit out the four minutes of added time, Kurt Zouma replacing him.89 min: Everton aim to calm things down with a change. Bernard goes off, to be replaced by Calvert-Lewin.87 min: Keane makes a crucial interception, facing his own goal but hooking Alexander-Arnold’s latest cross away. Liverpool are stepping up the pressure and, for the first time really, look the likely winners. Origi then streaks away down the right and Coleman, covering inside diligently, thuds his centre away from Mane. It’s a corner ... from which Origi hits the bar! So close to that storybook moment! Van Dijk wins a header and, right in front of goal, Origi jabs out a leg but can only strike the woodwork. What a chance to win it!85 min: ... which doesn’t beat the first man, not for the first time.84 min: Remember Divock Origi? He’s just replaced Firmino for his first Premier League game in 15 months. He has derby-winning form it’d be some story if he could do it again. And Liverpool win a corner immediately ...84 min: This would, of course, be a very satisfying result for Manchester City as well as for Everton. How much do Liverpool gamble in these closing minutes?82 min: Firmino drags across goal after running onto a swept Alexander-Arnold pass. He never really looked like scoring from that.81 min: Gomez cynically hauls Richarlison back after he gets on the wrong side of him, and is booked. A good foul as it happened in a harmless area and Richarlison was heading for the danger zone.80 min: This is very composed, controlled and impressive from Everton even if they can’t push on and win it – and even if they lose it. There are signs that they might just be on the way back.77 min: Fabinho is booked, having tried to tidy up a mess started by Firmino. He’s launched into a couple of spicy challenges today.75 min: Everton continue to apply some pressure. The chances haven’t, in general, been as clear for either side this half but you would not rule out a winner. Salah will not provide it, as he walks off to be replaced by Daniel Sturridge. Bit of a surprise to see him hooked instead of the quiet and slightly sluggish Firmino.71 min: Here comes Naby Keita, in place of Shaqiri, which heralds a 4-3-3 for Liverpool and a bit of a tightening-up. Everton have just wrested control lately.69 min: Alexander-Arnold concedes a left-sided free-kick, which Everton make little of, but since Lookman’s introduction the Toffees have really brightened up again.67 min: Mane, again, is close after a delicious sidefoot across goal from Robertson. He’s just put off sufficiently by Digne as he looks to convert from a matter of feet.66 min: And another good moment for the away side, Bernard tricking in from the left and taking aim but seeing his effort squirt away from the far post.65 min: A patient, slick Everton move, front-to-back-to-front, results in their cutting Liverpool open down the right. But Alexander-Arnold is terrifically alert to cut out Coleman’s ball across with Richarlison waiting to pull the trigger.63 min: It is getting a bit testy, Richarlison at the centre of a few handbags. It would be a shame if a good game became overly niggly but it’s certainly tense and there’s an edge developing. Walcott won’t be at the sharp end of it anymore – he does indeed come off and Lookman replaces him.60 min: Walcott fizzes a cross straight at Alisson. Not quite the same level of threat from Everton at the moment although the intent remains clear and a couple of times they’ve been one better pass away from a nice situation.59 min: Not far off from Mane, appearing from deep this time after neat hold-up play from Salah. It’s a much harder chance than his other two and, while well struck, he puts is wide from 20 yards.57 min: Seems Walcott will be alright. Ademola Lookman would be the obvious replacement if he pulled up lame again although you often see managers decide to tighten up in situations like that. Not sure Silva is cut from that cloth mind you.55 min: Walcott has an issue, I think he got a nick from Wijnaldum just now. He’s not looking very content.53 min: A second huge chance for Mane! Firmino controls on his chest and instinctively finds Mane first-time. He’s racing away in the inside-left but, as Mina recovers, seems to be put off and his finish slides well wide of the near post.50 min: An intricate Liverpool move ends with Bernard, better known for his attacking flair, race back and brilliantly hook the ball away after Alexander-Arnold volleys it back towards Firmino.48 min: Liverpool show rather more convincingly. It’s Salah, with his first consequential effort of the night, bending a left-footer just past Pickford’s far post, causing the keeper to scurry across goal and e at full stretch.47 min: Everton are first to show in the second period, Walcott making a searing run through the middle and perhaps holding onto the ball for too long. He ends up unable either to pass or shoot and Liverpool clear the danger.Get ready – we’re soon to get started at Anfield for the second half and if it’s much like the first in manner I can’t see it finishing goalless ...And here is Dave Hytner on Arsenal 4-2 Spurs:Football has been happening elsewhere, you know. Here is Suzanne Wrack’s report on Manchester City’s big 2-0 win over Arsenal in the Women’s Super League:No goals but plenty of fun, especially in a really ding-dong first 35 minutes or so. It should probably be 2-2. Mane and Shaqiri have both missed one-on-ones for Liverpool while Mina planted an early header wide for Everton and Andre Gomes was *somehow* denied by a combination of Alisson and Van Dijk later. Parity is fair and it’s refreshing to see an Everton side have a real go at Anfield as this one is.45 min: Liverpool look to prove that statement premature and Salah, after a lengthy grapple with Mina, earns a free-kick just to the right of the area. It’d be the perfect time to score. But Alexander-Arnold’s delivery is poor and cleared at the near post.43 min: Mane and Salah combine but the latter can’t squeeze around Coleman and Pickford can smother. We are heading for a goalless first half.42 min: A slight lull in the tempo now, with Liverpool dominating the ball but doing little of note with it. Both sides have put a lot into this half.39 min: Pickford executes some smart sweeper-keeping as Shaqiri aims a low, flat ball through for Mane. The danger is averted.37 min: This is rattling good stuff and you really wouldn’t fancy picking a winner.35 min: Pickford saves from Shaqiri! The Swiss is one-on-one after Salah sees him to his right, and if we’re being critical he should probably shoot with his first or second touch. But he can’t quite decide which foot to go with, eventually opting for his weaker right, and that gives Pickford the chance to set himself and block with a leg! Shaqiri really should have scored. And, as is the pattern here, we go straight down the other end and Alisson is out to do *just* enough as Walcott tries to go round him, bundling the ball against the forward’s legs and out. I’m not sure how we haven’t had a goal yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9ebdfd732764928a71b7c35bef8b8818823df55/0_19_1714_1028/master/1714.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8ab69a94870b46e156bb355d81f43a7","title":"quiz litty shook or goat can you talk tween","story":"Finstagram, spilling tea and looking snatched.

We’re both in our late 30s and want to settle down. After just six months we are moving in together and I’m considering proposing. We’re very much in love and have a wonderful life. But on meeting her extended family and friends, it’s clear we are from incredibly different backgrounds. Mine is humble, hers is filled with professors and doctors, and has close links to the best universities and the cultural elite.Her family and friends are lovely, but I can’t get over the feeling of inadequacy, particularly because I know how much value they put on education. They are very wealthy and she’s yet to visit my parents’ tiny semi in the Midlands. I feel her family will think she’s settling. There’s a similar situation with another family member. It’s often discussed, without the realisation that it is close to the bone.I have a very good job and live a nice life with charity work and travel, but I really don’t feel good enough because of my background and education. Even thinking of the wedding guests mixing stresses me out so much.Mariella replies Haven’t you done well! Don’t worry, I’m just messing with you. It’s sad that although privilege is no longer considered any guarantee of success, a man in love should be experiencing a class struggle within his own relationship. I’ll neither chastise you nor seek to dissuade you from giving the matter careful consideration. Hopefully you’re aware of how ill-founded your feelings of low self-worth are? Legitimate worry about how the disparity in your life experiences will impact further down the line is different from actually believing you are in any way lesser. As a self-starter myself, the greatest pride I ever experience is when I find myself in hallowed halls and mansions, among those presumed culturally or aristocratically elite, knowing I have earned entry under my own steam. Feeling I’m in elevated company is occasionally brought on by the presence of big brains, but never big bank accounts.You say you work in the charity sector, which will have brought you nose to nose with those less privileged than yourself, so you will be better aware than most of the lottery of life and how luck is as much of a currency as talent or tenacity. Your girlfriend may be fortunate in her privileged upbringing, but it’s taken her just as long to find a real and realistic mate – so there’s an example of equality of opportunity for starters.Your parents may live in a lowly semi, but they’ve created a god, or at least a god in your girlfriend’s eyes, so they, too, have abilities to equal her more fiscally fortunate family. I could go polemical about the inequality of our education system, of how much more admirable it is to succeed based on limited opportunity than an excess of advantages and how proud you should be that you can describe your life today as “wonderful”. It would be easy to elaborate, but by doing so I’d simply be reinforcing our deeply embedded belief that there are the haves and the have-nots, and there’s no good to be gleaned from mixing disparate elements.The problem you have isn’t with your prospective in-laws, regardless of whether the frequent mentions of the member who married down are intentional or benign. The problem you’re experiencing resides where most of our issues emerge from – between your own ears. It doesn’t matter how convincingly I lecture you on the equality of all mankind and encourage you to be blind to your girlfriend’s advantaged relations, just as we are increasingly becoming to race and gender. Your letter makes plain your conviction of disparity and it’s that sense of your own shortcomings that will corrode your chances of happiness unless you manage to get it under control.I wouldn’t often counsel counselling before you even get hitched, though it would put a lot of relationships on a firmer footing. In your case I’m convinced it would be worthwhile for you inidually and perhaps also as a couple. You two need to sit down and be genuinely honest with each other and that’s often the hardest thing to be. Beyond the sugary sheen of romance, you need to grub about in the dark places that might otherwise take a decade to get to and, unchecked, have the power to cause irreparable damage. These feelings you are having need to be aired and shared, but I suspect doing so within the confines of the relationship won’t be enough, which is where a professional can really help. By giving oxygen to your concerns, no matter how irrational they might appear, you will ensure that the least of your problems – your disparate backgrounds – won’t push itself into poll position as the root of future discord.There’s no reason why two people who love each other can’t surmount the barriers to be faced as you navigate a future together, but yours is deeply embedded and insidious enough to creep up on you when you are most vulnerable. Addressing your perceived inequality now is the best way to ensure its doesn’t come back to bite you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f19b38720cb72fa98499d04babc304d05c76a0dc/0_541_4156_2494/master/4156.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e049258e3d4e460362347fd9c846a8f8","title":"i love being a mother its just the word that bothers me","story":"Natasha Pearlman on why she doesn’t like the term ‘mother’ – and the billion pound industry that’s been created around itOver the past few months, every time I’ve tentatively raised the subject I’m going to tell you about with friends, family or acquaintances, I’ve been met with a sharp intake of breath. “Really?” they ask, tilting their heads quizzically. Occasionally a look of concern flashes across their faces. “Is she serious? She has kids. Has something happened?”Nothing has happened and, yes, I am serious. I just don’t like the word “mother”, that’s all.I am aware, of course, that by an inescapable biological fact I am one, with my two daughters: Rose aged four and a half and Thea, four months. I love them – deeply and intensely. And it’s a part of my personal life that couldn’t bring me more joy. I don’t even mind hearing “Mummy” whined at me about 200 times a day.No, it’s not being a mother I don’t like, it is being a “mother”.For it was as if the minute I had Rose, I had been conferred some kind of generic identity, with the same generic needs and wants as all other mothers. It was a society-defined term, with society-defined generalisations. How I was going to feel as soon as I “became one”. What I needed to buy, as a mother, to meet expectations. The way my life, from this point on, was going to pan out. Who I was now going to become, now that my life was no longer all my own.The ferocity with which this new identity felt like it was being thrust upon me – I was now a “mama” who surely was going to want to abandon my old life to focus entirely on my new family, right? – couldn’t have been further from what my husband was experiencing as a new father. His was a role he could wear lightly, one he could learn to define for himself, alongside his other commitments. There were no products he had to buy, no books to read, no new personality to subsume. But becoming a mother? It felt loaded, all-encompassing and, to me, uncomfortable. Not positive, or powerful, or equal.It also felt clichéd. Even today, even with so much effort focused on achieving gender equality, the language around mothers is so stereotypical – we “care”, “juggle”, “wing it” or “do it all” (and even if we “own” these words, they still exist), whereas fathers “provide” or “entertain”, rather than “ide” and “share”.And while words might not seem like much, I know from the job I do as a writer and editor that the casual, throwaway way in which we use language helps shape our culture and expectations. Whether we like it or not, we often become the terms that seek to define us. Right from the very start, as a result of all this, while I loved my daughter with every part of me, I struggled with being a mother.Before I continue, I am fully aware of just how loaded and emotive motherhood is. How difficult, provocative and upsetting this may sound for some women – those who have been through immense trauma or struggles in order to call themselves, and be, a mother. Those who long to have this identity, but yet may never be able to, for various reasons. Those who have shunned motherhood and are possibly fed up of being surrounded by it. And those for whom it is their vocation, their love, the centre of their world.So who am I to take issue with the word? And whatever my own personal feelings, I’m wrong, surely? Because, arguably, there’s never been a better time to be a mother. Gone are the days when having a child meant the end of your career – Serena Williams, Helena Morrissey, Net-a-Porter founder Natalie Massenet and current president Alison Loehnis, Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg and Nicola Mendelsohn are just a few of the many visible women showing us how you achieve success at home and at work.Our Instagram feeds are filled with inspiring and realistic “mum” role models, delivering us every conceivable and relatable version of motherhood you could imagine: @mother_of_daughters, @scummymummies, @selfishmother, @honestmum, @dresslikeamum, with nearly 1 million followers between them. And #motherhood with its 12m posts and rising is our space in which to share our challenges, highs and lows, and speak to other women going through what we are. It’s also our platform to showcase our inidual takes on this particular life stage or find the “tribe” that reflects us best.Then there are the women making motherhood profitable – Michelle Kennedy, founder of “mum” friendship app Peanut and the women behind similar app Mush, as well as Molly Gunn, who has turned Selfish Mother into a thriving clothing business, where we can wear various slogans of motherhood proudly across our chests.Want to write a book? Make it about motherhood and you’re on to a winner! From Sheila Heti’s acclaimed novel Motherhood and Angela Garbes’s non-fiction feminist book Like a Mother, to manuals on how to birth, there have been more than 30 published this year with the word “mother” in the title.And fashion – the industry I have worked in for the past six years, first as deputy editor of Elle and then as editor of Grazia until February this year – has made motherhood “cool”. It’s been sexualised on the catwalks for a while now, with pregnant models often showcasing their bumps in barely there lingerie, and in September this year with the appearance of Slick Woods at Rihanna’s Savage x Fenty show, nine months pregnant and (she revealed later) having contractions. And at the recent Marine Serre show in New York, motherhood was celebrated – with models wearing their babies, proudly and defiantly, in slings that matched their jumpsuits.While fashion shows might seem easy to dismiss, thanks to their often headline-grabbing showmanship, the influence the industry commands is huge. British and German Vogue now run online columns on motherhood and a number of fashion’s greatest social media influencers have recently or are about to become mums – Susie Lau, Pandora Sykes and Giovanna Battaglia, to name a few – and are using their platforms to showcase pre- and post-birth style, as well as the daily travails of new parenthood.Whether we like it or not, motherhood is in, and we are being sold the message that being a mother doesn’t have to hinder us. It can be cool, sexy and even financially lucrative. In fact, the figures are staggering – with “mumpreneurs” now expected to contribute £9.4bn to the UK economy by 2025 (up from £7.4bn in 2015).So, rather than shun it, why have I not embraced motherhood? Why have I not thrown myself headlong into the movement and even tried to turn a profit from it? Why haven’t I allowed myself simply to enjoy it?It’s an uncomfortable question to answer, because in many ways, surely, my prejudices are unfair. Just because I’ve not been able to switch off and allow myself to be consumed, on both my maternity leaves, by the uncomplicated gorgeousness of having a newborn, why should I start criticising it for everyone else?But it’s not that – everyone is entitled to the maternity leave they want. Where I come up against mothering and motherhood is that it’s become fetishised. It’s turned into an obsession, a crew to be part of, even, arguably, a clique – into which some of us will and won’t fit. We are being seduced into this new world, where we are meant to be able to be ourselves, with women just like us, and even potentially make money from it, but in which we are also, thanks to social media, required to keep up with our peers, heaping yet more pressure on us. But what if we can’t succeed as our role models do? How does that make us feel?Yet more disturbingly, it is because I believe the #motherhood movement is something we’ve convinced ourselves is empowering, when, really, it’s just a smokescreen for the fact that we still face so many inequalities every day.The gender pay gap is not closing any time soon. There’s a lack of women in senior roles across almost every single profession. And nearly 20 years on from the publication of the book WifeWork by Susan Maushart – which argued that women still do the large majority of work and childcare at home, whatever our role outside it – nothing has really changed.In fact, just last month the book Fed Up by Gemma Hartley was released, tackling the enormity of the emotional labour that women still have to shoulder alongside day jobs, house admin and raising children. It was borne of her own experiences of being unable and unwilling to deal with all of society’s unequal expectations of women.And it was my own experiences of first- and second-time motherhood that convinced me that the motherhood movement was perhaps a case of the emperor’s new clothes. That we had fallen for the greatest con of all.Somehow we had been convinced that creating our own women’s world was our idea, and the best place for us to thrive, when actually it was because we had been forced out of the wider one.My own experience of this began almost the very moment I found out I was pregnant, in 2014. It struck me that, as soon as I had started journeying down the motherhood path, decisions started being made for me. What kind of birth I needed or should have, how much I should and shouldn’t know about childbirth, who should raise my child, how I should balance work and child-rearing and what was best for my own body.Up until the point of pregnancy, I felt like my own person. But then, suddenly, I had turned from inidual into expectant mother, with the same presumed wants and needs as all other mothers. I had become part of a group, with generic assumptions being made about me and the life I was going to lead post-baby. And a person for whom decisions were taken, rather than the other way round – in a way that men will never experience.In a way, I was complicit in my own deception. I willingly let other people and societal expectations take control of my life. I didn’t question it when people told me it was better not to know the truth about birth until I had gone through it (it was not, and the ramifications felt enormous). And for too long, I misguidedly believed the lie that I could “have it all” – when actually society, and I, should have been preaching to “share it all”. That meant flogging myself to the bone in order to achieve everything I wanted to at work, then racing to pick my daughter up from nursery as often as I could, doing bath and bedtime and then attempting to be there for her emotionally as she navigated her way from baby to toddler to little girl. It shouldn’t have been a big surprise that, deep down, I was pretty unhappy.I began to resent the fact that society didn’t seem to accommodate fathers or partners balancing work and childcare – why was it only mothers who were expected to rush home or work flexibly for school or nursery pick-ups? And it deeply frustrated me that no one ever thought to ask my husband: “How do you cope with a high-pressure job and a young baby?”However, I questioned how much of it came out of desire, and how much from necessity – thanks to endemically lower wages than their male counterparts and societal expectations to shoulder the majority of the child-rearing. Because, while society patted itself on the back for offering more flexible hours, who were they really aimed at? Who was, most likely, going to have to take most advantage of them? Who was going to potentially have to put their career on hold as a result? Women.So rather than see their lives stall, #motherhood rose up. We turned kitchen table start-ups into huge empires, because we’re deeply capable. But we were only sitting at them in the first place because we were forced from our desks.We turned social media into our new home and personal branding platform and made motherhood “cool” or “scummy” or “funny” because we’re brilliant marketeers – and why not make motherhood even greater than the sum of its parts? We started hashtags and fashion trends and turned #dresslikeamum into a fashion statement, because we’re normal, stylish women desperate to break out of the stereotype we have been placed in.But while we created this brilliant, powerful and lucrative female world that feels like our saviour, I began to wonder if it was actually some sort of twisted pyramid scheme in which in the short term we feel like winners (we’re making all this money!), but in the long term only we are the losers (because we’re selling the same things back and forth to each other).Just think about so many of today’s “mother” businesses – clothing brands aimed at stressed-out mums who want to reclaim the stereotypes, apps to connect us, hacks to save us time, books to guide us through every eventuality. We now work, in part, to pay for the items of lifestyle we now believe we need. And then we innovate and create more businesses to solve more female-centric problems in our lives.While it might feel empowering, by not tackling the wider issues around sharing childcare, or smashing societal stereotypes, are we not allowing the cycle of inequality to perpetuate? Are we accidentally exploiting one another because we’ve bought into the lie that we’re better off out of the “boys’ club”?The reality is that it’s still tougher, in every respect, for women after a baby then men. And by sidestepping the issue, are we not harming ourselves, in the long term, more?We’ve spent years making the most of the decisions that have been taken for us. And we’ve turned the corner we’ve been put in, into a palace. But it’s still a corner. And we’re still in it. Surely it’s time, now, to leave that behind and send #motherhood out of fashion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e63c0440a7f819036e9b4d69176a04a60aa7291/278_0_4600_2760/master/4600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38e19985439988a42255904f75b49adc","title":"yoga v pilates both are popular but which would work best for you","story":"Pilates, yoga’s more modern associate, has seen similarly rapid growth since it was devised almost 100 years ago. Increasing stress levels, coupled with a greater focus on physical health and wellbeing, are cited as factors in the growth of both, as well as celebrity endorsements – Madonna and Geri Halliwell have long sworn allegiance to yoga, while Beyoncé and Emma Stone fly the flag for pilates.But despite the longevity and global popularity, confusion persists about yoga and pilates, compounded by the increasing variety of classes offered in each discipline. Ashtanga, iyengar and vinyasa are all considered relatively modern incarnations of yoga inevitably new variants of pilates have sprung up, too, as the market has become more commercialised. Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, whose mother, Doria Ragland, is a yoga teacher, is a fan of Megaformer – a souped-up version of reformer pilates – while gyrotonic yoga is credited with helping Andy Murray with his longstanding back issues.Teachers of both yoga and pilates say they are routinely asked to explain the difference between them. “The simple answer is that they’re both low intensity, low impact and inclusive, unlike many other forms of exercise,” says Prof Greg Whyte, a former Olympian and now leading authority on sports science. “Generally speaking, yoga is much more about flexibility and stability, pilates is strength and stability.”But, for every flashy gym offering yoga classes to burn calories and sculpt bodies, there are many more teachers committed to its traditional spiritual principles. Yoga was originally practised by holy ascetics in India, its aim to focus the mind, connect with a higher consciousness and, through this newfound compassion, end suffering in the world.For Lily Silverton, a fashion editor turned yoga teacher, it is a way of life that demands she practise social value. “I strongly believe that in yoga, you’re in service,” she says, giving as an example her voluntary work with mental-health and refugee charities, homeless people and children with special needs.Jonelle Lewis, this month’s Om Yoga magazine cover star, describes teaching yoga as a form of stewardship. “These are not my teachings,” she says. “These are lineage teachings that we have the honour to pass on to people.”Although pilates is not a spiritual pursuit, its origins are rooted in healing and rehabilitation. Its German inventor, Joseph Pilates, relocated to England in 1912 and, as war broke out, was interned with other Germans working in a hospital on the Isle of Man. It was here that he invented the beginnings of his reformer, cadillac and chair equipment, using springs to help bed-bound patients develop their muscles.That tradition continues to this day. Laura Browning Grant, a pilates teacher in North Carolina, gained a huge following on social media for using pilates techniques to rehabilitate her husband, Jonny, a former Navy Seal who suffered a traumatic brain injury in a car crash. Grant has written about the power of pilates for both physical and mental wellbeing.“I have worked with iniduals that have experienced trauma, causing emotional and physical damage,” she writes. “Using the pilates method, many were able to regain a sense of balance in their life.”Suzi Power teaches yoga and pilates at the community studio East of Eden in London, and sees the benefits of both. She advocates pilates as a safer option for those prone to injury, or those who are exploring this type of exercise for the first time. “I trained in yoga first, but I was drawn to pilates reformer because I had a yoga injury. Pilates helped me to rehabilitate.”Yoga uses the body to connect with the mind and the inner self, while pilates uses mindfulness to connect to the inner workings of the body. “I practise both and love both – I think they complement each other well,” says Lottie Murphy, a former ballet dancer, now pilates teacher. “The main difference is the focus on the spiritual element in yoga. Some of the actual poses are similar – in pilates, we do the elephant, which is basically downward dog, and also backbends. It’s just that in pilates, we tend to build up to some of those moves more slowly than you might in yoga.”Interestingly, the NHS does not count either practise towards its recommended target of 150 minutes of moderate activity per week (although it does count towards muscle strengthening), but the more dynamic forms of yoga do offer a cardiovascular workout. “I’d love to get someone from the NHS down to a dynamic flow class, or rocket yoga, where you come out dripping with sweat,” says Ruth Tongue, a pilates teacher of 10 years and yoga fan.Be warned, however, the more dynamic forms are not recommended for beginners. “They move very quickly, so there’s potential for damage to joints,” says Silverton. “Both pilates and yoga target muscle groups that you won’t access in many other forms of exercise. You can be an incredibly fit runner or boxer and come out of a yoga or pilates class in agony because you’ve worked muscles you don’t usually engage.”As the skinny, immaculate white women who pop up in a Google image search go to show, the stereotype is that yoga is squarely aimed at those with privilege. Lewis, a rare woman of colour in the industry’s spotlight, is understandably frustrated that the practice’s roots in Indian spirituality have been all but erased from its public image.“Yoga is for everyone,” she says. “I don’t know a single person who wouldn’t benefit from being able to breathe more deeply, have more mental space and put ease into their body. But you look in the media, or go into a yoga studio – even in London – and it’s all vanilla.”Tongue, whose clients include Charlton women’s football team, is equally frustrated by the Instagram imagery of pilates. “I don’t teach any classes where people turn up in crop tops. I mainly teach older people, often in their 70s. They’re really strong and they love it.”When professional athletes come to Whyte asking about yoga and pilates, which discipline does he recommend? “Often I suggest a combination of the two. Pilates has become the mainstay of rehab, particularly for back problems. But it’s also great for other conditions, such as urinary incontinence. You’re focusing on the core, whereas yoga tends to be more the whole body.“Both are great in pregnancy, although the key advice to remember is that pregnant women should look to maintain fitness, not improve it. Maintenance of range of motion is fine overstretching is problematic.”If you are hypermobile – that’s when joints stretch further than they should – the consensus is to try pilates first, and to approach yoga with caution. “You can do yoga and be hypermobile,” says Silverton, who is hypermobile herself “You just have to be very careful. Let your teacher know, don’t push to your maximum, and keep a microbend in the knees and elbows when you practise.”Ultimately, it might just be down to personal preference. Power says the choice is as much in the mind as the body. “People who are more logical tend to like pilates, creative people tend to like yoga. My partner is an accountant and he can’t stand yoga – it’s too hippy for him – but he likes pilates.“People with a creative brain often find more freedom in yoga.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30aa45dbd87033e25f68920879a09c3caece3b3e/0_0_4775_3421/master/4775.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=adec42b8c8d92af5154c51a1677a185e 1400w","title":"theresa may 20 brexit deal house of commons","story":"PM is steadfastly saying she has no plan B, but other leaders are starting to sound uneasyWhen Theresa May addressed reporters on her RAF Voyager plane en route to the G20, she wore an eye-catching bracelet that appeared to depict the Great Wave off Kanagawa, the famous Japanese painting of a tsunami. Hokusai’s famous painting depicts a huge wave threatening three small boats, whose fishermen look calm and decisive.It could hardly have been a more appropriate metaphor for May’s approach to this summit, which could be her last as a national leader if her mutinous backbenchers get their way in the Brexit vote next week. The latest analysis suggests more than 100 Tory MPs could vote against her deal.In public, she has steadfastly maintained to other leaders that her Brexit deal is the blueprint for Britain’s post-Brexit future as an independent trading nation, and to reporters that there is no plan B for losing the vote in parliament.It is a message devoid of the context that her version of the deal looks likely to be voted down in parliament by more than half of the backbenchers in her own party, many of whom have based their opposition on the belief that the backstop provision threatens the opportunity to forge trade deals. During the summit, yet another minister – Sam Gyimah – resigned, refusing to back the deal.Yet when pressed on how the government is preparing for plan B, May has stressed that none exists, and that she is focused on winning the vote in parliament on 11 December.“Everyone said we would not get a deal, and now we’re in the position of having a deal, all you seem to want to be asking about is the next stage,” she told reporters on the plane. “We haven’t had the vote yet. Let’s focus.”“It’s a long flight,” one journalist quipped as the prime minister finished up her press briefing. “Will you spend any time working up a plan B in case the vote falls?”Throughout the two-day summit correspondents have repeatedly asked if it might be seen as irresponsible to have no plan in place for a second vote, a renegotiation offensive, for an offer to the Labour party or for a commitment to pursue no deal.Each time May has deflected. It is a deliberate strategy by No 10 to focus minds on the vote in parliament as the real moment of truth. They believe that without convincing colleagues that beyond defeat lies only chaos, the prime minister loses vital leverage.During the summit, May met with leaders from countries that Britain hopes to forge not only new trading relations but also security partnerships, including collaboration on a new satellite system to rival the EU’s Galileo project, which the UK has now formally pulled from its defence programme.Only one bilateral was not focused on trade, according to No 10: May’s meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, where the focus was Yemen and the killing of Jamal Khashoggi.It was the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, who first raised the elephant in the room – that the deal May was here to promote was no foregone conclusion. He politely described it as dealing in “typical British fashion” with “a very tough set of issues”.“I think you’ve shown great resilience and great determination on one of the most vexed issues I think there is,” he went on, a diplomatic reference to her domestic struggles, which he called “a very difficult issue for you and your colleagues”.In her next bilateral with Japan’s Shinzo Abe, one of the world leaders who May had hoped would be most supportive, Abe warned in his opening remarks that the UK must avoid no deal “to ensure transparency, predictability as well as legal stability in the Brexit process”.When May returns to the UK, Downing Street sources said she would not embark on any major tour of the country to sell her deal. Her focus will be on SW1, where she is expected to speak in the parliamentary debates and ramp up a charm offensive to convince Tory colleagues.For now, those are the people she really needs to convince, not the national leaders gathered in Buenos Aires."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bf3dad6118303474dd76bba71dc6847c1625183/0_155_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=159c5445d2709df2980b935db84bf3ce","title":"behind closed doors labour second referendum shadow cabinet strategy","story":"In a Commons tearoom, the shadow cabinet made a decisive move towards shifting its strategy on BrexitLast Wednesday at 2.30pm Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet gathered as usual in the Norman Shaw North wing of the House of Commons for their weekly meeting. Tea and plain biscuits were served – and the mood was serious to the point of being almost sombre. Particularly so, initially, because discussion focused on a disturbing report on poverty in the UK by the UN’s rapporteur Philip Alston. The shadow secretary of state for work and pensions, Margaret Greenwood, made a presentation, and for over an hour members of the Labour top team expressed dismay at the legacy of Tory austerity on the poorest in society.But those present were anxious and earnest for another reason. They knew Labour had to decide what to do next about Brexit. The fact that Theresa May’s deal with the EU was looking more likely, by the day, to be defeated in the House of Commons on 11 December was not just a looming catastrophe for the prime minister. It also required, urgently, a clearer strategy from Labour.What would Her Majesty’s official opposition, split like the Tories over Brexit and ultra-cautious in every move until now, do amid the chaos that would inevitably follow defeat for the prime minister?With less than half an hour left before the meeting had to end, because MPs had to go to vote, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, opened a discussion that could well, one day, feature in the history books. According to several sources who were there, Starmer made clear that if and when May lost the “meaningful” vote, Labour had to be ready, as he put it, to “move quickly through the gears”. What he meant was twofold, said those in attendance. First he was clear that Labour should waste no time in calling a no-confidence vote in the government, which if passed could lead to a general election. Several shadow cabinet ministers agreed that this should happen within 24 hours.But, given that few at the top of Labour (Jeremy Corbyn, shadow chancellor John McDonnell and Starmer included) believe such a no-confidence motion has much realistic chance of succeeding – as Labour does not have the numbers – Starmer’s reference to moving “through the gears” meant that further moves had to be prepared.“What was clear and implicit from what he said,” said a shadow cabinet member, “was that if and when we fail with a no-confidence motion, we must be ready very quickly to take up the option of a second referendum, if that is the best route to take. The danger for us of not doing that could be that we would have no policy at all.”Up until last Wednesday, Labour had taken refuge in the convenient, if slightly implausible, argument that it could bring down the government by forcing an election, and then somehow renegotiate a better deal for the country once in power. That tactical line served a split party well, keeping enough people on both sides of its Brexit ide tolerably content.But with the vote fast approaching and a TV debate between Corbyn and May pencilled in for next Sunday, it could hold only for so long. Starmer and others could see that if Labour failed to force an election, and with the EU adamant that it will not renegotiate in any substantial way, the opposition looked like running out of policy options.Several senior figures at the meeting strongly backed Starmer, including Tom Watson, the deputy leader, Tony Lloyd, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, and Richard Corbett, leader of Labour MEPs in the European parliament, who all specifically said the party should prepare for the option of a second referendum. Those at the meeting said it was clear that Remain would have to be on the ballot paper.Crucially, several shadow cabinet ministers confirmed that Corbyn offered no real objection to the proposal, although the Labour leader stressed the need to move step by step, with the first task being to ensure that the prime minister’s deal was voted down. Watson was particularly strong on the need for clarity. McDonnell too appeared to have come round to the idea, saying in a BBC interview the same day that it now looked “inevitable” that Labour would back a second referendum.Only two shadow cabinet members – the campaign coordinator Ian Lavery and shadow lord chancellor, Richard Burgon – are said to have spoken out against, warning that pro-Brexit Labour voters would never forgive them. Lavery said, according to one source: “If we support a second referendum we will never get the keys to Downing Street.” Those who agreed were, though, in the minority.Labour’s progress towards backing a second referendum has been slow and difficult. But pressure has been building, not least because the mass membership supports one. For Corbyn, a lifelong Eurosceptic, it has clearly been painful. Only two weeks ago he was saying the party had to honour the result of the 2016 referendum, meaning no second vote.And the party is not there yet. Another referendum would have to be officially endorsed by the shadow cabinet, and possibly the parliamentary Labour party. Even then, legislation would have to pass through the Commons and then decisions about the question to be put determined by MPs and finalised by the Electoral Commission. Tory MPs would have to come out in favour, as some Labour Eurosceptics such as Kate Hoey and Graham Stringer would oppose it.We are some way off yet. But there is a clear movement. On Friday Sam Gyimah resigned as universities minister, saying a second referendum should be considered. With parliament increasingly deadlocked and Labour moving “through the gears”, it is starting to look like there may be no other viable option.

But after the manufacturers’ representative group EEF, which is heavily involved in apprenticeships, said it seemed unlikely the target would be reached, Downing Street declined to confirm it was still in place.Rayner said: “Austerity is not over for our colleges, but this government is more than happy to hand out millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money to the Tories’ favourite advertising agency after abjectly failing to meet their own apprenticeships targets.“Labour will genuinely end austerity, providing free lifelong learning in colleges and invest in workplace training as part of a national education service for the many, not the few.”Milton said: “The aim of the new campaign is to grow the number of high-quality apprenticeships offered, and started, by 2020 and to change perceptions of apprenticeships to encourage more people to see the positive value they can have on their business or their career.“Our reforms have driven up investment in the quality of apprenticeships to build skills and give people more opportunities to succeed … In the last 12 months more than 100,000 more people have started these new apprenticeships, putting them on the path to success in a range of cutting-edge and exciting industries such as aerospace engineering, nuclear science and architecture.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8b8b99ce5e994b77f43ed9fcc60313a24f3a6e3/0_23_1338_803/master/1338.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7ed3fcc41d5fa9b9db877686ac60e2e","title":"razor blades found attached to childrens slide in aughton lancashire","story":"Police post video on Facebook showing blades stuck to slide in play area in AughtonRazor and scalpel blades have been discovered attached to the side of a children’s slide in west Lancashire.Ormskirk and Burscough police said the blades were found on Friday morning at the Winifred Lane play area in Aughton.The force posted a video on Facebook showing the razor blades attached apparently using sticky tape.A spokesperson said: “We would ask everyone to be vigilant and check any play equipment before you let your child use it … If anyone has any information about this we’d urge them to contact us as soon as possible.

Over the course of an hour, three tonnes of clay are moulded, pounded and remoulded by their hands as Icon sets out to show how we create objects, communities and ideas, then destroy them and start all over again.This is the UK debut for Sweden’s GöteborgsOperans Danskompani. They’re an impressive troupe, fully in tune with Cherkaoui’s earnest and often spiritual world. Dressed in monkish garb via Belgian high fashion (courtesy of Jan-Jan Van Essche), they are like people relocated from trivial real life into the rituals of some other plane: a cult, in essence, whose members are united by an intensity of purpose and a subsuming of the self into the group – and also into movement. Cherkaoui’s musical choices underline that spiritual tone, his love for haunting, ancient songs – in this case from the Mediterranean and Japan, the combination of nations adding up to somewhere otherworldly.It’s a habit of Cherkaoui to have one dancer, and then the whole company in unison, deliver a conversational lecture, a kind of TED talk, while posing arms and hands in rhythmic semaphore. It might be annoyingly mannered if it didn’t add an interesting layer to the themes. Here, the lecture is a Jason Silva text on cognitive framing – the art of remoulding ourselves through the way we perceive our experiences.The dancers also deliver a paean to paying attention in the moment – “spontaneous flow” – which, when they’re not talking, seems to be exactly what’s happening to them, whether it’s the whole company pulled in waves by a strong undertow, or in some extraordinary writhing and melting solos where the dancers’ agency is seemingly replaced with a pure urge that hoicks, lashes and churns their bodies. Michael Munoz is especially thrilling, an extra inch of flex in every move.For all the specificity of the text, and of the moulded props, which include baseball caps, cameras and cocktail glasses, Cherkaoui gracefully grazes the big themes. People are pliable. Cultures are built and obliterated. Nothing is really sacred. Everything can be remade."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36c2375d1a06a38a5ab900f7e1b3e215f35c8d53/0_151_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1a01a80664770032da6cfd53dc0d1f8","title":"lynn nottage interview play sweat america","story":"As Sweat opens in London, the only female dramatist to win two Pulitzers talks about America’s left-behind, her intensive research – and why she’s writing about Michael Jackson nextIt’s the day before Thanksgiving and Lynn Nottage has food to cook.

She is the only woman to have won the Pulitzer for drama twice, which puts her in the ranks alongside Tennessee Williams, Thornton Wilder and August Wilson.That achievement was remarkable in itself Sweat is even more so. Set in Reading, Pennsylvania, where she spent two and a half years interviewing residents, much of the action takes place in a bar where steelworkers hang out. Nottage charts the shifts in their relationships, the resentments and fears that emerge as economic instability unravels the ecosystem of their lives. The play opened in New York’s Public Theater in 2016, days before the presidential election that resulted in Donald Trump. It seemed a prescient harbinger. The New York Times said: “It is the first work from a major American playwright to summon, with empathy and without judgment, the nationwide anxiety that helped put Donald J Trump in the White House.”Born in Brooklyn, New York, Nottage, 54, lives in the same brownstone in Boerum Hill where she grew up, with her husband, Tony Gerber, a documentary film-maker, and her son, Melkamu, who is nine. Her daughter, Ruby, 21, is at college.Nottage, whose father was a social worker and mother a teacher, grew up watching plays by the Negro Ensemble Company. She originally went to Brown University as a pre-med and it was only later that theatre called and she went to Yale School of Drama. She worked for Amnesty before turning her attention to writing full time. Now she is professor of playwriting at Columbia University.Her work covers a wide range of subjects but is always on the side of the marginalised and dispossessed and tends to be inspired by a period of research. Her breakthrough, Intimate Apparel, which starred Viola Davis in its off-Broadway production in 2004, is about a black seamstress in early-20th century New York Ruined arose from a trip to Uganda, where Nottage talked to women in refugee camps and demobilised soldiers from the Lord’s Resistance Army. Her most recent play, Mlima’s Tale, is about an elephant “trapped inside the clandestine international ivory market”.Even down an uncertain telephone connection, I can hear the warmth and passion Nottage brings to her plays. She laughs frequently but talks with fluid eloquence about her writing and her concerns.Why did you write Sweat?I was commissioned by the Oregon Shakespeare festival, which was asking playwrights across the country to write about American revolutions. For a couple of years, I wasn’t sure which revolution I wanted to write about – the American civil war? The civil rights movement?Then one evening I got an email from a friend sharing the fact that for a period of time she had been completely and absolutely broke. She was someone I knew quite well and saw regularly. I felt horrible that I had no idea she was struggling.The next morning, we had a long conversation that coincided with the beginning of the first week of the Occupy Wall Street protest against economic inequality. So, these two middle-aged women went down there and chanted. Nothing changed, but at least she knew she was not alone.To me, Occupy Wall Street raised a lot of questions that were not answered. That put me out on the street to figure out how economic stagnation was shifting the American narrative and how so many people who had so thoroughly invested in the American dream found themselves broadsided.Why did you set Sweat in Reading, Pennsylvania?I didn’t drive then and I had an assistant who didn’t drive, so we wanted some place we thought was reachable from New York. But because we don’t drive, we don’t read maps well and we underestimated the time it would take to travel. We ended up with the poorest city in America of its size – but which was three hours away.One of the first questions we asked was, how do you describe your city? People would respond by saying: “Reading was… ” They were incredibly nostalgic for this glorious imagined past. It nearly broke my heart. I thought this is a city that cannot conceive of itself in the present or future tense. It is a microcosm of what is happening in America today. We are a country that has lost our narrative. We can’t project our future because we don’t know where we are going. After about a year and a half of research, I met the steelworkers who would become the inspiration for the play – middle-aged white men who shared stories that absolutely broke my heart. I hadn’t anticipated I would be moved in the way I was. I hadn’t anticipated that, sitting with them in a circle, I would feel we had a shared narrative – one of struggle, disillusionment and frustration with our government and our society.How do you transform your research into drama?I push the research away and never look at it again until I finish the play. I don’t want the research to censor the way I shape my characters. What I create is very much a work of fiction. The characters are constructs of my imagination they are inspired by some of the conversations I had but I really didn’t want them to be facsimiles of the people I spoke to.A lot of American plays are set in a bar. Why did you choose one for your setting?Bars are places where a lot of people retreat, a place where people go to unwind and they tell stories in ways they wouldn’t otherwise.That’s the reason why there is this rich bar tradition in literature. People speak candidly once their tongues have been loosened by liquor. A bar is also a space where people can meet across age, race and gender. I was interested in that dynamic because the play explores the intersectionality between race, gender and class.The New Yorker has called Sweat the first theatrical landmark of the Trump era and said it predicted his election. Were you surprised when he won?All of us were shocked. But in some ways I understand how it happened. I was in the trenches and I saw the way the country was shifting. I saw a certain level of rage, particularly among the white working class, which, I knew, would express itself in some malignant way. When I was having conversations with people, a lot of the subtext, unspoken, was the white majority’s discomfort with ersity and inclusion. That’s why the play tells the story that it does.The play has just toured across the rust belt. How did it go down?After we closed the show on Broadway in 2017, we took it to Reading. We were all petrified because we thought, are we going to feel like interlopers? Is it going to feel authentic to them? But we were overwhelmed by the response.People felt the conversation was really necessary and the play arrived at the right moment for them to receive it and then have a dialogue with it. I was shocked by how readily audiences who, by and large, had never entered a theatre before received the play and felt it was resonant of their own experiences. There were lots of tears men standing up, crying, saying: “I needed this release, I needed to see this.”Do you feel theatre has a role in effecting change in that way?Not just theatre but art, particularly in times like these, has to reflect what is happening in the culture. Responsibility is not quite the right word, but I do think there is a role for us to play in asking difficult questions, reflecting back what we see. The New York Times asked, how did I see this when they didn’t. In this case, theatre can definitely play a role.What do you feel about Trump?How do I feel? I feel traumatised.You are the only female playwright to win two Pulitzers, a feat that puts you up there with August Wilson and Tennessee Williams. How do you feel about that?I have such respect for those two playwrights. Their work has been a lead line – like the one used to lead a child on a horse – for how I approach my own writing, so it is incredible to be in that company.Why did you choose theatre?Theatre was one of the art forms I had most engagement with as a child. I loved the energy and interaction and exchange that happens between the storytelling and the audience. As an inidual, I am an introvert extrovert. I think by definition playwrights are people who are very comfortable in that solitary time, grappling with ideas, but once we finish those ideas, we crave company and people to expand and shape and wrestle those ideas into some larger form.You live in the house where you grew up. I wonder if that rootedness gives you the freedom to fly imaginatively?One of the things I talk about when I’m teaching is that, inevitably, the structure of the place where we arrive is shaped by the places where we grew up – very specifically by the architecture of our homes.I grew up in a brownstone in Brooklyn in a very cosmopolitan neighbourhood that would eventually become gentrified, in a house that was always semi-renovated. There was always the possibility that things would be fixed but they never quite were. It is still in that same state. Those are the kind of things I write about. You tend to write about people who are ignored. Is that the common thread of your work?I write about people who are marginalised because, as an African American woman, particularly now I am a middle-aged woman, I walk down the street and people will bump into me. To much of the population I am invisible. I had one experience, when I had my two children with me, and we were standing in line to pay and this young white man stepped in front of me. I said: “Excuse me?” And he said: “Oh my God, I didn’t see you there.”He was speaking on a much larger basis than that. He didn’t recognise my presence and I think that is why I write the stories that I write.You have spoken about the difficulty of feeling you have to speak for your gender, race and class in a way white men are never required to do…That is true. We feel this need to assert ourselves because we are absent in mainstream spaces, but at the same time feel the frustration that there is even a need to assert our voices. So that’s the paradox.You are writing a musical about Michael Jackson. How did that happen?I was approached by the producers who thought I might have an interesting take. I jumped at it because the first album I ever received was by the Jackson 5, and Off the Wall was probably the most important album of my high-school years.The majority of my life I have dwelt in a not-for-profit world that gives you a certain level of freedom and now this is a commercial production. I am learning to negotiate a completely new space. Which is interesting. I believe wholeheartedly that every year you should do something that scares you.Sweat is at the Donmar Warehouse, London WC2, from Friday to 26 January 2019"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7ebecdd2da586536cf0ec9ebc0acffb0b5ec05d/0_157_4212_2527/master/4212.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b979268abeecfd6d5b34ec56c3ba5b3a","title":"ralegh review sam wanamaker playhouse london","story":"Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, LondonThis atmospheric recreation of Sir Walter Raleigh’s show trial set off many modern echoes and featured strong performances from Simon Paisley Day and Nathalie ArminSir Walter Raleigh (or Ralegh) probably never did lay his splendid cloak across that muddy puddle for Elizabeth I. But he was an arrogant swashbuckler and a military devotee of the Elizabethan anti-Spanish regime. So when Elizabeth was succeeded by the pacifistic James Stuart, Raleigh’s head was one of the first, ironically, on the chopping block. Oliver Chris has worked through the historical sources to put together this reconstruction of the poet-explorer’s 1603 show trial for treason, a glimpse into the pseudo legalism of authoritarian regimes both now and then.There are many potential problems in such a project, and Chris navigates most, though not all of them, successfully. Much Tudor legal jargon is probably impenetrable to a non-specialist audience, though the point that despotic regimes will twist any constitutional statute comes across loud and clear. The candlelight in the Globe’s wood-panelled Wanamaker Playhouse beautifully helps to recreate the claustrophobia of Jacobean court life. The actors are dressed in contemporary business attire, which efficiently ties together the director’s intended lessons about past and present.Women are cast in key roles as Ralegh’s legal persecutors, which veils the extent to which James’s court operated as a patriarchy. But it gives us the always impressive Nathalie Armin as Elizabeth (as opposed to Edward) Coke, Raleigh’s chief prosecutor. If anyone can keep this language fresh and contemporary, it is Armin. She’s matched by Simon Paisley Day’s dignified, frail Ralegh – a faded war hero down to the limp."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82123994551f2a8676d86242d80f6be0a4e7eeca/0_74_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fbcc6988cd5550a51779eed58f3bb28","title":"five planned missions to mars nasa esa china russia uae spacex elon musk","story":"Space agencies around the world are set to explore the red planet, while Elon Musk has even grander plansLast week, Nasa successfully landed its InSight probe on Mars, as part of a two-year mission to study the planet’s deep interior.

From Christmas cocktail parties to sit-down dinners, here’s how to host with impact and ease this seasonThe nights have drawn in, George and Mariah are in a state of perpetual soundclash, and with them comes the unsettling urge to host a seasonal get-together.If you’re an unsteady host, even an intimate dinner with a handful of friends can seem daunting, so when you chuck in the plus-ones, her next door and a cluster of colleagues, that “fun and festive” party can start to feel anything but.But things don’t need to get all out of control and Abigail’s Party. We live in a time when fine dining and Michelin-starred chefs appear in the most casual of settings, and that informality extends to the at-home-host, too. Claude Bosi - head chef of Bibendum restaurant and Rémy Martin cognac bar – is one such Michelin-starred chef who advocates this relaxed approach when entertaining.“The key to a great party,” he says, “is to ensure you are with your guests. There are so many dinner parties where you try to impress and find yourself spending more time in the kitchen than you spend with your guests. A great party is a balance between good food and good hospitality.”Here’s how it’s done:The dinner partyThis casual mantra starts at the top – the formalities of the past have been dispensed with. Invites can go out on WhatsApp or email. Similarly, boy-girl seating plans at dinner are a relic of another time. Remember, too, if there are only two single guests at a dinner party, they don’t necessarily want to be seated together, lest they feel like show ponies being watched over by the other guests for signs of good chemistry. And unless you have a particular gift for crafting, there’s no need for place names.That said, some small details done nicely can make a real difference. Take your dinner table, for example, as chef and caterer Stephanie Boote says: “I like a simple table, not too much fuss. A linen cloth can be lovely, napkins, if you have them. A couple of little vases or bottles with flowers or foliage. Candlelight is a must. You can have a pile of plates and cutlery on top of an undressed table, a water jug and a stack of glasses, and if you have candles lit it will all be just fine!”There are lots of ways to make life easier as you prep your dinner-party meal, especially as your guests arrive and the heat rises in the kitchen. For Bosi, a neat trick is to go for a cold starter. He suggests getting a terrine from a local deli and serving it with a salad, all handily ready to go on plates ahead of time.Food writer and author Killian Fox offers similar logic when feeding a crowd. “Simplify,” he says. “Instead of a starter, lay out a range of snacks – decent crisps and dips, olives, maybe some crostini – for people to eat when they come through the door. Use the time you’ve saved to make sure everyone has enough booze.”Drinks are, of course, key to a great dinner party. Leave time at the beginning for an aperitif, which will give you more breathing room to prepare your food, take account of inevitable late arrivals (“our Uber kept cancelling”) and let appetites build.Fox suggests a handy seasonal cocktail, too, named London Calling. “It was apparently devised at Milk \u0026amp Honey in Soho. It’s citrussy, it contains sherry, and it gives you a chance to look classy with a cocktail shaker. A fine Christmas drink.”Bosi suggests a drink can offer some surprises and lead to unexpected food pairings. He likes a Royal Sidecar, made with Rémy Martin 1738 Accord Royal cognac, Cointreau and lemon – and paired with oysters.“Until recently, cognac was something you would have after a great lunch,” he says. “It’s not something you’re expecting to drink at the start of the meal, but I find it goes very well with seafood. It’s a nice surprise, a bit of creativity. At that moment, you’ve made people really relaxed and given your meal a stamp of quality.”From then on, you can go with some classic dishes: a big joint of meat, a casserole that can be easily cooked in advance, a beautiful stew with game, or Bosi’s festive favourite: beef wellington.When it comes to serving, Bosi tends to stick to sharing plates. “I put pots in the middle of the table and we start sharing,” he says. “I think dinner parties with people closer to each other are a better atmosphere.”Boote adds a word of practical advice: “Preparation is key. Your guests are here to see you, not have you run about trying to do things. Keep it simple, with excellent ingredients that speak for themselves.”Dinner party music has long been something of a slur, a byword for a pleasant but bland background soundtrack. But you don’t want to be sitting in silence accompanied only by the sound of mastication and scraping forks, so head to Spotify to put together some playlists.For dinner, you want something that is eclectic but not too distracting – you don’t want to be continually flicking to the next song. However, you also don’t want to drift into nondescript tastefulness, either.The drinks partyInteresting people, nice snacks, some decent tunes and plenty of booze is all that’s needed for a drinks party. Keep things loose – this means submitting to the inevitable and assuming a crowd will congregate in your kitchen. Be ready to push some seats away in the living room if a late dance party emerges.When it comes to the drinks, try to be creative, says Boote: “This year, we have made a fig leaf syrup to go with lime juice, gin and soda. It’s delicious without the gin, too.” She follows that adding clementine flavours and fizz to spirits makes any drink feel “festive and delicious”.Of course, guests will be looking for something to nibble on, so lay out some decent crisps, popcorn or olives.You can also add some more expansive finger food into the mix. Boote goes for gougères, a French choux pastry filled with cheese, while Bosi will be serving up some intriguing offerings: Rémy Martin cognac, mixed with tonic (a Rémy Grand Tonic – the French spin on the British classic), served with his “pickled cockle popcorn”. The cockles are rolled in flour then deep-fried in hot oil, coming out as if popcorn. “It’s a fantastic pairing,” he says. To give it a seasonal twist, add some clove or orange to the cognac.Fox offers a snack serving with a backstory: “The Gilda – a pintxo created in honour of Rita Hayworth, who starred in the film Gilda. It’s pretty easy: skewer a couple of green olives on a toothpick with guindilla peppers and an anchovy fillet.”You want to keep the music equally eclectic but a little more upbeat. However, don’t feel the need to overload it with bangers and floor fillers. If the party goes late, you can bring out the hits. Remember to let a few people try out their music selections – it’s never fun to be overprotective of the music at a party, nor do you want one person hogging the speaker. Finally, if things take a particularly boozy turn, fire up some karaoke through YouTube.And finally …Really, there’s no set formula. Follow your instincts, embrace comfort and concentrate on having fun. And, if in doubt, remember some salient words from Bosi:“Just don’t try too hard. Don’t try to impress is the wrong thing to say – you want to impress – but stay in your comfort zone. Stay comfortable, enjoy yourself, keep it simple – and have a good time.”Make like Bosi and kick off that good time with a Royal Sidecar or Rémy Grand Tonic of your own – buy a bottle here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3726e0cf652a6dff90d706ddbed00a8be919ab9e/175_494_4443_2666/master/4443.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1db7e985ca32a06ba646b91f894c3e2 620w","title":"doctor who recap series 37 episode 9 it takes you away","story":"The Doctor stirs a touch of Scandi noir into the mix in the first episode of the series to really present a grand sci-fi concept“Ah, nice fjord!” states Graham as the Doctor whizzes around tasting soil to ascertain the time and location the Tardis landed our gang in this time. It is hardly the most electrifying start to an episode from the writer Ed Hime (Skins), that points toward a generic cabin-in-the-woods romp with something monstrous stalking the hills. Oh, how quickly things change.It Takes You Away boasts this year’s first truly grand sci-fi concept. Along with an artfully executed backdrop, clever twists, convincingly scary monsters and devastating emotional journeys.There is also a nice dollop of Scandi noir in the mix as the Doctor finds a cottage in Norway in the winter with a chimney but no smoke, and all the windows boarded up. Inside, team Tardis come across a petrified young blind girl, Hanne, who needs help to find her father, who has been missing for four days. Before long, they are inspecting a mirror that is a portal, of course, but one that appears not to lead anywhere at all. Beyond it lies a mirrored universe: the same house, moved about a bit and occupied by some familiar faces.A couple of impressive set pieces later, and the penny drops thanks to an old Gallifreyan fairytale of the Solitract, an all-seeing universe whose existence is at odds with our own. It’s one of those moments where Doctor Who gets to write its own science and say up yours to anyone who questions it. “Think of it like a kid with chicken pox,” warns the Doctor. “Nuclear chicken pox.” The Doctor is scared, which is never a good thing.Melancholy seeps through this episode like sap through a tree. The emotional lever is grief. Oh, Grace. We hardly knew your like. For a brief moment, both we and Graham are given hope that the spacey world of Doctor Who will grant them a happy ending, even though it was never to be.“Grace” is revealed as a Solitract construct by the ease with which she can leave Ryan in the anti-zone – the real Grace would never have done that. It is utterly harrowing, but we all knew that Grace was a wonderfully big-hearted character and that her death at the start of the series would lose any meaning if it were to be so easily undone. That said, the whole business resolves tensions between Graham and Ryan, the latter finally calling him “Grandad”.Chiming against this is the parallel story of Hanne, Erik and Trina. Aside from Hanne being a badass and Erik a bit of a jerk, that storyline is left a little shallow. You could almost have done this episode without them. But the obvious moral still carries home: that you have to let go of the past to grab on to the future. Doctor Who doing sentimental properly is always a lovely, bittersweet thing.That big fist-pump moment with Graham aside, Ryan’s animosity towards Hanne seemed a little forced in. His grabbing her (albeit for her own protection) is uncomfortably physical. Apart from the grief and the tendency to be a silly little boy (remember his Call of Duty? moment), we had not seen all that much more below the surface from him and it felt like a bit of a way to get some material between him and Yaz, because he is rubbish with kids and she has had training. With so many characters, there hasn’t been so much interaction between them.And Graham, bless him, is still a lovable dufus, with a routine of bringing sandwiches with him because mealtimes for team Tardis can be irregular. (It’s easier for the youngies, I suppose, and the Doctor will rarely be short of soil.)There’s another big tick in this category, too. The cabin-in-the-woods tropes are handled nicely. But the big bravo goes to the Flesh Moths, a simple idea to ground all the existential stuff behind the portal, and a chance for some fine action sequences.Yaz is proving no slouch when it comes to absorbing the Doctor’s scientific jargon. She suggests they “reverse the polarity”. A throwback to a throwaway line from Pertwee’s Three, “reverse the polarity of the neutron flow”, it somehow became a Doctor Who catchphrase.And there is more fun with Timelord family dynamics the Doctor had seven grandmothers, but Granny Five was her favourite.Finale time. The Battle Ranskoor Av Kolos does seem a bit of a mouthful for your big tentpole episode, but there you go. Alas, there is likely to be an overnight delay with the publishing of this column, since Grandmaster Chibnall has decreed that, for ultimate secrecy, nobody will be granted preview links.

What are weekends away and Saturday nights out again? I’ve forgotten.I’ll be back at 6.35pm for next week’s MASSIVE SEMI, so please join me then for another spin around the dancefloor. Thank you for joining in, and have a fabulous week! HxCharles says lovely things about Karen, and she reciprocates with bells on. They take to the floor for a final spin around the Strictly dancefloor to Jennifer Hudson’s ‘And I’m Telling You I’m Not Going’. I’m guessing she didn’t sing the original, but it’s the version I know.So it’s a heartfelt goodbye to Charles and Karen. I’m sad to see them go, he’s been a brilliant contestant, despite us all getting off on the wrong foot over the whole ‘talking about himself in the third person’ thing. I will miss him, he’s a hugely deserving quarter finalist.Decision time! Obviously the judges all save Ashley, for delivering a more complex, technical and accomplished dance. Well, sure, but it’s not an equal competition, is it?Time for the dance off! Charles and Karen are up first, and I’m quite happy to watch this Rumba again. This doesn’t seem quite as fluid as last night, but still a nice job from Charles and Karen.OK, anyone for a change of pace? This Quickstep from Ashley and Pasha is quite something, if a little frantic. I’m knackered just watching it. So that’s pretty much a guaranteed goodbye for Charles. That’s a real shame, he’s made incredible progress this series and I’ve really enjoyed watching him dance, but barring a Pashley disaster this is the end of the road for him and Karen. A Rumba at this stage in the game was always a risky move, but I thought he really managed to pull it off. As for Ashley, she must be wondering what she has to do to win the public vote. I’m afraid there’s nothing she can do the public have their favourites and the dancing matters very little at this stage.So who is joining Charles and Karen in the dance off? His only hope really is Lauren and AJ, really wouldn’t be able to call that one. Joe and Dianne are safe, along with Lauren and AJ. She MUST have got top marks in the public vote to stay out of the dance off.Which means ASHLEY AND PASHA are in the dance off. Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of Adam Lambert singing ‘We Are The Champions’ from the Queen musical We Will Rock You. He’ll never be Freddie, but he’s pretty good second best, and also quite handsome. Katya and Neil are doing a dance – neither of them get to be Strictly champions because Neil hasn’t got a partner and Katya’s got the boot. I forget his name.In this week’s instalment of ‘Bruno gets patronising’, he suggests Charles is only in the bottom two because people want to see his Rumba again. He knows YouTube exists, right? So who’s in tonight’s bottom two? Stacey and Kevin are safe, along with Faye and Giovanni (oh thank god I don’t have to watch puppet madness again). So far no surprises. First up in the dance off: CHARLES AND KAREN.

The campaign train was parked in a siding. Down at the level crossing, George HW Bush was trying to whip up enthusiasm for his 1992 presidential re-election bid among a group of sceptical South Carolinians. His was an uphill struggle, part of what the travelling press had already dubbed a “long goodbye”.Bored by the prospect of listening to a stump speech I had heard numerous times already, I wandered down the tracks. Walking towards me, wearing a heavy coat despite the sunshine, came a face I knew. It was Brent Scowcroft, Bush’s national security adviser, also taking a quiet break from the fray. Scowcroft was a formidable figure, a cold war veteran and senior official under Nixon and Ford.Of course, being a reporter, I had to ask him something. So I asked what he thought were Bush’s chances of beating Bill Clinton, the upstart Democrat governor from Arkansas who was leading in the polls with 10 days to go. To his credit Scowcroft did not brush me off. He did not put me down, as powerful men can so easily do to a journalist.Instead, he shrugged his shoulders, gave a wry smile, and briefly raised his eyebrows. It was an eloquent statement, and unmistakable in its meaning. He knew Bush was beat. He wasn’t going to say so. But the train, metaphorically, had left the station. And Scowcroft was right. On 3 November, 1992, Clinton stormed to victory, and Bush was consigned to one-term ignominy.The memory of Scowcroft’s courtesy to a foreign reporter has stayed with me. It was typical of how things were done in America in those less combative days before the 911 attacks, before the financial crash, before partisan political and populist-nationalist isions got out of control, before the era of fake news. Bush’s time in office, from 1989-1993, did not lack fierce controversy. But it seemed contained in a way it does not now. And that was due, in part, to the way Bush set the tone.Bush set great store by civility in public life. As Republican candidate in 1988 he called for a “kinder, gentler nation”. He was, quintessentially, a decent man, with a taste for the lifestyle of an English country gentleman. For the most part, though there were exceptions, Bush treated opponents with cordiality and expected their respect in return. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, evicting its royal family and seizing its oil wells, Bush appeared genuinely shocked at an egregious breach of good manners.I was with Margaret Thatcher in Aspen, Colorado, in August that year when news of the invasion came through. Thatcher was on holiday, staying with the US ambassador to Britain. Amazingly, in hindsight, it was Bush who rushed down from Washington to join her, rather than the other way round. After supposedly receiving Thatcher’s spine-stiffening advice – she reportedly insisted: “Remember, George, this is no time to go wobbly” – Bush famously drew what he called a “line in the sand”. From that ensued what came to be known as the first Gulf war in 1991 and, arguably, also the 2003 invasion of Iraq by Bush’s son, George W Bush.Bush’s White House was quite unlike that of Barack Obama, let alone Donald Trump. It oozed the confidence of a government and a leader who, in terms of sheer power, had no equals in the world. The Soviet Union was gone. The international terror threat was still largely in the future. Security around the Oval Office was efficient but nothing like it is now. Bush and his wife, Barbara, nicknamed the “silver fox”, were accessible to reporters in a way it’s hard to imagine.I recall one Saturday morning on the South Lawn when Arnold Schwarzenegger, then still a mere actor, was publicising a presidential national fitness initiative by doing workouts for the cameras. Barbara Bush, no fan of sweaty push-ups, looked on with her English springer iel, the “first canine”, Millie, at her side. We were soon in conversation as I told her of the problems my daughters had encountered in settling our springer, Bryde, in our new Washington home. Free tips on springer handling followed, later encapsulated in her bestseller, Millie’s Book.Marlin Fitzwater, Bush’s avuncular press secretary, exemplified this relaxed atmosphere. Fitzwater invited me into his office for a friendly cup of tea on my first day in the White House press corps. If you needed something from him, you only had to phone. It was in this period that the  obtained its first ever trip aboard Air Force One, flying with Bush from Omaha to Andrews air force base. Just try asking for similar assistance now.It has become fashionable to suggest Bush belonged to an elite that is somehow responsible for the current rightwing populist backlash. It’s true he enjoyed a privileged upbringing in a monied east coast family. Bush was a natural scion of America’s white, Anglo-Saxon, Ivy League-educated patrician class – the closest 20th-century America came to an aristocracy. In a sense Bush was born to rule – and that era of entitlement has clearly passed.But Bush’s most admirable quality is still of high value – his deep sense of public duty and service, dating back to his time as a second world war combat pilot. I recall travelling with him to Honolulu in December 1991, to commemorate the attack on Pearl Harbor. As the sun rose over the Cemetery of the Pacific, Bush stood with hand on heart, his voice choking with emotion, exactly 50 years – to the minute – after the Japanese bombers swept in. Bush was a patriot who did not need cheap slogans to express his belief in enduring American greatness.Simon Tisdall was the ’s US editor and White House correspondent from 1989 to 1994"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce11fec1435267e12cb4865ff8bd8f5144369e3c/0_658_4745_2848/master/4745.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03b1df73e12aa1f9108006fedf65a63b","title":"george hw bush a life in pictures","story":"George HW Bush, who has died aged 94, was the 41st president of the United States.

They invoked the spirits of their ancestors and the land to liberate him from any bad influences.“What we want, what we desire is to purify public life in Mexico,” Amlo said during the ceremony. “I repeat my commitment: I will not lie, I will not steal or betray the people of Mexico.”He gave a 90-minute speech to the thousands of jubilant supporters jamming the Zócalo, the city’s main square, vowing to help the poor in a nation where almost half the population lives in poverty.“We are going to govern for everyone, but we are going to give preference to the most impoverished and vulnerable,” Amlo said. “For the good of all, the poor come first.”Speaking in a personal style honed over decades of small-town rallies, he told the crowd: “Be patient and have confidence in me.” One of the most pressing issues Amlo faces at the start of his presidency is the caravan of thousands of Central American migrants camped out at the US border, hoping to obtain asylum.In his first official act in office, he signed an agreement on Saturday with counterparts in three Central American countries to create a development plan for the region. The plan would include a fund to generate jobs as a way to lessen the poverty that drives people to leave El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.The president also pledged on Saturday to personally oversee daily 6 am security briefings and to work 16-hour days to confront the brutal violence in Mexico, and promised to restore the energy sector to prominence and bring up oil production from the country’s current 25-year lows.

Many complaints languish for months or longer before any action is taken, so the swift action betrays the urgency of the desire to appease those that took offence. Youssef is due in court on 12 January.The case is the latest instance of ostensibly secular authorities embracing religious conservatism in Muslim-majority Egypt, where the military — then led by the current president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi — overthrew a freely elected but isive Islamist president in 2013.Elected to office in 2014, Sisi has since overseen a crackdown that saw thousands of Islamists and many secular, pro-democracy activists imprisoned, and reversed gains won by a popular 2011 uprising that toppled the 29-year rule of autocrat Hosni Mubarak.Egypt’s actors’ guild said in a statement that it intended to investigate and discipline actors who wore “inappropriate” attire during the opening and closing ceremonies of the week-long film festival, arguing that they clashed with “the traditions, values and ethics of society”.“Although we absolutely believe in the personal freedom of artists, we appeal to everyone to shoulder their responsibilities toward the fans who appreciate their art and view them as role models,” said the weekend statement. “That should compel them to exercise a minimum level of commitment to society’s public values.”Youssef’s dress and news of her impending trial have dominated the conversation on social media networks over the weekend. On Sunday, they made the front page of several newspapers and became the topic of several op-eds.While some on social media denounced the actor’s “immodesty”, others criticised the judicial system for bowing to conservatives, noting the lack of progress in redressing homelessness, corruption and the sexual harassment of women.“A nation is jolted by a revealing dress at a festival but is not infuriated by a million children sleeping rough and scavenging in trash bins for food,” opinion writer Khaled Montaser tweeted.Emad Hussein, editor of the independent daily Al-Shorouk, said Youssef had every right, in theory, to wear whatever dress she chose, but that her “grave mistake” was that it “looked more like a swimsuit”.“There is a law that prohibits offending the public but, more importantly, there are societal values that need to be respected,” he wrote on Sunday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb850b4aba69d2ec2fa36a8cb0e9089c265e1750/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33ea4131d24dea3207563de57b55f5ec","title":"paris riots worst unrest decade with shops and cars set alight gilets jaunes","story":"Shops and cars set alight after peaceful gilets jaunes protest turns violentThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, has instructed his prime minister to hold talks with protest groups after anti-government demonstrations led to the worst violence in central Paris in a decade, with more than 100 people injured as cars and buildings were set alight.Macron is facing his biggest crisis since taking office 18 months ago after the violence erupted on Saturday following weeks of street protests that began against fuel taxes and have turned into an anti-government movement.The Élysée and key ministers appeared to rule out imposing any kind of state of emergency after thousands of masked protesters from the gilets jaunes – named for their fluorescent yellow jackets – fought running battles with riot police, torched cars, set fire to banks and houses and burned makeshift barricades.Macron, who had said he would “never accept violence”, instructed the prime minister, Édouard Philippe, to meet what he has called legitimate protest groups and opposition politicians this week in an effort to calm tensions and stop “professional” rioters from infiltrating street demonstrations.The Paris prosecutor Remy Heitz said 378 people were in custody, including 33 under the age of 18. He said many of those arrested in battles with police were men aged between 30 and 40, often from regions far from Paris, who had “come to fight police while claiming to be part of the gilets jaunes movement”.The interior minister, Christophe Castaner, and his head of staff will be questioned by a senate committee on Tuesday over how thousands of protesters were able to play cat and mouse with police through central Paris for hours.Macron flew back from the G20 summit in Argentina on Sunday and went straight to inspect damage at the Arc de Triomphe. Graffiti all over the base of the 19-century monument read: “We’ve chopped off heads for less than this” and: “Topple the Bourgeoisie.” Scores of used teargas canisters filled the gutters.Near the Champs Élysées there were splashes of paint on buildings after protesters had paint-bombed police. Used bottles of eye-drops on the ground indicated that some protesters – many of whom wore ski-masks and breathing equipment – stood their ground despite the teargas fired from rows of police behind shields.Along the Avenue Kléber near the Arc de Triomphe on Sunday morning, passersby peered at scorched pavements where the burnt-out carcasses of cars had been towed away, and where a private residence had been set alight. Graffiti read: “Babylon is burning.”The far-right leader Marine Le Pen and Jean-Luc Mélenchon, head of the leftwing party La France Insoumise, both called on Macron to dissolve parliament and hold elections.The violence started on Saturday in broad daylight on the edges of a peaceful demonstration by the gilets jaunes movement, which began two weeks ago in protest at rising fuel prices and a new green fuel tax.After three successive Saturday citizens’ marches in Paris organised on social media, the security forces seemed at a loss to stop the rioting, with groups of masked men spilling into nearby streets, ripping up benches and traffic lights and hurling bits of paving stones from roadworks.An Élysée spokesman said Macron wanted policing procedures to be reviewed in terms of “maintaining order in the days to come”. No date was set for the prime minister to meet representatives from the gilets jaunes movement to revive talks that last week amounted to nothing.Demonstrators continued to stage small roadblocks in towns around France on Sunday. Other cities saw violent clashes between protesters and police on Saturday, notably Toulouse where 48 police officers were injured. In the town of Puy-en-Velay on Saturday, the prefect’s office briefly caught fire after it was petrol-bombed.Over the weekend more than 130,000 people demonstrated across France in the gilets jaunes movement, and there were more than 580 roadblocks around the country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8124f57137e39445a0e7fce1ce170710b72cbac5/76_280_3424_2054/master/3424.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bd0fa0d0b57d7c4238cb44386c8be2f","title":"the aftermath of the gilets jaunes riots in paris in pictures","story":"Vandalised cars and graffiti on the streets of central Paris, after a day of clashes between riot police and gilets jaunes protesters, who are demonstrating against rising oil prices and living costs• Paris riots: Macron to hold emergency meeting after worst unrest in decade"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3709939.1543164372!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"suspect device the all metal hip replacement that caused untold hardship","story":"The DePuy ASR hip launched in 2004, was promoted as a game changer in orthopaedics, with 3,300 patients receiving the hip in Ireland.  Problems were discovered, resulting in its recall in Ireland in 2010. Video: Bryan O’Brien Report: Colm Keena\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGillian O’Sullivan: ‘He told me there was a lovely new hip on the market that could last a lifetime . . . I would never look back.’Scandals involving breast implants and all-metal hips prosthetics have raised global concerns and prompted regulatory reform in the European Union. Now the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) has conducted a major investigation into the medical device sector.The debacle that is the DePuy metal hip illuminates the ways medical devices are brought to market and the mayhem that can ensue if a product fails to live up to expectations.On a per capita basis, more of the DePuy hips were implanted in Ireland than in any other jurisdiction. In excess of 1,000 Irish patients have issued proceedings against DePuy. Hundreds have already settled.When Gillian O’Sullivan gets up from her chair to fetch some hip X-rays, you can’t but notice that one of her legs is shorter than the other.One of the difficulties with replacing hips is that the artificial implants wear out. As bone and tissue get destroyed when prosthetics are being implanted, replacing worn-out implants with new ones is not a simple matter. For this reason, the practice has been to wait until people are older, and less active, before giving them artificial hips. If you get the timing right, the patient may be dead before the hip implant has failed.But in the early 2000s, hip implant manufacturers started to market new, longer-lasting implants they said were suited to younger, active people.In 2005, when she was 40, Gillian O’Sullivan went to see the highly regarded local orthopaedic surgeon, Tadhg O’Sullivan, in the Waterford Regional Hospital. She was suffering from arthritis.“He told me there was a lovely new hip on the market that could last a lifetime . . . I would never look back.”Her surgeon was referring to a new metal product from DePuy, a subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson and a major manufacturer of orthopaedic products. The so-called ASR hip came in two variants. One was a hip resurfacing device, which covered the cup and ball of the hip socket, while the second was a total hip replacement product, which involved replacing the top of the femur with a metal device, which then sat into the metal cup.Both products differed from what was previously on the market in that both traditional hip implants used a metal ball and a polyethylene or plastic cup. The DePuy hip had a ball and cup made out of a hard-wearing cobalt chromium metal alloy.Tadhg O’Sullivan was one of six design surgeons who had worked with DePuy’s engineers to design the new product. It is standard practice for innovative new products to be developed with the assistance of clinicians.At the time he saw Gillian O’Sullivan, the Waterford surgeon was showing surgeons around the world how to implant the new product, and taking part in post-market surveillance of how the product was performing.In October 2005, Gillian O’Sullivan had a DePuy hip replacement device implanted on her left side at the Kilcreene Orthopaedic Hospital in Kilkenny. In May 2006, her second hip was replaced. She was told she now had the “hips of Brian O’Driscoll”.However, her operations were difficult and she experienced pain afterwards.“By Christmas 2006 we knew I was in trouble. I had no energy levels, I was really sick, and you could hear me coming down the stairs. There was a click, click, click, every time I moved.”Her children could hear the grinding of her metal hips.In May 2007, she went back to Tadhg O’Sullivan. “I said, I’m in trouble here. He argued with me. He said I was in better condition than I had been.”She was told that “the god of orthopaedics” had performed her hip operation and that she should wait and see.By this stage O’Sullivan had moved from the Waterford Regional Hospital to the private Whitfield Clinic, also in Waterford. “Between 2007 and 2010, I was in an awful state. I would say to myself, I think I am dying.”Gillian O’Sullivan now believes that during the years 2007 to 2011, metal ions from her hip implants were progressively damaging the flesh and bone of her hip joints.When the DePuy hip was withdrawn from the market in August 2010, Irish patients were advised that their future care would involve the monitoring of the cobalt and chromium levels in their blood.After the withdrawal, Gillian O’Sullivan got a letter for an appointment at the Whitfield and Tadhg O’Sullivan warned her that she would be hearing a lot of public debate about cobalt and chromium ion levels in the blood. He said it was “all bullshit”.“They are trying to frighten everybody.”She went to see Jimmy Sheehan at the Blackrock Clinic again and brought along her blood test results which showed very high metal ion levels. “He said, you need to get those hips out now. They’re poisoning you.”In 2011, the right hip was replaced by O’Sullivan at the Whitfield, and a year later the second hip was also replaced. The operations, which were paid for by DePuy, were difficult, she said, and left her with a left leg that was longer than her right.During her original operations and subsequent operations Gillian O’Sullivan met a number of other patients who were having DePuy hips implanted or replaced by Tadhg O’Sullivan. Among those she met was Kiera Kenneally, who had DePuy hips implanted by Tadhg O’Sullivan in 2005 and 2006, the first when she was just 16 years old.Kenneally, who now lives in Sandyford, Dublin, is originally from Hillview, Waterford, and Gillian O’Sullivan knew her family. Kenneally sued DePuy. Her case was heard over a number of days in the High Court in 2016, but the case was settled with the agreement including a confidentiality clause. However, the transcripts from the sitting days have been seen by The .In August 2005, Kenneally had a resurfacing procedure done by O’Sullivan in Kilcreene. In May of the following year, the second hip was resurfaced.The left hip implant was replaced by O’Sullivan in 2010. During the operation, substantial metal ion damage to her hip tissue was discovered and there was substantial loss of bone.Blood tests taken afterwards showed cobalt and chromium blood levels that were, respectively, 10 and four times above what would be expected, the High Court was told.Kenneally has since been advised she may in time need to have a Girdlestone procedure, which fuses the femur to the hip so that it can no longer bend. She may end up in a wheelchair.The medical records in Kenneally’s case showed that before her procedure, Tadgh O’Sullivan discussed both with her and her mother the concept of metal-on-metal hips, the possibility of failure, and the issue of debris (which in turn leads to the release of ions).Gillian O’Sullivan also sued DePuy. During her High Court action, she says, DePuy “fought me all the way”.She also enlisted Nargol as an expert witness and he told the court that 90-95 per cent of her problems were due to the DePuy implants. DePuy argued that 90-95 per cent of her difficulties were due to her congenital condition.Mr Justice Kevin Cross decided that 90 per cent of O’Sullivan’s difficulties were referable to the DePuy hips, and awarded her €740,000. DePuy said it would appeal and the matter was then settled for €520,000.Unusually for people who made settlements with DePuy, Gillian O’Sullivan did not agree to a “gagging” clause and so is free to discuss her experience.In his judgment in November 2016, Mr Justice Cross said O’Sullivan was an “honest historian” who did not consciously exaggerate, but that her difficulties prior to her hip operations were greater than she recalled.As was the case with the Kenneally trial, Tadgh O’Sullivan was not a party in the O’Sullivan case, was not called by either side, and no one criticised his surgical skills. The judge said he accepted that O’Sullivan’s relationship with her surgeon had broken down some time after the second DePuy implant operation.O’Sullivan would need future revisions and would continue to be severely disabled for the rest of her life, the judge said. “The plaintiff will also be in significant pain, probably for life.”Gillian O’Sullivan says, reflecting on what’s happened to her: “You make the most of your life. I can’t be on a beach. The balance is completely gone, and I would fall over nothing. I get pains and contractions. I was in bed for six weeks after Christmas.”She is a mix of being surprisingly upbeat, while also occasionally displaying a fierce sense of resentment towards Tadhg O’Sullivan. “I live my life. If I’m upright for the day, I’m happy.”The DePuy hip debacle may end up costing DePuy up to $4 billion (€3.53 billion) in damages. Other producers of metal hip implants are also being sued.Although figures are not available for the Republic, total damages of up to €80 million may yet be paid to Irish recipients of DePuy hips, with legal costs in addition to that. It is the largest corporate personal injuries episode to ever hit the Irish legal system.Despite the challenges a metal-on-metal product presented, a new all-metal hip resurfacing product, known as the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR) system, made by Smith \u0026amp Nephew, came on the market in the late 1990s and began to prove popular.The device was attractive for young, active people with hip problems, and Tadhg O’Sullivan was an early fan. A former GAA player himself, O’Sullivan was known for treating young athletes with joint problemsO’Sullivan told The  that it was because of his extensive use of the Birmingham hip that he was invited to work with DePuy in relation to its new product. At the time “I was probably one of the most experienced hip resurfacing surgeons in the world.”Companies developing new implants often engage surgeons to assist them. Although DePuy engineers put a huge amount of work into designing their new product, this did not including clinical trials, something that was not necessary under EU rules.Simulator tests were used, but critics say the tests did not replicate the repeated stop and start motion that is intrinsic to human joint use, and were restricted to larger model components, the sort used by larger framed people.“It would have been a very good design process if they were designing a washing machine,” says Trinity College Dublin engineering professor David Taylor. “They seem to have forgotten that it was going into a human being.”Taylor, who specialises in materials that are inserted into the body, has acted for a number of people who are suing DePuy. For him, a critical failure made by the DePuy engineers was not testing the proposed product on people prior to going to market.The head of medical device regulation in Ireland, Dr Niall MacAleenan, speaking generally, said clinical testing of medical device products was complicated by the fact that many devices were designed to be inside the body for years if not decades.Assessments as to the suitability of implanted devices involves a “risk benefit” assessment. “There is always risk. The question is if it is an acceptable level of risk.”In January 2004, DePuy got approval from a UK notified body, BSI, to market its two metal hip products throughout the EU. Approval across other, non-EU markets soon followed.For the US market, the company had to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which was considered a tougher regulatory authority than the multi-agency structure operating in the EU.English surgeon Tony Nargol was an early enthusiast for the new DePuy product. In September 2003, he travelled to Rome for the product launch, where he met Tadhg O’Sullivan and some of the other design surgeons. He agreed to become involved in a clinical study of the device to be used to seek approval for the product in the United States, and also to become an “opinion leader” for the device in the UK.Between 2004 and 2009, the Newcastle surgeon implanted about 500 of the metal devices, making him one of the highest users of the product in the world.However, by late 2006 a number of his patients were presenting with difficulties. Nargol began to study the performance of the DePuy product in his patients, working with hospital colleague Simon Jameson.Among the matters they began to examine was the role played by the “angle” of implantation of the cup. They also began to notice that it was smaller models of the device, used in smaller framed persons, that appeared to be causing the most difficulties.When he revised the DePuy hip in some of his patients, Nargol noted a “greenish grey” fluid in the hip joint while doing so. This was “tissue necrosis”, he told the courts in Australia in an affidavit in 2013.In early 2007, he asked Ian Newell, DePuy’s regional manager in the Newcastle area, if he knew of other cases involving greenish grey fluid and tissue necrosis. “Mr Newell replied that he was ‘not aware of any’,” Nargol said in his affidavit.The response he got from DePuy caused Nargol to think that the problems he was encountering were caused by his work rather than the product.At a meeting with Newell and others in a hotel in Durham in September 2007, Nargol discussed the apparent link between smaller devices and high ion levels.In response, Newell showed him the data from a DePuy study of 89 patients who had received the hips in the UK, Australia, South Africa and Germany. The study subjected them to regular blood-testing to see if their cobalt and chromium ion levels became elevated.In November 2007, two papers about the DePuy hips were presented at the American Academy of Hip and Knee Surgeons conference in Dallas, Texas, one by Nargol and one by Graham Isaac, the DePuy engineer who led the team that designed the new product. Both flagged problems with the device.Isaac’s paper was entitled Whole Blood Metal Ion Levels after Surface Replacement of the Hip the effect of Component Positioning, and the authors included Isaac, Tadgh O’Sullivan and the other design surgeons, as well as a surgeon from South Africa. The authors reported that 24 months after their procedures, the ion levels for 50 patients (40 male and 10 female) showed three female (30 per cent) and three males (7.5 per cent) had significantly higher ion levels than would be expected.These elevated levels were associated with their devices being implanted at particular angles, the conference was told.DePuy, O’Sullivan and the other authors were saying the negative outcomes were related to how the devices were implanted rather than attributable to any defects in the device.During 2008, Nargol continued to have regular contact with Isaac, Newell and other DePuy representatives. He also began to notice patients with difficulties whose implants had been put in at an angle that was at or near the “safe zone” that he and his colleagues had identified from their research.In time, Nargol came to believe that the product was at fault, not his work as a surgeon. The implants put in at particular angles tended to fail earlier than others, and so created the early impression that the angle was the source of the problem.In August 2008, Nargol stopped using the complete hip replacement product and in early 2009 he stopped using the DePuy resurfacing product also.A colleague, surgeon David Langton, had by this time noticed a new problem with the DePuy implant called “edge-loading”, which contributed to high wear and debris and was, in Langton’s view, the result of the design of the DePuy product.During a meeting with Isaac on March 11th, 2009, at DePuy’s offices in Leeds, Langton and Nargol outlined their latest findings.Nargol said there were problems with the DePuy product even when it was implanted at the recommended angle. There was a “design flaw”, especially with smaller cups.One of the DePuy representatives at the meeting said, “we’re f**ked”, Nargol said in his Australian affidavit. Isaac said the problem was “multifactorial”, with the factors involved including patient weight and activity levels.Requests submitted through DePuy for interviews with Isaac and Newell were declined.In time Nargol became one of the harshest critics globally of the DePuy product. He and Langton became involved in litigation around the world as patients sued DePuy for damages. Nargol, along with Langton, gave evidence in a lot of these cases and the surgeons are party to continuing proceedings in the US where, as designated whistleblowers, they stand to make significant amounts of money if DePuy ends up having to pay out to the US Government for implants sold to public health programmes.The judge did not have to rule on the mala fides issue because of the position adopted by DePuy in the trial, but he rejected the attack on Nargol’s evidence. He said the expert witnesses for both sides had given honest evidence. Nargol would not be interviewed by The  because of the ongoing litigation in various jurisdictions.In 2010, by way of his involvement in litigation, Nargol discovered that other surgeons had expressed concerns during the mid-2000s about the DePuy product, contrary to what he said he had been told by DePuy.The highly regarded Belfast orthopaedic surgeon, David Beverland, told Nargol he had stopped using the DePuy product in early 2007. Requests from The  to Beverland for an interview met with no response.Nargol contacted Beverland in 2010 after being told by a former DePuy employee that the Belfast surgeon had experienced problems with his patients.In his Australian affidavit, Nargol quoted a 2010 email from Beverland to Isaac: “All in all, this ASR problem has to date been the worst problem I have faced in my surgical career. It has been a real nightmare.”Nargol also said that in 2010 he was shown emails from the Dutch surgeon Paul Born to a DePuy executive, dated June 2006, in which he said he’d experienced a significant failure rate with DePuy and would no longer be using the product.Nargol said that on several occasions during 2007 and 2008 he had asked Newell, Isaac and their colleague Magnus Flett if other surgeons were noticing similar problems to him.“Mr Newell, Mr Flett, and Mr Isaac told me on several occasions that ‘no one else has had any problems with the ASR’.”The DePuy metal hip was voluntarily recalled in August 2010 after figures from the National Joint Registry for England, Wales and Northern Ireland showed it was performing badly when compared with its peers.The registry collects information on all joint replacement operations so as to measure the performance of the different implants that are on the market.In its most recent annual report, the registry said that for the 992,090 hip replacements monitored since it began collecting data in 2002, some 7.27 per cent have been replaced (or revised, as the medical term goes).The replacement rate would be lower if it were not for metal-on-metal implants which showed a replacement rate of 19-22 per cent. The most successful type of hip replacement, metal-on-polyethylene, had a replacement rate of 4.87 per cent.“Metal-on-metal resurfacings have a revision rate at 14 years of 14.76 per cent and their use, as with all metal-on-metal bearings, is now very limited.”After DePuy withdrew its product from the market, there was extensive discussion as to how it had been approved for sale in the first place.The EU and the United States are the world’s two most important bodies when it comes to the regulation of the medical devices sector. In the EU, there are multiple “notified bodies” each of which can award CE marks to proposed new medical devices, thereby allowing them be marketed across the union.In Ireland, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) is the body that licenses new medical devices, while the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has a role in monitoring the safety of devices that are on the market.The DePuy products were approved by BSI, a UK-notified body. Clinical trials were not required under EU rules, even though the products are recognised as among the higher-risk category of medical devices. Approval by an EU-certified body opened the way to the devices being marketed in other economies, including Australia and South Africa. Many of the world’s poorer nations rely on the developed world for the regulation of medical devices.In the US, the FDA decided that the DePuy hip resurfacing product was a significantly new product and required clinical testing. It allowed the marketing of the total hip replacement product.In 2009, DePuy was told confidentially by the FDA that it would not be granting approval for the hip resurfacing product after reviewing company studies that showed it had failed prematurely in “significant” numbers. In response the multinational quietly withdrew its request for approval.The DePuy hip replacement product was approved for the US market by way of a controversial pathway called “substantial equivalence”.Medical devices can be approved for the market in both the EU and the US if they can be shown to be substantially equivalent to a product already on the market, or if they can be shown to be made of parts that are substantially the same as parts already on the market.The rule applies even if the device or parts already approved have since been withdrawn, even for poor performance reasons.As a study in the New England Journal of Medicine put it in January 2013, approval by the FDA by way of substantial equivalence “does not mean that a new device is safe and effective: it means that the device is deemed no less safe and no less effective than a predicate”.The study looked at how the DePuy hip replacement device came to be approved for implantation in US citizens. It found that the lineage of the device involved 95 different devices or device parts that had operated as predicate devices or parts to which DePuy said its new product was substantially equivalent.The predicate devices included ones that were “discontinued long ago because their risk of revision was so much higher than that of other hip” products, the authors noted.The NSAI was not able to tell The  how many higher risk devices it had approved over the past decade by way of equivalence, or how many had been approved after clinical trials, even though the information was sought as far back as September 3rd last.However, MacAleenan of the HPRA points out that precisely because implanted medical devices designed to last a long time inside the body are hard to subject to pre-market clinical testing, the data that comes from devices that are already on the market is particularly valuable.There is another interesting aspect to the substantial equivalence phenomenon both here and in the US, according to a Newcastle University biomedical engineer, Tom Joyce, who has extensively studied the DePuy debacle“It happens all the time that a product comes onto market via substantial equivalence, meaning that it is supposed to be similar to a product already on the market, but it is then marketed as if it is wildly different,” said Joyce, who has worked with Nargol and Langon on behalf of Irish plaintiffs.The EU is currently introducing a new regime for the certification of medical devices that is in part a response to the DePuy hip and other high-profile failures.Tadhg O’Sullivan told The  that up to the date that the DePuy products were withdrawn, he never had a problem with any of his resurfacing patients.Despite the global controversy over the performance of DePuy hip, there is no mistaking O’Sullivan’s continuing enthusiasm for the product.During a lengthy interview in his consultation rooms in the Whitfield Clinic, O’Sullivan said the DePuy implant was an important innovation for patients with serious hip problems.Asked if in his view there was a design flaw with the DePuy hip resurfacing device, his answer was simple: “Not really. If put in properly, no.”Likewise, he said he did not believe there was a flaw with the ball and cup of the total hip replacement product, though there was a problem with the stem that attached it to the patient’s femur.He believed that DePuy, and J\u0026ampJ, were probably acting on the advice of lawyers when they decided to withdraw the product from the market. The decision, he says, was the equivalent of saying: “Sue the f**k out of us.”And that, he said, is what has happened.DePuy has “pumped an outrageous amount of money into putting this thing right. Unfortunately, the more they pump in, the more our legal profession want. They’re like an insatiable dog.”As well as assisting the DePuy engineers and attending design team meetings over a number of years, O’Sullivan was also the co-inventor of two patents registered in the name of DePuy that were associated with the hip product.Publicly available information in the US indicates that the two US design surgeons who worked with O’Sullivan on the DePuy project, Tom Schmalzried and Thomas Veil, received a number of million dollars each in royalties and other payments from the manufacturer.However, O’Sullivan says his royalty income from DePuy was “relatively small” and that if the time he had spent as a design surgeon travelling to meetings and conferences for DePuy had instead been spent working at the Whitfield Clinic he would have been equally well rewarded.He has earned more from DePuy as a result of the programme it has put in place for patients post the withdrawal of the hip product than he did while working as a design surgeon, he said.The enormous global medical legal battle that has erupted since the product was recalled has led to a great amount of misinformation coming into the public domain, the surgeon said. “We have poor people coming in here thinking they are going to die.” It is “very hard to get at the truth when there is a huge amount of money to be made from suing a company”. he added.O’Sullivan said he had not seen one paper which, read closely, showed heightened cobalt and chromium levels causing medical problems. Yet people were coming to him now, he said, with normal ageing problems such as becoming forgetful, and blaming it on their ion levels.The patient may feel fantastic, and may have no problem with their hips, but he tells them the only way to get their ion levels down is “to take out the generator”. It is their choice.Surgeons want to do what is best for their patients, he said. The DePuy project was about “trying to help people of 30 years of age who needed a hip and not be sending them home and have them not working for the next 20 years.”As matters now stand, most metal hip products have been withdrawn from the market and all major manufacturers are producing a similar ceramic ball and cup product. “They’re all giving you the basic Ford Focus.”The threat of being sued means doctors feel pressurised into doing what is safest in terms of legal exposure, rather than what is most appropriate for their patients.Surgeons know that if they put in a product that has been around for decades, but which fails, they cannot be sued, he said. And manufacturers, if they are going to fear being sued, are deterred from creating new devices.The loser in the end, he says, because of the stifling of innovation, is the patient.A special alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process has been put in place by the Irish courts such is the level of claims that have been lodged against DePuy over its metal hip product.The highest award to date has been €750,000, but the average is in the region of €100,000. If a settlement is not agreed, a claimant can take their case to court.As of July, 540 of the 1,108 sets of proceedings lodged against DePuy had been resolved. Many of the proceedings lodged do not qualify for the ADR.A spokeswoman for DePuy said she would not give a figure for total awards made in Ireland to date.“DePuy has no greater responsibility than to the patients who use our products,” she said in a statement to The . “We are committed to the wellbeing of our patients and believe the full history of the ASR system shows we have worked properly and responsibly to improve patients’ lives through innovation.“We will continue to stand by our patients.”A special investigation by The  in association with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3713513.1543595488!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"northern irish students on brexit the republic has become a more attractive option","story":"Simon Carswell speaks to a group of second level students from Belfast\u0027s Methodist College on Brexit and what it means for them.

Photograph: Bryan O’Brien Methodist College in Belfast – better known as Methody\u0026nbsp– is an interdenominational, co-ed grammar school located at the bottom of\u0026nbspMalone Road in Belfast, next to Queens University. Founded by the Methodist Church in 1865, it has a long-established academic and sporting pedigree in Northern Irish second-level education and is ranked among the top schools in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.Traditionally a Protestant school, Methody now draws both Protestant unionist and Catholic nationalist students. Past pupils include the\u0026nbspDUP MPs Sammy Wilson and Ian Paisley jnr, the Nobel physics laureate Ernest Walton, the former Church of Ireland Primate of All Ireland Robin Eames, the artist Colin Davidson, the Hollywood actor Jamie Dornan and the rugby player Paddy Jackson.Joni Mcilroy, who is 18 and\u0026nbspfrom Newtownards, Co Down, says she is Northern Irish. She grew up in a non-religious household. She wants to study politics in the United States.Jonathan ‘Jonny’ Mearns, an 18-year-old\u0026nbspfrom Dunmurry, is a Protestant unionist and identifies as British. He would like to study politics at Queen’s and eventually set up a new conservative political party.Izaak Carnduff, who is 17 and from Bangor, Co Down, identifies as Irish. He comes from a nationalist background and is non-denominational. He hopes to go to university in England next year.Hala Heenan, who is 17 and from south Belfast, is a Catholic nationalist but is not overtly religious. She identifies as Irish. She hopes to study history at university abroad and to return to live in Belfast.Adam Flanagan, a 17-year-old\u0026nbspfrom south Belfast, is a Protestant unionist and British. He wants to study economics in Britain and to return to Northern Ireland to work in business and, later, possibly politics.Shannon McKeown-Gilmore, also a 17-year-old from south Belfast, is a Catholic nationalist and Irish, though she is not religious. She has applied to study law in England and hopes to become a barrister.Jake Lowry, who is 17 and from east Belfast, is a Protestant unionist and British. He hopes to study politics and international relations in England next year and would like to be a civil servant or diplomat.Six out of the seven students raise their hands.None of the seven students puts up their hand.This group of 17- and 18-year-old students, are all in their final year at Methodist College in Belfast and are thinking seriously about their future education and careers. They sat down with The  to discuss Brexit and what it means for them and Northern Ireland.The discussion takes place as the draft orce deal emerges and stirs isions in Northern Ireland, Britain and beyond. The political consequences of a no-deal, disorderly Brexit are huge five students, including one unionist, believe Brexit could result in a united Ireland in their lifetimes.Just two of the students have Irish passports but some of the others, and their family members, are applying because of the potential restrictions on travel after the UK quits the EU in March 2019.Even the only student who supports Brexit within the group, Jonny Mearns, a Protestant unionist, says he might consider an Irish passport if it became very difficult to travel.For these seven students at Methody, Brexit has reopened a complex debate about nationality and identity politics that the Good Friday or Belfast Agreement – negotiated two or three years before they were born – attempted to settle.Jonny\u0026nbspThe money the UK puts into the EU could be spent elsewhere, particularly education. Britain is much better off using that money and trading with the EU or the rest of the world on its own terms.Joni\u0026nbspIt is kind of a regression of ideas to combat globalisation, which I think is impossible anyway. I am not really sure what it is achieving. The main things at the beginning were immigration, sovereignty I am not really sure how we are going to gain those things through Brexit.Izaak\u0026nbspIt is breaking up different people, different countries and it will make it a lot harder for students and people early in their lives to get as many opportunities as they do right now.Jake\u0026nbspAs always in Northern Ireland, identity is a huge issue and you could almost say that Brexit has created an identity crisis. There are nationalists within Northern Ireland who feel that they are being drawn away from their Irish identity and the uncertainty over a hard or soft border, or indeed for unionists, if there is going to be a border down the Irish Sea. Young people within Northern Ireland still remain very close to their identities and all this is being thrown into uncertainty by Brexit.Shannon\u0026nbspI don’t think it will be a deal that everybody wants or agrees with. It’ll be a very middle-ground deal trying to please as many people as possible and ultimately will do the complete opposite.Jake\u0026nbspI live in a predominantly unionist area and in fact the post office ran out of Irish passport application forms within days of the Brexit vote, so there is a real appetite because of the uncertainty.Joni\u0026nbspOur Irish passport forms are in the post. I have always wanted to travel loads so it is pretty crucial that you are not held up in loads of different queues. It was a bit of a no-brainer really.Jonny\u0026nbspThere are a lot of unionists taking up that opportunity but I just think the border question in terms of travelling from France to Britain, having control over our own border, is more important to me than being able to walk through a line at the airport.Adam\u0026nbspThe rulebook of identity in Northern Ireland is almost being torn up by Brexit. There were people who five years ago would have thought it unthinkable to get an Irish passport but they think it now just makes sense. As a Northern Irish unionist, I think that’s what makes Brexit most frightening. If we continue barrelling down this uncertain path towards Brexit, it genuinely calls into question unionism in Northern Ireland and Northern Ireland’s very existence ultimately as well.Hala\u0026nbspIt is a worry for my family because we have a house just across the Border. Are we going to have to bring our passports or other ludicrous questions like that? It is usually a quick 45-minute trip down the road. When travelling in the car, there is a little pole with a little red stick on it. That’s how you know you have crossed the Border.My mum and dad recount the tales of when you used to have to stop and open the boot of the car and there would be army checks. Now there is such an ease of travel. It instils quite a big fear inside me that there is a very small possibility that that might come back.Jonny\u0026nbspTo a certain extent. From Northern Ireland’s perspective, we worry about it a lot but we fail to realise that the majority of our trade is with the rest of the United Kingdom. We also fail to realise that the Republic relies on the United Kingdom more than we rely on the Republic of Ireland.Adam\u0026nbspAny hard border or any hardening of the border, even whether it avoids a totally hard border, is certainly dangerous in that it could risk a return to violence. Whether that would be the case, no-one can foresee that but I think the risk of that isn’t a price worth paying.Shannon\u0026nbspThe DUP – because of their own personal interest, they were obviously a pro-Brexit party – are not recognising that the people of Northern Ireland voted to remain.Jake\u0026nbspThe DUP are a Eurosceptic party. They campaigned for Brexit and Sinn Féin unfortunately don’t take up their seats so how can they advocate for the people of Northern Ireland if they refuse to go to Westminster. It is the issue of symbolism. Sometimes you have to put pragmatism before symbolism.Izaak\u0026nbspIf a “no deal” Brexit was to occur due to chaos from an event such as the DUP pulling the rug out from under Theresa May’s government, then I could potentially see a fracturing of the union that would cause Northern Ireland to splinter off from the UK.Jonny\u0026nbspDespite Northern Ireland voting Remain, it is highly unlikely that many of those who voted Remain but identity as British would be willing to sacrifice the union for the sake of remaining in the EU.Joni\u0026nbspIt seems that unionists in the North are too adamant in their support of the union to concede, and southern nationalists don’t feel strongly enough for Northern Ireland to leave the union at this moment in time. Yet the uncertainty created by Brexit and the changes in Northern Ireland suggest that the prospect is not as far-fetched as it once was.Jonny\u0026nbspBrexit could perhaps result in a united Ireland, but it is improbable. It would have to take Brexit to be a catastrophe before even thinking about this, which I do not for one moment believe will be the case.Jake\u0026nbspA no-deal Brexit would expedite any potential unification of Ireland. Regardless of the actualities of such a scenario, the symbolic significance of a hard border could galvanise moderate voters and pro-EU unionists to turn to Irish nationalism as their solution to a no-deal scenario. Of course, that wouldn’t be a sudden change in thinking but something that would perhaps develop over the decades to come.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It has been their joint project for half a century to be at the centre of the public scene and debate.” Photograph: Brendan SmialowskiAFPGetty ImagesToronto: the snow is falling lightly.I’m feeling something foreign, something I’ve never felt before. It takes me a moment to identify it.I’m feeling sorry for the Clintons.In the 27 years I’ve covered Bill and Hillary, I’ve experienced a range of emotions. They’ve dazzled me and they’ve disgusted me.But now they’re mystifying me.I’m looking around Scotiabank Arena, the home of the Toronto Maple Leafs, and it’s a depressing sight. It’s two-for-the-price-of-one in half the arena. The hockey rink is half curtained off, but even with that, organisers are scrambling at the last minute to cordon off more sections behind thick black curtains, they say due to a lack of sales. I paid $177 weeks in advance. (I passed on the pricey meet-and-greet option.) On the day of the event, some unsold tickets are slashed to single digits.I get reassigned to another section as the Clintons’ audience space shrinks. But even with all the herding, I’m still looking at large swathes of empty seats – and I cringe at the thought that the Clintons will look out and see that, too. It was only four years ago, after all, that Canadians were clamouring to buy tickets to see the woman who seemed headed for history.It’s a sad contrast with the sold-out boffo book tour of Michelle Obama, who’s getting a lot more personal for the premium prices. But introspection has never been within the Clintons’ range.I can’t fathom why the Clintons would make like ageing rock stars and go on a tour of Canada and the United States at a moment when Democrats are hoping to break the stranglehold of their cloistered, superannuated leadership and exult in a mosaic of exciting new faces.What is the point? It’s not inspirational. It’s not for charity. They’re not raising awareness about a cause, like Al Gore with global warming. They’re only raising awareness about the Clintons.It can’t be the money at this point. Have they even spent all the Goldman gold yet? Do they want to swim in their cash like Scrooge McDuck?The Clintons’ tin cup is worthy of the Smithsonian. They hoovered more than $2 billion in contributions to their campaigns, foundation and philanthropies.After the White House, the money-grubbing raged on, with the Clintons making more than 700 speeches in a 15-year period, blithely unconcerned with any appearance of avarice or of shady special interests and foreign countries buying influence. They stockpiled a whopping $240 million. Even leading up to her 2016 presidential run, Hillary was packing in the speeches, talking to the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, the American Camp Association, eBay, and there was that infamous trifecta of speeches for Goldman Sachs worth $675,000.“What scares me the most is Hillary’s smug certainty of her own virtue as she has become greedy and how typical that is of so many chic liberals who seem unaware of their own greed,” Charlie Peters, the legendary liberal former editor of the Washington Monthly, told me. “They don’t really face the complicity of what’s happened to the world, how selfish we’ve become and the horrible damage of screwing the workers and causing this resentment that the Republicans found a way of tapping into.” He ruefully worries about the Obamas in this regard, too.Indeed, in the era of Trump, greed is not only good. It’s grand. The stock market is our highest value. Mammonism rules.But watching the Clintons hash over their well-worn tale of falling in love at Yale Law School, I realise that it’s not only about the money.Some in Clintonworld say Hillary fully intends to be the nominee. Once more, in Toronto, she didn’t rule it out, dodging the question with a lame joke. She carries herself with the air of a president in exile. Her consigliere, Philippe Reines, has prodded reporters on including her name when they write about 2020 candidates.And Bill has given monologues to old friends about how Hillary knows how she’d have to run in 2020, that she couldn’t have a big staff and would just speak her mind and not focus-group everything. (That already sounds focus-grouped.)After losing to an orange puffer clown fish who will go down as one of the most destructive forces in American history and flushing the Obama legacy down the drain, that’s delusional. Some Obama associates say the former president has some regrets about throwing his support solely behind Hillary and knows he misread the anger and frustration of voters.Bill was radioactive in the midterms and Hillary was the Ghost of Christmas Past. Her approval rating is at a record low of 36 per cent. The only American who seems truly interested in her these days is president Donald Trump, who can’t stop tweeting about her. She’s still money in his book.The Clintons refuse to be discarded. It has been their joint project for half a century to be at the centre of the public scene and debate. The way that the whole thing came crashing down in 2016 is too hard for them to bear. They would like to rewrite the ending, but there is no way to do that.Nothing they have done lately suggests that they have learned anything, including their obtuse post-#MeToo comments about Monica Lewinsky, who has been far more candid and sympathetic in the 20th anniversary retellings of the impeachment saga. The Clintons are still unable to hold themselves accountable. The formerly golden couple who dominated their party for nearly three decades is travelling North America in a bubble, shockingly un-self-aware.Their pathological need to be relevant in America is belied by a Canadian arena, where stretches of empty seats bear witness to the passing of their relevance.Read more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination.

But those who have economic problems like Greece achieve it faster.His remarks are likely to cause irritation in Athens, as Germany was the driving force behind the austerity package Greece was ordered to adopt after the debt crisis.  Mr Merz went on to suggest that the two per cent target should be expanded to include German aid projects.  One should not include only military expenditures. Germany does a lot to build civilian structures in crisis areas. That should be included in the calculation.Donald Trump, the US president, has repeatedly criticized Germany for failing to meet the Nato target, which was agreed at a summit in 2014.However, Germany has pledged to increase defence spending, with the CDU expected to agree at its annual conference this week a commitment of 1.5 per cent of GDP by 2024.It came as early polls indicated that Mr Merz has taken the lead in the race for the party chairmanship, following 18 years of Ms Merkel.Mr Merz is one of three candidates who have a realistic chance of winning when delegates vote at the party conference on December 8th. The other two runners are Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, a Merkel loyalist, and Jens Spahn, a long-time critic of Merkel’s refugee policies. Polling by Bild newspaper showed that, of 300 delegates prepared to disclose their intentions, 144 planned to back Mr Merz while 96 wanted Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer and only 29 support Mr Spahn.A total of 1,001 delegates will vote at the party conference in Hamburg. The CDU\u0027s decision to conduct nationwide leadership hustings ahead of the conference  seems to have gone down well with the wider electorate. A poll released on Saturday showed that they had jumped 2 percentage points to 28 percent, while the surging Green party fell back two points to 19 percent.We need to hold our nerve over Brexit - we can do so much better than this dealKeeping Brexit legal advice secret because of Iraq precedent is wrong, Tony Blair\u0026#39s ex Attorney General saysThe Home Office fears EU law will damage child abuse prevention operations, leaked memo revealsDynasties, episode 4 review: the painted wolves gave us a family feud akin to Game of ThronesStrictly Come Dancing 2018, Musicals Week results: Charles Venn knocked out after dance-off defeat to Ashley RobertsJohn Lewis advent calendar in hot water with parents after telling children Christmas will come a week earlyBaby boomers increasingly being admitted to hospital for drug-related mental health problemsEton\u0026#39s new state-of-the-art sports centre set to be refused planning permission Proton beam failure leaves hundreds of child cancer patients at riskLift ban on payments for surrogates, says Sir James MunbyComment: The UK must take the lead in ensuring disabled people are not left behindDoctor Who episode 9, It Takes You Away recap: Nordic noir meets Crazy Frog in spookiest, smartest and best episode yetDenmark to banish foreign criminals to remote island Claire Foy pokes fun at Netflix during Saturday Night Live routineAuthor furious after book on how to reduce plastic waste shrink-wrapped by distributorMan drops ring in drain while proposing on New York\u0026#39s Times SquareBridesmaid died after falling and hitting her head on the way to her brother\u0026#39s wedding, inquest hearsAspiring pilot who killed himself believed seeking help for depression would end his \u0026#39dream career\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/12/02/TELEMMGLPICT000182478549_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNJjoeBT78QIaYdkJdEY4CnGTJFJS74MYhNY6w3GNbO8.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"claire foy pokes fun netflix saturday night live routine","story":"Claire Foy appeared in a number of sketches on this weekend\u0026#39s edition of Saturday Night LiveClaire Foy has poked fun at her employer Netflix during a stand-up routine on Saturday Night Live.The actress, best known for playing the Queen on drama series The Crown, which is produced by the streaming service, appeared in a number of sketches on the satirical comedy show. One began with a voiceover that said: We\u0027re spending billions of dollars and making every show in the world, before the sketch moves on to a pitch meeting with SNL cast member Heidi Gardner playing a producer suggesting a new programme.This show is about a girl named Ginny, she says, before a Netflix executive throws money at her.

Reunification was the logical result of the collapse of the Soviet empire, but it was fraught with danger, because the Soviets might have crushed it. The harder-line Communists might have regained control and tried to refreeze the shape of Europe. (Indeed, this nearly happened.) Bush gave wholehearted support to Germany, while building trust with the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. The Cold War came peacefully to a close.

Well if it\u0027s 85 you will comfortably live to see your child become an adult if you have an artificial baby at 60.”Sir James highlighted a landmark case in which a transgender man wanted to be legally registered as their child’s father, noting that concepts of family were changing.“If someone would have said ten years ago that, in a decade\u0027s time, there\u0027s going to be a case in the family ision on whether you can have a father without having a mother, people would have thought you were bonkers,” he said.“\u0027Society is moving on and the challenge for lawmakers is what steps, if any, we take to accommodate those changes into our legal framework.”Law and orderWe need to hold our nerve over Brexit - we can do so much better than this dealThe Home Office fears EU law will damage child abuse prevention operations, leaked memo revealsDynasties, episode 4 review: the painted wolves gave us a family feud akin to Game of ThronesStrictly Come Dancing 2018, Musicals Week results: Charles Venn knocked out after dance-off defeat to Ashley RobertsJohn Lewis advent calendar in hot water with parents after telling children Christmas will come a week earlyBaby boomers increasingly being admitted to hospital for drug-related mental health problemsEton\u0026#39s new state-of-the-art sports centre set to be refused planning permission Proton beam failure leaves hundreds of child cancer patients at riskComment: The UK must take the lead in ensuring disabled people are not left behindDoctor Who episode 9, It Takes You Away recap: Nordic noir meets Crazy Frog in spookiest, smartest and best episode yetDenmark to banish foreign criminals to remote island Claire Foy pokes fun at Netflix during Saturday Night Live routineAuthor furious after book on how to reduce plastic waste shrink-wrapped by distributorMan drops ring in drain while proposing on New York\u0026#39s Times SquareBridesmaid died after falling and hitting her head on the way to her brother\u0026#39s wedding, inquest hearsAspiring pilot who killed himself believed seeking help for depression would end his \u0026#39dream career\u0026#39Comment: George H W Bush - the last leader whose ego didn’t come firstWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/22/14/44641881-2083460138371691-2373664266554179584-o.jpg","title":"hs2 london birmingham manchester cost department transport high speed","story":"IM Subscribe  registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

On a weekday, when thousands of commuters were trying to get to work, college and school let alone the other, vast number of folk who thought they they would see the railway as their most convenient form of travel.Because it was in the North, the stoppage raised barely a glimmer of interest in the South. If it had happened in Kent or Surrey, to trains into London Bridge or Waterloo, all hell would have broken loose. Instead, it was just another day of misery, to go with the other numerous days lost, including when they changed the timetable, and the services across the North could not cope.Meanwhile, the Government is pressing ahead with a £56bn plan to develop HS2. Will the new high-speed link between London and the North-West change any of this? Will it improve things? Not at all. Will it make a difference that justifies such vast expenditure? Hardly. Is it a grotesque example of ministerial machismo, of gesture politics, of a total inability to see the wood for the trees? You bet it is.Archaeologists begin examining 10,000 years of history along HS2 routeNow we know HS2 really is a flawed projectHS2 requires extra £43bn \u0027for people to make the most of it\u0027The trains I’m talking about, the ones that were cancelled, were mostly on the branch lines, on the routes that people use day in, day out - not the West Coast Line, which already has a fast, comfortable service. In my lifetime, since growing up in Cumbria, and travelling to and from London to visit family, journey times have plummeted. On the main, trunk route - not on the secondary ones. This is where the problem lies, where the service is creaking.Cutting several minutes off the London to Manchester service does not matter a h’apporth. What would boost the experience immeasurably there would be to ensure that wifi works all the way, that a mobile signal is not lost. But that, too, is not what HS2 is about.Already, there is talk by those on the inside that the projected costs are soaring. The “main works civil contracts” on the London to Birmingham section, reports The Sunday Times, are “several billion pounds” over the official budget of £6.6bn. That’s before any earth is turned, and all manner of unseen, below ground problems are discovered.Conscious of a final bill that could spiral out of control, and being seen to get a grip, ministers are demanding that instead of sanctioning extra expenditure, costs are being renegotiated, to stick to the budgeted figure. This, in turn, has led to delays, as more design and development is required, and specifications redrawn. Again, the word is that the vast project - the country’s biggest and most demanding infrastructure scheme - is likely to be more than a year behind schedule.That\u0027s how fast HS2\u0026nbspservices will travel at when the project is completedPart of the issue here is that mooted figures are proving inaccurate, the result, apparently of an insistence that the new railway meets a deadline for the beginning of services, of 2026.The thinking behind this demand, that Britain is sick and tired of major capital constructions that seem to take forever to reach fulfilment (runway expansion of Heathrow was first raised exactly 50 years ago) is laudable. But put that together with a scheme that is huge and complex, and it can become a recipe for chaos. And that’s without HS2 being unnecessary in the first place.This is what ministers should realise: that £56bn buys you an awful lot of terribly needed enhancements, for instance to existing country and suburban services, and to digitalisation.There is a subtext, of course, to HS2 - one that is hardly ever raised, let alone publicly admitted. And it is that the 250mph railway has another purpose, beyond rushing passengers from London to Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. It is that the faster railway makes commuting from Birmingham in particular all that more manageable. House prices in the West Midlands are so much cheaper than in the South-East. Public sector workers in essential occupations, in sectors like the NHS and education, will be able to afford to commute from Brum. HS2, you see, is aimed in part at alleviating London’s growing housing crisis. Which makes it a very expensive solution indeed.When confronted with the news of the overruns and delay, the Department for Transport said it would not comment on speculation. “Our priority is to ensure value for money for the taxpayer.”Yes, but does the overall project seriously provide value for money?Ministers have the ability to stop it in its tracks, to ert the investment elsewhere. Of course, that would involve a loss of pride. There would be some dismay in the North, but not as much as might be expected - particularly if the money was spent on other local, much-needed advancements. Perhaps they should test attitudes towards the new service before it\u0027s too late.For there are warning lights flashing all over this.

Regulated fares, meanwhile,\u0026nbspare linked to\u0026nbspretail price index\u0026nbspinflation and will rise by 3.2 per cent, as has previously been announced.Regardless of whether they buy regulated or unregulated tickets, the lot of users is not a happy one. They pay through the nose for\u0026nbspa shabby service prone to widespread disruption.\u0026nbspThese trains are affected by the Northern Rail strike this SaturdayA wake up call for rail operators? Commuters now have an ombudsmanThe near meltdown that followed the introduction of new timetables earlier this year brought\u0026nbsppublicity to the problem. But just as serious is the constant low-level pain inflicted upon passengers. No wonder the announcement left them, and their representatives, spitting tacks.\u0026nbspThe backdrop to this is the government’s policy of having taxpayers spend less subsidising the railways, with the\u0026nbspburden being shifted on to the fare-paying public. \u0026nbspAt first blush, that would seem like a credible plan, and even more so when you look at the numbers.\u0026nbspAccording to Full Fact, the fact checking charity, the railways have received subsidies averaging about £5bn a year over the last five years.\u0026nbspBut that’s just the start of it when it comes to public money. In 2016-17 about £15bn was spent in total, partly due to the way Network Rail, which owns and operates the tracks and infrastructure, is funded.\u0026nbspWanda Wyporska\u0026nbspof the Equality Trust\u0026nbspmade the point in  last year that this spending is weighted disproportionately towards London and the southeast, and so favours well-to-do commuters. She argued that the government should focus\u0026nbspon poorer areas\u0026nbspand\u0026nbsptransport used by the less well-off, such as buses and trams. She made a good point.\u0026nbspHowever, I would argue that one needs to look at rail in the context of an integrated transport policy that serves the needs of the nation, and its economy, as a whole.\u0026nbspRail, which has seen a sharp increase in passenger numbers and requires investment to cope with them, plays an important role in keeping people off Britain’s congested, polluting roads. Through that lens, the money is\u0026nbspwell spent.None of this changes the fact that the private rail operators have done a rotten job. Given what they’ve experienced, and what they pay for it, passengers’ outrage is entirely justified.\u0026nbspAt times like this, rail companies are fond of pointing out that 98p out of every £1 in fares goes into running the railways and that the extra money is needed to keep the show on the road.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

They\u0026nbspwere asked their opinions on their bank’s current account, and how likely they were to recommend the company. TSB’s overall score was 58 per cent, putting it in joint last place with Bank of Ireland, which was bottom of the table for the second year running. TSB sheds 20,000 current accounts in wake of massive IT failure Monzo to launch new crowdfunding round as it seeks $1bn valuationTSB boss Paul Pester steps down after new IT problemsTSB, which came in fourth in last year’s ranking, has suffered a crisis this year after a series of major IT failures, which caused\u0026nbspthousands of customers\u0026nbspto leave.Chief executive Paul Pester\u0026nbspstepped down over the tech meltdown and the chaos prompted a parliamentary inquiry. More than half of the TSB customers surveyed by Which? said they had experienced technical issues in the last year. The bank also scored poorly on customer service, telephone and online banking and complaint handling. “TSB’s slump suggests that customers felt outraged to have endured the prolonged IT issues that left millions locked out of their accounts,” said Gareth Shaw, money expert at Which?A TSB spokesperson said: “We’re sorry for the problems customers experienced as a result of our IT switch.“Regrettably this is why our scores are low in this poll. Our priority is putting things right for our customers and we’ve made significant progress.”Meanwhile, Monzo came out on top after reaching a large enough sample size for the first time since it launched in 2016.

That should allow people to share more personal moments with a smaller group, Instagram said.Instagram Stories has become the place to express yourself and share everyday moments, but our community has grown — sometimes what you want to share isn\u0027t for everyone, the company wrote in its announcement blog post.Instagram’s latest feature aims to tackle social media addictionInstagram had always intended for stories to be a more personal way of sharing information on the site. Not only do they disappear 24 hours after they are posted, users can see everyone who has watched them.Adding people to the list of close friends is simple: go to your profile and click on the Close Friends option in the side menu and add people. Then when you share a new story, you\u0027ll have the option of sharing only with the people in that list.Only you can see your own close friends list, people will not know from the app if they are not in it, and there is no way for people to ask to be added.\u0026nbspIf you are chosen as someone\u0027s close friend, you will see a green ring badge when you\u0027re viewing their stories, and a green ring around their profile photo in the list of stories.Close friends will be rolling out globally today on both iOS and Android, the company said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

William Cook catches\u0026nbspup with him in his Bristol studioClick to followThe IndependentKnees up at Yates\u0027s Wine Lodge, in Ashton-Under-Lyne: these lodges had a dismal reputation, seemingly designed for taking the quickest route to oblivionAt Manchester Art Gallery, in the beating heart of England’s most happening city (sorry, London – you’ve had your turn), Martin Parr is showing a gaggle of reporters around his latest exhibition. It’s called Return to Manchester, and the title is telling. Parr is a southern softy, born and raised in Surrey, but it was as a photography student at Manchester Polytechnic in the early 1970s that he found his creative focus. His first exhibition, back in 1971, was just down the road, in a corridor at Kendal Milne department store. Half a century later he’s back in the metropolis that made him, to open a one man show of Mancunian photos, then and now.It’s an exhibition of two halves: black and white photographs of the rundown Manchester of the 1970s colour photos of the dynamic Manchester of today. Wry and playful, yet imbued with a deep, unspoken sense of melancholy, it’s a profound and powerful evocation of the way that Manchester – and Martin Parr – has changed. “I had a fantastic time in Manchester,”\u0026nbsphe says, and his affection for the city – then and now – is evident in these photos.Picture of heart-shaped cancer cells wins science photography prizeThe earliest photographs in the show were taken while he was still at college, and the images that encapsulate\u0026nbspthe Manchester of the early 1970s are the June Street photos he took with his friend and fellow student, Daniel Meadows. They’d gone in search of Coronation Street, but the street which inspired the Salford soap opera had already been demolished. However, a few scenes had been shot on June Street, an adjacent street which had survived.Instead of photographing the drab exteriors of these terraced houses, they ventured within. Their portraits of the people they found inside exude the poise and dignity of Old Masters, which is ironic, for Parr has often been accused of being a photographer who takes the piss. “Unless there’s some vulnerability there, I don’t think you’re going to get good photographs,” he once said. There’s vulnerability here aplenty, and that’s what makes these portraits so appealing.June Street was one of several photographic projects which Parr undertook, entirely of his own accord, during his student days in Manchester. A series of photos inside Prestwich Mental Hospital captured the bleak ambience of that institution, but it was his Love Cubes series (which doubled as a board game) that epitomised his sense of fun. Parr photographed couples on the streets of Manchester, together and then separately. The idea of the game is to try and work out who’s going out with whom.Half a lifetime later these student projects still feel fresh and vital, but Parr’s course was a vocational training for a career as a commercial photographer, and so his superiors weren’t impressed. He could have been chucked out if it hadn’t been for Alan Murgatroyd, the one tutor who fought his corner. Happily, after all these years, Murgatroyd is still with us, and he appeared as the guest of honour\u0026nbspto open Parr’s new show.For this show Parr has returned to Manchester to shoot a new set of photographs, and the city of today feels a world away from the city of his student days. It’s multicultural and, above all, colourful –\u0026nbspfrom Media City to the Eithad, from mosques to yoga classes, from royal wedding street parties to Gay Pride. It was unimaginable, 30 or 40 years ago, that Pride would have such a big impact in a city like Manchester,\u0026nbsphe says. From pies at Bury market to gluten-free brownies in the Northern Quarter, like an anthropologist Parr finds signs of change amid the ephemeral and the mundane.Created with Sketch.The best of The

I doubt it. But the rest of Britain has changed almost as much, and Parr has chronicled that change with more wit and insight than any other artist I know. What makes his vision so acute? To try and find out, I travelled to Bristol, where he’s lived since 1987, to meet this elusive and enigmatic man who excels at examining the minutiae of our daily lives.We meet at his studio, on an industrial estate on the scruffy side of Bristol. His studio is tidy and businesslike (not for him the chaotic squalor of the tortured, tormented artist). His appearance is similarly anodyne, almost anonymous – nondescript leisurewear, neither smart nor scruffy. His manner is friendly but noncommittal – warm smile, wary eyes. He speaks quietly, clearly, lucidly. His voice is classless, rootless. He chooses his words with care.“I was fully aware that Manchester had changed enormously in the 35 years since I lived there,”\u0026nbsphe says. “There are now two Manchesters – there’s the traditional one and the gentrified one, so I went to both.”He’s broadly enthusiastic about the gentrification of the city, but he can see the downside too. “Gentrification can be a mixed blessing. It can tend to kill off the sense of community that was there before – richer, younger people move in – but in the end I think without it these places would suffer even more.”As befits a born observer, accustomed to travelling incognito, he’s used to blending into the background. With his pleasant but forgettable face, his neat grey hair and his bland chainstore clothes, he’d make a good private detective. He looks more like a middle ranking civil servant than a famous photographer - which is fitting, for that was his father’s job (though his passion was ornithology). Martin used to accompany him on his birdwatching trips - though Martin always used to watch the birdwatchers, not the birds.He was born in 1952 in Epsom, the buckle in the commuter belt. His parents were Methodists (“I went to Sunday School and argued with the teachers”), comfortably off, in a humdrum way, and reasonably contented. He has one sibling, a sister, seven years younger, which made him almost an only child. It sounds like a barren beginning for a creative artist, but the absence of high drama compelled him to look more closely, more keenly, at the world around him. “The advantage of coming from suburban Surrey is that everywhere else looks more interesting.”\u0026nbspHe was a meticulous collector, and a quintessential trainspotter. He still collects all sorts of trash-aesthetic bric-a-brac today.His main inspiration was his paternal grandfather, George Parr, a lay preacher and a keen amateur photographer, who lived in Calverley, in West Yorkshire. George taught him the rudiments of photography. For Martin, it was love at first sight. “There was never any doubt. As soon as I saw it, I thought ‘That’s the medium for me – that’s what I want to be.’”\u0026nbspMartin’s summer holidays in Calverley were among his happiest childhood memories. ‘I’ve always had a soft spot for Yorkshire – my father’s from Yorkshire, I’ve got Yorkshire in my blood.’ His first photographic project was a study of Harry Ramsden’s, the celebrated Yorkshire fish and chip shop. It was here that his passion for photography – and the north of England – began.Martin passed his 11-plus and went to Surbiton Grammar School, but compared with his Yorkshire apprenticeship school was distinctly uninspiring. He was a mediocre student and his teachers were underwhelmed. His school report makes interesting (and, in retrospect, amusing) reading. ‘He has considerable flair for photography and a certain amount of ability in the art field, but there seems to be little chance of realising his potential if his attitude to his general work continues to be so poor,’ wrote his form tutor. “Very little work achieved – very lackadaisical,”\u0026nbspconcurred his art master.It was only when he went to Manchester that he really spread his wings. In Manchester he encountered a sense of community more akin to the one he’d found in Calverley. “Coming from suburban Surrey, I was very taken with that – the friendliness of people, and how open they were.”He lived in Moss Side, which was thrilling. When they started demolishing Moss Side we used to go round and pick the stuff out of the old houses and photograph it – we had a great time. Photography was his calling. Despite being on a course which didn’t suit him, making work for which there was no real outlet, he never doubted his abilities. I knew what I wanted to do and why, and I just got on with it. I had total self-belief.In Manchester he met Susie Mitchell, an English student from the Home Counties who collaborated with him on various projects and subsequently became his wife. In the 1970s, Manchester was an exciting place to live, like a foreign country after the outer London suburbs, she wrote, in her eloquent introduction to The Non-conformists, his haunting book of photos of Yorkshire chapel life. Swathes of condemned terraced housing, monstrous Victorian public buildings, acres of wasteland awaiting redevelopment, grimy parks and odiferous curry houses…\u0026nbspFor Martin it was paradise.After graduating from Manchester they moved to Hebden Bridge, where they formed close relationships with some of the subjects of The Non-conformists (Susie interviewed them Martin photographed them). This intimacy resulted in some remarkable photos, but the relationship ended rather unhappily when some of their subjects realised, belatedly, that they were only photographic subjects (rather than soulmates) after all.I wasn’t a believer,\u0026nbspsays Parr. I respected their religion and I enjoyed partaking in it and photographing it.\u0026nbspHowever, he was essentially an atheist. From then on Martin kept his distance and his work became more detached. You’re never part of what you photograph,\u0026nbsphe says. You’re always an outsider.Susie became a speech therapist, a job that took her to Ireland and then to Merseyside. Martin went with her and on Merseyside he found the subject that made his name. His stark photos of New Brighton (a rundown seaside resort near Liverpool) were revolutionary. For one thing, they were in colour (a medium still shunned by so-called “serious”\u0026nbspphotographers) but above all it was his stark treatment of these Liverpudlian daytrippers which broke new ground.Parr showed New Brighton in all its gory glory – the fractious toddlers, the bored parents, the litter, the fast food... There was nothing falsified about it, but there was nothing prettified about it either, and for middle class audiences used to quaint depictions of the worthy poor, it was a rude awakening. This is a clammy, claustrophobic nightmare world where people lie knee deep in chip papers, swim in polluted black pools and stare at a bleak horizon of urban dereliction,\u0026nbspwrote Robert Morris in the British Journal of Photography. Parr called his series The Last Resort.The show was well received in Liverpool. Ironically, it was when it went to London that the reaction became more critical. Our historic working class, normally dealt with generously by documentary photographers, becomes a sitting duck for a more sophisticated audience,\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspwrote David Lee\u0026nbspin Art Review. They appear fat, simple, styleless, tediously conformist and unable to assert any inidual identity. They wear cheap flashy clothes and in true conservative fashion are resigned to their meagre lot. Only babies and children survive ridicule, and it is their inclusion in many pictures which gives Parr’s acerbic vision of hopelessness its poetic touch.With the hindsight of history, this seems rather unfair. Parr’s vision is acerbic but he never ridicules his subjects. On the contrary, his day-trippers actually seem rather admirable, striving to give their children a nice day out in the face of overwhelming odds. Merseyside was a pretty hopeless place in 1986. Like all good photographers, Parr was simply shooting what he saw.I don’t think I’m out there to take the piss, particularly. There has to be a sense of mischief, because that’s part of the British make-up and identity, but the mischief is applied equally to everything and anybody, because life is weird. People are strange, and people are entertaining. I do like people –\u0026nbspI love what they all get up to.’Most of the things he photographs are things he does himself.‘Portrait of Britain’ photo competition highlights ersity of nationFive tips for underwater filming and photographyStanley Kubrick\u0027s unseen photography reveals early talent of directorHe’s impervious to criticism of his work. I realised pretty early on that that controversial aspect to what I do never does you any harm,\u0026nbsphe says. I’m very democratic when it comes to classes – I put it up all classes.\u0026nbspHe followed up The Last Resort with several projects about the bourgeoisie.If anything, these projects were even more acerbic, attracting further criticism. One picture editor called him a gratuitously cruel social critic who has made a large amount of money by sneering at the foibles and pretentions of other people.\u0026nbspAgain, this seems unfair. It’s hardly Parr’s fault that he’s made a decent living, and it seems harsh to describe his stance as sneering. He delights in bathos and absurdity, but his vision is dispassionate, not cruel. I continue to be amazed that people still find my work controversial, because I’m just photographing western life, the leisure pursuits of the western world.One of his most successful series, Small World, was about mass tourism, a phenomenon which straddles every class. We have this idea of what a place would be like because we’ve seen it in the pictures and the postcards. When we get there the reality is quite different. I’m showing the reality of peoples’ expectations.We have this idea of what a place would be like because we’ve seen it in the pictures and the postcards. When we get there the reality is quite differentAs beauty spots become tourist traps, that reality is pretty grim – but for Parr, it makes great photos. “I find it completely fascinating. Remember: when a place is mobbed I’m happy, because I can make my point even clearer.”\u0026nbspAnd the point is? “That the mythology is different to the reality.”The overall conclusion one draws from Parr’s photos is that consumerism is pretty tawdry, and globalisation is making a bad situation even worse. And yet, inidually, his photos are full of fun. “That’s all part of the contradiction – the ambiguity is what this is all about.”Back in Manchester, Martin is winding up his tour. Most of the pictures I take are rubbish – I take more rubbish than most people because I take more photographs than most people, he says. What you’re trying to find is that magic moment, and how and when that happens is almost impossible to predict. So, even though I’ve been doing it for many years, I couldn’t quite tell you how to do it – but you have a very strong intuitive sense when it starts to happen.Martin Parr: Return to Manchester is at Manchester Art Gallery (www.manchesterartgallery.org) until 22 April 2019Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But they missed it the first time around, making it one of a number of objects that the team hopes to go back and have a proper look at.The rover already snapped a photo of the object, showing its shiny coating amid the dust and rocks of the Martian surface.But it will investigate it further with other tools in an attempt to understand its chemistry. That will be done using the onboard ChemCam, a set of tools that can examine objects remotely.In the same journey, it will have a look at a number of other interesting specimens. One very small piece is “Flanders moss”, which has an interesting, dark coloured coating which the team hope to come to understand by examining its chemistry.All of the work comes after Curiosity welcomed another visitor to the planet from Earth, the InSight rover. Curiosity played Mr Rogers’ song “Won’t You Be My Neighbour”\u0026nbspto welcome its fellow visitor.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This has never been done before, said astrophysicist Marco Ajello​, who is lead author of the paper. Most of this light is emitted by stars that live in galaxies. And so, this has allowed us to better understand the stellar-evolution process and gain captivating insights into how the universe produced its luminous content.The calculations allowed scientists to work out the total number of photons ever emitted.Expressing the number they found is very difficult, in part because it relies on a number of variables. But it is also literally difficult to write out, because there are so many zeroes.In all, there have been four and then 85\u0026nbspzeroes of them.Despite that vast amount of light ever emitted, very little of it ever gets to us beyond the light we see from our own sun and galaxy. The brightness of the universe as it reaches us is roughly equivalent to looking at a 60-watt lightbulb in complete darkness, from 2.5 miles away.That is because the universe is so vast and distant. But the Fermi telescope allowed the researchers to look at the dim swirl of light that comes from stars, and in so doing calculate how much light was being absorbed and therefore how much there might ever have been around.The new discovery will now allow scientists to peek out into the very beginnings of the universe.The first billion years of our universe\u0027s history are a very interesting epoch that has not yet been probed by current satellites, Ajello said. Our measurement allows us to peek inside it. Perhaps one day we will find a way to look all the way back to the Big Bang. This is our ultimate goal.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The Brexiteers may lose their Brexit.”Ms Rudd also cast doubt on Ms May’s plans to seal the Brexit deal at a summit with EU leaders on Sunday, acknowledging there are still obstacles in the way.“Hopefully it will get through this week,” she said, adding: “There is still a negotiation going on in terms of actually getting this agreement through.”The comments make Ms Rudd the first cabinet minister to rule out a no-deal Brexit – and the first to suggest an agreement at European level could yet be derailed.They came as the prime minister prepared to head to Brussels for talks with Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, under huge pressure for further “wins” in the final text.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

And these are exceptional circumstances.Labour sources said that Sir Keir was ready to sign a joint letter with the DUP\u0027s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds, Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake and SNP Europe spokesman Stephen Gethins, asking Mr Bercow to allow a motion that the government had\u0026nbspheld Parliament in contempt.Under Commons rules, if the Speaker allows the motion to go before the House and the vote is carried, it would then be referred to the Committee of Privileges which would rule on whether a contempt of Parliament had taken place.If it is decided that a contempt had occurred, the committee can recommend a suitable punishment which is then put back to MPs to agree.In theory, the most severe penalty is expulsion from the House, although the prospects of that happening would appear remote.However, any finding against the government would be potentially highly damaging for Ms May at a time when she is at her most vulnerable politically.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Just 10 per cent said they thought the deal would produce a stronger economy while 22 per cent said “about the same” and 18 per cent replied, “don’t know”.\u0026nbspThe poll of 1,655 iniduals was conducted on Wednesday and Thursday, meaning some of those surveyed could have seen the alarming analysis of different Brexit scenarios from both the Treasury and the Bank of England.Outlining worst-case scenarios, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank, said a no-deal scenario could send the pound plunging, shrink the economy by eight per cent and that house prices could fall by almost a third.Referring to the findings, Mr Kellner added: “These are significant results, and not just because Remain’s lead is the biggest yet. For the first time, more than one in five Leave voters are having second thoughts.\u0026nbspwouldn’t be a ‘walk in the park’“While 88 per cent of those who voted Remain two years ago would vote the same way in a new referendum, the equivalent figure for Leave is down to 79 per cent.“This means that 3.5 million\u0026nbspLeave voters are having second thoughts – of whom two\u0026nbspmillion\u0026nbsphave changed sides and would now vote Remain. (The rest\u0026nbspare now don’t knows or would not vote).“The big majorities among Labour voters both for Remain and a People’s Vote also send a clear message to the party’s MPs about the decisions they will shortly face in parliament.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But it is a projection… It is simply one scenario, and one model.“The government in every scenario and in every model can take steps in order to improve economic growth. The projections are one way of informing the debate but they are not definitive, they are not a prediction, they are not an oracle, they are simply a set of data.Labour to table no confidence motion in if Brexit deal fallsMr Gove did, however, acknowledge that there would “undoubtedly” be a “period of economic turbulence” should the UK crash out of the bloc without a deal.The cabinet minister also used his appearance to urge wavering Conservative MPs to back Theresa May’s deal in a crucial Commons vote in nine days’ time.While he admitted it would a “challenge” to secure the passage of the UK-EU agreement, Mr Gove insisted the prime minister can still persuade colleagues and win the vote.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Britain will no longer have access to the EU\u0027s Galileo satellite system (pictured) following brexit US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Theresa May attend the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires, ArgentinaWaves hit the British coast as Storm Diana approaches, in Portreath, CornwallDuke and Duchess of Cambridge stand with Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha (left), the son of Leicester City\u0027s chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, and his mother Aimon watched by Leicester City players (right) as they pause after laying flowers during their visit to the King Power Stadium in Leicester, to pay tribute to those who lost their lives in the October 27 helicopter crash at the stadium.

There is a real risk that if we don’t vote for this deal that there may be a majority in the House of Commons for a second referendum. And there is also the risk that if we don’t vote for this deal we may get a less good deal, or no deal at all. All of those are less attractive than this deal.“I actually think if there were a second referendum people would probably vote to Leave in even larger numbers than they did before. But the very act of calling a second referendum, I believe, would damage faith in democracy and rip apart the social fabric of this country.”Pressed on the Northern Ireland “backstop” – the EU’s insurance policy to avoid a hard border – Mr Gove said however “uncomfortable” it is for the UK, “it is more uncomfortable for the European Union”.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Britain will no longer have access to the EU\u0027s Galileo satellite system (pictured) following brexit US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Theresa May attend the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires, ArgentinaWaves hit the British coast as Storm Diana approaches, in Portreath, CornwallDuke and Duchess of Cambridge stand with Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha (left), the son of Leicester City\u0027s chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, and his mother Aimon watched by Leicester City players (right) as they pause after laying flowers during their visit to the King Power Stadium in Leicester, to pay tribute to those who lost their lives in the October 27 helicopter crash at the stadium.

They\u0026nbspwere asked their opinions on their bank’s current account, and how likely they were to recommend the company. TSB’s overall score was 58 per cent, putting it in joint last place with Bank of Ireland, which was bottom of the table for the second year running. TSB sheds 20,000 current accounts in wake of massive IT failure Monzo to launch new crowdfunding round as it seeks $1bn valuationTSB boss Paul Pester steps down after new IT problemsTSB, which came in fourth in last year’s ranking, has suffered a crisis this year after a series of major IT failures, which caused\u0026nbspthousands of customers\u0026nbspto leave.Chief executive Paul Pester\u0026nbspstepped down over the tech meltdown and the chaos prompted a parliamentary inquiry. More than half of the TSB customers surveyed by Which? said they had experienced technical issues in the last year. The bank also scored poorly on customer service, telephone and online banking and complaint handling. “TSB’s slump suggests that customers felt outraged to have endured the prolonged IT issues that left millions locked out of their accounts,” said Gareth Shaw, money expert at Which?A TSB spokesperson said: “We’re sorry for the problems customers experienced as a result of our IT switch.“Regrettably this is why our scores are low in this poll. Our priority is putting things right for our customers and we’ve made significant progress.”Meanwhile, Monzo came out on top after reaching a large enough sample size for the first time since it launched in 2016. The\u0026nbsponline-only bank scored full marks for both communication and its app. With a total customer satisfaction score of 86 per cent, it narrowly beat telephone and online-only First Direct, which scored 85 per cent. Nationwide\u0026nbspcame in third\u0026nbspwith 79 per cent and challenger\u0026nbsp Bank was fourth with 76 per cent. Which? said this year’s ranking showed challenger banks were gaining favour. Mr Shaw said: “Impressive results from challenger banks place them well ahead of many of the biggest banking brands in Britain, showing that innovation and modern ideas are shaking up the market, with good customer service truly valued by customers.“Our research shows a clear gap between the best and worst providers and should act as a catalyst for customers unhappy with their service to switch banks – as it’s never been easier.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

but the EU has warned that would render the mechanism pointless.It would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.At the same time the UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries.On November , thereported that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab demanded the right to pull Britain out of the EU’s Irish backstop after just three months.The paper claimed the hardline pitch to the Irish government “stunned” officials.Its claimed Mr Raab’s proposal was put to the Irelands deputy prime minister Simon Coveney in a private meeting in London.However, the Irish Prime Minister told Theresa May that he will not accept a Brexit deal which gives the UK the unilateral power to halt backstop arrangements for the border with Northern Ireland.The EU has suggested a backstop that would see Northern Ireland staying in the customs union, the EU VAT system and parts of the single market.This will essentially draw a customs border down the middle of the Irish Sea, potentially damaging the union of the UK.Mrs May has suggested a backstop that will see all of the UK aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after .Brussels has two issues with Mays plan.The first is that May wants the backstop to come to an end after a certain time period the EU thinks this would be self-defeating as its possible no solution for the Irish border would be found.The EU also thinks this risks leaving Britain benefiting from the customs union and single market for years after Brexit - reaping all the benefits without having any of the obligations that full membership would entail.In June  European leaders said Britain was running out of time to do a deal because of the unsolved border problem.In July Theresa May quoted Shakespeare as she insisted the UK would not be broken up with a border down the Irish Sea.Theresa May has told EU leaders she is looking at ways of keeping Britain under their rules for at least another year as part of efforts to break the Brexit deadlock.Addressing the  national bosses at a tense summit in Brussels on the night of October , the PM said she is “ready to consider” extending the  month transition period after the UK leaves the EU next March.The potentially incendiary move has been drawn up by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier to try to end a bitter impasse over the Irish border.It would mean abiding by all Brussels rules until December  at the earliest.The news comes after talks on Sunday, October , hit a brick wall once again, as the issue of the Irish border continues to cause a headache for Theresa May.Theresa May has insisted any backstop arrangement must apply to the UK as a whole so not to create a border in the Irish Sea.However, talks broke down after the EU had insisted on a second backstop arrangement - just involving Northern Ireland -the UKs version wasnt ready in time, according to Downing Street sources.Brussels admitted in a draft trade agreement that technology COULD be used to solve the thorny issue of the border, using Max Fac solutions at the frontier as part of a future deal between the UK and EU.But the backstop - which keeps Britain in the customs unionno alternative is agreed to keep the Irish border open - will stay in the withdrawal agreement as an insurance policy.Ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith said: The withdrawal agreement will make it very clear that should we struggle with a negotiation for a free trade arrangement and not complete that process, we will fall into the Northern Ireland backstop.I would hope that she would now consider that none of this is at all workable unless we get the withdrawal agreement now amended so that any arrangements we make strip out that backstop.Former minister Owen Paterson added: As long as the backstop is in existence in a legally binding document, there is a danger that should talks fail the backstop becomes accepted.We would have the horror of falling into a customs union, the horror of having Northern Ireland separated from the rest of the United Kingdom.Mrs May dubbed the continuing row with Brussels over how to avoid a hard border in Ireland as “the one real sticking point left, but a considerable one”.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.On November , , the PM faced crunch Cabinet showdowns with her ministers where she will set out the details of the agreement she struck with Brussels the previous day.A number of pro-Brexit ministers are feared to be on the brink of walking out over the deal.They believe it would leave Britain tied to the EU customs union for years to come, because of the controversial Irish backstop arrangement.If the Cabinet does block Mrs Mays deal, she could find her position is untenable - leading to a Tory leadership crisis."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0003730276661-e1541888658682.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"labour mp lives in social housing","story":"Shadow development secretary Kate Osamor has faced intense criticism after it emerged that she promoted her son in his House of Commons job, regardless of his conviction for having £, of Class A drugs with intent to supply at Bestival in Dorset last year.Now the Sun on Sunday can reveal that Ms Osamor and her son Ishmael, , are living in social housing in Tottenham, north London -

Sure enough, she literally lost the will to live and died soon after.It was the same story with my godparents and, as a trainee reporter, I interviewed countless golden wedding coupleswho had endured all manner of marital bumps in the road but lasted the course.How many of today’s liaisons will reach that -year milestone When Harry and Sandra took their vows, they clearly both understood the now largely outdated concept that love is a decision, not just a feeling.In other words, there might have been plenty of niggles and quarrels along the waybut they pushed on through in the knowledge that reaching old age with your spouse and best friend by your side is one of le’s greatest pleasures.The shared experiences, the joy of shared memories, the private jokes, the non-awkward silences and the companionship — bliss.Interestingly, Harry and Sandra’s marital set-up is one that’s increasingly regarded as outdated in this supposedly “progressive” day and age — that of the man bringing home the bacon while the woman runs the house and does the lion’s share of parenting.Consequently, Harry, now , freely admits he can barely make a cup of tea because Sandra does everything for him.It wouldn’t be my, er, cup of tea, but it has worked for them and perhaps it’s because Harry clearly doesn’t view Sandra as “just a housewe”he sees her as the boss and someone whose input he values and respects.And therein lies the key to a happy marriage. It doesn’t matter what the dynamic is as long as each feels appreciated and respected in their chosen role.Harry is what many might consider to be an old-fashioned gentleman, when men were allowed to be one without fear of being branded patronising.He turned away from the female contestants while they were showering and, whenever he gets the chance, awards “the ladies” the rare camp comforts on offer instead of the men.A magnanimous gesture, I notice, that they all accept readily without a passing thought that it might be unfair to the male contestants in these times of supposed equality for both genders.Ashley Roberts danced her bobby socks off in the Lindy hop on Saturday’s Strictly and performed a crackingly good samba too.But she ended up in the bottom two.Why  Because the public never like what they think might be a foregone conclusion.And however much the show tries to dress her up as a plucky amateur, her previous dance experience makes it as implausible as putting Bear Grylls in the I’m A Celebrity “jungle” and seeing him scream at the sight of a cockroach.Remember that moment in Crocodile Dundee when a yob pulls a blade on Mick Dundee in New York and he responds by saying “That’s not a kne”– “that’s a kne”.Fast forward  years and consider the story of Alun Powell, of Newport, Gwent, who takes part in medieval role-playing contests as “Sir Fightalot”.A court heard that when he arrived home to find his father being plagued by a gang outside the house, he pulled a sword, axe and knuckleduster from the boot of his car and “took up a fighting stance”.The prosecution added: “They saw the weapons and got so frightened that they left as quickly as possible.”Job done. End of. Right Nope. Alun ended up in court, convicted of possessing bladed articles in public and given  hours of community service.Perhaps this is why more members of the public don’t get involved when they see trouble.Becausethey don’t have a weapon themselves, they could get hurt.Andthey do happen to have one in their house or car, and brandish it in self-defence, there’s every chance they’ll end up in court themselves while the troublemakers get away scot-free.Robert de Niro is the new face of Warburtons bread.It’s hard to choose my favourite movies starring this acting titan, but Midnight Bun would be top, followed by The Kingsmill Of Comedy and Jackie Brown Bread.Posh store Anthropologie has been ridiculed for selling a bunch of twigs for £.But is the laugh on them or the idiots who buy them In the words of the marvellous Harry Enfield, it must include “we saw you coming” tax.Following on from the debate on whether or not they should have built a ramp to rescue stranded penguins, the crew of BBC’s wildle series Dynasties are in the news again for helping a stricken lion cub.As a rule, those who film such programmes are discouraged from intervening in the events they are trying to capture on the basis that nature should be allowed to take its course.But the cub was shown collapsing and spasming after eating bait laced with poison by tribesmen who had lost their cattle to a lion a few days earlier.So perhaps the new “rule” could be that human intervention is allowed when it’s human intervention that caused the crisis in the first place So how come a -year-old Iranian man – pretending to be  – was blithely placed in a class full of GCSE pupils in Ipswich without so much as a routine dental check Education Secretary Damian Hinds has added to the curriculum certain feats he wants primary school children to achieve before they move up to secondary.He says pupils will be urged to climb trees, explore caves and watch the sun rise to help build character.A good idea, but how depressing that all the things most of us did as a matter of routine in our youth now have to be actively prescribed.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He is the Health Secretary, for God’s sake. Why doesn’t he get the medicines, instead of issuing stupid threats At least Michael Gove’s pitul descent into Project Fear ignominy, with his own Hancockian warning about running out of drinking water, turns out to be fake news — or so I’m told.And where has all this left us With a Brexit “deal” that is not really a deal and doesn’t actually deliver Brexit. The transition period leaves Britain subject to most EU rules, and there is no agreement on what comes next — just an agenda for more negotiations.How dare Mrs May say last Sunday, “The British people don’t want to spend any more time arguing about Brexit. They want a good deal that fulfils the vote” Her plan guarantees years more “arguing about Brexit” and obviously doesn’t fulfil the vote. I know politicians spin everything but this is in a dferent league. It’s not spin, Prime Minister — what you are saying is a bare-faced lie, and you know it.It is also disgraceful that the civil service is helping push out this lying propaganda at taxpayers’ expense with its Cabinet Office “Project Vote” operation.But we shouldn’t be surprised. The senior civil service has catastrophically mishandled Brexit all along, finally exposing as self-serving fiction the idea that it is the professional, reliableof the national interest, there to save the nation from the half-baked schemes of here today, gone tomorrow politicians.Yes indeed: “Consider the possibility we are led by idiots.”But now what, you might say. It’s easy to criticise — what would you do Well, I’ve said it before : Pursuing a “deal” with the EU is a waste of time. Of course you can’t stay in the single market but regain control of immigration. Of course you can’t stop paying membership fees but still set the rules. And as President Trump noted, of course you can’t strike new trade deals unless you fully leave.There is no such thing as a “soft Brexit”. There is Brexit, without adjectives — or staying in the EU in some form. “Fulfilling the vote” now requires two things: Preparing for a clean break and counteracting the inevitable short-term disruption.Disgracefully, and cynically, the Government refused to prepare for a clean break over the past two years, so now we are behind. But that doesn’t mean we can’t do it — it just means an all-out effort must be made, andnecessary the exit date pushed back.However solid the preparations, though, there is bound to be economic turbulence. But here too, we can be proactive. The Government could almost instantly make Britain the world’s top destination for business and investment.Slash corporation tax and regulations. Roll out the red carpet for entrepreneurs, scientists, investors. Commit to building the world’s most modern infrastructure and best-trained workforce.Business hates uncertainty more than anything. That is why Theresa May’s deal is a disaster — it prolongs uncertainty.A clean break and a radical pro-enterprise agenda would end uncertainty and counteract the short-term shock of departure.Once we have left, and shown how dynamic post-Brexit Britain can be, we will have much more leverage to negotiate a trade deal with the EU.Objectors will say: This is fantasy — there is no majority in Parliament for a clean break. But there is no majority for anything  either, and in any case, with a clean-break scenario the EU Withdrawal Act does not require a vote that binds the Government.But perhaps the biggest question is: Who can make this happen My idea of bringing back Cameron went down like a lead balloon. After the Rees-Mogg rebellion flopped, we are stuck with Mrs May — evenshe loses on December . No one can see a way out.There is only one answer. Pro-Brexit MPs, inside and outside Cabinet, must develop a spine, step up and unite to offer a positive alternative. Unite to get rid of TheresaMay, then make the case with passion and conviction for a clean break and a radical pro-enterprise programme.Right now, Britain needs leaders.

I do get a lot of sessions in Birmingham, and I get asked to go to Manchester quite often.But London is definitely Britains kinkiest city.There are loads of fetish parties and latex parties in London where people come together and express themselves. You never know what goes on in peoples bedrooms. You only know what they tell you.Sex and relationships expert Lianne Young told Sun Online she wasnt surprised to see that such a erse range of kinks were being indulged behind closed doors.What is amazing is the amount of dferent kinks reaching the top ten. Whoever would have thought latex gloves could be such a turn on  This proves people are starting to be adventurous and content with their sexual appetites.As for why there are so many kink hotspots clustered in the North of the country, Lianne has a theory.In the UK there are more sex establishments up north than down south, she explains. Therefore people up north may be open to more choices of sexual activity. But Id say the whole of the UK is becoming kinkier, as more people become open to the enjoyment of sex.Not once have I heard of anyone experiencing a bad orgasm!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently , or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Other benefits like Carers Allowance, Personal Independent Payments, and Child Benefit are still separate to Universal Credit and wont be part of your lump payment.But the income from that could affect your Universal Credit amount.You might need to book and attend an interview at your local Jobcentre before you get your first payment.Once you have successfully applied and have given all the relevant information, it will take five weeks for your first sum to come through.But you can apply for an advance  you dont feel youll be able to manage financially until that happens. The money you owe will be taken off your UC sum in future months.After youve applied you can sign in to your Universal Credit online account to report changes in circumstances, add notes to your journal, see anything you need to do, and check when your payment is coming."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004506571551-e1543531251522.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jeremy corbyn trying to ruin economy","story":"Just the threat of the lelong Marxist in Downing Street has seen huge amounts of cash leave the UK, and it could be just a taster.We don’t buy the ridiculous Project Fear sequel.But imagine the Bank’s apocalyptic scenario is anywhere half-close to true.Now imagine a Corbyn government committed to massive increases in corporation and income tax, a wealth windfall tax, and nationalising everything within touching distance.Even the Shadow Chancellor has said there’d be a run on the Pound.It’d make even the most chaotic clean break look a walk in the park.People think Venezuela-style destitution could never happen in Britain.

A growing number of other ministers share this concern.Theresa May, of course doesn’t want no deal. She wants Parliament to approve the deal she has negotiated.But, right now, it is hard to see how it passes.The DUP have said they won’t vote for it, denying the Government its majority, and  Tory MPs have declared they will vote against it — ­suggesting the Government is on course for a heavy defeat.“It is increasingly dficult to see what rescues this,” said one of those charged with getting it through.Given thatthe withdrawal agreement is defeated and nothing is put in its place then this country leaves the EU without a deal, it is foolish not to massively intensy planning for that outcome.At every point since the ­referendum, the Government has put off crucial decisions on no-deal planning.This has weakened the UK’s negotiating position and means the UK is now ill-prepared for what Mrs May admits is one of the three most likely outcomes.The situation is so serious that one member of the Privy Council told me this week that the military should be drafted in to help.This former Cabinet minister’s argument was that only the military had the logistical know-how to ensure that ­critical supplies make it all around the country in time.May still hasn’t given up on getting the withdrawal agreement through Parliament.But there is little sign of a decisive sht in her favour.Cabinet ministers are still talking in terms of the scale of defeat, rather than of victory.The expectation among ­ministers is thatMay loses the vote by  or less, she will seek clarication on the ­backstop and then try and bring it back to the Commons.But, as one leading member of the Cabinet warns, May will have to move fast.If she loses the meaningful vote she “could face the  letters and a vote of no confidence in short order”.THE Housing Secretary, James Brokenshire, has scored a ­signicant victory over the Chancellor.Brokenshire wanted to reduce the maximum deposit that renters would have to pay from six weeks’ rent to five.The idea was that this would be fairer on tenants who must find the money for the deposit up front. But Philip Hammond objected.The Chancellor wrote to Cabinet colleagues that “I cannot agree to the proposed concession to lower the deposit cap from six weeks’ rent to five weeks’ rent.“Six weeks’ rent was already placing landlords at risk of uncovered loss for damage to property, as well as risk of loss of rent.“This bill was always a high- risk measure. A cap of six weeks’ rent was already a major concession and I believe we have to hold the line at this level.”However, Hammond’s objections have not carried the day. The Government will now back reducing the deposit cap to five weeks for all but the most expensive properties.One of the Tories’ biggest problems is being seen as the landlords’ party. Hammond himself declares rental income of more than £,.In , the Tories were more popular than Labour among those who rented in the private sector.But at the last election, ­Labour had a -point lead over the Tories among private renters.The Tories won’t win these voters back by dragging their feet on measures that make le easier for tenants.SENIOR Labour figures are plotting a route to an early General Election that doesn’t involve having to get two thirds of the Commons to vote for it.One close ally of Jeremy Corbyn in the Shadow Cabinet tells me that the plan would be to defeat the Government in a confidence motionthe ­Government loses the meaningful vote.The idea would be to persuade the DUP to join with Labour and the other opposition parties in voting against the Government. This would result in a narrow defeat for Theresa May.At that point, the Fixed Term Parliament Act allows  days for the Commons to approve an alternative government.In these circumstances, no government could be approved – the DUP wouldn’t actively put ­Corbyn into No  while no Tory leader could be elected in that time who would meet the DUP’s requirements on the backstop.The result of all this would be that with ­Parliament deadlocked, there would have to be another General Election.How realistic the Labour front bench consider this scenario is crucial. For there is mounting tension in the Shadow Cabinet about whether or not Labour should formally back a second referendum.At the moment, Labour’s policy is to push for a General Election above all .But this week, John McDonnell – the Shadow Chancellor – admitted that securing a General Election was “very dficult” so the party may well back a second referendum instead.TORY party donors have received a letter from party HQ defending the deal that Theresa May has ­negotiated.Attached to the letter is a rather revealing document setting out why “the backstop is needed in all scenarios”.It lists four future scenarios for UK EU relations – a Canada-style trade deal, EEA membership, a UK EU customs union and the UK being in both the customs union and the single market.Three of these four options would be deemed unacceptable by most Brexiteer MPs.WHEN the then Culture Secretary Matt Hancock scrapped Leveson , the next stage of the inquiry into the Press, critics claimed that either Parliament or the courts would force him into a U-turn.But the key votes in the Commons were won, and this week the courts rejected the appeal for a judicial review of the decision.With Labour having gone cold on Section , which would have forced newspapers to sign up to a state regulator or pay both sides’ costs in disputes, the freedom of the Press remains.The challenge now is never to allow it to be threatened in this way again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That weakness has been exploited time after time by EU negotiators.If only they shared the faith of those who voted for a brighter future.The scandalous lack of planning for a clean break, as James Forsyth makes clear on this very page, is a result of the Government only ever looking for pitfalls — rather than grabbing the opportunities that are so obviously out there for a reinvigorated Britain.It’s not too late.

And it took a risky pioneering operation to separate them at six weeks old – with doctors giving them only a million to one chance of survival. Yet while surgical skill managed to physically part the girls, their unbreakable emotional bond has always kept them firmly together. And it’s meant they have only ever spent ONE NIGHT apart. But Zainab and Jannat shyhave now celebrated their th birthday, both knowing that in a couple of years that could change. Twins born in dferent countries claim world record after nearly  years  Because the incredibly bright A* twins are planning to go to dferent universities in pursuit of their dream careers. Zainab is aiming for Cambridge en route to achieving her ambition of being a paediatrician at Great Ormond Street Hospital, where their lives were saved. Jannat is studying three languages and wants to go to Oxford. She plans to become a lawyer and live in France. Zainab said: “Maybe it will be hard, but I guess we have to be independent at some point.” Jannat adds: “People do ask us, ‘Will you be OK ’ I think we will. As we’ve got older we’ve got more confident.” Yet the parents who have watched their little wonders grow up reckon wherever they are, they’ll never be apart. Dad Luther, , said: “I laugh when I hear them say that as I know they will end up in the same place. So I’m not concerned.  “Even though they try so hard to be dferent from each other, they end up doing the same. I strongly believe that’s because they were conjoined. “When they were younger they would sit across a room and smile at each other and laugh, before they could even talk. They’ve always had a deep connection.” Mum Nipa, , spoke of her pride at seeing the girls she once feared might not live turn . She said: “It’s unreal. It feels like yesterday they were babies. They’re thriving and I’m so proud.” Zainab and Jannat were born shyat Homerton Hospital, East London, in , weighing lbs together and sharing a liver – the only organ in the human body that can regenerate. Zainab was healthiest and had  per cent of the liver while Jannat was suffering from a hole in her heart. The prognosis for their survival was not good – but renowned Great Ormond Street surgeons Prof Lewis Spitz and Edward Keily prepared for the op just six weeks after their birth.  Luther said: “The day they took them for the operation I held them and I was crying. My tears fell on to Jannat’s face and she just smiled at me. That smile, I tell her every day, said, ‘Don’t worry I’m coming back’.” And back they came – Jannat went on to have another six operations to fix her bowel and the hole in her heart and was left with a long scar on her chest. The telling and re-telling of their survival is now deep in family folklore. As the girls celebrated their th with a big bash, complete with DJ and  guests, Zainab said: “We grew up with the story of what happened to us. “There wasn’t a day where our parents didn’t mention it. It was only as we got older we realised how complicated everything was and how lucky we were.” The girls says they were five when they first remember seeing pictures of themselves conjoined. Jannat said: “I didn’t think the picture was real. It was so odd seeing something like that. It was weird to see that was us. At primary school people would ask us who is older and we would say ‘we were conjoined’. “But I don’t think we realised what this meant till later.”  Zainab was the louder, more outgoing twin until the girls turned four. They were  before they spent their only night apart from each other. Jannat, who was ill at the time, slept at her nan’s. As they grew, their personalities slowly switched and now Jannat is the more active, energetic one who plays football, cricket, and netball for her school. Zainab meanwhile is the bigger bookworm. Yet they have the same friends, share clothes, finish each other’s sentences and even do their homework together on the same desk.Together they are gearing up to take their GCSEs in the summer and hope to sweep the board with A* grades. Zainab is top of her year for maths. She said: “I’ve been interested in shymedicine for a while. I want to become a paediatrician and work in Great Ormond Street.” Jannat still has to have check-ups on her heart, but has otherwise suffered no ill effects from being the sicker twin. Proud dad Luther can’t wait to see what his girls can achieve. “For me, even to this day to know they are still here with us, is incredible,” he said. “I tell them do whatever you want, achieve what you want. I want to say to other families with sick children not to lose hope. There is always a chance.” "},{"url":null,"title":"celebrations chocolates ranked best worst","story":"NewsCelebrations chocolates ranked from best to worst amid advent calendar rowThere was one clear favourite, although chocolate lovers may be surprised to know that neither Bounty nor Snickers was ranked last despite the advent calendar uproarShareCommentsByChris kitching:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video christmas-characters-come-le-celebrations-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Celebrations advent calendar is a Christmas staple in many homes - but its sparked fury this year with the surprises behind doors No  and .

Dave Fletcher, , thought he had captured a tender childhood moment when he pictured daughter Izzy dozing off at a playground when she was -months-old. But just a few weeks later Dave and we Vicky, , were left devastated at the news their daughters tiredness was a symptom of leukaemia. Dave, an auditor, said he thought nothing of it when he snapped Izzy nodding off in the swing at a park near their home in Claines, Worcs. It was just an afternoon pop out to the swings. She was swinging away - I turned around and she had dropped off. She was drowsy and fell asleep but I didnt think much of it. I thought it was a cute moment and just took a picture of her as you do.  It was only afterwards we realised it was all part of the symptoms and what Id captured was her displaying signs of something more sinister, he said. The youngster has since undergone  doses of gruelling chemotherapy and is now receiving maintenance therapy in a bid to stop the cancer ing. Dad Dave is now warning other parents to be vigilant and look out for the tell-tale signs of the disease. She had been tired, had had a few colds or viruses, and quite a bit of bruising on her legs. But we put all this down to normal childhood bumps and minor illness. You get a bit sentimental, looking at pictures of her before she was ill - you just realise how much shes been through since at so young.  The couple first took Izzy to a GP in January last year after a strange rash appeared on her leg. They were advised to come back several days later for blood teststhe rash had not gone, and to take her straight to hospitalit got worse. However by the next morning, Izzys rash had spread and she then developed a temperature, so her parents took her to Worcester Royal Hospital. She was diagnosed with leukaemia the same day and began a course of chemotherapy the following week.Izzy spent her second birthday in Birmingham Childrens Hospital waiting to have a procedure to sample her bone marrow.  As part of her care, Izzy was enrolled on a clinical trial called UKALL  and will remain on treatment until May next year. This trial aims to seechanging the standard chemotherapy treatment will reduce side effects and help stop their disease from coming back. Dave added: She has grown up very quickly and been subjected to medicine she doesnt like but has taken everything in her stride so far. When she was diagnosed it came out of the blue. We were both in real shock as it happened so fast.It was a big unknown. A family member died of leukaemia five years ago, so it was a scary time. We didnt know what was going to happen at that stage or what the future held. But we were lucky Izzy was diagnosed quickly and lucky she has coped very well with the treatment, suffering very few setbacks or unplanned hospital admissions. The type of leukaemia she has has a better chance of recovery than some others. She is young which helps those odds. It makes us more optimistic. She doesnt have to have so many steroids because of the trial she is on.Its a treatment plan they use in other countries and we are grateful to be given the opportunity.It shows just how important research is in pioneering new treatments. The NHS doctors and nurses have been brilliant. and weve had lots of support from family and friends.  Brave Izzy has now received a Cancer Research UK Kids  Teens Star Award in recognition of what she has been through. Vicky, , an archivist, said: Izzy was so excited to receive her award. It was a nice positive experience that rewarded her for struggling on with her treatment. Jane Redman, spokesperson for Cancer Research UK Kids  Teens in Worcestershire, said: Cancer can have a devastating impact on their lives and many of those who survive may live with serious long-term side effects from their treatment.

An official prison watchdog report has revealed in June last year  Scottish prisoners were unlawfully at large in England, half the  total who had absconded after being liberated on Home Detention Curfewtags. It has been recommended that the practice be suspended until communication with authorities south of the Border are improved. The systems issues came to light following the murder of Craig McCelland in Paisley, the Daily Record reported.The dad-of-three was kned to death by James Wright, , who had avoided the law for six months after destroying his tag before carrying out the random attack.   The murder led the HM Inspectorate of Prisons for Scotlandto order a review of the system in July last year. It said: “Serious consideration should be given to temporarily suspending HDC releases outwith Scotland until a more rigorous communication protocol is developed between the Scottish Prison ServicePolice Scotland and the English authorities in relation to the monitoring and licence revocation process.” The SPS were forced to carry out an overhaul of their procedures. But rather than ending the practice of releasing prisoners to addresses in England, they have instead identied contacts in England and Wales’  police forces. The hope is that English officers will be able to track down offenders for them in areas wherePolice Scotland have no jurisdiction. An SPS response to the HMIPS recommendation added that information would be placed on the National Police Computer and Police Scotland notied of the breach of licence.   Moira Ramage, a former district procurator fiscal and Parole Board for Scotland member, believes Scottish prisoners shouldn’t be allowed to give addresses outside the country for home detention. She said: “A prisoner should have to provide an address in Scotland before being considered for a tag. “They should have to remain in an area where Scottish police can arrest themnecessary.” Neil Bibby MSP added: “Any loopholes in the Home Detention Curfew scheme that could put the public at risk must be closed and closed quickly. “After the tragic murder of Craig McClelland, confidence in HDCs has been badly shaken and the Scottish Government have a responsibility to act quickly and reassure the public.” Scottish Conservative justice spokesman Liam Kerr said: “It shouldn’t be dficult to sort this out, particularly when public safety on both sides of the Border is concerned. “Clearly police here and in England need to get their heads together to come up with a plan.”   Of the  prisoners unlawfully at large in England on June ,  were ed to custody before the HMIPS report was published in October. Notes in the final draft provided by the SPS claimed inquiries on five were pending, while three remained on the run. A small number were back in custody over separate matters. An SPS spokesman said: “Police Scotland don’t have jurisdiction in England but English forces do and they can act on the information that is forthcoming via the Police National Computer, as indeed they have in the past. “The HMIPS recommendation was that a more rigorous communication protocol be put in place and we have done that. The details are in the report.” He added that, over the last  months,  of  prisoners released on home detention had been allowed to go to England and that, in that period, eight who had absconded had been ed to custody. A Scottish Government spokesman said: “Police Scotland and the SPS have worked together to establish a single point of contact in all  police forces in England and Wales, with clear processes for alerting the relevant force and National Probation Service in the event of breach.” "},{"url":null,"title":"how meghan markle dealing relentless","story":"NewsHow Meghan Markle is dealing with relentless rumours about herselfA royal source says Meghan has a very simple way of dealing with ongoing negative publicityShareCommentsByRobyn DarbyshireAudience Writer:,  DEC NewsShe has a coping strategy for bad press \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIts been a tough few weeks for Meghan Markle, whos made the headlines after a slew of royal aides, insiders and sources have come forward.

It is believed the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will spend Christmas with the royals at Sandringham.Kate, William and their children, meanwhile, are reportedly planning to spend the festive season at the Middleton family mansion in Berkshire.There have been recent rumours of a rt between William, Harry and their wives.Meghan and Harry recently unveiled plans to move out of Kensington Palace - where the Cambridges also live - and set up home in Windsor instead.There are also recent reports of a ghastly row between Meghan and Kate, which sparked the current feud. Kates mum Carole confirmed in her first ever interview this weekend that she has planned a less formal Christmas day for her children and grandchildren, suggesting William, Kate, George, Charlotte and Louis will join them on December .Instead of following the strict schedule of a formal church visit and an extravagant lunch served up by the royal butlers, Caroles essentials are mince pies, mulled wine and mistletoe.  A royal aide reportedly said about the ghastly row that drove a wedge between the royal couples: Kate had a quiet word with Meghan. It escalated rapidly after Meghan complained to Harry that she had been told off. He took her side, while William defended Kate, who was five months pregnant with Louis and certainly didn’t want this sort of confrontation. Prince Charles had engineered a get-together between the two couples at Kate and Williams country home after Meghan felt she didnt feel welcome with all members of the royal family.  The rumoured fall-out did not blow over in the lead up to the Duke and Duchess of Sussexs wedding at St Georges Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle, on May . Kate was reportedly reduced to tears following a bridesmaid fitting for daughter Charlotte. Meghan, who is expecting her first child with Prince Harry in Spring next year, may now have to work harder to build bridges with Kate and William. But the rt may not be fixed anytime soon, as she and Harry are moving away from Kensington Palace, the home and office space they share with William and Kate, to Frogmore Cottage in the grounds of Windsor Castle.

Suddenly you are reading such hurtful stories about you, Harry and your alleged dwindling relationship with the shyCambridges. You probably feel like shycurling up and refusing to go out. This souring of the goodwill that first embraced you must be devastating. They don’t do this to celebrities in America. But we Brits are deadly at shyturning against those we consider too successful. You are gorgeous, slim, poised, articulate, socially active, a visibly loving we and – wow – you’re pregnant. We Brits hate all that goody two shoes stuff. Now we’re pitting you against the last person we did it to, Kate. For years she was the apple of our eye. Her royal wedding was a celebration of her perfection as the woman destined, nay designed by a reportedly ambitious mother, to be queen.  But, oh dear, once she appeared shycomfortable on that pedestal, we so shyenjoyed trying to knock her off. Someone referred to her as “Her Royal Thinness” and so started the gossip about whether she was anorexic, stressed, burned out. Then there were horrid shyrumours about having pushy parents. So let’s look at what they’re saying about you right now. Possibly the most toxic quote that has taken root is what Prince Harry is rumoured to have said. “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.” It sounds like you stamp your little foot and make outrageous demands. What about upstaging Princess shyEu-genie’s wedding by announcing your pregnancy  Or the rt that is meant to have developed between you and Kate  I think to be a royal in modern Britain, you need a much tougher hide than any celebrity film star in Hollywood. What you have to do, Meghan, is ignore it. We don’t really knowany of it is true. I hope it isn’t. I suspect you and Harry want your own space.  Many, many royal couples before you have said how claustrophobic is the shyatmosphere of Kensington Palace. No wonder you want to move out to your own space, in Frogmore House. How many of us could live that close to our family, no matter how posh the surroundings or how many rooms  Another thing you have to understand about Brits is our newspapers claim they reflect what the people think. shyReaders often say they think dferently. You will have to judge for yourself whether this anti-Meghan onslaught is tittle-tattle or true public feeling. Only you can test that barometer. I’ve already met a few of the people you’ve met, and you made their day. So don’t let us get to you. Plough your own furrow. That’s Brit for “do your own thing”. We’ll come around to you again.

However, the breed do suffer from a number of health problems as a result of their beefcake bodies.Pregnancies can be dficult and calves often have to be delivered via c-section.The calves often suffer from birth defects, such as enlarged tongues, which makes it dficult for them to feed from their mother.As oversized cows continue to hit the headlines, a farmer in Canada has claimed his steer is even bigger than Aussie beast Knickers.

If you stood next to him he’ll just lay down next to you.”  Although both Dozer and Knickers have been described as cows, they are in fact steers - a male bovine that has been neutered. The term cow refers to female cattle who have had a calf. As we previously reported, Knickers, who weighs a whopping st, eats more than kg of grass and grain each day.

Despite the massive investment, Showcase is keeping prices at a minimum to ensure as many people as possible can enjoy the gadgets on offer.One-hour sessions for up to three people are £, while up to  people can play for two hours for £, including food.Fergus Storrier, director of Showcase the Street, said the VR facilities were about more than giving underprivileged children access to computer games.“It has been a real community effort – like everything we do,” he said.“We’ve had Adam Milroy and Ian Tayac in to do the graffiti art on the walls – they do all of that type of art for us.“We’re already working with Abertay on a project to create a VR game that aims to improve people’s employability skills.”Showcase VR opens next week.

It’s a career decision so I am not going to rush into anything.“When I first started getting in the Dundee first team this season, the Socceroos came to one of my games and that was a big positive for me because I hadn’t been playing that long.“I will see how it plays out but it’s not something I expected to be thinking about right now. It’s great for me and, hopefully, I can just keep progressing.”Lightning quick on the pitch, when asked which of the countries would be his first choice, he shows he’s not slow either when it comes to coming up with a diplomatic answer.“I don’t really want to say. I’m from Australia and was brought up there so it would, obviously, be good to play from them.“But my dad is Scottish and my mum’s from the Philippines so they matter to me as well.“I just have to see who,anyone, comes for me and then take things from there.”The good news for Dark Blues fans is he’s fully focused on their team right now and helping with the fight to climb off the bottom of the top flight.And he’s convinced that draw at Hibs was the strongest evidence yet, in terms of both commitment and quality, Dundee have what it takes to do that.“To come back from - down to - is a great positive for us.“It was good, especially at a place like Easter Road because when Hibs get ahead they can control the game.“We had the chances to go and win the game, to be fair both teams did, so it was quite an entertaining game and it was a good game to play in.“Just a couple of balls in the final third let us down but we’ll work on that.“Obviously, St Mirren won at the weekend and the gap is three points but we are going to look at our performance and will keep working hard to make sure that’s how we play. We have to concentrate on ourselves.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b62caca727d8.jpg ","title":"dundee united to offer christmas day meal at tannadice to 120 lonely city folk","story":"Dundee United are offering a free Christmas Day meal to  lonely city residents.The Dundee United Community Trust is this year opening up the doors of Tannadice to local residents who may otherwise be on their own.The trust is working with The Ambassador pub in Clepington Road to extend the festivities, with more food and activities planned into the afternoon with the event running from am to pm on December .A club statement said: #We are also working on transport to assist with getting our guests to and from the event.#There are still places left and we would really encourage you to get in touchyou know of anyone who would benefit from coming along. Perhaps a neighbour or family friend who doesn’t get out much.#The community trust would also welcome donations from businesses or iniduals of gts that we can give to our guests to give them a fantastic Christmas Day.#Festive Friends is the result of cash raised from the Team DUCT Kiltwalkers earlier in the year and funding from the SPFL Trust.Should you wish to donate a gt, email the community trust at michael.malone@dundeeunitedct."},{"url":null,"title":"ex dundee midfielder nick ross going loco with us move in bid for mls promotion","story":"Former Dundee midfielder Nick Ross hopes his move to American second-tier side El Paso Locomotive can provide a lucrative stepping stone to Major League Soccer.After ending a short stint with Brora Rangers, Ross sealed a move to the newly-formed Texas outfit yesterday on a one-year contract with the option of a further year.The -year-old will report for pre-season with El Paso in January as the club prepares for its  debut in the USL Championship.Although no promotion to the ring-fenced MLS is available, former Scotland U  international Ross hopes making an impression at his new club may catch the eye of clubs higher up the American ladder.Ross said: “I’m just looking forward to getting over and seeing how the year goes.“If I play well over there the target is to get into the MLS but that’s everybody’s target so it’s not that easy.There are a lot of good teams at this level.

He was leaning over me and it was at this point I decided to stop breathing and play dead.“I took myself somewhere  and at that point I felt peaceful and had no pain.

But on the day we scored two in the first half, Eric Black and Billy Stark.“I was involved in the third one.

It’s always something I’ve been desperate to do here. We’ve come mightily close on a number of occasions and it makes you hungrier to get it.”Despite his abiding hope the Reds can get over the finishing line at Hampden, Shinnie says it isn’t a case of the Dons expecting to win trophies.Semi-finals and finals, yes. But he says going all the way is a journey littered with pitfalls.Shinnie said: “I don’t overly expect to win trophies.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13662436.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS168584632.jpg","title":"ayrshire sands mark 30 years","story":"NewsAyrshire SANDS mark  years of support and prepare for Christmas bauble serviceThe voluntary group has been offering an invaluable support network to bereaved parents across the county for three decades.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsSANDS team Marion Boyd, Jenner Stamp, Sarah Spiers and Alison McNeil \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThat they are needed at all is a matter of huge regret. But to those within Ayrshire SANDS, a common bond and desire to unite burns bright. Behind this voluntary group for bereaved parents lies many a heartbreaking story. The Stillbirth and Neonatal Death organisation is there, in the first instance, to reach out to those in desperate pain. As a support network, mums and dads who have been in the darkest of places are often the very people best placed to act as rocks for those perishing behind them. But back in , when the Ayrshire branch of this inspiring group formed, few could have imagined the size of their task  years on. Local chair, Marion Boyd, explains: “Our first meeting had only a handful of parents and the whole topic of losing a baby was very taboo. “Thankfully the world has changed a lot since then, and people have become far more open about their loss. “But there’s no doubt that back then, you were not encouraged to speak about it.” For newly grieving mums like Marion, having a place to turn was not in the script of the s. And her experience – along with those of many others – has helped drive the st century changes to hospital support.  Marion, , said: “I had to share a room with another mum who had just given birth. “Watching her push her baby around and hear the cries of a newborn was heartbreaking. “But that was the reality back in those days. “It was almost like you had to dust yourself down and get back to normal as soon as possible. “Then there were the people who wouldn’t know what to say to you...so they’d maybe say nothing at all.” Marion and fellow committee members in the Ayrshire branch of the SANDS group are among Britain’s longest serving. Along with fellow parents, they have raised thousands during the intervening three decades and made friends through their grief. New facilities, latterly built at the Ayrshire maternity unit in Crosshouse, now give newly grieving parents their own space – with SANDS instrumental in their set-up. Treasurer Alison McNeil, , said: “Each of us has our own personal story which brought us together, and obviously they are very sad. “But through the years a special bond has grown between so many of the parents here. “Some of us have become friends for le and we’re just glad we can be here to offer support to others now. “But one stillbirth or neonatal death is one too many and it’s a sad reality that our group continues to grow like it does.” From the handful that began the journey in , so many more have passed through the hands of Ayrshire SANDS since then. And on Sunday, hundreds will attend the group’s annual bauble service at Prestwick’s St Nicholas Church. And such is the growing need for the team, they even have their own social media officer. Mum Sarah Speirs, , added: “The best thing is that nobody will judge you. “Ultimately, the only person who can truly understand what it’s like to lose a child is another parent who’s experienced the same thing.” And Marion said: “We were very keen from the outset that we had NHS involvement in the group. “We have an office on site at Crosshouse and work closely with midwives. “Perhaps they could have been wary of us at first, thinking that some parents would want to criticise them. “But they quickly realised that we are all here for the same thing and it’s a relationship that has worked very well. “Ideally the need for our group wouldn’t be there at all, but we’re just glad it can do some good.” •Parents wishing to attend Sunday’s service can bring their own bauble to hang on the Christmas tree.

Whilst providing a first-class service to her clients and the long hours spent in the office, Margo manages to achieve the perfect work-le balance for her family. This is one of the many reasons that she is one of just three finalists for Solicitor of the Year at the Law Awards of Scotland . The ceremony is this Thursdayat the Hilton in Glasgow. Growing up on the family farm in Maybole, Margo has been involved in agriculture since a young age and knew that her career path would lead her into the agricultural industry. Starting her legal career in the city, Margo worked at MacLay, Murray and Spens in Glasgow before moving closer to home at Howat’s Associates in Mauchline, to spend more time with her husband and two sons. Margo then moved to become a Partner at Lockharts in Ayr, and now heads up their Agricultural and Estates Team. Margo was nominated by one of her long-standing clients and will be attending the Awards. Her firm Lockharts are presently rebranding their office and operation at Beresford Terrace. Peter Lockhart told the Post: “The Partners and staff are proud of Margo. This is particularly so, given the two other finalists are high profile City Centre Lawyers.

It follows a kne attacker plunging terror through the health network at the Ailsa Hospital. The wooly-hatted suspect remains at large after escaping past CCTV cameras switched off for  years. Community worker Donna Maxwell, , was stabbed en route to her car on Thursday morning. Now the Post can reveal cameras are also out of order at Girvan Community Hospital – a building shared by the town’s police. Police are still hunting the Ailsa suspect, understood to be a patient at the unit. But they have been forced to launch a desperate appeal for dashcam footage caught on nearby motors. The frantic search has failed to produce a result – despite the alleged culprit being known to Ailsa staff.  One NHS source told the Post: “The woman who did this is no stranger to staff at the hospital. “She had requested to speak to a particular person on Thursday and was told they weren’t there. “That seemed to agitate her and when she got outside she carried out this random attack in the car park. “Luckily she didn’t get any of Donna’s vital organs or this could have been a whole lot worse.” Mum-of-one, Donna, of Irvine, is believed to have stumbled back into the Ailsa after the attack. She was transferred to nearby Ayr Hospital for treatment. Both the Ailsa and Ayr Hospital were put on lockdown as police dog teams raced to the scene and a force chopper circled the skies. And despite an arrest on an “unrelated matter” being made later that night, police admitted on Tuesday the suspect had not been caught. A force spokeswoman said: “There has been no arrest and inquiries are ongoing.” Donna, who was released from hospital on Friday, is now recovering at home.  Husband Tom, , said: “She is very tired and sore. Everything is a bit raw at the moment. “We have been asked by the police not to say anything about what happened or make any comment.” Now a furious union claims staff and patients have been “misled” by NHS bosses over cameras being turned off. UNISON President Gordon McKay, who worked at Ailsa Hospital for many years, said: “Our first thoughts are for the member of staff and her family. “It is shocking that someone who is dedicated to providing high-quality healthcare to the people of Scotland should be attacked at work. “In the longer term, serious questions need to be asked and answered by senior management of NHS Ayrshire and Arran over why it would appear they were leading patients, relatives and staff in the hospital to believe that CCTV was operating as a safety measure when they knew it wasn’t. “Anyone who takes a decision which misleads people about safety matters must be held to account.” When pressed by this paper, NHS chiefs insisted cameras at all of Ayrshire’s major sites were in working order. However, they were forced to concede cameras at Girvan were “working but not currently recording”. And a spokeswoman admitted: “The analogue CCTV system at Ailsa Hospital has not been operational for a number of years. “We have an ongoing review of how to make best use of CCTV across all our sites.” Scotland’s health secretary, Jeane Freeman, has the hospital within her Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley constituency. She said: “The Scottish Government has been in constant contact with NHS Ayrshire and Arran throughout recent days, and has offered any support that might be required. “The Health Resilience team has also been in touch regarding the site CCTV system. “As the MSP covering the Ayr Ailsa Hospital campus, I have contacted the management of NHS Ayrshire and Arran to seek their assurances that they’re taking all reasonable steps to protect the safety both staff and patients.” Police say the suspect is about ft in to ft in tall and aged -.

Scores of jobs are under threat as bosses battle to save its future. Senior sources say at least  full time posts face the axe amid a financial crisis.  Staff have been given the stark warning by outgoing Principal, Heather Dunk. It comes as the college leaks cash on a costly PFI deal for its campus at Kilwinning. A source said: “Mrs Dunk announced to staff that the college will run out of money in a few short years. “She blamed this entirely on the funding council, the Scottish Government and the PFI at Kilwinning. “In a blatant attempt to essentially threaten staff against pursuing the cost-of-living pay rise, she made clear that at least  full time jobs would need to go to pay to keep the college afloat.” The warning comes as Mrs Dunk prepares to step down in the Spring. And a row has engulfed management as they prepare to appoint her successor. We told last week how the recruitment agency leading the search includes the we of college chair, Willie Mackie. A College spokesman said: “The Principal recently met with all staff to provide an update regarding the financial challenges facing the college due to increased staff costs arising from national bargaining and the excessive costs of the PfI campus in Kilwinning. “The College is working with the Scottish Funding Council to find a solution to the dficult financial position, however,additional funding is not available, the outcome may be the loss of jobs to reduce expenditure. “The Principal continues to update the trade unions, the student association and staff on a regular basis to ensure openness and transparency. “All staff are aware of the challenges the Colleges faces and have contributed to a consultation regarding potential efficiencies and opportunities for income generation.” Ayr MSP, John Scott, wants to see the college backed by the Scottish Government until the end of its PFI contract. But he said: “Unfortunately, the response I have so far received from the Scottish Government to this request has been negative. “But I will continue to argue the case for additional funding to be allocated to the College in order that their ongoing commitments can be met and the loss of staff avoided.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"famous tower blocks almost certain","story":"NewsFamous tower blocks almost certain to be flattenedThe trio of -storey Riverside Place towers have been a landmark since .ShareByStephen Houston:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsThe only towers in South Ayrshire are doomed \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr’s famous tower blocks are almost certainly to be flattened after a repair bill landed for up to pound MILLION of work. The astonishing figure - which works out at pound, for each flat - is being seen as hopeless to fund. The trio of -storey Riverside Place towers have been a landmark since .   Their destruction will mean the loss of  one-bedroom flats and tenants will have to be farmed out to new homes. An insider at owners South Ayrshire Council said: “The price is too high and unless there is a money miracle, they will come down. “Officials have been taken aback at how much money they need. To save them would be financially ridiculous.” Ironically the council has already sanctioned pound million worth of initial work which has already begun. Housing staff say that to build a brand new flat either on the same riverside site or where in the area is just pound,. Each of the blocks has  homes and  have been deliberately left empty as the scale of repair emerged. One-to-one consultation is to take place with the tenants - most of whom are elderly - over the next six months. Councillors heard about the state of the “essential and advisable” works at a meeting yesterday . These include the removal of the external cladding, existing timber and aluminium windows, and pitched roof covering new insulated render system full rewiring new heating and hot water systems upgrading the sprinkler system and upgrading passenger lts. One long-time tenant told the Post: “If it is going to cost about pound, to build a new flat for me to rent, I have a money saving plan. “Give me pound, and I’ll buy my own we place in Ayr. Job done.” If repairs were sanctioned tenants would need to be decanted for a year. Housing boss Donald Gillies said: “As we consider what happens next with the high flats in Ayr, our tenants will continue to be our focus at all times. That’s why we’re asking councillors to approve a formal consultation where we can sit down on an inidual basis with each and every one of our tenants in Riverside Place and discuss their specic needs and preferences. “If Councillors agree, we’re also seeking approval to appoint two dedicated officers to lead on the consultation and engagement exercise, which would get underway in the new year with a further report to Councillors in June. “It would only be then that any decision on the future of the flats would be taken and tenants would be involved in discussions every step of the way.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13663409.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_231118pets_04JPG.jpg","title":"hopping mad mauchline miss doolittle","story":"NewsHopping mad Mauchline Miss Doolittle issues Christmas pleaPoppy Wyllie owns a whopping  bunnies so she knows a thing or two about caring for them.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  NOV NewsPoppy with guinea pals Ginny and Delilah and cabbage-eating rabbit Jasper. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA hopping mad seven-year-old is warning others that rabbits are pets for le and not just Christmas.

councils as community assets.In Melrose, the research revealed that Melrose Town Hall, currently known as the Scout Hall, was gted to the Burgh of Melrose in .The title deeds contain a typical common

However, the access to the fort does not form part of the common good asset.The ground on which the High Street toilet has been constructed was gted to the burgh in , with no purpose of acquisition stated.

People work and pay a lot of taxes and we are fed up, said Rabah Mendez, a protester who marched peacefully on Saturday in Paris.Speaking in Buenos Aires before he flew home to Paris, Mr Macron said he welcomed the views of protesters but vowed that those who participated in wreaking havoc would be held responsible for their behaviour.ldquo has nothing to do with the peaceful expression of a legitimate anger and ldquono cause justies attacks on police or pillaging stores and burning buildings, Mr Macron said."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/8557015.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"indian-takeaway-near-glasgow-named-best-in-britain","story":"Mushtaqs Restaurant, in Hamilton, walked away with the top accolade at a glittering ceremony in London.Over , VIP guests attended a gala dinner at the Grosvenor House Hotel to honour the winners at the Asian Curry Awards.FIRST LOOK: World-famous restaurant gears up for Glasgow opening after sudden closure of CarlucciosThe awards were co-hosted by BBC TV presenter Babita Sharma and Tommy Sandhu from the BBC Radio Asian Network.Mushtaqs, on Almada Street, is officially the biggest takeaway operation and was featured on BBCrsquos Best of British Takeaways.Mushtaqs in HamiltonHead chef Ajmal Mushtaq was crowned Scotlandrsquos Chef of the Year at the Food Awards Scotland in August last year where he beat off competition from the best fine dining and Michelin trained chefs in the country.He said: ldquoIt was overwhelming when it was announced that we had won the title of being the Best Takeaway in Britain.:City Centre basement bar shuts its doors to customers before ChristmasldquoThis is great news for Hamilton and we are just honoured to have put Hamilton on the culinary map once again.ldquoWe are really grateful for the love and support we have received from the people of Hamilton ndash they are the best.:Mystery as massive Glasgow City Centre BBQ restaurant suddenly shutsldquoMy wonderful team deserve this great award.There is an incredible amount of hard work, skill and quality control that goes into making every meal the very best it can be and for Mushtaqs to be recognised at the highest level was a great achievement.Best Maicirctre Drsquo went to Mohammed Sultan of Charcoals on Renfield Street."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-15-best-cosy-coffee-shops","story":".

After being promised wealth on buses, we face hardship on stilts. And after hammering warnings of No Deal to get her own way, Theresa May has invalidated No Deal by mistake.In the last week, wersquove seen the UK Government warning No Deal could lop % off GDP by  relative to our current economic trajectory. Security minister Ben Wallace said No Deal could put the country at greater risk of crime and terrorism. And Scottish Secretary David Mundell doubled down on his claim that No Deal would be ldquocatastrophic for the Union.So dire have been the worst-case scenarios that MPs have united to block No Deal. The apocalypse appears to have been cancelled.Mrs May also made the ldquonational interest her yardstick on Brexit. But in what circumstances would the national interest be best served by No Deal  How could she argue it would be in the national interest to enter recession, choke the ports, disrupt the food supply chain, upend industry, risk social unrest, and jeopardise her precious Union, as her own cabinet has warned She has killed off her bogeyman. Instead of No Deal warnings making it more likely MPs will back her deal, it has made them more likely to reject it, as they no longer feel a chaotic exit hanging over them.They now reckon they have more space to explore other options - a softer Norway-style Brexit with single market and customs union membership is the current favourite, or a Peoplersquos Vote, the option increasingly favoured by Labour.Some politicians point out that, although Mrs May and the EU say the current deal is the only one on offer, it is more accurate to say it is the only negotiated deal. That doesnrsquot mean itrsquos the only option. Off-the-shelf plans, such as EFTA membership, are out there too.Nicola Sturgeon always said it was a ldquo choice between Mrs Mayrsquos deal and No Deal, and Mrs May and cabinet have proved it. Brexit is rich with unintended consequences.Another unintended consequence applies to Ms Sturgeon. The First Minister recently announced her MPs would vote in favour of a Peoplersquos Votegiven the chance. It was not a universally popular idea.Pete Wishart, the longest serving SNP MP, warned it could work against the independence cause, setting a precedent that could see Unionists demand a re-run of a referendum ending in a Yes vote.Alex Salmond raised the same point on his TV show last month.Irsquom not sure about this argument. The SNP conceded the principle that referendums can be rerun as soon as it lost the  vote. ldquoThe dream shall never die, as Mr Salmond said in his resignation. Then Ms Sturgeon called a second referendum in March  over Brexit to reverse the No vote.The argument seems more about timing than principle about how long to wait before voters will put up with another referendum.But there is a more pressing aspect to Ms Sturgeon supporting a Peoplersquos Vote. If her MPs back it, they will be voting against another independence referendum. Not directly, of course. But the former would surely preclude the latter.Imagine the Prime Minister is defeated on December  and the upshot, after much wailing and gnashing of dentistry, is that MPs decide to palm the mess off onto you and me. Sorry, I mean trust the people to decide what to do next. This would not be a speedy process.The EU would have to agree to extend the Article  process by a year or more to put Brexit on ice. Another referendum means a bespoke Bill going through Westminster. The last one took seven months. A second referendum Bill would be resisted at every turn by apoplectic Brexiteers. There would be a furious debate about what would be on the ballot paper.Would it be a choice between Leave and Remain again  Or a multiple choice  Perhaps the UK governmentrsquos deal versus a dferent deal , staying in the EU or a sod-it No Deal.If it was first-past-the-post, the winner would almost certainly get less than the % that gave Leave victory in . Imagine the stink that would cause. If it was decided by proportional representation, transfers might see most peoplersquos second choice come out on top. That doesnrsquot sound like a recipe for clarity and contentment either.The Electoral Commission would need weeks to mull it over. There would then be another four months of campaigning, and a potentially long and messy aftermath.The process could be doubly confused by a Tory leadership contest and a winner shting the government position mid-stream.This would all take time, time Ms Sturgeon doesnrsquot haveshe wants a second referendum before her ldquocast-iron mandate runs out in .As Irsquove written before, the First Minister has to make a call on Indyref by mid-it is happen in this parliament, because of legislation and campaign time. Butthere was a second EU vote she would have to wait till that was over, and by then it would be too late.She canrsquot have two referendums running at once. That would be a dogrsquos dinner. But nor can she have one after the other because therersquos not enough time for both by .The Scottish Tories claimed this week that Ms Sturgeon is backing a Peoplersquos Vote to cause chaos and boost the prospects of the Yes movement. But Irsquod say a Peoplersquos Vote is more likely to stall the Yes movement, at least for a few years.Faced with this choice between two referendums, I wonder how SNP MPs will vote in the end."},{"url":null,"title":"prestwick-under-pressure-after-advertising-jobs-below-real-living-wage","story":"But five years on, Glasgow Prestwick Airport is under fresh pressure after it emerged it is still advertising jobs which fail to pay the real living wage, despite Nicola Sturgeon urging all employers to do so.Opponents have now accused Ms Sturgeon of ldquorank hypocrisy after she criticised the Ministry of Defence for paying more than  civilian staff less than the living wage during First Ministerrsquos Questions on Thursday.She said: ldquoThe MoD and all Government agencies should pay the real living wage.

It is also a ldquoersionary airport capable of dealing with planes experiencing security risks.A police source said the reduction was likely down to low passenger numbers, adding: ldquoCops are not there to protect the premises ndash thatrsquos the role of security. They are there for protecting passengers.The Scottish Government bought the Ayrshire site in November . The airport has since been handed more than pound million in loans despite continuing to make losses.Its accounts say this funding will continue for the ldquoforeseeable, but turnover is increasing. Meanwhile, extra revenue has come from fuelling aircraft.This is ldquoprimarily due to military activities on the back of being awarded a contract in October  with the Defense Logistics Agency, a combat support agency in the United States Department of Defense.However both Edinburgh and Glasgow airports claim Prestwickrsquos public subsidy has ldquodistorted the market, and bosses previously admitted it would be forced to shutasked to repay its loans.A Scottish Government spokeswoman said Prestwick was operated at armrsquosndash but signalled unhappiness over its continued failure to pay

I just wanted a job I enjoyed, and I love what I do now. Irsquove tried to find a middle ground between fish and chips and fine dining seafood. There was just nobody doing seafood street food before.

Itrsquos great to see so many people coming along and trying foods that they wouldnrsquot normally try. Because theyrsquore not in a dedicated restaurant they can dip in and out. I do feel that people are trying new things here.ldquoFor people that havenrsquot tried it, I would say to them to come in a big group, or as a family, have a drink and make it an event. The dining experience these days is you go for a meal and yoursquore out within an hour.

Mr Trump has criticised the WTO and adopted aggressive trade policies targeting China and the European Union.ndash US-China trade warFinancial markets will be cheered by the announcement that Mr Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed at a dinner after the summit to have a -day truce in their trade battle.Mr Trump agreed to hold off on plans to raise tarfs on January  on  billion dollars in Chinese goods. Mr Xi agreed to buy a ldquonot yet agreed upon, but very substantial amount of agricultural, energy, industrial and other products from the United States to reduce Americarsquos huge trade deficit with China, the White House said.The ceasefire will buy time for the two countries to work out their dferences in a dispute over Beijingrsquos aggressive drive to supplant US technological dominance.ndash Prince under pressureThere were some awkward moments for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as some leaders called him out over the gruesome October killing of dissident Saudi newspaper columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the countryrsquos consulate in Istanbul.French President Emmanuel Macron was captured on video seemingly lecturing Mr bin Salman, at one point being heard saying ldquoI am worried, ldquoyou never listen to me, and ldquoI am a man of my word. Mr Macron said the crown prince only ldquotook note of his concerns.British Prime Minister Theresa May also said she pressed Mr bin Salman.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was the only G leader to raise the issue during the official session. Mr Erdogan called Mr bin Salmanrsquos response ndash that the crime had not been proven ndash ldquounbelievable and complained that Saudi authorities have been unco-operative.But it was not all bad for Mr bin Salman. He was not shunned, and on the gatheringrsquos first day, he and Russian President Vladimir Putin engaged in a hearty grip-and-grin as the two seemingly revelled in their shared status as relative outcasts.US intelligence agencies concluded the Saudi prince was behind the killing. Saudi Arabia denies he played a role.ndash Ukraine conflictWestern leaders confronted Mr Putin over Russiarsquos recent seizure of Ukrainian naval vessels and crews, but the diplomatic pressure did not seem to bring either side closer to solving the conflict. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of being responsible for the standoff.Mr Trump cited Russiarsquos actions as the reason that he cancelled a planned meeting with Mr Putin on the sidelines of the summit. EU Council president Donald Tusk sharply criticised ldquoRussiarsquos aggression against Ukraine.Mr Putin tried to convince Mr Trump and the leaders of France and Germany that Russiarsquos actions were justied ndash even pulling out a piece of paper and drawing a map of the disputed area to make his point.ndash Climate changeThe final communique signed by all  member nations said  of them reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris climate accord. The only holdout was the US, which has withdrawn from the pact under Mr Trump.Still, environmental groups praised the statement as welcome news.ldquoThat G leaders signed up to the Paris Agreement reaffirmed their commitment to its full implementation in the resulting communique is important, the World Wildle Fund said. ldquoIt is also a reflection of the Argentinian government rightly making climate an important topic on the agenda.Greenpeace said that ldquothe necessity of the US being part of the effort to fight climate change cannot be denied, but this is a demonstration that the US is still the odd one out.ndash NAFTAAfter two years of negotiations, Mr Trump signed a revised North American trade pact with the leaders of Canada and Mexico on the sidelines of the summit. The deal is meant to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement , which Mr Trump long denigrated as a ldquodisaster.The new pact will not take effect unless approved by the legislatures of all three nations, and there are questions about the pactrsquos prospects in the US Congress, especially now that Democrats will control the House. Democrats and their allies in the labour movement are already demanding changes.But Mr Trump said on the way back to Washington that he plans to formally terminate NAFTA, so Congress will have to choose between accepting the new pact or going without a trade accord.ndash Low expectations ndash low outputEven the host country had lowered expectations ahead of the summit, saying before the gathering started that it might not be possible to reach a consensus for a final statement.After sleepless days of round-the-clock talks by diplomats, a communique was produced, but analysts said leaders merely signed a watered down statement that skirted trade and other contentious issues.ldquoThe G veered all over the road at the summit and the leaders failed to fix trade, which is widely seen as a priority for boosting growth in jobs and economies, said Thomas Bernes, a distinguished fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation who has held leading roles with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and Canadarsquos government.ldquoLeaders buried their dferences in obscure language and dropped language to fight protectionism, which had been included in every G communique since the leadersrsquo first summit. This is clearly a retrograde step forced by United States intransigence, Mr Bernes said."},{"url":null,"title":"charity night at jewellers","story":"An Inverurie family-owned business hosted a charity Christmas shopping night recently.Sinclairs the jewellers held the event in support of local children’s charity Charlie House.The business welcomed over  people to the store for an evening of Christmas shopping, fizz, canapes, music, prizes and special offers.All ticket proceeds from the event were donated to Aberdeen-based children’s charity Charlie House, which supports babies, children and young people with complex disabilities and le-limiting conditions.The event raised over £.

These concerns were echoed by the group of experts giving evidence to the Committee this morning.Speaking after the committee meeting, Mr McArthur said: “Today’s evidence session left no doubt at all that the Scottish Government is now isolated over its approach to tackle fuel poverty in rural and island areas. It is increasingly clear that Ministers will have to think again and ensure their proposals are properly #island proofed#.“In a desperate move yesterday evening, the Housing Minister issued a briefing to MSPs seeking to justy his decision not to include a rural Minimum Income Standard in the revised definition of rural fuel poverty.  This attempt by the Minister to get his retaliation in first backfired, however, as the Committee heard again today how this approach flies in the face of all the advice.“The Rural Fuel Poverty Task Force, the government’s own Independent Panel of Advisers and every organisation across the Highlands  Islands involved in housing and fuel poverty have made plain that excluding a rural MIS risks support not going to the people and communities who need it. As a result, the government’s own targets for combatting fuel poverty across the country will be undermined.“While fuel poverty is not simply an island issue, all the evidence shows that it affects rural and island communities more than others. Hopefully, today’s committee evidence session will persuade ministers to think again. If not, it will be up to parliament to force the government to do the right thing”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Golspie is operational   three days a week.\"The writer states that the letter represents the feelings of paramedics and technicians in Easter Ross, and they are calling for six more staff to make Alness and Tain   and ldquogive the residents of Easter Ross a fighting chance in their hour of need\".The Scottish Ambulance Service hit back however. A spokesman said: ldquoThe claims are untrue. We have ambulances working a   sht at Dingwall, Golspie, Lairg, Wick and Thurso ndash a crew is also available at either Tain or Alness stations and often both at the same time, depending on sht patterns.ldquoPatients in this part of Scotland can also rely on the air ambulance helicopter, a team of emergency response doctors based in Tain, Dornoch and Dingwall, and our teams of community first responders to provide an emergency response within a matter of minutes.ldquoWe closely and continuously monitor our staffing levels, through our demand and capacity review, to ensure we can provide safe patient care in all parts of Scotland and continue to invest in our workforce.Contacted for comment, Highlands and Islands Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said: ldquoStaff have raised concerns with me which I in turn have raised with the ambulance service. I believe that we do require more ambulance resources throughout the Highlands and Islands.ldquoCrews have to travel long distances to transfer patients and with specialist services becoming more centralised that will only increase.ldquoIt is right that crews who are fatigued sign off and ideally we should have more stations covered without the use of on call staff, who are in greater danger of becoming fatiguedthey have already undertaken a long transfer.ldquoI know from SAS that they are using Inverness crews to do some of these transfers where that is clinically safe.ldquoObviously in an emergency the nearest crew must respond. Sadly the whole of our public sector is suffering from the impact of funding cuts and we must now end austerity and fund the le line services that our people need.Share your views by emailing us at newsdesk@spp-groupSunday  Dec  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The pair of Sir Knights enjoyed their first mock battle between King William and King James, in their respective roles, during the summer.Craig, from Richhill, admits the Scarva showpiece is a particular personal highlight, having assumed such office.He said: “I enjoy the interaction and opportunity to meet other people. We were fortunate to have been invited by the outgoing Lord Mayor to launch the Thirteenth, and promote our official charity. It is very rewarding to walk in front of the banner at Scarva, after months of planning, seeing all the spectators and Sir Knights enjoying themselves, with preferably nice weather!”The project coordinator, who only recently got married, acknowledges the extra responsibility of preparing for one of the flagship events of the parading season.“There’s a lot of meetings! We liaise with ious stakeholders in order to make the day possible, which means a lot of evenings are taken up, especially the closer we get to July. I must admit, I didnt appreciate the work that goes into organising the event until I was elected into office. “The deputy master and I are only two cogs of the wheel though, as there is a dedicated team who work tirelessly, giving up their time without any hesitation to put on the best parade of the year. “However, when you hit the Demesne, and see the tens of thousands of people enjoying themselves, it makes it all worth it.” Craig maintains he and Andrew have a close bond, having a shared interest in sport, and more importantly both “wanting the best for the preceptory”.As for their partnership demystying the perception that the Royal Black is an “older man’s” organisation, Craig retorts: “Yes, I would say so. I know many of my friends are all active members throughout the organisation. For those that argue it is an old mans organisation, I would say, join, get involved and help change that perception.”Andrew, from Donaghmore, said he enjoyed holding office with the Scarva preceptory.“There are not many preceptories with a young leadership like RBP  but it’s important to have experience from the older members to guide us in our decisions and actions,” he said.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson: Libya trade envoy role ‘very interesting’Temperatures set to plummet tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“If the presence of Craig and myself encourages younger people to join the Institution, then that can only be a positive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"four generations during four decades","story":"JOHN Paul II Youth Club in Ardoyne was founded in  amidst violence that would mark the year as one of the bloodiest of the recent conflict.The youth club’s first home was in a disused shop on Herbert Street, just yards from where a number of nationalist were burnt out of their homes just a few years earlier.Jacqui Maguire, a senior youth worker at John Paul II, was just nine years old when she attended the club’s first ever event on Halloween night in its formative year, and has been involved with the club ever since.Reflecting on those early days, Jacqui recalled how, in the hardest of times, local people rallied to provide a safe haven for young people who needed refuge from regular rioting and shootings on the nearby Crumlin Road.“The kids needed social interaction, but they were getting out of school and then going into the house because of the shooting and the rioting,” she explained.“There was an old shop that they cleared out and used for discos and wee parties.“The word went about that there was a youth club opening and everybody came from everywhere. In the beginning it was just used as a place for the kids in the street to play, but it just got bigger and bigger.“It was used as a nursery and mothers would meet there at night-time. It was like a social club rather than a youth club.“At the time Mr McLaughlin in St Gabriel’s said there werelads at the school who needed apprenticeships, so he would have brought them down and they were doing a bit bricklaying and plumbing and cleaned up the building.”Despite its less-than-humble beginnings, Jacqui’s early memories of the youth club are happy ones of a community that did its best in dficult circumstances. She recalls discos in Herbert Street, sports competitions and – despite it being the height of the Troubles – cross-community trips away. It was also those formative years that set Jacqui on the path to youth work. “Every night there was something dferent going on,” she recalled.“We also went on cross community trips, and we went to Cork with Cedar Lodge Youth Club. We used to go to Cork in the week of July. Later on we would have gone to Donegal. It was really a way to keep us off the streets.”She continued: “The club got us to do wee junior committees, got us to volunteer and help the young ones, and it stopped us being out there causing trouble. That’s the way we run this club as well. There are all dferent age groups that help with the younger ones. It’s called peer leading now, but it wouldn’t have been called that in those days.”Moving from an old disused shop to two burnt-out houses in the area that were renovated, the youth club eventually got its own purpose built building, which was opened by Liverpool and Ireland player Steve Heighway in . That came after local people, including Jacqui’s father Owen Maguire, and her late mother Bridie Maguire, lobbied the then Secretary of State, Lord Melchett, to obtain £, in funding for the club’s new home.While kids with few other facilities flocked to John Paul II Youth Club in its early days, the club has only grown since then. Two years ago a new extension was built at the club and plans are already under way to build a new amphitheatre and all-purpose sports pitch in early .John Paul II Youth Club has been an integral part of the lives of many people in Ardoyne. Jacqui represents just one of four generations of her family who are currently involved with the club and said its growth is a real source of pride to her.“It’s hard to believe that a group of women way back in the s even knew about social policy, or knew how to take those steps to build a club,” she said.“I will also say that it has been the members and the community that have been the backbone of the club. We could see what it did for us and we want to make sure pass that on to the next generation and the generations after that.“It’s a safe haven for the kids. Our young people know they can come in and there is enough staff of dferent ages and dferent levels for them to work with them. Young people will have particular staff that they will really gel with. We have a lot of programmes, a lot of personal development, a lot of buddy programmes, but it doesn’t all have to be high-flying – sometimes it can just be sitting down with somebody to talk.”Like all community groups, John Paul II Youth Club has had its challenges, particularly in the area of funding. However, volunteer hours, care and hard work from staff members combine to keep the club open six days a week. For the young people, the outcome is better social lives, learning opportunities, and the instilling of a strong set of values amongst which empathy is to the fore.“Our motto is sharing is caring,” Jacqui said.“They learn acceptance and understanding of others. It doesn’t matter who they are or what they are – you respect them. It doesn’t matter what anybody’s issues are, you always give them a second chance, because we can all mess up first chances.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"storm diana set to batter the north","story":"THE tail end of Storm Diana is set to sweep across the north todaywith strong winds of up to mph in some places.A yellow warning has been put in place by the Met Office from am to midnight.The warning adds that some delays to public transport are likely and some journey times could take longer.

BelfastBrexit survey: Have your say and you could win a £ Amazon voucher UUP leader Robin Swann said his party was prepared to look at all the alternatives to Theresa Mays \"unacceptable\" current deal but he stressed that any solution must be \"UK-wide\".Sinn Fein said the DUP couldnt negotiate their own agreement and there already was a Brexit deal on the table. NI boss is called ‘Tory cow’ for May support Speaking to BBC Radio s Today programme yesterday, Mrs Foster said she would not support calls for a second Brexit referendum, as the UK had already voted to leave and \"we respect that\". Repeating the DUPs opposition to Mrs Mays deal, she urged the Prime Minister to \"not waste time\" on it and instead look for a better solution to the border question.She hinted thatthe current Withdrawal Agreement failed to get through the House of Commons, her party could be open to a Norway plus style arrangement, where the whole of the UK stayed in the customs union until an agreement with the EU is reached on future trading relations. Would membership of the EEA work  Ms Foster said the DUPs \"one red line\" was to make sure Northern Ireland was not dferentiated from the rest of the UK in terms of customs and was \"not prescriptive\" about other potential options on the future relationship with the EU.But a Norway plus-style arrangement has been rejected by the TUV leader.Mr Allister told the Belfast : \"It would retain us fully within the EU single market, subject to all Brussels-made rules - adjudicated by the European Court of Justice - and maintain free movement of labour and require ongoing payments to the EU. That is not Brexit. Brexit: Ulster Farmers Union remain amenable to alternate Withdrawal Agreement proposal \"But for us it would be worse, because the Norway plus that is being talked about would additionally keep Northern Ireland in the customs territory of the EU - completing the repudiation of the Brexit that was voted for. Thus, the backstop would essentially still apply.\"Mr Allister continued: \"The core of the backstop is that Northern Ireland alone remains part of the customs territory of the EU.\"With the EU likely to only agree a Norway-style deal which had this add-on, it would leave us incarcerated in the EU in perpetuity.\"The UUP did not appear to rule out a Norway plus style arrangement. Mr Swann said: \"The Ulster Unionist Party cannot give our support to the Withdrawal Agreement and its disastrous backstop. However, we will look at every option and assess its merits - but the bottom line for the Ulster Unionist Party is that any solution must be UK-wide in its entirety.\"Sinn Fein MLA Mairtin O Muilleoir said: \"There already is a deal on the table - its not perfect but it avoids physical infrastructure on the border.\"The DUP cannot negotiate their own deal. Nor can they back a deal that isnt there.\"The EU has recognised that a unique solution is needed for the north because of our historical and geographical concerns. The backstop recognises that - that must be maintained.\"Mrs Foster told Radio  that Mrs Mays deal would see Northern Ireland \"erge off from the United Kingdom\" and she urged the Prime Minister to \"look for a better deal\" that \"takes back control of our money, of our borders and of our laws\".The DUP leader said: \"All the things that made us vote for Brexit are the things that are going to be imposed on Northern Ireland.\"Reiterating that the DUPs  MPs would not back the Withdrawal Agreement on December , Mrs Foster said it would create a \"huge democratic deficit\" in Northern Ireland.Mrs May yesterday rejected a suggestion that the failure to get a deal with the EU would see the UK stuck with the Northern Ireland backstop plan permanently.She was responding to Andrew Murrison, the Tory MP and chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, who compared it to a \"post-war pre-fab\".He said: \"Its sold as temporary, its built to last, and its likely to outlive us all.\"However, the PM dismissed his comments and told the House of Commons Liaison Committee it would only ever be a temporary solution.She added: \"Neither side thinks the backstop is a good place to be.\"Mrs May admitted that it would not be possible for the UK to unilaterally withdraw from it, though. But she said this was a guarantee to the people of Northern Ireland there would never be a hard border in place.Mrs May also rejected the claim that passing her Brexit deal in Parliament without the DUPs support would lead to the end of her partnership with Mrs Fosters party.\"Actually, the DUP have themselves said that the confidence-and-supply agreement remains in place,\" she stated.Mrs May refused to be drawn on what would happenMPs down the Withdrawal Agreement. But she insisted a second referendum was not an option as it could not be held before March ,  when Britain leaves the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"german ambassador urges vigilance against xenophobia at kindertransport event","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Many never saw their parents again.Speaking at the event in Hope Square near Liverpool Street Station, central London, German ambassador Peter Wittig said that amid the “blind racial hatred of the Nazi regime” the Kindertransport represented a “beacon of humanity in inhumane times”.Reflecting on what he described as the “darkest chapter of German history”, Mr Wittig said that he was “deeply honoured and moved” to attend the ceremony and extended his thanks to Britain, World Jewish Relief and the Association of Jewish Refugees.He also emphasised the need for countries and iniduals to remain “vigilant” and “show moral courage” against what he called “the backdrop of the continuing rise of anti-Semitism, racism and xenophobia across the world”.His words were echoed by Ruth Barnett who recounted her experience travelling to Britain from Berlin aged four and called for tolerance and kindness towards refugees.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Ruth Barnett, one of the Kinder, spoke during a ceremony to mark the th anniversary of the first Kindertransport “When I go into schools to talk to children, I assure them that nobody leaves their home in large numbers unless their home is not safe to stay in,” she said.“The very least we can do, is meet themwith a little kindness and a little help.”World Jewish Relief, formerly known as The Central British Fund for German Jewry , was instrumental in implementing the rescue programme.Following the violence of Kristallnacht, CBF founders Lionel De Rothschild and Chaim Weizmann, alongside a small delegation of prominent British Jews, met prime minister Neville Chamberlain to appeal for his help.Between  and , World Jewish Relief provided essential funding and education to the children and, in the subsequent years, continued to assist with their ongoing welfare needs.The chief executive of World Jewish Relief, Paul Anticoni, spoke of the “fantastic team” behind the event and praised the assistance of the Association of Jewish Refugees.Mr Anticoni also spoke of the deep connection maintained between World Jewish Relief, the kinder and their extended families.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Kinder survivors pose for a group photograph in front of Frank Meisler’s Kindertransport memorial “Every one of the kinder has said to us,it wasn’t for you, I wouldn’t be here, you’ve saved my le and I want to be a part of your organisation,” he said.This sentiment was echoed by siblings Harry Heber and Ruth Jacobs. Both travelled on the Kindertransport train and were placed with ious families throughout Britain, before reuniting with their parents, who arrived years later as domestic servants.Mr Heber ultimately worked with World Jewish Relief for over  years, utilising his skills as an optician to provide more than , glasses for lower income Jewish children.“We are so grateful to Britain that they welcomed us. But I am particularly grateful for World Jewish Relief without whom we wouldn’t be here,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"8 of the best pictures from londons largest","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

One slogan on the famed war memorial read: “Yellow jackets will triumph.” He then headed to a nearby avenue where activists battled police on Saturday to meet firefighters, police officers and restaurant owners.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A demonstrator throws an item as a car burns At the security meeting, the French leader asked his interior minister to consider making “adaptations” to security procedures to try to contain protests sparked by rising fuel taxes.Mr Macron also asked Prime Minister Edouard Philippe to meet the heads of France’s major political parties and representatives from the grassroots movement behind the protests.Plans for an earlier meeting between the prime minister and representatives of the movement collapsed last week after a request to broadcast the talks live was rejected.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Demonstrators stand by the words ‘The yellow jackets will triumph’ written in big black letters at the base of the Arc de Triomphe It was the third straight weekend of clashes in Paris involving activists dressed in the yellow vests of the new protest movement. The grassroots protests began on November  with motorists upset over a fuel tax hike, but have grown to encompass a range of demands and complaints that Mr Macron’s government does not care about the problems of ordinary people.The scene in Paris contrasted sharply with protests where in France that were mostly peaceful.“It’s dficult to reach the end of the month.

The gathering’s final statement, however, did not mention protectionism after negotiators said the US objected to the wording. Mr Trump has criticised the WTO and adopted aggressive trade policies targeting China and the European Union.– US-China trade war\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  President Donald Trump with China’s President Xi Jinping during their bilateral meeting in Buenos Aires Financial markets will be cheered by the announcement that Mr Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed at a dinner after the summit to have a -day truce in their trade battle.Mr Trump agreed to hold off on plans to raise tarfs on January  on  billion dollars in Chinese goods. Mr Xi agreed to buy a “not yet agreed upon, but very substantial amount of agricultural, energy, industrial” and other products from the United States to reduce America’s huge trade deficit with China, the White House said.The ceasefire will buy time for the two countries to work out their dferences in a dispute over Beijing’s aggressive drive to supplant US technological dominance.– Prince under pressure\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, left, and Russian President Vladimir Putin, shake hands prior their talks at the G summit in Buenos Aires There were some awkward moments for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as some leaders called him out over the gruesome October killing of dissident Saudi newspaper columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the country’s consulate in Istanbul.French President Emmanuel Macron was captured on video seemingly lecturing Mr bin Salman, at one point being heard saying “I am worried,” “you never listen to me,” and “I am a man of my word.” Mr Macron said the crown prince only “took note” of his concerns.British Prime Minister Theresa May also said she pressed Mr bin Salman.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was the only G leader to raise the issue during the official session. Mr Erdogan called Mr bin Salman’s response – that the crime had not been proven – “unbelievable” and complained that Saudi authorities have been unco-operative.But it was not all bad for Mr bin Salman. He was not shunned, and on the gathering’s first day, he and Russian President Vladimir Putin engaged in a hearty grip-and-grin as the two seemingly revelled in their shared status as relative outcasts.US intelligence agencies concluded the Saudi prince was behind the killing. Saudi Arabia denies he played a role.– Ukraine conflict\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Russia’s President Vladimir Putin speaks after meeting with Argentina’s President Mauricio Macri at the presidential palace in Buenos Aires Western leaders confronted Mr Putin over Russia’s recent seizure of Ukrainian naval vessels and crews, but the diplomatic pressure did not seem to bring either side closer to solving the conflict. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of being responsible for the standoff.Mr Trump cited Russia’s actions as the reason that he cancelled a planned meeting with Mr Putin on the sidelines of the summit. EU Council president Donald Tusk sharply criticised “Russia’s aggression” against Ukraine.Mr Putin tried to convince Mr Trump and the leaders of France and Germany that Russia’s actions were justied – even pulling out a piece of paper and drawing a map of the disputed area to make his point.– Climate change\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  President Donald Trump listens to questions from members of the media during his meeting with Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel at the G summit in Buenos Aires The final communique signed by all  member nations said  of them reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris climate accord. The only holdout was the US, which has withdrawn from the pact under Mr Trump.Still, environmental groups praised the statement as welcome news.“That G leaders signed up to the Paris Agreement reaffirmed their commitment to its full implementation in the resulting communique is important,” the World Wildle Fund said. “It is also a reflection of the Argentinian government rightly making climate an important topic on the agenda.”Greenpeace said that “the necessity of the US being part of the effort to fight climate change cannot be denied, but this is a demonstration that the US is still the odd one out”.– NAFTA\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  US President Donald Trump, Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, right, and Mexico’s President Enrique Pena Nieto, left, participate in the USMCA signing ceremony in Buenos Aires After two years of negotiations, Mr Trump signed a revised North American trade pact with the leaders of Canada and Mexico on the sidelines of the summit. The deal is meant to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement , which Mr Trump long denigrated as a “disaster”.The new pact will not take effect unless approved by the legislatures of all three nations, and there are questions about the pact’s prospects in the US Congress, especially now that Democrats will control the House. Democrats and their allies in the labour movement are already demanding changes.But Mr Trump said on the way back to Washington that he plans to formally terminate NAFTA, so Congress will have to choose between accepting the new pact or going without a trade accord.– Low expectations – low output\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  World leaders gather for a group photo at the start of the G summit in Buenos Aires Even the host country had lowered expectations ahead of the summit, saying before the gathering started that it might not be possible to reach a consensus for a final statement.After sleepless days of round-the-clock talks by diplomats, a communique was produced, but analysts said leaders merely signed a watered down statement that skirted trade and other contentious issues.“The G veered all over the road” at the summit and the leaders failed to fix trade, which is widely seen as a priority for boosting growth in jobs and economies, said Thomas Bernes, a distinguished fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation who has held leading roles with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and Canada’s government.“Leaders buried their dferences in obscure language and dropped language to fight protectionism, which had been included in every G communique since the leaders’ first summit. This is clearly a retrograde step forced by United States intransigence,” Mr Bernes said."},{"url":null,"title":"ardnashees got talent talented youngsters take stage spectacular christmas show","story":"A Derry school for children with special needs is staging a hugely ambitious original show this Christmas that would not look out of place on the West End stage.Rehearsals are well under way for the all singing, all dancing ‘A Very Musical Nativity!’, which features professional sound, lighting and choreography.The show centres around Noel, played by Year  pupil Noel Mulgrew, who is a typical teenager.His dream is to perform on a professional stage, but his mother has other ideas.Sinead Crossan, Senior teacher and writer and producer of the show, said performing arts are an integral part of the school.“We like to challenge the perception of what children with a disability can do,” she explained.“Every child has the right to access the arts.“Some of our pupils have very limited communication, but there is a magic that happens with dance and music and drama that allows them to communicate through the arts.”Some of the children who would struggle with appearing on stage will feature in a series of video sequences and there are also Makaton signing sequences for children with speech and language dficulties.Ardnashee school’s award winning choir, led by Bríd Cutlfe,  are central to the action of the play which follows Noel’s quest to land a starring role in a nativity.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAnd there are also some memorable guest appearance from members of staff.“All the staff have got on board and it allows the children to see them in a dferent light and discover an extra dimension to them,” continued Mrs Crossan.“Every child has the right to dream and at Ardnashee School and College we aim to provide the very best teaching and learning to encourage our pupils to be the best they can be.“The story of our musical captures the theme of dreams in a fun, light-hearted way.”A production of this size is very expensive to stage and it is thanks to the tireless fundraising of the Ardnashee PTA that is has been made possible.“I am forever grateful for the work of all the staff behind the scenes and for those who appear in the show,” added Mrs Crossan.“Without the Ardnashee School and College PTA the show would not be possible and I need to personally thank Mrs Clare McDaid and Miss Jane Boyd for leading and coordinating the fund raising events for the show and Emma Lindsay for her fantastic choreography.Vice Principal Donna Cartin said the show promises to be fantastic.“We are all looking forward to the show this Christmas.“The students and staff have put so much hard work into it and we are so proud of them and we know the show will be a huge success.”"},{"url":null,"title":"plans lodged demolition flats waterside area derry replacement new social housing development","story":"Plans have been lodged for the demolition of a block of flats at Gobnascale in the Waterside area of the city and its replacement with a new social housing development.The application has been lodged by the EHA Group, which has delivered a number of social housing projects across Derry, including a new development on behalf of Apex Housing at lands formerly occupied by the old St Brecan’s High School on Trench Road.The latest development would see the demolition of numbers - Mimosa Court , which is currently a block of flats, and a new development consisting of  new social housing apartments erected in their place.The new development would also be extended over empty lands at the front of the buildings facing onto Strabane Old Road.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshHowever, concerns have now been raised about the application by the Sinn Fein election candidate Sharon McLaughlin, who said that in its current form, the application does not address a number of outstanding issues, such as parking provision.“As anyone living in the area knows, there are massive issues with parking provision at the rear of Mimosa Court,” she said.“There is an acute need for new social housing in the Top of the Hill, however, we are disappointed with this application as it stands and will be seeking a meeting with the developers to address these issues.”The application has been lodged with Derry City and Strabane District Council and will come before a future meeting of its Planning Committee."},{"url":null,"title":"traffic alert victoria road derry closed newbuildings due traffic collision divsersions place","story":"Due to a road traffic collision on the Victoria Road in Derry, the Victoria Road has been closed at Newbuildings.

The latter opened last year at a cost of poundm.ldquoSuch facilities are important in the provision of sport and recreation, especially to young people who are just starting out in their sporting activities, the council chairman continued.ldquoFacilities like the Down Leisure Centre provide a gathering place around which social activities occur. They provide a sense of pride of place and belonging that can add value to community and indeed the entire district.ldquoThe council is committed that all people in Newry, Mourne and Down enjoy good health and wellbeing via the districtrsquos community plan and that the lsquoBe Activersquo campaign is a superb way to help support this outcome.Cllr Murnin added: ldquoA healthy and active lestyle contributes positively to physical, mental and social wellbeing and as an organisation we want to encourage all our citizens to be active every day.Council officials are delighted with the new centre and the initial reaction of the public to date.One of the key features is the teaching pool which will allow the new centre to provide more swimming classes and education training for teachers, allowing full access to the main pool for other swimmers.Mains gas has also been connected to the new multi-million pound building which also boasts a combined heat and power source, helping minimise its carbon footprint. Photovoltaic cells which have been fitted on the roof help heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas.In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns it into warm air, while so-called ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building, with everyone associated with the new centre, from the designers to builders and the councillors who supported it financially, delighted at the opening of a new chapter in the history of local leisure provision..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygalget on the ball helping families dealing with dementia  ","story":"BALLYGALGET GAC has been recognised for its effort in helping people who live with dementia in an award ceremony recently.John Mitchelrsquos GAC received the award after teaming up with the Alzheimerrsquos Society to become the first GAA club to take on the Dementia Friendly programme.This award recognises the work members do to ensure everyone affected with dementia in their parish and beyond gets the support they need.Brendan Birt, a spokesperson for the club, explained that the club had been crossing every cultural and religious ide since it was founded in .He said that in that time the club had attended to the needs of everyone who live in what is a very rural part of the Ards Peninsula.ldquoWe are delighted to win this award in recognition of the work that has been done by our club and in the community, he remarked.ldquoThe first initiative of our new award-winning health and wellbeing centre was to become a dementia friendly community. We already have  trained dementia friends and that is growing.ldquoAs the first GAA club, we wanted to get involved because of the many people within our community who are living with dementia. This has raised the profile and understanding of dementia within our club and parish.Although this project is in its infancy, two dementia friendly community workshops have already been delivered creating  dementia friends, not only in Ballygalget but in the surrounding areas too.Future plans include extending the dementia friends initiative to two neighbouring GAA clubs and to hold a workshop in the local primary school.Bernadine McCrory, Country Director for Alzheimerrsquos Society, said: ldquoIt is amazing that John Mitchelrsquos GAC has won the Championing Diversity award and it is a testament to their tremendous work they do.ldquoThe level of nominations received this year was truly phenomenal and there were some exceptional stories heard at the awards ceremony.ldquoWe want everyone affected by dementia to know that whoever you are, whatever you are going through, you can turn to Alzheimerrsquos Society for support, help and advice.She added: ldquoAll the finalists and winners at the Dementia Friendly Awards have demonstrated how we can unite against dementia and support those affected by the condition..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch edge derby tie  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH secured an ugly derby win in front of a large home crowd and banished a few memories from the three defeats to Banbridge last season which cost them promotion.The home side were almost at full strength, with Peter Nelson at full back, Kyle McCall ing in the front row and Johnny McPhillips sprung from the bench in the second half. Conor Kelly was the only signicant absentee, with Richard Reaney taking his place on the wing.Banbridge were without most of their Ulster contingent, fielding the team which had propelled them through the leagues over the past few seasons, and they will feel that they should have beaten a jittery home side.Defence dominated an attritional match and both sides were guilty of giving away penalties when in strong positions. Nelson kicked his side into the lead after five minutes, following a positive start, but Banbridge cranked up the pressure and had an excellent ten minute spell. They were held up over the line following some excellent driving play and continued to pile on the pressure, a charge down leading to a succession of m scrums. Despite some heroic defence, Banbridge scored when Stevie Irvine was driven over in the nd minute.Ballynahinch followed this with their best spell of the match, with excellent carrying from forwards and backs, pinning Banbridge in their own . When it seemed they had finally stretched the Bann defence to the limit, a knock-on gave the away side some respite.As lsquoHinch began to build another wave of attacks, scrum half Rhys OrsquoDonnell spotted a gap around the ruck in the centre of the pitch and ran under the posts untouched for an excellent try.Nelsonrsquos simple conversion made it -, but lsquoHinch failed to push on and there was more defending to before half-time. Banbridge missed a penalty just before the break and the home side turned round with a narrow three-point cushion.McPhillips replaced Hilton Gibbons at half-time and knocked over an excellent penalty early in the second half to stretch the lead to six points. However, Banbridge had already shown their intention to move the ball and they looked increasingly dangerous with ball in hand, especially from scrums.Centre Andy Morrison looked dangerous every time he received the ball and Banbridge upped the tempo with lsquoHinch looking increasingly nervous. A yellow card for number  Conall Boomer in the rd minute following a collapsed maul invited pressure and only sensational home defence with  men kept them out.The home try line was eventually breached in the th minute when Morrison went over following a missed tackle in midfield. The missed conversion gave Hinch a leline and despite more pressure form a superbly well drilled Banbridge team the final score remained -. Relief rather than elation from the home supporters as they made their way home.Ballynahinch Banbridge AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Chairman gives his backing to ‘green’ off road paths scheme  ","story":"A CAMPAIGN to connect Downpatrick with the Rowallane area via a series of off-road paths has secured the backing of the districtrsquos first citizen.A delegation of residents met recently with Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin to discuss extending the existing Quoile River walk towards Killyleagh. A motion on the issue will be tabled at next monthrsquos meeting of the local authority.The council chairman was presented with a consultancy report on the merits of the proposal and the minor costings of delivering the scheme which have not yet been made public.The delegation was led by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who was joined by David Flinn, from the Ulster Ramblers Association.The report on extending the existing Quoile River walk into Rowallane was commissioned by the Downpatrick-based Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, which was represented at the meeting by Anthony Trainor.Also taking part was Peter Smyth from the Downpatrick Community Collective, a body which represents all community and residentsrsquo associations in the town. It is also supporting the proposed initiative.Cllr Enright described the off-road paths proposal as a ldquosimple, affordable and detailed plan to restore linkages lost in the s and s.He continued: ldquoIt has long been the desire of all political parties to restore the Ulster Way and reconnect Killyleagh, Delamont Country Park, Downpatrick, Castle Ward and Strangford.ldquoImplementing the reported does not require actual money at all, but simply the local council using its powers under the Countryside Order to remove some of the obstructions that have grown up in recent years.Cllr Enright said the network of paths would reconnect Delamont and Castle Ward with Downpatrick. He explained the route would require two or three short sections of boardwalk similar to those near the Belfast Road to reconnect paths or overcome boggy ground.ldquoAll this needs is a resolute approach by council management to reflect cross-party consensus over the priority of this project, he added.Cllr Murnin said the loss of official Ulster Way status in  for an area stretching from Killyleagh to Downpatrick and from Downpatrick to Strangford was a ldquohuge blow to East Down.He continued: ldquoSince then, local authority staff have intended to re-assert off-load links to recreate these vital routes, but this project has not been prioritised.ldquoWe can re-establish East Down as the centre of a network of off-road community trails that would be both regionally and nationally signicant. I will be lending my support to the cross-party motion in council to prioritise these three inter-linked routes.Mr Smyth said funding for the off-road paths study was obtained though the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, with the project supported by the Downpatrickrsquos Collective which surveyed hundreds of users of existing pathways around Delamont and the Quoile River.He added: ldquoThere is clearly overwhelming public support for this proposal that would cost a small fraction of the money recently invested in providing so-called greenways in the Newry, Warrenpoint and South Armagh areas to link into the Cooley mountains..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Congratulations all round at Saintfield High School  ","story":"SIXTY years of providing outstanding education are being celebrated at Saintfield High School.The school proudly opened its doors in  as Saintfield Secondary Intermediate School with  pupils and five teachers.The school has seen many changes, including extensions and additions, the subjects offered to pupils, the ied members of staff and, of course, the generations of pupils.Miss Sarah-Lucy Hynds, principal, said the th anniversary was being marked ldquowith a real sense of pride in our past, and an excited and positive outlook for the future.She continued: ldquoIt is an absolute honour and privilege to lead such a thriving and active school community a school with a highly commended academic, pastoral, sporting and cultural history.The school has been instrumental in the development of the wider community during the last  years mdash in the citizens that it has produced and in the many and ied achievements of pupils, both past and present.Mr Johnston Young was appointed as the schoolrsquos first principal in .

Last year five pupils were retained and this term eight were held back.The practice was put under the microscope by the Education Boardrsquos Educational Services Committee recently when a committee member asked for it to be discontinued.Mr J Scott said he was concerned that all children should have equal opportunities and that no pupils should have an advantage over othersCROSSGAR mdash The threat of closure that has been overshadowing the future of Crossgar War Memorial Hall was lted at a special public meeting. Over  local residents rallied in response to a desperate plea for help issued by the hallrsquos management committee.Lack of support and use of the hall forced the committee to present an ultimatums to the townsfolk to either take an interest in the hall, or have it closed down.This unprecedented appeal certainly produced results as Mr W J Cochrane said when he addressed a packed meeting.ldquoI am delighted to see so many people here, he said. ldquoHowever, we are not out of the woods yet. It is vitally important that the hall is managed by a thoughtful and inventive committee to ensure a safe passage out of our present dficulties.ldquoUnless the committee can come up with ways of obtaining sustained financial assistance, the threat of closure is still real.Mr Cochrane explained that while many repairs had been carried out, there was still a lot to do.

When he was included in the play, he was absolutely lethal and too hot for Killough to handle.Alas, Killough were masters of their own downfall. They had the major share of possession throughout a feisty encounter, but were never going to be as ruthless as Celtic up front with too many chiefs in midfield and not enough Indians up front and any time they did threaten, goalkeeper Nathan Curran was there to deny them.Celtic started in a hurry and were - up after only four minutes. Stevie Galbraith, who led the line with distinction, linked up with McCoubrey out on the left before cutting inside Chris Fryer.He had only one thing on his mind as he entered the box and an angled right-footed curler, that seemed to take a bit of a deflection, beat Gerard Gormley all ends up.Killough tried desperately to get back on level terms and with seven minutes gone they went close when Fryer let loose from just outside the box. Curran did well to take the sting out of the shot and did even better to retrieve the loose ball ahead of the lurking Tony McIlhone.Two minutes later at the other end a McCoubrey cross was met at the back post by Sean McMahon, but he failed to get a good connection with his head and the chance was wasted.With  minutes gone the same combination dovetailed perfectly again, but McMahonrsquos cross hit the crossbar. McCoubrey was back in the thick of things minutes later when he had a shot well saved by Gormley, but Killough continued to threaten at the opposite end as well with McIlhone again being denied by Curran.Killough were starting to edge midfield and with  minutes gone Curran prevented Liam Graham from equalising after a tidy pass from Michael Burns. Just as Killough started to believe they could get back into the game, they shot themselves in the foot.As they dithered at the back, getting the ball forward, Celticrsquos pressing game bore fruit and McCoubrey took full advantage to race away and beat Gormley with a clinical strike.Four minutes into the second half McCoubrey made it - after Galbraith picked him out with a delightful pass that split Killough wide open.The exciting teenager could have added to his tally on a couple of occasions as Killough gamely tried to get back into contention, but he was out of luck with two cheeky efforts that went narrowly wide.McCoubrey eventually completed his hat-trick in the th minute when Celtic again caught Killough napping at the back and there was only going be one outcome when the talented youngster raced through to beat Gormley.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Sean Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Michael Rice, Jordan Curran, Jordan McCoubrey, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan, Subs: Terence Bell, Caolain Boyd, Andy Baggley.Killough: Gerard Gormley, Chris Fryer, Conor Black, Michael Burns, Colm Stranney, Kevin Groves, Liam Graham, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George, Jack McLaughlin.

A comprehensive design scheme would also have to be worked up.NI Water officials have also confirmed Saintfield is one of a number of towns across the Province which requires signicant investment to upgrade the existing infrastructure to carter for current and future demand.Rowallane politicians fear the moratorium on new development in Saintfield could potentially be in place for two years and have urged senior NI Water officials to do all they can to expedite the work that is required. They say the current ban will not only have a major impact on residents and developers, but the townrsquos economy.NI Waterrsquos Stephen Blockwell confirmed to Newry, Mourne and Down councillors that the drainage study will not be completed until next December. He said the study will look at the causes of the current issues in Saintfield and outline solutions.Pointing to sewage spills at the Old Grand Jury Road, Mr Blockwell, NI Waterrsquos head of investment, said the study was part of NI Waterrsquos approach to wastewater capacity and described it as a tool ldquoto get timely solutions.Mr Blockwell continued: ldquoIn terms of the drainage plan we need to get the right analysis to come up with solutions and the model we are working on will be ready in December . It takes time to do this work and analysis and get the right solution. If there is available funding, we will be able to bring schemes forward.ldquoThere are under capacity issues across Northern Ireland in relation to wastewater treatment works but there are parts of the Saintfield area like Darragh Cross where development is not restricted.Mr Blockwell added: ldquoUnfortunately for some current residents in Saintfield when there is heavy rainfall, there is restricted toilet use. This is very unpleasant and we sympathise with them. We will work to ensure everything is in place to develop a solution to this issue.Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews have urged officials to ensure that the study is not only completed on time, but that money to implement its ious recommendations is available. They argue it is not unrealistic to suggest that the development ban could be in place for up to two years.ldquoIt is very concerning that work on the study will not be completed for another  months with no guarantee that the money needed to provide a st century sewerage system in Saintfield will be available, said Cllr Walker.ldquoThis is a very serious issue and one that must be urgently addressed. The ban is impinging on the future development of one of this districtrsquos leading towns and we currently have situation during heavy rain that raw sewage is backing up into peoplersquos gardens.Cllr Walker said it was his understanding that Saintfield is one of  towns in Northern Ireland which requires major investment to upgrade sewage treatment plants and the sewerage network.He added: ldquoSaintfield must be at the top of NI Waterrsquos priority list and the money needed to upgrade the sewerage system must be available. Given that the study will only be completed next December, by the time it takes to draw up detailed designs and secure money to carry out improvements, the development ban could be in place for at least two more years. This is unacceptable.Cllr Andrews said Saintfieldrsquos existing sewerage system could not cope and there were major questions over the long term future of the townrsquos treatment plant.ldquoThe preparatory work to identy solutions must be completed as soon as possible and the money required to signicantly upgrade the system must be made available, he said.ldquoI believe a new treatment works is required, but it will take time to deliver such a strategic capital investment scheme.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Many never saw their parents again.Speaking at the event in Hope Square near Liverpool Street Station, central London, German ambassador Peter Wittig said that amid the ldquoblind racial hatred of the Nazi regime the Kindertransport represented a ldquobeacon of humanity in inhumane times.Reflecting on what he described as the ldquodarkest chapter of German history, Mr Wittig said that he was ldquodeeply honoured and moved to attend the ceremony and extended his thanks to Britain, World Jewish Relief and the Association of Jewish Refugees.He also emphasised the need for countries and iniduals to remain ldquovigilant and ldquoshow moral courage against what he called ldquothe backdrop of the continuing rise of anti-Semitism, racism and xenophobia across the world.His words were echoed by Ruth Barnett who recounted her experience travelling to Britain from Berlin aged four and called for tolerance and kindness towards refugees.Ruth Barnett, one of the Kinder, spoke during a ceremony to mark the th anniversary of the first Kindertransport ldquoWhen I go into schools to talk to children, I assure them that nobody leaves their home in large numbers unless their home is not safe to stay in, she said.ldquoThe very least we can do, is meet themwith a little kindness and a little help.World Jewish Relief, formerly known as The Central British Fund for German Jewry , was instrumental in implementing the rescue programme.Following the violence of Kristallnacht, CBF founders Lionel De Rothschild and Chaim Weizmann, alongside a small delegation of prominent British Jews, met prime minister Neville Chamberlain to appeal for his help.Between  and , World Jewish Relief provided essential funding and education to the children and, in the subsequent years, continued to assist with their ongoing welfare needs.The chief executive of World Jewish Relief, Paul Anticoni, spoke of the ldquofantastic team behind the event and praised the assistance of the Association of Jewish Refugees.Mr Anticoni also spoke of the deep connection maintained between World Jewish Relief, the kinder and their extended families.Kinder survivors pose for a group photograph in front of Frank Meislerrsquos Kindertransport memorial ldquoEvery one of the kinder has said to us,it wasnrsquot for you, I wouldnrsquot be here, yoursquove saved my le and I want to be a part of your organisation, he said.This sentiment was echoed by siblings Harry Heber and Ruth Jacobs. Both travelled on the Kindertransport train and were placed with ious families throughout Britain, before reuniting with their parents, who arrived years later as domestic servants.Mr Heberultimately worked with World Jewish Relief for over  years, utilising his skills as an optician to provide more than , glasses for lower income Jewish children.ldquoWe are so grateful to Britain that they welcomed us.

The fluorescent jackets, which French motorists are required to have in their cars for emergencies, are an emblem of a grassroots citizensrsquo movement protesting against fuel taxes.Mr Macron shakes hands with a firefighter Fires were started at six buildings and more than  makesht barricades and  vehicles were torched, Mr Delpuech said.Paris prosecutor Remy Heitz said  people remained in police custody as of Sunday evening,  of them minors.Earlier on Sunday, Mr Macron visited the Arc de Triomphe, which had damaged statues as well as graffiti. One slogan on the famed war memorial read: ldquoYellow jackets will triumph.He then headed to a nearby avenue where activists battled police on Saturday to meet firefighters, police officers and restaurant owners.A demonstrator throws an item as a car burns in Paris At the security meeting, the French leader asked his interior minister to consider making ldquoadaptations to security procedures to try to contain protests sparked by rising fuel taxes.Mr Macron also asked Prime Minister Edouard Philippe to meet the heads of Francersquos major political parties and representatives from the grassroots movement behind the protests.Plans for an earlier meeting between the prime minister and representatives of the movement collapsed last week after a request to broadcast the talks live was rejected.Demonstrators stand by the words lsquoThe yellow jackets will triumphrsquo written in big black letters at the base of the Arc de Triomphe It was the third straight weekend of clashes in Paris involving activists dressed in the yellow vests of the new protest movement.The grassroots protests began on November  with motorists upset over a fuel tax hike, but have grown to encompass a range of demands and complaints that Mr Macronrsquos government does not care about the problems of ordinary people.The scene in Paris contrasted sharply with protests where in France that were mostly peaceful.ldquoItrsquos dficult to reach the end of the month. People work and pay a lot of taxes and we are fed up, said Rabah Mendez, a protester who marched peacefully on Saturday in Paris.A woman takes a photo of charred cars near the Arc de Triomphe Speaking in Buenos Aires before he flew home to Paris, Mr Macron said he welcomed the views of protesters but vowed that those who participated in wreaking havoc would be held responsible for their behaviour.ldquo has nothing to do with the peaceful expression of a legitimate anger and ldquono cause justies attacks on police or pillaging stores and burning buildings, Mr Macron said..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Macron demands security evaluation after Paris riots article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

On average,  months after rollout, foodbanks see a % increase in demand, compared to % in areas with Universal Credit for  months or less.“All the evidence available suggests that the introduction of Universal Credit in new communities is swtly followed by hardship for struggling families. The introduction of welfare cuts has led to foodbanks being overrun and all politicians locally need to recognise the impact of welfare cuts it has on the people they represent. “The new welfare system is increasingly driving referrals to food banks due to benefit delays, which include waiting for a first payment or having problems with a new claim.“The generosity of people who donate to the foodbanks and the volunteers who manage and distribute the food are an inspiration.“Unfortunately, the winter months are more dficult were foodbanks typically receive more referrals for emergency support and we need to redouble our efforts. “To express our gratitude, the SDLP will be doing our bit this Christmas to assist local foodbanks and doing all we can to help families under pressure.”Council staff visit aerosol paint sellers after spike in graffiti Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Christmas1.jpg","title":"thought about the christmas party its just a few weeks away","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business A time for giving, the festive party is an event that puts the spotlight firmly on employer gratitude. Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come.

And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/223.jpg","title":"lunns opening m rolex store in city","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by Ulster Business Luxury watch and jewellery business Lunn’s is opening a new £m Rolex store in Belfast city centre.

Earlier this year, it was announced that Queen’s Arcade would undergo a major £m facelt. Peter Lunn, chairman of Lunn’s Jewellers, said the decision by Rolex to open in Belfast is “a huge endorsement for the city”. “Rolex is one of the world’s true super-brands and to have their store on Donegall Place, the city’s main retail thoroughfare, is a major expression of confidence. The store will offer customers a truly immersive experience of the brand. “We are also very excited to be opening a fully accredited Rolex workshop, which will help owners to maintain the value and ensure the quality of their watches by having them serviced by skilled technicians on site at Queen’s Arcade. It represents a big investment in Rolex parts and machinery, but we believe it is an essential part of the authentic Rolex experience.” Richard de Leyser, managing director, Rolex UK, said: “I’m delighted that Lunn’s continues to invest in our partnership and excited at the prospect of expanding the Rolex offering in Queen’s Arcade. “The plans to extend the space dedicated to Rolex and provide a new and engaging customer experience will perfectly position Lunn’s to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing retail environment. “The contemporary space will complement the historic architecture of Queen’s Arcade and provide a fitting home for Rolex.  We are proud to partner Lunn’s in this new development which will further enhance the unrivalled service to our customers in Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said.
