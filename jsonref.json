[{"url":null,"title":"Free speech legal supremacy Dominic Raab unveils plan stop democratic debate","story":"Share this article Harry Potter author JK Rowling and other public figures have been vilified for voicing concerns over an erosion of women’s rights by the transgender lobby, for example.Only this week, the creator of comedy series Father Ted Graham Linehan declared that he had been ‘thoroughly cancelled’ and that trans activists had cost him his family and his marriage. Recent years have seen cancel culture extend across society, with growing numbers attacked in public life, on university campuses and on social media for expressing their views.The author Jacqueline Wilson recently compared ‘scary’ cancel culture to ‘walking a tightrope’.Yesterday, Vladimir Putin tried to use the issue to score political points, suggesting the West was trying to ‘cancel’ Russia in the same way some have with JK Rowling.Mr Raab told the Mail that under plans being drawn up for the Bill of Rights, there would be only very limited restrictions placed on the new over-arching protections on free speech.He said it would be given a ‘different status in the pecking order of rights’, with checks to stop people abusing it to promote terrorism.Although the main impact of this will be on legal disputes, ministers believe that placing such a heavy emphasis on free speech is likely to have an effect beyond the courts and could help iniduals trying to push back against cancel culture.Mr Raab said: ‘We will still be clamping down on those who try and use either media or free speech to incite violence, to radicalise terrorists, or to threaten children. All of those safeguards will be in place.‘But we’ve got to be able to strengthen free speech, the liberty that guards all of our other freedoms, and stop it being whittled away surreptitiously, sometimes without us really being conscious of it.‘So it will have a different status in the pecking order of rights and I think that will go a long way to protecting this country’s freedom of speech and our history, which has always very strongly protected freedom of speech.’The Human Rights Act was introduced by Tony Blair’s Labour government 20 years ago, and Tory ministers believe it is ripe for reform. "},{"url":null,"title":"Duchess Cambridge looks world away afternoons wet regatta dazzles gown","story":"Dazzle like the Duchess in a gown by Phillipa LepleyTake a closer look here!We\u0026#39ve loved poring over the Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s outfits throughout the Royals eight-day tour of the Caribbean.

We put all our grocery expenses on credit cards in order to conserve as much as we could from our salaries. Lockdown also meant we had nowhere else to be.’Even so, it wasn’t always ideal: after finishing his 7am-3pm shift for Ford (working from home), Ashok would decamp to his home hangar to crack on with plane assembly for hours at a time.‘Some of it is really tedious work — you have to spend hours preparing all the parts and there is a lot of repetition,’ he says. ‘I had a checklist that just got longer and longer — I think by the end it had a thousand items on it. And it’s stressful because there’s no second chances — you can’t really afford to make a mistake. So I did get tired.’His wife, meanwhile, felt the strain of home schooling and homeworking in what, for several months, became a de facto aircraft parts storage facility.‘Once the wings were assembled, they were in my kitchen diner for months,’ she says. ‘I had to swaddle them in duvets to make sure they didn’t get damaged by the kids, but there would be times when Ashok and I were both on work calls, Tara was home schooling on the laptop next to me and Diya was causing mayhem. There was an element of novelty at first but my patience did start to wear thin.’The couple persevered, though, and by April last year the main bodywork had been completed and the plane was ready to have its wings, engine and avionics fixed in place.These jobs were then done by certified experts at the airfield Sling uses as its UK distribution point.‘It would have been wonderful to put the wings on at home but we couldn’t have got it down the side entrance,’ says Abi with a grin.The wings were painted in May and in June, Ashok started the engine for the first time.‘That was a special moment,’ he says. ‘I looked at it and thought, “I made this” — and it did feel good, although at the same time I kept thinking about stuff that could go wrong.’ The Light Aircraft Authority must not only sign off on overall safety but also make regular inspections.Finally, at the end of November 2021, the freshly painted aircraft was signed off as airworthy, although it took a further two months for the paperwork to come through, so it was not until early February that Ashok could see the aircraft take to the skies, with Tim Hardy at the controls.‘After all those months of hard work it felt amazing,’ he says. ‘It was everything we had worked towards.’He needs to complete another four landings and a few hours with an instructor before he can take command himself, while Abi is also studying for her pilot’s licence so they can share the controls on those mini-breaks.Which raises the question — where will they go first? At the moment they are aiming for Newquay over the Bank Holiday weekend, with some European adventures in summer.As to the financial side, they want to get other pilots to buy shares in G-DIYA to spread the cost of future maintenance, while the ever-industrious Ashok is also looking at building a full-size hangar, closer to home.‘Space is at a premium in the South-East of England, so I have applied to the council to lease a plot and build my own hangar,’ he says.Abi rolls her eyes affectionately. She says she has nothing to complain about, even if there are some hefty credit card bills to pay off this year.After all, she no longer has a plane in her house — and the sky is now literally the limit. ‘We definitely had a productive lockdown,’ she says with a smile."},{"url":null,"title":"Britains civil servant Simon Case quizzed Met Partygate investigation","story":"Share this article A source told the Financial Times: ‘Simon is totally compromised, he’s worried about being fined by the police – it’s widely known he is being investigated.

Photograph: PA Proposals that would see non-Irish people forced to get an electronic visa waiver before crossing the border are not yet finalised as far as the Government is conerned, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.Speaking following talks with Northern secretary Brandon Lewis in Dublin on Wednesday, Mr Coveney said the proposals were still in the legislative process in the UK and that Ireland would continue making representations on the issue.“I think it is important to say that this is not legislation that is finalised yet, there was a vote in the House of Commons last night but my understanding is this is likely to go back to the Lords and back to the Commons again,” he said.“What we have looked for here is an exemption for any non-Irish or British nationals who are resident in Ireland to be able to cross without having to get an ETA (Electronic Travel Authorisation), but as I say, that’s an ongoing conversation and as far as we’re concerned, that legislative process hasn’t concluded yet.”MPs at Westminster on Tuesday night voted to reinstate the requirement of a US-style visa waiver for non-Irish EU citizens crossing the Border as part of the proposed regime. The British government challenged an amendment introduced in the House of Lords, which would have exempted Northern Ireland from the legislation. Mr Coveney – who met Mr Lewis under the auspices of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference at Farmleigh House in Dublin – said on Tuesday night following the Commons’ vote that the Irish position had been “ignored”.He said that since the peace process was agreed, the relationship between North and South “has been based on uninterrupted travel opportunities and movement of people and we think that’s worth protecting”. “Northern Ireland, and the island of Ireland in terms of the relationships between North and South, is a very unusual construct and series of relationships and treaties and agreements,” he said, adding that it was “not for the first time we’ll be asking for special treatment to try to protect that relationship”. Mr Lewis said the decision to move ahead with the ETA legislation had nothing to do with reported concerns in the British government about whether Ukrainian refugees could cross into the UK. The plan had been in development for years and was “completely separate” to the Ukraine crisis, he said. The measure could affect as many as 645,000 non-Irish nationals living in the Republic - almost 13 per cent of the population, which will increase again with the arrival of Ukrainians fleeing the invasion by Russia. Sinn Féin reactionSpeaking in the Dáil, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the proposal would create “a disgraceful situation” which undermined the Belfast Agreement and Common Travel Area. “It creates significant restrictions on freedom of movement across our island,” she said. Ms McDonald said she found it “wholly unacceptable” for a Polish person who lived and worked in Lifford, Co Donegal, would need papers to travel to Strabane, Co Tyrone, and that this was the reality “or so many people living in our Border region”. She urged the Taoiseach to intervene with British prime minister Boris Johnson and “to call this out”. Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath said the Government stood “foursquare behind the Common Travel Area and the open Border in all respects. We do not in any way support or endorse the decision that was taken in the House of Commons. We have serious concerns about the proposal for an electronic travel authorisation system. “We do not believe it is either practical or fair to seek to distinguish between EU citizens from another member state versus Irish citizens for example going over and across the Border.”The SDLP’s Lilian Seenoi-Barr, the only elected councillor in the North from a minority ethnic background, said Westminster’s Nationalities and Borders Bill will lead to more “racial profiling” and stigmatizing of minorities. “It is a racist bill,” she said. “It will strengthen the invisible hard border that already exists for non-Irish and non British citizens.”Ms Seenoi-Barr, a former asylum seeker from Kenya, added: “People like myself, who are black and brown, will be suspect communities. We will be asked to prove that we have the right to be on this island. How else can you tell if someone is Irish or British?” SDLP South Belfast MP Claire Hanna said the proposed legislation would be “hugely disruptive” for non-Irish or UK citizens living on the island, while damaging the North’s tourism industry. “This is a terrible piece of legislation overall, with a horrible approach to refugee and asylum issues,” she said, adding that it went “against the spirit” of the Common Travel Area. Troubles’ amnestyRegarding Westminster’s proposed amnesty for Troubles-era legacy crimes, mooted last year in the face of a backlash from victims groups and others, Mr Lewis said the move had not proceeded because the government wanted to consult with parties and civil society bodies in Northern Ireland. “We want to bring something forward that helps people of Northern Ireland get to the truth and get information,” he said, adding that he would not put a timeframe on that. Mr Coveney said the issue could not be forgotten “because the current status quo in terms of getting the truth and securing prosecutions and so on isn’t as it should be for many families and victims groups”. He said the Irish Government’s position was that the strictures of the Stormont House agreement on legacy cases was the agreed position. However, he added: “We also have accepted that if some want to move in a different direction, we’ll listen to those arguments and see if we can agree in places to move forward. We’re still very open to that engagement and partnership.”On comparisons drawn by British prime minister Boris Johnson between the Brexit vote and the Ukranian resistance to Russia’s invasion, Mr Coveney said Mr Johnson had clarified them and that his spokespeople had recognised “that’s not a good comparison to have in the same sentence”.A joint communique issued by the ministers after the meeting said they had discussed the development of the British-Irish relationship in the coming years, including “potential synergies” between the UK’s levelling up plan and Ireland’s National Development Plan. It noted “with regret” the developments at Stormont since it last met in December and reiterated commitments from both governments to the functioning of the political institutions established by the Belfast Agreement.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"british and irish relationship should be based on equal respect says starmer","story":"Labour leader Keir Starmer speaks to the Labour Party Irish Society Annual St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre. Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireBritish Labour party leader Keir Starmer has called for a relationship between Britain and Ireland based on equal respect that acknowledges both governments’ roles as co-guarantors of the Belfast Agreement rather than simply consultees.He said the relationship had been dominated by Brexit in recent years but it had a rich and long history that was bigger than the current dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol.“And I felt they were some of the most uplifting years in my working life because there was so much progress going on, so much change going on. You could feel it, you could see it, you could sense it when you were there.

Other speakers included Trade Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O’Grady, Labour MP Conor McGinn, who chairs Westminster All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain and Adrian O’Neill, Ireland’s ambassador to Britain.Mr O’Neill said that this year’s St Patrick’s Day events in London had been conceived as a celebratory return to personal contact after two years of the coronavirus pandemic but they had been overshadowed by the war in Ukraine.“To some extent, we have to kind of dial it down a little bit or at least recognise that while we are enjoying this opportunity to meet in person and celebrate all the things that we really cherish, our democracy, our human rights, our independence, sovereignty, all of those core values that they are absolutely now being trampled on in Ukraine,” he said.“In Ireland, we’re working very, very closely with the UK, with the US with like-minded partners in the Security Council of the UN, within the EU, the Human Rights Council in Geneva, the International Criminal Court, using all the mechanisms at our disposal to isolate and increase pressure on Putin and his regime.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics a disappointing patrick s day for the taoiseach covid s resurgence","story":"Hugh catches up with Pat Leahy, fresh from his trip to Washington for Micheál Martin’s ill-fated St Patrick’s Day visit.

The words “child” or “children” are not used.The public is able to submit responses on the UK Covid-19 Inquiry website until midnight on April 7.Responding to the publication of the terms of reference, Dame Rachel de Souza, Children’s Commissioner for England, called for the inquiry’s scope to be widened to explore the impact on social services because of a number of harrowing high-profile cases which “shocked us all and where the strictures of managing the pandemic evidently played a role”. Her comments come following the deaths of 16-month-old Star Hobson, who died of “catastrophic injuries” inflicted on her at her West Yorkshire home in September 2020.Following a seven-week trial, Star’s mother Frankie Smith, 20, and her partner, Savannah Brockhill, 28, were convicted over her death.Five referrals were made to social services by concerned friends and family in the eight months leading up to Star’s death - but the authority repeatedly closed the case.A joint statement from safeguarding agencies in Bradford said they “deeply regret” missing warning signs in Star’s case.The case drew parallels with that of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, who was murdered in Solihull borough in June 2020. The six-year-old boy suffered a campaign of abuse and was left with an unsurvivable brain injury at the hands of his father and his partner. In December, Emma Tustin was jailed for at least 29 years for Arthur’s murder while her partner, Arthur’s father Thomas Hughes, was given a 21-year sentence for manslaughter.The pair’s trial heard Arthur had been poisoned with salt by Tustin and subjected to regular beatings by both adults. He was also given punishments such as being denied food and drink and being made to stand for hours alone in a hallway.During the trial, it emerged social workers from Solihull Council had visited the boy’s home in the months before he died and found no issues, despite relatives raising concerns.Commenting on the Government’s Covid inquiry, Dame Rachel told The : “I have spent my first year in this role committed to putting the voice of children at the heart of recovery from the pandemic. “During it, many children had significant setbacks in their lives which I am confident we can, and we must, help them recover from but also help them flourish into the future. “That sacrifice they made to keep us all safe should be acknowledged. They have told me, in unprecedented numbers, they want recovery, and they want support in getting back to normal.“I think it’s what this generation deserves, to be heard and to be helped. It is also true that during this period some children paid a terrible, ultimate price, in cases that have since shocked us all and where the strictures of managing the pandemic evidently played a role.“I would be keen to see the experiences of children, and the effects on children’s social care, more widely considered than the current draft of the inquiry’s parameters currently reflects.”The  has been running a campaign calling on ministers to put children first as the country recovers from its Covid lockdowns.It comes after a group of MPs, led by Robert Halfon, the chairman of the Commons education select committee, called for the closure of schools to form a “significant part” of the Covid Inquiry.In a letter sent to Baroness Hallett, the MPs also asked for the impact of the pandemic on young people’s mental health and on their “life chances” to be considered.Anna Edmundson, head of policy and public affairs at the NSPCC, added: “The lockdowns left some vulnerable children and young people trapped in violent homes with little means of escape from the increased threat of domestic, physical and sexual abuse.“It is vital the difficulties, hardship and suffering faced by the younger generation over the past couple of years are fully examined and reflected upon in the Covid Inquiry, with the learnings that come out of it being used by Government to help those in need now and to ensure we are better prepared in the future.”       Helen Hayes MP, Labour’s Shadow Minister for Children and Early Years, added that throughout the pandemic “the Government has treated children as an afterthought”. “Vulnerable children were let down time and again, with huge impacts on learning, mental health, and wellbeing. The government’s dither and delay simply means this inquiry is starting far too late.”A Government spokesperson said: “Following the publication of the draft Covid Inquiry terms of reference, there is now an ongoing period of public engagement and consultation being led by Baroness Hallett to inform further changes to the terms before they are finalised. The experience of children is in scope of the inquiry.”More from NewsBritish Summer Time 2022: How Chris Martin\u0026#39s great-great-grandfather ensured our clocks go forwardRussia-Ukraine latest news: Putin pulling back from urban war to \u0026#39limit considerable losses\u0026#39Military wives become first all-female group to recreate the Heroes of Telemark missionUkraine morning briefing: Five developments as Zelensky refuses to sacrifice territory for peaceCaught with his trousers down: How one soldier’s careless capture sums up Russia’s invasion debacleDon’t mention the war at Beijing’s only Ukrainian restaurantMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"secret life alina kabaeva star gymnast became putins eva braun","story":"Beautiful, talented and with an Olympic gold medal to her name, Alina Kabaeva was once regarded as the most eligible woman in Moscow. Today, though, she has a rather less desirable epithet, as “Russia’s Eva Braun”.Kabaeva, 38, is the former gymnast turned politician who is widely believed to be the girlfriend, or possibly the wife, of Vladimir Putin. She is even rumoured to have given birth to four children by the Russian president, though reports of any relationship between the two have always been denied by the Kremlin.As Putin commits ever greater atrocities in Ukraine, Kabaeva and her children are reportedly holed up in a Swiss chalet, facing growing demands to be extradited back to Russia.“It’s time you reunite Eva Braun with her Führer,” says a Change.org petition to the Swiss government signed by almost 64,000 people at the time of writing, comparing her to the woman who married Adolf Hitler in his Berlin bunker the day before they both took their own lives.Opponents of Putin believe Kabaeva is in hiding near Lugano, a quiet lakeside city known for its celebrated chocolate museum, though there is no proof she is even in Switzerland. Other reports place her in an underground bunker in Siberia’s Altai Mountains.Needless to say, facts about Putin’s private life are hard to pin down. One thing we do know is that the 69-year-old dictator is orced from his first wife, Lyudmila Shkrebneva, which was confirmed in 2014, six years after Kabaeva was first romantically linked with Putin.“I have a private life in which I do not permit interference,” Putin has said. “It must be respected.” He has also criticised “those who with their snotty noses and erotic fantasies prowl into other people’s lives”.This, though, has done little to quell the rumours, according to which Kabaeva continues to be Russia’s secret first lady, paid a £7.7 million salary for her job controlling a pro-Kremlin media group.Dr Elisabeth Schimpfössl, a senior lecturer at Aston University and author of Rich Russians: From Oligarchs to Bourgeoisie, says she has heard rumours that “Vladimir Putin and Alina live together in the Kremlin”. There are plenty of clues that point to a long-term relationship between the two, and to the origins of Putin’s interest in her, dating back to at least 2008 and possibly much earlier.Born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, in 1983, Kabaeva’s father was a professional footballer and her mother played basketball for the national side, but she is said to have left her roots firmly in the past once success came her way. Kabaeva is said to have started rhythmic gymnastics at the age of five, and her parents took her to Moscow where she was taken under the wing of Irina Viner, a former Soviet-era coach.By the age of 13 she was competing for Russia, and she went on to win 14 world championship medals, 21 European championship medals and Olympic gold at the 2004 Athens Games. A doping conviction in 2001 saw her stripped of the world title she had won that year.The source who knew her when she was in her early 20s said she lived at the time in a “modest and quite Soviet” flat near the Central Moscow Hippodrome, decorated with small glass ornaments, and described her as “a sweet girl – simple, nice and friendly”. She seemed to want companionship more than anything. “I think she’d been put in that flat and it was quite new that she was living on her own, rather than living with her mother, who was pretty involved,” says the source.At the time, Kabaeva had a boyfriend, a Moscow-based policeman originally from Georgia, who “overnight became a colonel and got promoted wildly up the ranks”, says the source. “She talked to me about him and looked quite proud.”Her confidence clearly grew in line with her success as a gymnast. She became so popular that a Russian pop band recorded a song about her entitled Alina. Nor was she particularly modest about her talents. “Being a star in gymnastics is not just about skill,” she told one interviewer, “It is also about personality. Look at me. I don’t want to be rude, but everyone wants to be like Alina Kabaeva.”Dr Schimpfössl says it was through sport rather than politics that Kabaeva met Putin. Viner, who married the oligarch Alisher Usmanov, introduced them, she says. In 2001, Putin was pictured beside Kabaeva as he awarded her an Order of Friendship (a state decoration) at the Kremlin.Kabaeva’s relationship with the Georgian policeman reportedly ended in 2005 amid complaints of tabloid intrusion into her life. She is on record as saying subsequently she had met a man who “I love very much”, adding: “Sometimes you feel so happy that you even feel scared.” Described as Russia’s most flexible woman, she retired from gymnastics after 2004, but made a brief comeback in 2007, by which time her sights were firmly set on politics. It was in that year that Kabaeva was elected to the State Duma, representing the pro-Putin United Russia party.The source next saw her in 2008, by which point Kabaeva’s life appeared to have changed dramatically. The source was attending an awards ceremony in Russia, where Putin himself was present. “We had a massive formal dinner and afterwards I looked over and saw this girl in a white Grecian dress and realised, ‘Oh my God, it’s Alina,” she says.She was shocked by how much weight Kabaeva had gained, but a fellow guest told her, “Well, she’s pregnant.” He also told her Kabaeva was in a relationship with Putin.  The source witnessed no physical interaction between the gymnast and Putin that evening, but she noticed the attention Kabaeva was attracting from others: “There was a circle of people staring at her as she twirled around.” Her career had branched into modelling and hosting a television chat show called Steps to Success, and in 2014 she announced she was quitting parliament to take control of the pro-Kremlin National Media Group. In November last year, The Insider, a Russian investigative journalism website, reported she was paid an annual salary of 785 million roubles (£7.7 million), basing the figure on leaked tax records for 2018.She is reported to have been seen wearing a wedding ring and there have been claims she and Putin married in the Iversky Monastery in the Valdai hills between Moscow and St Petersburg.Rumour has it that she gave birth to a son by Putin, named Dima after one of the president’s close friends, followed by a daughter and then twins, all of whom are said to have Swiss passports. In 2015, Switzerland’s Bick tabloid reported Putin had flown to Switzerland to be with Kabaeva as she went into labour at the private Clinic Sant’Anna near Lugano, although Putin’s spokesman insisted that “information about the birth of a baby fathered by Vladimir Putin does not correspond to reality”. The twins are said to have been born in 2018, after which Kabaeva disappeared from public view for almost three years.She resurfaced last August, appearing on a state television channel to criticise Tokyo judges who deprived Russian star Dina Averina of gold in rhythmic gymnastics.In December, as tension between Russia and Ukraine ramped up, it was reported she was seen dancing at a party in Moscow’s Voskhod restaurant, not far from the Kremlin, resplendent in a glittering gold dress. The party followed an experimental rhythmic gymnastics international tournament called Divine Grace, which she herself had organised.In keeping with the status that she would command as Putin’s wife, she reportedly has a fleet of limousines at her disposal and has made visits to a Moscow café surrounded by security guards armed with machine guns.If she has indeed decamped to Switzerland lately, it is unclear how long she might remain. “Please decide whether the residence of this inidual in your country is warranted,” implores the petition to the Swiss government. “It’s time Switzerland takes action.”More from NewsBritish Summer Time 2022: How Chris Martin\u0026#39s great-great-grandfather ensured our clocks go forwardRussia-Ukraine latest news: Putin pulling back from urban war to \u0026#39limit considerable losses\u0026#39Military wives become first all-female group to recreate the Heroes of Telemark missionUkraine morning briefing: Five developments as Zelensky refuses to sacrifice territory for peaceCaught with his trousers down: How one soldier’s careless capture sums up Russia’s invasion debacleDon’t mention the war at Beijing’s only Ukrainian restaurantMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cleaning rivers not customers priority list water company boss","story":"Water companies have not done more to end the practice of polluting rivers because it was not on their customers’ “priority list”, the head of one of the worst-offending companies has said.Liv Garfield, the chief executive of Severn Trent, said spending more money on reducing sewage overflows into rivers would not have been good business because it had not been on the public’s radar until recently.“We spend our money on the activities that customers desire,” Ms Garfield told The . “Even two years ago, it wasn\u0027t on the priority list.”Ms Garfield, who joined Severn Trent in 2014, said the issue had not risen to public consciousness until 2020.That was the year when all water companies were forced to produce extensive data on how often they released sewage into rivers.Ms Garfield said it was a consequence of people connecting with nature during the Covid-19 lockdowns that had shifted public opinion.“The thing that\u0027s changed, I think, with Covid people are suddenly out and about more,” she said.“Until the perception became so big, it was a compliance activity that isn\u0027t causing river harm spending more money on it wouldn\u0027t have felt like the best, perfect spend of money.”She said water companies had been “investing £12 billion into river quality as a sector over the last few years.”She added: “In the course of that time, we’ve delivered in line with what we’ve been asked to deliver around river quality.”Water companies are allowed to release sewage into rivers in extreme circumstances such as heavy rainfall, to avoid flooding homes.But data collected since 2020 has shown storm overflow systems are being used on a daily basis in a potential breach of licences. analysis found companies were frequently using such storm overflows even during dry weather, with Severn Trent among the worst offenders.More than 60 per cent of England’s river courses are classified as moderate to bad ecological status because of the impact of storm overflows, according to a recent report commissioned by the environment ministry and the water industry.The report also found that the majority of rivers are not swimmable for the same reason.The potential misuse of storm overflows across the industry is now the subject of investigation by the Environment Agency and regulator Ofwat announced last year.Ms Garfield acknowledged the investigation, which has not singled out Severn Trent, saying it was “not a good look for the sector”.“It’s reputationally damaging to us, that\u0027s clear,” she said.Ofwat has turned its focus in recent months to executive pay, calling for companies to ensure pay and bonuses are linked to environmental performance.The regulator has also raised the prospect of clawing back bonuses if water companies were found to be dumping sewage illegally.Ms Garfield, who is one of the highest-paid chief executives in the industry, earning £2.8 million in 2020, said the issue of pay was “a tricky one to get into”.“Certainly my remuneration is heavily linked to performance,” she said. “I think people should judge us on environmental metrics. And I think we’ve proven to be a strong performer, if not the strongest, on those metrics.”Severn Trent has now announced a series of promises to combat pollution, including a pledge to reduce spills from storm overflows to an average of 20 per year by 2025.They have also promised to ensure their own activities are not the reason for unhealthy rivers by 2030.Ms Garfield said public appetite for environmental improvement was now “almost like a hungry child”.“What\u0027s clear is the expectation to go much quicker, is definitely there,” she said.  “People don\u0027t like it. So we\u0027re saying, ‘Okay, we\u0027ll lean into it’.”She defended Severn Trent’s record on protecting rivers in their region, and said that since privatisation in the 1990s, levels of ammonia in sewage have been cut by 70 per cent, and phosphates by 90 per cent.“It\u0027s not like we\u0027ve just been doing nothing for the last 25 years,” she said.More from NewsBritish Summer Time 2022: How Chris Martin\u0026#39s great-great-grandfather ensured our clocks go forwardRussia-Ukraine latest news: Putin pulling back from urban war to \u0026#39limit considerable losses\u0026#39Military wives become first all-female group to recreate the Heroes of Telemark missionUkraine morning briefing: Five developments as Zelensky refuses to sacrifice territory for peaceCaught with his trousers down: How one soldier’s careless capture sums up Russia’s invasion debacleDon’t mention the war at Beijing’s only Ukrainian restaurantMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"le pen gains macron french presidential race tightens final","story":"Emmanuel Macron’s lead has slipped two weeks before the French presidential election, with far-Right leader Marine Le Pen and Left-wing firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon both making gains in the race for a place in the run-off.Mr Macron still has a comfortable lead ahead of the two-round vote on April 10 and April 24, and is on track to become the first French president to win re-election since Jacques Chirac.The latest IFOP daily poll places Mr Macron on 28.5 per cent of voter intentions for the first round, ahead of Ms Le Pen on 20 per cent and Mr Mélenchon on 14 per cent.Support for Valérie Pécresse, the hope of the mainstream Right, has meanwhile slipped to 11.5 per cent, neck-and-neck with extreme-Right polemicist Éric Zemmour.Mr Macron has benefited from a sizeable bump in his ratings since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with voters largely backing his efforts to find a way out of the conflict.But the “rally round the flag” effect has started to wear off. The president has dropped down 1.5 points over the past week, according to IFOP, although he remains four points up from his position before the start of the war.“Macron is complacent,” charged Philippe Marlière, Professor of French and European politics at University College London.“He hasn’t been seen much on the campaign trail. There are reasons for that – he’s the incumbent president, he’s very busy, notably with the war in Ukraine. However, the nearer we get to election day, I think that may be a problem.”Mr Marlière predicted that the president’s share of the vote could ultimately come in well below the current 28-30 per cent predicted by pollsters as voters flock to candidates who have gone to more effort to explain their policy platforms.Meanwhile, the wind is back in the sails of Ms Le Pen, who is up 2.5 points in the IFOP poll compared to a week earlier.The leader of the Rassemblement National has clawed back some of the support she had lost to Mr Zemmour, scooping up votes from those unhappy with his previous outspoken support for Vladimir Putin.Ms Le Pen has also spent months campaigning on cost of living measures, which has resonated with voters as the Ukrainian conflict drives fuel and food prices ever higher.A repeat of the 2017 election, pitting Mr Macron against Ms Le Pen in the run-off, remains the most likely scenario. But Mr Mélenchon, a veteran Left winger, is hoping to trigger an upset.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Putin pulling back from urban war to \u0026#39limit considerable losses\u0026#39Military wives become first all-female group to recreate the Heroes of Telemark missionBritish Summer Time 2022: How Chris Martin\u0026#39s great-great-grandfather ensured our clocks go forwardUkraine morning briefing: Five developments as Zelensky refuses to sacrifice territory for peaceCaught with his trousers down: How one soldier’s careless capture sums up Russia’s invasion debacleDon’t mention the war at Beijing’s only Ukrainian restaurantMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"saturday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph2","story":"Welcome to your early morning news briefing from The  - a round-up of the top stories we are covering today.

The millionaire Chancellor promised to help families with skyrocketing prices through a p fuel duty cut now, and a big rise in National Insurance thresholds in July.It’s £bn of tax cuts - but analysis shows it’s a drop in the ocean, as inflation soars close to % and the tax burden still rises overall between now and . The Resolution Foundation also slammed the Chancellor for giving £ out of every £ to the wealthier half, as there’s no new increase to benefits or cash help for energy bills. With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement saw him announce a cut in fuel duty, although this will cost the Treasury billions without putting cash back in familiesapos pockets. So how will the Spring Statement affect you The  huge big cost of living blows hitting you from next Friday What the fuel duty cut actually means - and whether weaposll see the dference in our pockets The Spring Statement  summaryaposs key announcements Everything you need to know about the National Insurance cut The UKaposs current inflation rate amid the Spring Statement - as Brits are left with crippling costsKeep up with live announcements from the Statement in the Mirroraposs live blogIf you need help with the cost of living crisis, weaposve put together a list of charities and schemes offering advice and grants to keep you and your family warm and fed this year. Boris Johnson said “it will continue to be tough, it will continue to be chippy, but we will get through it and we will look after people throughout”.But what do the charts from his own Treasury, watchdogs, and independent think tanks say  We’ve taken a look at  that highlight the enormity of the problems facing the economy... Inflation is rocketing to a -year high  Inflation is due to rocket to .% on average in   and could peak at nearly %. The Office for Budget Responsibility said the rise “will erode real incomes and consumption”, slashing GDP growth from a % forecast to .% this year. This graph highlights just how steeply inflation has climbedbeyond what experts thought it would hit five months ago , due to the Ukraine-Russia war. This will be the highest inflation in the history of the OBR, which was set up in .  This graph from the Office for Budget Responsibility shows the same inflation data but going back to . It shows inflation will peak above the .% it hit in  andto levels not seen since the early s. Disposable incomes will suffer the biggest drop since the s - at least  Brits’ household disposable incomes per person will fall .% in real terms in -, due to inflation outstripping wages. That is the biggest fall in a single year since records began in . And this is even after factoring in £ support for energy bills, the temporary cut in fuel duty and rise in National Insurance thresholds. The Office for Budget Responsibility said this help announced since October has offset around a third of the fall in living standards.  This Office for Budget Responsibility graph is an even starker way of portraying the same data. It shows disposable incomes only fell in real terms in nine years since the s - four of them since the Tories took power in . And the fall projected for - is by far the deepest, outstripping those in the s or the wake of the  financial crash. Wages are now £k lower than without the  crash  This shocking chart on wages from the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows the same problem in the starkest way yet.

It is still predicted to be .% of the UK’s entire GDP in . And the cost of servicing that debt rockets as inflation rises. Since the last forecast, the cost of servicing the national debt has risen by more than £billion in - alone.  This chart shows the same data but with a longer timescale, showing how debt was more than double Britain’s GDP after the Second World War - but fell steadily as the decades rolled on. That falling of debt continued through the s and stayed low until the financial crash. It jumped, then climbed further under the Tories. Rishi Sunakaposs new apostax cutsapos do exist - but overall itaposs still a tax hike  Rishi Sunak boasted he’d become the tax-cutting Chancellor with cuts to National Insurance, fuel duty and a p income tax cut from April .But the IFS think tank has warned the tax burden will in fact be rising, not falling, overall because frozen thresholds will drag .million more people into paying income tax. In this chart, the Office for Budget Responsibility finds the Chancellor’s tax cuts barely make a dent in all the tax rises that have been announced in . The OBR found previously announced tax rises will add .% of GDP to the tax burden - already the highest in decades - by  . The freeze on fuel duty, change to National Insurance and p income tax cut in  will lower that tax burden by just .%.  This is a dferent way of looking at the same information on tax. In this chart, the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows how ‘Illusionist’ Rishi Sunak is in fact raising taxes on Brits - not cutting them. A median earner on £, will be £ worse off in   than   - a £k earner will be nearly £ worse off. Boris Johnson claimed the Chancellor had “cut taxes for working people by, I think, the biggest single amount for the last  years.” The IFS said this is technically true. But IFS Director Paul Johnson said: “He can now expect to raise more in tax as a share of national income by  than he expected last October. In fact, taxes are set to rise to their highest level as a fraction of national income since Clement Attlee was prime minister.”  This graph shows just how fast the tax burden has shot up to a record high since Covid. The OBR warns the tax burden overall will reach .% of GDP in - - the highest level since the late s. That’s up from % of GDP in -.

The telegenic Chancellor was praised for the generosity of the furlough scheme and his slick performances at the Covid press conferences. Sunak is now discovering that popularity can be as superficial as the images on his Instagram account. His Spring Statement did not just land badly, it belly-flopped. There was nothing extra to help people with the cost of living, an additional .million people will be dragged into poverty and workers are going to be hit with higher taxes. Those who had shares in Sunak are now trying to offload them before then reach the status of a Russian rouble. The fall in Sunak’s stock seems to have happened overnight. But the Chancellor’s downfall has been in the making ever since he stepped into Number . He was presented by his slick PR machine as a slightly nerdy guy who wears a hoodie to work, has a nice haircut and wouldn’t offend your motheryou brought him round to dinner.  He was a safe pair of hands whose grasp of detail and measured manner offered a reassuring contrast to the bumbling, chaotic style of Boris Johnson. That’s what made him an appealing prospect for many voters - especially moderate conservatives - as a potential future leader. But beneath the soft-speaking and cosy leisurewear was a Thatcherite Tory, whose privileged upbringing, private education and vast family wealth has apparently left him struggling to understand the real world.For example, the Government was today forced to admit the Chancellor had borrowed a Kia Rio from a Sainsbury’s garage employee for a staged photo of him filling up with petrol with a broad grin. Downing Street said he paid for the petrol himself. In an interview yesterday morning, Mr Sunak said the food item where he’d most notice a price increase was bread, because “we have all dferent breads in my house.” The gaffe led to him being branded “Rishi Antoinette” on Twitter.  And the same day, footage emerged of Mr Sunak apparently struggling to pay for a tiny can of Coca-Cola in a shop, because he kept trying to tap his contactless card on the bar code reader. He once in an interview described himself as a “massive Coke addict” - which he quickly claried, meant the drink. But he also revealed he was a cola snob, and prefers the formula only available by importing bottles from Mexico. He won’t touch the Diet or Zero ieties. Evidence of his expensive tastes doesn’t end there.  Photos ahead of his first budget in March  saw him pose up with a £ bluetooth coffee mug, which can be temperature controlled from an app on his phone. It’s been claimed the Chancellor’s favourite snack is a truffle-flavoured crisp made by Torres, which costs as much as £ a bag from posh department store Fortnum and Mason’s.  In pictures released before his  budget in October, the Chancellor was shown wearing £ designer flip flops made by LA brand Palm Angels and sold in Selfridge’s. And he revealed in  that he starts the day with a ride on his £, Peloton exercise bike, where he enjoys online classes hosted by Instagram-friendly New York trainer Cody Rigsby.  In December , just days after freezing public sector pay for millions of workers, the Mirror revealed he had dined with his we, Akshata Murthy, at Mayfairaposs  Hertford Street - known as Londonaposs most secretive private membersapos club. The Mirror understands Mrs Murthy - whose vast wealth reportedly puts her higher up the rich list than the Queen - planned to hold a surprise party for Mr Sunak’s th birthday at the same private club in , but Covid- restrictions got in the way. Mrs Murthy’s business interests came under the spotlight today amid questions about whether Mr Sunak’s family had benefited from interests in Russia.  Mr Sunak was forced to deny profiting from Vladimir Putin’s regime, after being asked about Mrs Murthy’s reported stake in Infosys, an IT firm founded by her billionaire father N.R. Narayana Murthy. Just last week, Mr Sunak warned businesses to “think carefully” about making investments in Russia. But unlike other ministers, Mr Sunak has resisted calls to declare his we’s shareholdings on the Register of Members’ Interests. He insists he “followed the ministerial code to the letter.”  And Mr Sunak’s decision making was called into question long before his failure to deliver help for working families in Wednesday’s mini-Budget. Analysis found his “Eat Out to Help Out” campaign failed to deliver a long-term boost to struggling restaurants and cafes, knocked sideways by the pandemic. Studies did suggest, however, that it helped to push up infections - with the scheme linked to a spike of between  and %.

Families across the country are worried about rising food and fuel costs, soaring inflation and rocketing energy bills. A bold Chancellor would have seized this opportunity to deliver a new economic deal for the British people. Instead we got some tinkering with the tax system and a promise of more support further down the line. When families needed shelter from the economic downpour, the Chancellor offered the equivalent of raising a cocktail umbrella in the middle of a hurricane. Almost all the indicators on the economic dashboard are flashing red.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section Growth forecasts have been slashed, inflation is set to rise to a -year high and the country is set for the biggest fall in living standards since . What support Mr Sunak did provide was either too paltry to make a signicant dference, such as the cut in fuel duty, or a piece of fiscal sleight of hand. Nothing The raising of the National Insurance threshold and the promised cut in income tax will not compensate for the tax hikes coming into force next month. Overall, the tax burden is set to rise to its highest level since the Second World War. Mr Sunak’s claim to be a low-tax Chancellor is as absurd as his claim he was “standing by” families during the cost-of-living crisis. Get the stories you want straight to your inbox.toone of the Mirroraposs newslettersThere was no extra support to help people with energy bills even though they are set to increase by £, on average by this autumn. And there was nothing to help pensioners, the very low-paid and those on social security. Mr Sunak is condemning more people to poverty and more people to choose between heating and eating. Despite Conservative claims that the age of austerity is over, our public services will now receive less funding than originally announced.

A typical working-age household will see their real income fall % next year - a loss of £,, the Resolution Foundation think tank said. Absolute poverty - rather than relative poverty - is crucial because it is the measure Boris Johnson chooses to use.In  the PM controversially boasted poverty had fallen when relative poverty was up and absolute poverty was down. It comes after the Budget watchdog said soaring inflation - expected to nudge % in a four-decade high - will inflict the biggest disposable income drop since records began in the s. And today the Foundation warned poorer Brits will be hit harder as the Tory Chancellor refused to raise benefits - which will rise at less than half inflation. Meanwhile his £bn in cuts to National Insurance and fuel duty will mostly benefit people in work.Even with a p cut in income tax from , seven out of eight workers will still be paying more tax overall by , the overnight analysis found.The experts said: “The scale and distribution of the cost of living squeeze, coupled with the lack of support for low-income families, means that a further . million people are set to fall into absolute poverty next year, including , children – the first time Britain has seen such a rise outside of recessions.” With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement saw him announce a cut in fuel duty, although this will cost the Treasury billions without putting cash back in familiesapos pockets. So how will the Spring Statement affect you The  huge big cost of living blows hitting you from next Friday What the fuel duty cut actually means - and whether weaposll see the dference in our pockets The Spring Statement  summaryaposs key announcements Everything you need to know about the National Insurance cut The UKaposs current inflation rate amid the Spring Statement - as Brits are left with crippling costsKeep up with live announcements from the Statement in the Mirroraposs live blogIf you need help with the cost of living crisis, weaposve put together a list of charities and schemes offering advice and grants to keep you and your family warm and fed this year. Despite the tax cuts yesterday, the think tank said only those earning between £, and £, will actually pay less income tax in -. And only those earning between £, and £, will pay less tax and National Insurance . Of the  million people in work, around  millionwill pay more in income tax and NI in -, the think tank said. By  earnings will be £, behind what they would have beenthey had continued growing on the pre- path.  Torsten Bell, Chief Executive of the Resolution Foundation, said: “In the face of a cost of living crisis that looks set to make this Parliament the worst on record for household incomes, the Chancellor came to the dispatch box yesterday promising support with the cost of living today, and tax cuts tomorrow. Signicant measures were announced on both counts, but the big picture is that policy does not measure up to the rhetoric. “The decision not to target support at those hardest hit by rising prices will leave low-and-middle income households painfully exposed, with . million people, including half a million children, set to fall below the poverty line this coming year. “And despite the eye-catching p cut to income tax, the reality is that the Chancellor’s tax changes mean that seven-in-eight workers will see their tax bills rise. Those tax rises mean the Chancellor is able to point to a swt fiscal consolidation and signicant headroom against his fiscal rules. “The big picture is that Rishi Sunak has prioritised rebuilding his tax-cutting credentials over supporting the low-to-middle income households who will be hardest hit from the surging cost of living, while also leaving himself fiscal flexibility in the years ahead. Whether that will be sustainable in the face of huge income falls to come remains to be seen.”  Office for Budget Responsibility watchdog chairman Richard Hughes said despite the measures announced by Rishi Sunak, people still face an unprecedented fall in living standards. He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: So in total, they amount to about an £ billion giveaway in this spring statement coming from the Chancellor. That offsets around a third of the overall hit to living standards that people would otherwise have felt had he not taken those measures, so without the Chancellor taking action, people would have felt a % fall in their living standards in the coming  months. That reduces it down to around %, but itaposs still an unprecedented fall in peopleaposs standard of living over the next  months. Mr Hughes also said energy bills are doubling over the course of the year, rising by around % in April and another % in October.

He’s asking for us to come out and make a stand - for Ukraine, for freedom and for peace. Today, we are answering that call in London. We are organising a march through the centre of our great capital, followed by a vigil in Trafalgar Square, where thousands of people will come together to show their support for the Ukrainian people. We want to send an emphatic message to Ukrainians- you are not alone and we condemn Putin’s barbaric aggression. We will never stop raising our voices in support of the struggle for freedom, peace and democracy. Horric war crimes are being committed by the Putin regime, and this unprovoked invasion is causing the biggest refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War. We have all seen the heart-breaking images of innocent civilians being targeted, apartment blocks burnt out and children clutching their toys as they flee. I’ve been proud of the way people across our country have come forward to help Ukrainians in their hour of need - whether it’s by donating money or offering a home to refugees. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here  We have a moral duty to help and on Saturdayaposs march we will be saying loud and clear that we stand ready to welcome more Ukrainians with open arms. Refugees will always be welcome in London and given the support they need. That’s why I’m announcing that City Hall will be giving an extra £. million to ensure refugees get access to the vital services they require when they arrive.  Taking to the streets will also be crucial to keeping up the pressure on national governments – helping to ensure they continue to take the necessary action. So far, many international leaders, businesses and people around the world have been united in putting measures in place to support the Ukrainian people and to hold Putin’s regime accountable. One month on - as the war continues to rage and as Russian shells continue to rain down on innocent civilians in Ukrainian cities - we cannot allow our collective resolve to wane. Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section That’s why it’s more important than ever that we make our voices heard – so that we can ensure our government and governments around the world maintain focus, introduce even tougher sanctions and live up to all the promises made to refugees. We begin our solidarity march from Park Lane at pm.

But he said he had “always tried to be honest with people”, and said: “I can’t protect them from absolutely everything that we face.” Mr Sunak said he was “anxious” on behalf of the country and said he knew rising financial pressures were “the number one concern that people have right now”. Speaking on Beth Rigby Interviews on Sky News, he said: “Families are struggling with the rising cost of lots of things and that’s why in the spring statement I wanted to make sure that we demonstrated we were on people’s side, and we announced the tax plan that will deliver the biggest net cut taxes, net cut to personal taxes in two years, in quarter of a century taken together.” He said: “Where we can make a dference, we will, and I’m confident that the plan yesterday will do that.”  The Chancellor added: “I think what we’ve done is substantial. If you take together £ billion to help people with energy bills announced last month, the signicant tax cuts that we announced yesterday, they will all help. But of course they can’t mitigate all the dficulties that high inflation is causing. No chancellor could do that.”Earlier, Downing Street said ministers stood ready to provide further support to householdsrequired after Prime Minister Boris Johnson appeared to suggest more measures could be announced.Mr Johnson admitted it was “going to be tough” as households had to cope with rising prices and the cost-of-living squeeze. He said: “It will continue to be tough, continue to be choppy but we will get through it and we will look after people throughout.” Separately, he told LBC “as we go forward, we need to do more” and insisted the Government would “fix” the rising cost of living.Richard Hughes, chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, said on Thursday that despite the measures announced by Mr Sunak, people still face an “unprecedented” fall in living standards.The Institute for Fiscal Studiessaid the Chancellor had failed to protect the country’s poorest households. But Mr Sunak insisted he had “protected those on the lowest incomes the most” in recent years.  Asked about figures from the Resolution Foundation think tank, which said . million Britons were set to fall below the poverty line next year, including , children, Mr Sunak told Beth Rigby Interviews: “Well, I mean, what we do know is the track record, because there’s lots of projections and speculation about the future, but the track record shows that over the last  years, since we’ve had Conservative governments in charge, the number of people living in poverty has actually declined by about . million people. “That includes , children from memory. So actually, that’s a record that I’m proud of. “Now, obviously, a lot of that happened before I was in post. But the actions I’ve taken over the past couple of years have ensured that we have protected those on the lowest incomes the most.” Told that it felt like the country was being “gaslighted” by his reassurances amid the rising costs and as inflation rose, he said: “I’m not denying for one second that inflation is dficult. Of course it’s dficult, and it’s most dficult for those on lower incomes.” The Chancellor, who has been tipped as a potential successor to the PM, also failed three times to rule out that he could launch a leadership bid in the future. He read a quote from Mr Johnson, who said in  that being prime minister “would be a great, great thing to have a crack at”,“the ball came loose from the back of the scrum”, and askedhe felt the same. Mr Sunak said: “I’m much more a cricket and football fan, so I don’t know what the appropriate analogy is. But as we’ve talked about at the moment, there’s a lot going on, there’s a big job to do and I’m fully focused on doing that job and trying to do it as well as I can.” Asked again, with a cricket analogy,he would be interested, he said: “At this point, I’m just trying to stay at the crease and keep in place and not get out.” Asked a third time, this time with a football comparison, he said: “We’re stretching these analogies too far.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyRichard HughesBoris JohnsonEnergy billsLiving standardsPrice risesPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Heartfelt tributes have been paid to Martin Greenfield, who performed as “Honey Lingus”.Martin died at the age of  last week, after a struggle with illness and some mental health issues,Chronicle Live reports .As both Martin and Honey, they were much-loved as a performer and a friend, who will be remembered for their energy, light, joy, empathy. Trailblazing Martin is thought to have been one of the first black drag queens performing in Newcastle when they started their act in the s.  Close friend Mark Stephenson remembered them as a star that always shined bright. Mark has known Martin since they were both , when Martin moved to the North East from Hong Kong. The pair worked at popular club Powerhouse together, and Mark recalled how Honey began to come to le as Martin became a part of Newcastleaposs LGBTQ scene. He said: Martin was always bigger than le, very flamboyant, peopleaposs attention was always drawn to Martinaposs clothes and long nails. Back in , , when they started performing as Honey, she was probably one of Newcastleaposs first black drag queens. Martin was a perfectionist so they always looked unreal, absolutely beautul. Honey would work a room and was able to sing brilliantly, could always hold a note, and was very much a perfectionist in terms of being the most beautul person in the room. They did seasons in Ibiza, performing around the world as Honey and they loved that. Honey was really well-known around the gay scene in Newcastle. With a vibrant energy that couldnapost be ignored, Martin loved music and dance and worked with ious cultural organisations across the North East. Mark remembered fondly their love of music - Martin was once dancing so joyfully at a Diana Ross concert in Newcastle that they were invited up on stage - but also the quieter side of Martin, who loved nature, gardening and cooking. Mark said: Thereaposs Honey and thereaposs Martin and they are two dferent people. Honey is Martinaposs bigger-than-le persona. Martin was a very loving person who would give their all to everybody, they were very into growing things and learning new skills, spicing all the food they cooked up to the hilt. That was a dferent side of Martin. A fierce advocate for LGBTQ rights, Martin refused to let prejudice stop them from being themselves. Mark remembers a more hostile environment in the city in the s when Martin started performing, but on or off stage, they refused to be kept silent. He said: Martin was not scared of anything or being the first person to do anything. I remember when we were , walking round Newcastle, and Martin was quite obviously a gay person and people would shout aposp***apos or aposf*****apos and Iaposd be worried, but Martin would just own it, saying aposMark, these people donapost bother meapos. Martin was always very much at the forefront of fighting for what they believed in. I think Martin was someone who paved the path for people and they were definitely someone who did that by being themself, whether as Martin or when performing as Honey. Iaposm just so proud that I had them in my le, because I think my le would very much not have been the sameit wasnapost for Martin. Loved ones are set to say farewell to Martin in a natural burial ceremony and a celebration of their le and their family is currently raising money to commemorate them as they would have wished. On a GoFundMe page which has already collected more than £,, their brother, Steve Greenfield, said: From events with thousands of people down to intimate and real person-to-person conversations, Martinaposs beauty and warmth radiated to everyone. For my part, being sometime witness to the joy they brought, and knowing people in Martin’s many friendship circles, I can say their energy, light, joy, empathy and, at their best, glorious nature will echo, reverberate, and resonate always. Martin was a stunning, unique soul Honey a fierce and compassionate entertainer. Together their force led to a le, though shortened, that was full to the brim with experiences, events, friends and times of truly living. He added: We were all better for knowing Martin or Honey - or indeed both.

High air pollution warnings have been issued for parts of England, such as the Midlands, the South East, and North West. The high alert is in place from London to Ipswich and Cambridge, as well as further north to Nottingham and to Hull. According to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs , Leicester, Northampton, and Manchester are also among the places affected, along with spots along the south coast, including Brighton, Eastbourne and Hastings. Advice issued by DEFRA suggests adults and children with lung problems, and adults with heart problems, should “reduce strenuous physical exertion, particularly outdoors, and particularlythey experience symptoms”. “People with asthma may find they need to use their reliever inhaler more often.  “Older people should also reduce physical exertion,” the group added.Additionally, anyone experiencing discomfort such as sore eyes, cough or sore throat was advised to consider reducing activity, particularly outdoors. According to Sky News, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan warned that toxic air “is dangerous”, particularly for those with heart and lung problems.He urged residents to look after each other by walking, cycling, avoiding unnecessary car trips and stopping engine idling. He also asked people to withhold from burning wood or garden waste. Earlier this year Mr Khan said car use had ed to close to pre-pandemic levels and that the effect on residents could be disastrous.“If we do not double down on our efforts to deliver a greener, more sustainable future, we will replace one public health crisis with another – caused by filthy air and gridlocked roads,” he said.

Her mum, Laura Hindle, , watched in disbelief as she was rushed to hospital where she suffered a second stroke, leaving a third of her brain damaged and paralysing the left side of her body. Now eight years old, Victoria still suffers with hemiplegia , causing extreme fatigue and dficulty completing certain tasks.Stay at home mum, Laura told The Mirror : “I still to this day cannot get my head around it, it’s horric. “I had received a call from her school to say that she had taken a bit of a tumble in the playground but she was fine, so I said ‘thanks for letting me know’ and didn’t worry too much. “But then a couple of hours later I got another call to say she was very ill and I needed to come right away because they had called her an ambulance. “When I got there she had completely collapsed, she was just slumped up against one side of the room. She couldn’t talk to me or anything. “When the paramedics got there they asked her to put her hands above her head, but she could only lt her right arm.“Then they asked her to smile and there was a visible drop on one side. “For a split second it crossed my mind ‘she’s had a stroke’. “But then I told myself don’t be ridiculous, children don’t have strokes.” Victoria was rushed to hospital where tests confirmed Laura’s worst fears - she had experienced a stroke, but doctors were unable to determine any trigger or cause. Only the following day, while waiting for a scan with her parents in the hospital, Victoria experienced a second severe stroke, leaving her left side paralysed and damaging  per cent of her brain. Mum of four Laura said: “We were walking down the corridor and she turned around and said ‘my headache is coming back’. “Just as she put her hand to her head, she collapsed. “I had never heard of a child having a stroke, I was in shock, we couldn’t get to grips with what the doctors were talking about until they showed us her scans and we saw the damage. “To actually witness my child’s face visibly dropping on one side was horric, it was like something out of a horror film.” After extensive research, Laura has discovered a machine which would give Victoria the use of her arm again, by stimulating the nerves which send messages to the limb from the brain.Victoria has already benefited from temporary use of the Saebo-stimulator Pro machine in the weeks after her strokes while recovering at The Children’s Trust for children with brain injuries. But now Laura is desperate to give her daughter a “normal le” after admitting that some children have already started teasing Victoria for her injury.Now Laura has set up a GoFundMe to raise £, for the machine and therapy to help Victoria, with any proceeds spent on further rehabilitation which could aid a normal lestyle.She said: “People that don’t know Victoria might just think that she has had an injury because of her walk. “But she experiences extreme fatigue and she has a tendency to fall over a lot. “She’s already had some grief from other kids being unkind saying things like ‘you can’t play with us because you only have one arm’. “It’s dficult because children often don’t understand things they can’t see and a stroke is something you can’t see.“It’s heartbreaking to watch her sometimes because she wants so badly to be able to do something as simple as remove a pen lid without having to ask someone to do it for her, or putting her school tie on. “She’s such a bright and bubbly little girl, she loves dancing and playing just like any other child her age. “I want her to have access to everything anyone can expect from a normal le like being able to do her makeup when she gets older. “I always tell her, you’re no dferent to anybody , you just need a bit more time.”To donate to Victoria’s fundraiser, click here.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON StrokeHospitalsTherapy\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The furniture giant today published findings of a probe into surveillance cameras placed above  bathrooms at a distribution centre in Peterborough. Bosses installed cameras in toilet ceiling voids in November  to monitor staff membersapos alleged drug use and provision of  urine samples. But the investigation revealed that two cameras became dislodged and accidentally filmed communal areas in both a female and male bathroom. No footage was captured of toilet cubicles. An IKEA spokesperson said: Whilst the intention at the time was to ensure the health and safety of co-workers, we understand the fact that colleagues were filmed unknowingly in these circumstances will have caused real concern.  ‘For this we are sincerely sorry,” they continued. The cameras were operational until July  and were not recording when staff found them last September, the investigation said. It added that no CCTV was recorded in toilet cubicles and that footage showing staff in bathrooms was only seen during the independent investigation. An IKEA spokesperson added: Their [the camerasapos] installation followed serious concerns about the use of drugs onsite, which, owing to the nature of work carried out at the site, could have very serious consequences for the safety of our co-workers. The cameras placed within the voids were positioned only to record irregular activity in the ceiling voids. They were not intended to, and did not, record footage in the toilet cubicles themselves. “However, as a result of ceiling tiles becoming dislodged, two cameras inadvertently recorded footage of the communal areas of two bathrooms for a period of time in .

TV footage showed him scoffing down a pepperoni pizza and chatting with several military personnel. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here But Biden complained he was blocked from crossing the border to Ukraine.In an emotional speech, he also mentioned his grandfather and his late son Beau Biden who was an Iraq War veteran. Like you, he didnapost have to go either... the point is there are hundreds of thousands of people like my son, like all of you, so thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, he said. We have a sacred obligation in this government... to equip those we send to war and to care for them and their families when they come home, he said.  It comes as Biden was due to be briefed on the humanitarian response to help civilians sheltering from Russian attacks inside Ukraine and to respond to the growing flow of refugees fleeing Ukraine. Biden told reporters in Brussels yesterday that his visit to Poland will reinforce my commitment to have the United States make sure we are a major piece of dealing with the relocation of all those folks, as well as humanitarian assistance needed both inside Ukraine and outside Ukraine. The US President is due to travel to Warsaw to have talks with Polandaposs President Andrzej Duda. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan appeared to the United States and its allies could still impose new measures to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.During an emergency NATO summit in Brussels yesterday, leaders agreed to step up measures to protect Ukraine and members of the -country alliance from a Russian chemical or nuclear attack. Secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels: Today we agreed to do more including cyber-security assistance and equipment to help Ukraine protect against biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear threats. This could include detection equipment, protection and medical supplies, as well as training for decontamination and crisis management. Mr Stoltenberg said Natoaposs chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence elements had been activated and we are taking measures both to support Ukraine and to defend ourselves. Asked whether the move was based on credible intelligence, Mr Stoltenberg said: We are concerned, partly because we see the rhetoric and we see that Russia is trying to create some kind of pretext - accusing Ukraine, the United States, Nato allies - for preparing to use chemical and biological weapons. Earlier Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged NATO chiefs to send tanks and warplanes to his war-torn country so forces can repel Russian invaders.In a passionate video link plea to an emergency summit at the coalition’s headquarters, he warned leaders from the organisation’s  member countries that delays to vital equipment were costing lives. He fumed: “You have thousands of fighter jets but we havenapost been given any yet. “We asked for tanks so that we can unblock our cities that are now dying - Mariupol, Berdyansk, Melitopol, others - cities where Russia is keeping hundreds of thousands of people hostage and articially creating famine no water, no food, nothing there. “You have at least , tanks Ukraine asked for a per cent - one per cent of all your tanks to be given or sold to us - but we do not have a clear answer yet. “The worst thing during the war is not having clear answers to requests for help.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NatoU.S. ArmyJens StoltenbergJoe BidenNATO summitSoldiersPizzaOn Instagram\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The couple has been married for almost  years and royal wellwishers have been delighted with their hand-holding and dancing together. They have known each other since they were at university together and with Prince William a future king, he reportedly had no shortage of attention from girls. And when he settled down with Kate, many thought she was one very lucky lady. But when one of the now-Duchessaposs friends put this point to her, she reportedly had a brilliant response.  During their university days at St Andrews, a friend told Kate how lucky she was to be going out with William. And according to Claudia Joseph, author of Kate Middleton: Princess in Waiting, Smiling, Kate simply replied: Heaposs lucky to have me. Today marks the last day of William and Kateaposs Caribbean tour and they have several engagements lined up in the Bahamas before they fly home.

When they arrive home, they will be reunited with their three children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. The youngsters have been tracking their parentaposs progress on the tour - and it appears George is in charge of it. William explained that George has been sticking pins in a world map of each of the destinations his parents have visited and then sharing the information with both Charlotte and Louis.  He said: We let them know where we are and he finds us on the map and puts a pin in it and shares with the others. Theyaposll also be reunited with their kids on Motheraposs Day - and no doubt the little ones will want to show Kate their appreciation. So will she be in line for a lovely present  Or maybe a cake like last year  Last Motheraposs Day, Louis, George and Charlotte created the delicious treat in honour of both Kate and her mum Carole Middleton.  A heartwarming post on the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgeaposs Twitter page showed a picture of what appeared to be a Victoria Sponge next to a snap of Kate holding her mumaposs hand as a child. The photograph of the cake, which was adorned in hearts, was also shared on the Kensington Royal Instagram page.In their social media posts, the couple said: Celebrating two other special mothers today.

Ross Molloy runs RGM Brailsford Garage, the oldest petrol station in Derbyshire where the fuel has been flowing since .Rocketing fuel prices have made business very dficult for independent, local fuel stations, Leeds Live reported. He acknowledged that although some facilities may be marking up their prices to increase their profits, for the majority the hike is needed to simply break even. Ross said: People blame the retailer, like me. They are saying you are putting up the price, you are cashing in. Iaposve been making about p a litre profit on diesel and Esso down the road are selling it cheaper than I can buy it for.  I usually sell for around p more than Esso. I have to put it up because it comes to me at a high price. Iaposve almost been giving it away to be honest, and thataposs why there arenapost many small garages left. Ross says higher prices are being driven by his diesel supplier preferring him to buy larger quantities of fuels, a practice he says benefits big buyers. I canapost buy large amounts because modern fuels donapost keep. Diesel keeps for two or three months and then it is starting to go off in a tank, he said. The amount I sell,I bought , litres, which is what they want me to buy, it would be in the tanks for months before I sold it. I canapost buy a large amount because it wonapost keep, so I have to buy a smaller amount which is more expensive and I am hardly selling any of it.Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a p fuel duty cut on Wednesday.Although this is the biggest ever cut to fuel duty, motoring groups like RAC believe this wonapost make a big dference to motorists given the rocketing rise in fuel prices.Ross said: Anything is better than nothing, but the amount of tax we pay on fuel, to be honest itaposs just going to be a drop in the ocean. Yes it cancels the rise in price, but not by a lot. For the likes of me,the Chancellor knocks p off, it isnapost going to make much of a dference. Unfortunately, over the Christmas period a vehicle drove into the diesel pumps at the garage and they are yet to be repaired. But even before the accident, Ross was unable to afford his own diesel. Now, with the prices soaring further, Ross is unsure whether it is worth fixing the pumps.  He said: At the moment I am weighing up whether it is even worth getting them repaired for the amount I make out of it. It upsets me because this is the oldest petrol station in Derbyshire -  is when this place started selling fuel and although I donapost make anything out of the fuel, I donapost want to be the last person to sell fuel at the oldest petrol station in Derbyshire. Earlier this week a petrol station in Cha, west London was spotted selling petrol for £. a litre - around p more than the national average. After Sunakaposs announcement Asda, Tesco, Sainsburyaposs and Morrisons announced that they would be lowering the cost of their petrol. UK motorists are now being forced to pay an average of £. a litre for unleaded and £. a litre for diesel. On Wednesday RAC head of policy Nicholas Lyes warned that the Chancelloraposs decision to cut fuel duty would only help consumersretailers passed on the savings. There’s also a very real risk retailers could just absorb some or all of the duty cut themselves by not lowering their prices, he said. If this proves to be the case it will be dire for drivers. It also wouldn’t be totally unexpected based on the biggest retailers not reducing their prices late last year when the oil price fell sharply. Changes in prices at the pump are linked to the price of crude oil and the dollar exchange rate.

Many people are struggling to get by due to inflation and the rise in prices as they battle to heat their homes and put meals on the table.In the hospitality sector it is also having an impact with costs soaring and in pubs the cost of a pint of bitter has escalated over the past year.Marston’s, one of the biggest breweries in the country, has reportedly said that a pint is likely to break £ for the first time. The company owns six breweries and has more than , pubs and it has said it has had to raise prices due to rising prices including energy. Prices are going to go up between p and p at Marston’s, with the average price in the UK for a pint of beer £., reported The Sun. The cost of beer ies around the country, peaking in London where there is an average of £ and £. in Edinburgh but it is also over £ in many cities including Liverpool and Birmingham. “The price increase is a direct impact of the soaring energy prices and operating costs as being experienced by all businesses and households across the country,” a Marston’s spokesman said, reported The Sun. The Covid pandemic has put pubs under “financial pressure” reportedly said Nik Antona, from the Campaign for Real Ale. She said: “Our pubs have been under signicant financial pressure following two years of lockdowns, restrictions and partial closures, which is feeding these increases. “From rising energy bills and the cost of goods going up, to VAT increases and the end of business rates holidays, pub owners are feeling the squeeze from all sides.” Meanwhile, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has been branded out of touch as Brits face the biggest income drop since the s. He was asked by BBC Breakfast which food he noticed was rising in price in the supermarket as inflation looks set to near % this year.When the presenter said for her it was crisps, he laughed, and replied: “It’s probably, I think bread, probably is the thing. The one we buy I’m sure is now about £. and it was about £, from memory.” Asked what kind of bread, he replied: “It’s a Hovis kind of seeded thing. We have a whole range of dferent - we all have dferent breads in my house, a degree of healthiness between my we, myself and my kids.” It comes a day after Iceland’s boss said food bank users are “declining potatoes and root veg because they canapost afford the energy to boil them”.The Budget watchdog said despite Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement cutting some taxes, Brits will face the worst drop in disposable incomes next year since records began nearly  YEARS ago.

The author of Behind the Throne: A Domestic History of the British Royal Household says they would often call him P.P when in private – a shortening, of course, of Prince Philip. And according to Tinniswood, the witty royal was always the Palace staffaposs favourite member of the family.That was backed up by The Crown actor Matt Smith, who, before the royalaposs death last year, told Variety : If you’ve talked to any of the staff, Philip’s the one they all love really. Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section I think more than a lot of them, he’s a bit more of a man of the people. The royal protocol hasn’t dogged him in quite the same way his whole le and there’s a sort of rebellion in him and a naughtiness and a cheekiness. I think he’s quite affable and open by all accounts with the staff. They all love him.”The Queen has been given a number of nicknames over the years, including ‘Cabbage’ and ‘Lilibetapos - and ‘Gan-Gan’ by a young Prince George.It comes as another top author has claimed Philip told an aide “we were wrong about her all along” after discovering Prince Harry and Meghan Markle had quit the Royal Family. He was spitting blood after learning about the coupleaposs plan to step back and leave the UK behind, it has been said. Christopher Andersen, author of Brothers and Wives: Inside the Private Lives of William, Kate, Harry and Meghan, says he went straight to the Queen to express his “anger”. Furious Philip saw red after the couple decided to go public without informing the family first, he states.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex stunned the world in January  when they announced they will step back as senior royals and work to become financially independent on Instagram. Get the latest royal news and gossip straight to your inbox.to one of the Mirroraposs newsletters No other royal - including the Queen or Prince William - were consulted before the bombshell statement as Buckingham Palace spoke of its disappointment. In the book, the aide revealed Philip had no knowledge of the social media  but was “furious, deeply hurt, spitting blood” when he learned of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s joint announcement.According to the aide, Philip shouted “this shows a complete lack of respect” as he told the Queen of his anger.The book also claims both Philip and his son Charles had a warm relationship with Meghan but their view eventually changed. Andersen wrote the senior royals now viewed Meghan as a twenty-first-century Wallis Simpson – the American socialite who married the Duke of Windsor, former King Edward VIII after he abdicated in order to be with her more than  years ago. Philip then confided in one of his closest aides that: “It appears as , we were wrong about her all along.” The Duke of Edinburgh was not the only male royal who was angry by Harry and Meghan’s announcement.

The tot, from Hall Green, Birmingham, was born with a condition meaning bones in his leg werenapost growing properly, and the leg became shorter than it was supposed to. It caused foot and ankle abnormalities and mum Chloe was told he would likely never be able to walk again.So the single mum chose an amputation for her son so he can get a prosthetic leg and learn to walk. Ollie had the operation a month ago and he is now recovering without making much of a fuss. University student Chloe said: This was the first time he saw it - he was a bit shocked. He didnapost really understand why it had happened, he just knew it wasnapost there any more. Then it was straight back to watching TV for him - he wasnapost too bothered. In fact, he was more annoyed that I had to take him to hospital to get a new cast put on than the actual amputation! Ollieaposs condition, called fibular hemimelia, meant his fibula bone was missing and his tibia bone was half the size it should be. It caused his ankle to be twisted and he had toes missing.On February , the little boy went to Birmingham Childrenaposs Hospital and underwent a six-hour amputation of his right leg. Chloe said: The days leading up to the amputation were the most dficult - it was the anticipation of it. It was a massive relief once it was done. His leg before wasnapost painful but doing it now means he will be able to learn to walk with a prosthetic. He will grow up and wonapost remember a time before the amputation, so it will feel totally normal to him growing up. A month on, Chloe said the healing process is going well - and Ollie saw his stump for the first time after his cast came off on March . He had a cast re-applied after it came loose, but it will be off for good in a couple more weeks time. Soon after, he will be fitted for his first prosthetic leg, and he will begin learning to walk with that.

Britain has baked in highs of C over the last four days and the temperatures could be set to soar again from mid-April. That means egg hunts outside could be on again for millions after last yearaposs glorious Bank Holiday brought sweltering conditions as we tucked into chocolate on Easter Sunday. The British Weather Services claim that some parts of the UK may even enjoy C warmth in just three weeks time. Although the Met Office state it is too soon to know for sure how warm it will be at Easter, things are looking promising - eventhereaposs rain on the way before. Forecaster Stephen Dixon says we may be getting some reward after a soggy start to next month.He told the Mirror : From Tuesday we will start to see the influence of the cold air coming down from the north, it will start to be unsettled again on Wednesday.Going into April weaposre going to see more of that unsettled weather across the UK, thataposs for sure. The warmth wonapost last past this weekend, but itaposs probably not the last weaposve seen of it before summer.  There will be showers, heavy at times, but it will be more dryer in southern areas. Unfortunately we wonapost be getting the warmer weather we have enjoyed this week at the start of next month. However, there is potentially some good news - it will be much more settled by mid-April and the trends we are seeing are more encouraging. We canapost put numbers on it quite yet, but people can draw their own conclusions when we say there could be a , for many, to much more settled weather.  While the Met Office avoided saying how warm Easter could be, Jim Dale - the senior meteorologist at the British Weather Services - said there is a real possibility that some parts of the UK could see temperatures as high as C. “I know March is the start of Spring but I think we’re probably going to get properly into April before we start to see the searing sort of temperatures.” He added: “I wouldn’t be surprised to see °C, °C, °C in the middle of April. “Longer-term, given what’s happening globally in terms of the temperature profiles in the southern hemisphere and what’s also happening in the United States, I would not be surprisedwe started to see some big highlights.  A leading bookmaker has meanwhile has slashed the odds on this summer being the UKaposs hottest on record. Coral now make it - - down from from - - to break records. The weekend sunshine has got Brits dreaming of summer already said Coralaposs Harry Aitkenhead. With temperatures rising we have slashed the odds on the UK recording its hottest ever summer in . Early April The first few weeks of April follow a very similar theme all over the UK - itaposs going to be unsettled. There will be showers, some heavy, and the north of England will be the worst hit. The south will be less wet, but there wonapost be too much in the way of sun. Mid-April Things will start to warm up in the second half of April. Thereaposs hope it will be another very warm Easter, with some even predicting it will be hotter than last yearaposs C sizzler. Most of the country can expect warm and sunny spells after a drab start to the month. Late April and early May The Met Office say itaposs dficult to know yet in the sunny burst will last. Temperatures will drop from April  and early forecasts show cloud with C warmth. But, at the moment, it is expected to be a dry end to the month.

The dry, settled weather should continue into Sunday for most, though the warm weather may be slightly dampened by light fog and cloud on some North Sea coasts.  The warm days are limited, forecasters have warned, with temperatures expected to fall away towards the middle of next week. Some parts of the UK could be subject to snowfall as a cold snap could bring light flurries to higher ground in northern Scotland. By Monday temperatures will start to drop slightly but will remain dry and fine for most. And by Tuesday, more unsettled and cooler weather is expected from the middle of next week.  Met Office Chief Meteorologist Paul Gundersen said: “Although the UK has had a good deal of fine and settled March weather in recent days, a change is on the way from the middle of next week with colder air spreading down from the north and the increasing likelihood of rain for most areas. On the hills in the north, there’s a chance of this falling as snow, although we’ll gain more certainty on that in the coming days. “With the influence of some unsettled weather, we’ll be seeing a marked drop in temperatures for most with colder air arriving from the north.  This will see maximum temperatures drop into single figures for many areas, and below freezing overnight.” The chilly spell will be brought on by a cold air mass attempting to push into the north of the UK on Tuesday, before slowly sinking southwards. Forecasters have warned that wintry showers are on the cards for much of the country, although they will be most frequent in the north and east. Meanwhile, nighttime temperatures in the north could sink to –C in isolated rural areas, the Met Office added. UK Weather Forecast Today: Dry with plenty of warm sunshine for most parts after a chilly start. Becoming breezier in the southwest. Some low cloud affecting the far north of Scotland, perhaps also affecting some North Sea coasts towards evening. Tonight: A clear night for most but less cold than recent nights with more breeze in the south. Becoming cloudier in the east with some low cloud and fog in places. Sunday: Fine and sunny for many western and northern parts though still breezy in the south. Cloudier and cooler in East Anglia and southeast England though some sunny spells developing.

The UK has basked in weather warmer than Spanish hotspots Marbella and Lanzarote on Thursday as the mercury hold strong again today.Met Office forecasters say much of the weekend will see a continuation of the dry, settled weather that many have seen over in recent days.However, by Tuesday things will become unsettled as a cold air mass will push itself North across the UK. Over the weekend, long spells of sunshine can be expected in the South. Other regions will see a continuation of the dry, settled weather that many have seen over in recent days.  Over Saturday, most can expect light winds and sunshine, with only a risk of an isolated shower in the far north of Scotland. In South West England and Wales, clear skies and temperatures of around C are forecasted. Sunday follows a similar theme and by Monday temperatures will start to drop slightly but will remain dry and fine for most. By Tuesday, more unsettled and cooler weather picture from the middle of next week.  Met Office Chief Meteorologist Paul Gundersen said: “Although the UK has had a good deal of fine and settled March weather in recent days, a change is on the way from the middle of next week with colder air spreading down from the north and the increasing likelihood of rain for most areas. On the hills in the north, there’s a chance of this falling as snow, although we’ll gain more certainty on that in the coming days.  “With the influence of some unsettled weather, we’ll be seeing a marked drop in temperatures for most with colder air arriving from the north. This will see maximum temperatures drop into single figures for many areas, and below freezing overnight.” Ahead of next week, the mini-heatwave is set to continue over the weekend. Temperatures are well above the average on Friday afternoon, with the mercury hitting C in London and Birmingham. Looking ahead to the next few days, Met Office meteorologist Alex Deakin said: It may well be the shortest weekend of the year, because the clocks go forward, but it will be one of the sunniest. Itaposs going to be blue skies almost across the board on both Saturday and Sunday thanks to a chunky area of high pressure thataposs just wobbling around across the UK.

Teacher Lauren Whitworth, , who is a special sergeant with GMP, saw -year-old Kennie Carter, who had suffered a fatal stab wound to the chest, unconscious just yards from his home in Stretford. Kennie had allegedly been followed and pounced on by a group wearing hoods and Covid masks on Stretfordaposs Lakes estate at pm on Saturday, January .He was stabbed in the chest and died later in hospital. Police believe the fatal stabbing was the culmination of a series of tit-for-tat incidents between two rival groups, the Manchester Evening News reports. So far police have arrested  youths on suspicion of murder, aged between  and . Ten of the young suspects remain on police bail.  In the wake of the devastating incident, Special Sergeant Whitworth, from Urmston, the head of maths at Altrincham College, is asking: Have we failed these teenagers  Lauren, who was first police officer on the scene of the stabbing on Thirlmere Avenue in Stretford, alongside PC Charlie Crouch, said the teenageraposs eyes were open but he aposwasnapost thereapos. She is now insisting more work has to be done in schools to tackle kne and crime. Kennie is one of four youths from Greater Manchester who have died because of kne crime in . Lauren said: There was chaos, people everywhere we turned on Thirlmere. At that point Kennie was just laying on the floor. There was somebody giving him CPR, a member of the public.  He was laying down on his back near to the wall on the pavement. He was unconscious and not breathing. I went around the back of the car to collect the first aid bag. My colleague was there administering first aid. Charlie took over. I was with Kennieaposs mum and dad. They only live around the corner. The whole neighbourhood was out. Once we have arrived it feels like a long time before the ambulance arrived, but it was only a matter of one or two minutes. By that point the whole street was flooded with police and paramedics. It was all happening incredibly fast. I tried to put up thescene tape while Kennie was taken to the back of the ambulance where they continued to work on him. A volunteer cop for the last three years, Lauren said: I felt absolutely helpless. Every day I think back and think, could we have done more  I think I question myself as I work in education. Thataposs what upset me most in the coming days and weeks. Have we failed these teenagers  These teenagers are ending up in this situation of being stabbed and people are carrying knives. We need to get to the root cause when they are in school and help them see they have options and opportunities, that carrying a kne isnapost the right option. Itaposs only going to end one way. She described seeing Kennieaposs parents at the scene: They were distraught. It was extremely traumatic and devastating, seeing Kennieaposs mum especially. She was devastated. She was losing her son in front of her eyes, at , when he should be out playing football and getting ready to do his GCSEs. He should be planning for the future. His le was taken away from him. Lauren described how Kennieaposs mother was aposshouting trying to find who had done itapos. She said: There were at least  to  people out. The whole neighbourhood was out. There were children and parents. The whole neighbourhood was out there. I just hope that the conversation around kne crime stays on the table and as parents and teachers or anybody who works with teenagers, we continue to do everything we possibly can to minimize this happening in the future. By the time the police get involved, itaposs already happened. There are branches in the police like safeguarding teams that do work intensively with those involved in kne crime or any sort of criminality. “But really itaposs those that are close to the teenagers at a young age, the teachers that are working with them every day. “Itaposs them that can build this trust.

Four months on and the politan Thames Valley Housingproperty has not been repaired, leaving her fearful that the ceiling could collapse on top of hershe s. The -year-old says the large hole has caused her kitchen to smell of damp.MTVH claim that they fixed the leak before Christmas, Fatima says she had to replace and empty buckets for at least two months because water was continuing to drip through her ceiling. Even though Fatima is currently not living in her one-bed flat, she still has to pay MTVH £ a month in rent, as well as council tax and bills. She claims that MTVH told her it will not reimburse her rent in full because she decided to leave the property a few days after her ceiling collapsed. Fatima said:insists I should have stayed there and should not have left the flat. Even though the kitchen is damaged and I canapost use it to cook. It is as thought they think I decided to mess up my le for three months just for fun. Iaposm very angry about that, the ceiling just dropped. Itaposs recurring thataposs why Iaposm very upset and anxious, itaposs just the same problem over and over again.  Fatima, who is a teaching assistant at a local primary school, ed to her flat twice a day to swap and empty the bucket.

When Fatima reported the most recent leak in December , she claims she was told there was nothingcould do because there was allegedly an asbestos infestation. The following Saturday, the ceiling partially collapsed in the middle of the night. Fatima left the following day, fearful that she was living with asbestos and that more of the ceiling could collapse and injure her. She added: It smells, the kitchen isn’t repaired and I canapost use it. I don’t want to be thereanother part of the ceiling drops. I don’t feel safe. I have to go through the same thing, having to fight, having to leave my home. But I still have to work and pay the rent and bills becauseI don’t do thatwill kick me out. As well as paying for her own rent and bills, Fatima is also helping to cover her friendsapos bills for the duration of her stay there.She claims that she was offered just a % reduction off her rent for the past three months - an offer she refused. Fatima, who has requested to be placed into a new home, fears it will take years for her to eventually be rehoused.

They need to stop ruining my le. They need to stop now. Itaposs not fair. I want to be able to come home and relax. I want to have a bath, have something to eat and I want to read a book.

We have carried out repairs to Ms Djabra’s home over a number of years including the leak which had damaged the ceiling which we fixed before Christmas. MTVH has been actively working on the issues raised by Ms. Djabra and her legal representatives since February . As such, we carried out a swt and thorough inspection and found no signs of damp in the kitchen or the bathroom. We’ve agreed with Ms Djabra to make good the ceiling in her kitchen and redecorate.

She said on Reddit: I told her absolutely not. She said she won’t be coming unless the dog can come too.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.  Originally wanting her sister to be a bridesmaid, the woman, who is due to marry in six monthsapos time, is now struggling to maintain her guest list as her sister is trying to turn their family against her following the ban. I told her she was being ridiculous. The dog isn’t even trained and there is nothing medically wrong with her, she added.She says it’s for PTSD from our childhood. We had an exceptionally normal childhood with great parents. We never financially struggled or anything like that and were never abused.She is now refusing to come to the wedding and trying to get family members to take her side. She is saying I am discriminating against her disability - PTSD and anxiety caused from a super normal childhood. Claiming her sisteraposs service dog is fake, the bride-to-be explained how her sister adopted the dog as a puppy and started referring to it as a service dog in training so her landlord would allow her to keep him. She added: Now she has herself convinced that she actually needs this dog and that he is performing some kind of therapy for her.  The problem is the dog is not a trained service dog. It barks, it will rub up against you and get slobber and hair on you. Itaposll scratch up your legsit’s excited. I think the whole service dog thing is her way of feeling special, standing out and getting attention from others.She loves the attention the dog brings and it’s super obvious. The dog has its own Instagram for goodness sake.I’m also worried that she will use the dog to steal the attention on my wedding day. She has done this at family birthday parties with the dog and other events. She literally needs people to pay attention to her and her dog. Questioning whether she has been too harsh on her sister or whether her reasoning is justied, the woman has turned to Reddit to seek othersapos opinions.One user said: People like you sister are incredibly annoying for people like me who have actual trained service dogs, and give service dogs a bad rap. My dog helps me with my autism and mental illnesses. I have a hard time navigating crowds and so he is trained to lead me around when I get overwhelmed, along with doing some other stuff. It is incredibly annoying when people think I might be faking him being a service dog because of people like your sister. While some users supported the bride-to-beaposs decision to ban the dog from attending her wedding, others pointed out how her dismissible behaviour towards her sisteraposs mental health might be the reason for her problems. Pretending to speak through the bride, one user said: Dear family, Iaposve just learned that I am the source of sisteraposs PTSD and childhood trauma. I am shocked and sad as I thought we had a wonderful childhood. I cannot in good conscience force sister to attend my wedding. She was gracious enough to try to put her trauma aside, but it is exacerbating her need for her service animal. Please help me support her by supporting her non attendance and not talking about wedding details in front of her. Love you all so much! Another user added: She sounds extremely dismissive of her sister and I really wondersheaposs ever considered that this behaviour could be a cause of her childhood trauma too, especiallyshe has always regarded her sister this way. A fourth user said: Please remember that not all PTSD suffers are affected in the same way. Your symptoms may not affect you to such an extent that they constitute a disability but for others their panic attacks can be completely deliberating.

Thataposs because the cooking experts over at HelloFresh have shared their top tips for making the perfect dippy eggs.Speaking to The Daily Star, they claim that itaposs all to do with timings - and cold water. No one wants to crack open their dippy egg to find it hard inside, so how do we avoid this breakfast devastation Chefs from HelloFresh explained: Some people put the eggs into boiling water, but did you know thatyou add the egg into cold water and then place it on the heat, you’ve got a higher chance of being able to control the outcome   Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.“You just need to put the egg in cold water and then bring it to the boil. Once it’s boiling – the bubbles should be bursting at the surface of the water – take it off the heat and cover the top with a lid. They then shared a chart with dferent yolks and suggest you choose the one you want for your egg, leaving it in the hot water for the amount of time indicated on the chart. Once itaposs had its time, you then place it into very cold water and peel the shell off and it should be perfect every time. According to the chart, extra runny eggs with a partially set yolk take two minutes while a fully set egg and runny yolk takes four minutes. Those who prefer a jammy yolk and set white should aim for six minutes and an almost hard-boiled egg will take eight minutes.  The chefs also shared their recommendations for how to aposspice upapos your dippy eggs. They suggest adding some dukkah, saying: You can also spice up your boiled eggs by sprinkling on some dukkah along with your salt and pepper, finely chopping some chives and sprinkle them on top.

The woman, from the US, explained her friend invited her and her husband to South Padre Island in Texas and told her specically to bring one of her black dresses for aspecial eventthat would be taking place during the trip.When the woman was packing, she realised she didnapost fit into the black dress anymore so packed a white one instead, thinking the substitute would be close enough to the one her friend suggested. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. But when the day of the event arrived, her friend told her it was actually her wedding day - and was furious that sheaposd decided to wear white.In her post, the woman said: My best friend invited my husband and me to go on vacation with them at South Padre Island. She told me to bring the dress I wore to my last anniversary dinner for the special dinner event she planned during the vacation. I said sure.I also recently gave birth, and that dress is elegant black lace over a nude dress that is very classy but also form-fitting. When I tried it on when packing, I realised it wasn’t as flattering and my boobs had a hard time fitting. So instead, I packed a cute semi-formal white lace dress instead. I figured it was close enough.  I arrived at the event and found out it was a surprise wedding on the beach where she only invited like  guests. She hadn’t told me it was her wedding because of an inside joke, where I kept telling her and her partner to get married and said theyaposd just elope and next thing we know they are married. The woman said she was horried when she realised the mistake she had made, and things went from bad to worse when she was then told she was supposed to act as the maid of honour at the ceremony. She tried to tell her friend to get someone  to fill the role but she refused - and instead accused her of ruining the wedding. The woman added: She was horried, and so was I. I didn’t bring any other dress, plus there was no time to change buy a new dress. Also, surprise! I’m the maid of honour. I offered to either not be the maid of honour, or leave the wedding, but she rathered me not. Later she blamed me for ruining her wedding because I didn’t follow her instructions to wear a specic dress and didn’t tell her about changing my mind. I said I’m sorry her wedding was ruined but it wasn’t my fault and she should have told me it was her wedding, and at the time of packing, I didn’t find it appropriate to get her approval on my outfit. Commenters on the Reddit post admitted they were initially planning to tell the poster she was in the wrong, but after discovering that she didnapost even know thereaposd be a wedding. One person said: You didnapost know. It was close to the same style, I donapost see how you could have known not to wear white simply because someone asked you to wear a dress they liked on you before.

Some owners are left with no other option but to pay a professional dog walker to exercise their pet whin theyaposre busy - and as long as theyaposve done their research, this shouldnapost be a problem.But one dog owner got more than she bargained for when a client set out a ridiculous demand she must adhere to when walking her energetic dog. Venting to Reddit, the dog walker said: I was pet sitting and dog walking on my own for seven years - needless to say, I have had a lot of experience with dog owners. to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.  The current client booked me for a one hour walk for once last night and twice today. I walked the dog last night for a little over an hour and got in . miles which was shown on the dogaposs GPS tracker. Several hours later, I received a message saying that the dog needs to be walked  to . miles in an hour. Surprised by this sudden request, the woman searched through their agreement and was unable to find a distance requirement for the job. I am a short person so I have short legs and I am not in shape enough to go that fast, even with incorporating intermittent jogs into the walk, she said. I searched all over the dogaposs profile and this is never mentioned - it just says he needs to be walked for an hour. It is physically impossible for me to get  miles in an hour. Today, I walked the dog again and managed to get  miles in an hour and a half. However, I am only getting paid for an hour, so essentially the owner just got a free  minutes from me.  After dropping the dog off at home, the woman received a condescending message from the owner who claimed her services were not up to scratch. She claims the owner treated her like a child, despite knowing she has almost a decadeaposs worth experience with working with dogs. She added: Several of the messages I have felt have had attitude to them as well. I suggested to the owner that I was going to take the dog on a walk on a nearby trail so we would be away from cars and I felt more comfortable with that and I was completely shot down. Clearly this is not a good of a fit for me and I will be mentioning that after the final walk. I just did not want to leave them to find a new dog walker at the very last minute. The dog is incredibly sweet and I really like him, but the demands and requirements from the owner are just unreasonable for me.Do you think this is a fair demand  Have your say in the comment section below.Unsure how she should handle this situation, the woman has turned to Reddit to ask whether she is overreacting or whether the owneraposs expectations are over the top. One user said: You’re given a time requirement hour, not a distance requirement. This is absurd and that’s awful they are treating you so horribly. I would cut ties with them. It’s not worth it. Another added: This person should be hiring a triathlete to walk their dog -  miles in one hour is a brisk pace for a fit person and  miles is jogging. I have never had a client comment on the distance I walked with their pet. This owner is going to continue to be nothing but trouble. Cut your ties carefully, they may be vengeful and leave a bad review on you. I would use the words, aposnot a good fit based on their needsapos. While a third said: I’m a former cross country runner, and still in good shape. When I’m speed walking, I can approach the  minute a mile mark, but never have reached it. She doesn’t know what she’s talking about, andshe wants someone to run with her dog, then that’s what she should actively seek out. You’re not overreacting.

A unique home with magnicent history has come on the market in the quaint village of Chilcompton, Somerset for £, - but the propertyaposs back garden is an eerie graveyard. The church - which was renovated in the mid s by architect Warwick Rodwell - has been transformed into a light and airy home. Downside Old Church has truly been given a modern make-over and awaits a new family to move in and call it theirs. Originally built in , the property still boasts some of its period features - such as the original church doors and stained glass windows throughout and all the wooden structures.Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.Andthose features werenapost original enough for you, it even still has all the gravestones from the church situated in the garden. With some of the headstones being over  years old, it is safe to say these gravestones are no longer visited, but they still very much have their place. There are a number of these historic gravestones in which,wanted, visitors would have to submit a written request to the owner of the property to visit them.  The converted church is currently on the market with estate agency Cooper and Tanner. Branch manager Samuel Masters says: The main draw to the house is the how big it really is inside, the garden is a compromise to some, but the other features make it a great home. The strong colours inside and the way it has been well decorated eradicates any cold and spooky feelings of a church and gives a warm and cosy feeling to the home.  The garden wouldnapost suit everyone, but the house itself has a lot of quirky characteristics. So many memories will have happened in this church, weddings, baptisms and also funerals, the home has retained its magnicent history whilst being liveable in a church. The church is located near Bath and Frome, and is only a short distance to Wales.Do you have a story to sell  We want to hear all about it.

Although cannabis is illegal for all production and public consumption in Chile, it is legal for private-at-home consumption.Aloaposs sister requested the unique wedding cake ingredient herself after having enjoyed sampling some “magical brownies” and all guests were made fully aware of what had gone into the special layer before tucking in.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Footage which has since clocked up more than  million views on TikTok, shows guests cheering as the new bride and groom slice into the innocent-looking wedding cake.The video then cuts to around  out of the  wedding guests dancing around happily, laughing as the effects of the cannabis took hold. One commenter remarked that they were definitely doing this on my wedding [day]. While another wrote: Ok, I didnapost want to get married, but now Iaposve seen this, and I want to get married, then orced, but I will already have been happy with my magical wedding cake.Alo said: It was good fun. Me and my sister had already tried magical brownies and the effect was very funny, so when she asked to have a bit for her wedding I didnapost think twice. The magic level itself took me two hours and was pretty easy. I just infused it with the butter from the day before and once the brownie set I put it with the other levels with chocolate ganache, and voila. Everyone was made aware of it and after the cake was cut, we made sure it was kept apart from the others and served only to adults. He continued: The funniest reaction was my aunt. I remember her back hurt and two hours after eating cake her pain disappeared and she was up dancing like a teenager. I think cannabis cooking should be normalised a little more, both in culinary and medicinal terms. It has incredible effects on those who might need an alternative, both for physical and mental health.Do you have a wedding-related story to tell  We pay for stories.

The Brazilian-born influencer, who boasts over a million followers on Instagram, is now delivering food and medicine in the besieged nation.Miss Gutierrez sued Brown in  over an alleged altercation in Las Vegas and won a civil lawsuit against the star after she claimed he attacked her in a hotel room. The -year-old is fighting fit having been placed in a coma by doctors in Istanbul, Turkey, after suffering a severe reaction to anaesthesia while undergoing cosmetic surgery four years ago.“I decided to come too because I couldn’t just watch what was happening from my house and do nothing,” she said. “Of course I’m scared when I’m inside Ukraine, but when I help someone I feel that I’m doing the right thing.“We take stuff to dferent places, like this hospital in Chervonohrad, some police stations in Lviv and Lutsk, and schools as well.” Ms Gutierrez claimed that those delivering food and aid were now accompanied by police escorts after the Russian army had captured some volunteers.But the scariest thing was the air-raid sirens, she said. “When I hear the siren, it is super scary because we don’t know exactly what to do,” she said. “It is impossible to get used to.” Photos and videos show Ms Gutierrez and fellow volunteers loading up supplies in a car, ready for distribution in Ukraine. Further images show her with donated goods in a Lviv warehouse, and posing with a rescued family who had crossed into Zosin, Poland. She continued: “The Ukrainian people see us volunteers as heroes. “Sometimes I feel like crying when I see families breaking apart – men over  years old can’t get out of Ukraine.  “I see all the time families with just a backpack and the documents in their hands leaving everything behind. But we can’t cry, we are here to give support to these families.” It’s unclear how many foreigners have travelled to Ukraine to assist in a humanitarian capacity.However, in an update on March , the Ukrainian Government said it had received , applications from foreigners looking to fight against Russia.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

She is said to have received around , in compensation after claiming Brown or a member of his crew assaulted her while confiscating her cell phone at a luxury party held by the RB star. At the time, TMZ reported the incident occurred after Brown caught her taking his photo at the bash at the Palms Hotel and Casino on December , . The Grammy award winning artist denied the allegations but reached an agreement after Gutierrez stepped up her claim by suing for defamation when Brown posted a video in which he said she was too ugly to have been invited to his party.

Mystery remains as to what caused the Boeing  plane to suddenly nose e as it headed from Kunming to Guangzhou killing  passengers and nine crew.It appears to have crashed into remote hillside at around mph and while investigators have found a black box it is uncertaindata can be retrieved from it due to its damaged state. Search teams have been looking through the debris at the crash site for clues as to what happened, but now it seems as though they will need to extend the area. Investigations have been made more dficult by hilly and forested terrain in the Guangxi region while there has also been heavy rain making the land muddy and susceptible to landslides.  Around six miles from the crash site, farmer Huang Jianyi, , said he found a piece of metal while working on a paddy field in the village of Siwang.“I saw a piece of metal. It was white,” said Huang, reported the South China Morning Post, spreading his arms out wide to indicate its large dimensions.It was later found and it raises questions now over whether the plane broke up in the sky.Zheng Xi, head of the Guangxi regional fire and rescue office, reportedly said the piece of suspected wreckage was about . metres long and cm wide.Huang’s son Chen Zhuchang, , reported the sighting of the metal strip to the police. “It was a long white strip that bends when picked up, it had a slight curve, and it wasn’t heavy,” he told the SCMP.  “There was a small area of blue paint at the centre of the strip. When I saw this, my first thought was that it could be aircraft debris.” As recovery crews sted through debris, dozens of relatives of those on board flight MU remained nearby in an anxious wait for further news. One was Qin Haitao who comes from neighbouring Hunan province and his daughter, Shujun, was a passenger on the flight on Monday. Guangzhou-based migrant worker Shujun, , had travelled to Kunming to accompany her mother to see a specialist doctor she had heard was very good. We couldnapost believe it and didnapost dare say anything, for fear that my we would not be able to bear it, Qin said, when describing the moment he heard the news of the crash. Our eyes were full of tears but we dared not weep. In fact, we knew the truth, but we kept it from her for a night, for half a day plus one night.  Qin said he initially received no official confirmation about his daughteraposs situation but on Monday night his brother-in-law went to Guangzhouaposs Baiyun International Airport, where the flight was scheduled to arrive. There, he was shown a list of the passengersapos names, which included Shujunaposs. On Tuesday, Qin, his son and two others drove to Wuzhou and the next day visited the crash site accompanied by staff and volunteers from China Eastern. Itaposs so painful, he said in a broken voice, holding back tears. We have nothing but grief now. We are living in grief every day.Rescue workers have reported finding human remains, pieces of personal belongings of the passengers and debris from the plane.Many family members were burning incense, Qin said, about the visit to the crash site.I prayed and put my daughteraposs name there. It happened to be her birthday that same day...so I said: aposDad came to see you, my child. Happy birthdayapos. After that visit to the site, Qin has largely stayed at his hotel with his son, Shujunaposs elder brother and only sibling. Shujun herself leaves behind a teenage daughter. We donapost have any requests now, Qin said. Our only request is to find my daughteraposs body as soon as possible and bring her home.

Annoying berks who think that spouting sitcom catchphrases makes them characters, sticking the word “meister” on the end of surnames passes as wit, and the height of ingenuity is a prank phone call. A bit like those two Russians who rang ministers Ben Wallace, Priti Patel and Nadine Dorries. But the Putin stooges met their match. I hear after a minute of listening to Dorries they hung up thinking they were being hoaxed by someone pretending to be an MP. It makes you proud to be British.It also makes you wonder how anyone believes they could hoax members of a government told to bluff whenever their mouth opens, as witnessed in the Chancellor’s Spring Budget statement which felt more like The Great British Cock ’n’ Bull Swindle. Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section Here was Rishi Sunak claiming we’re ALL about to feel the pinch when as a multi-millionaire married to a billionaire, he clearly isn’t. He said he was putting “billions back into the pockets of people” when he’s making us pay the highest tax rates since  while suffering the biggest cost-of- living crisis since rationing in the early s. A fact confirmed when ­economists calculated a worker on the average annual wage of £, will be £ worse off. Pure bull, and he knows it. The decision to let energy firms escape a windfall tax on their gargantuan profits was a cruel and calculated decision by this Tory government to force low income households to choose between food and heat. Yet still they lie about levelling up being their top priority. With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement saw him announce a cut in fuel duty, although this will cost the Treasury billions without putting cash back in familiesapos pockets. So how will the Spring Statement affect you The  huge big cost of living blows hitting you from next Friday What the fuel duty cut actually means - and whether weaposll see the dference in our pockets The Spring Statement  summaryaposs key announcements Everything you need to know about the National Insurance cut The UKaposs current inflation rate amid the Spring Statement - as Brits are left with crippling costsKeep up with live announcements from the Statement in the Mirroraposs live blogIf you need help with the cost of living crisis, weaposve put together a list of charities and schemes offering advice and grants to keep you and your family warm and fed this year. Their latest con is to claim our current problems are all down to Ukraine, when in reality, the economy was sliding down the pan way before the invasion due to their incompetence and nepotism. Their latest slogan is “our work begins now” which makes it sound like Labour has just left office after saddling the country with a crippling debt, when Gordon Brown moved out  years ago. They tell us they detest how obscenely PO has treated its workers, yet they voted against scrapping Fire and Rehire and signed off the legislation that allowed the Dubai-owned firm to sack  employees over Zoom.They tell us they’ve done more for refugees than any other country, then make it a criminal offence for desperate Ukrainian families to arrive in the UK without the right papers. Like David Cameron posting photos of himself volunteering at a foodbank, to make it look like poverty is close to his heart, when foodbank use went up ,% during his time as PM. There seems no limit to their capacity to insult our intelligence.A telling video emerged on Thursday of the NATO meeting in Brussels. As world leaders warmly greeted eachother, Boris Johnson stood unloved and alone, like Billy No-Mates.Further proof that the world’s politicians have discovered through painful experience that the oligarch-enabler and his ministers are just two-bit hustlers. Which is why they choose to give the British the cold shoulder. My grandad used to have a saying about people he found shady: “They’re kidding the goolies off you.” Labour should adopt that slogan for the May elections, because the overtaxed penny is surely now dropping with even the most gullible about how badly they’ve been conned.

Not long after the invasion of Ukraine, Putin ordered his nuclear deterrent forces on alert he sent several Russian submarines capable of carrying  ballistic missiles each sailed into the North Atlantic, it has emerged. At the time, nuclear experts told The Mirror that this was posturing rather than a real nuclear threat. It has now been reported they ed to Russia shortly afterwards, however western intelligence is now keeping a closer eye on Putinaposs nuclear arsenal. Putin has the largest stockpile of nuclear warheads in the world with , - thousands are thought to be classed as tactful - meaning they are intended to eliminate enemy targets in a specic area without causing widespread destruction. A navy source told The Times: The majority of Russian conventional weapons can be retrofitted with a low-yield nuclear capability. It is more complex than ‘plug and play’ but the Russians are quite innovative in what they put in front of bombs and missiles. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here Putinaposs justication for invading Ukraine was to de-Nazy the country, not destroy it as experts say they donapost see evidence that the Kremlin is gearing up to launch nuclear weapons. A western official said that there had been no sign in the conflict so far of any nuclear warheads being loaded onto missiles bound for Ukraine. At the time Putin put his nuclear forces on special alert, Dr Matthew Kroenig, Director of the Scowcroft Strategy Initiative at the Atlantic Council, told Thethere were two reasons to move his weapons.  He said it so Putin would be less vulnerable to a nuclear attack with the weapons being in one place and to move them into strategic places where they can be launched from. He said: This is part of Russian strategy. I donapost think we are getting ready for a nuclear war. Itaposs like in the animal kingdom when animals make themselves look really big before a fight. What Putin is trying to do is intimidate us to say aposstay out of Ukraineapos. Dr Kroenig said that Putin used a similar strategy in  during the annexation of Crimea. He added: This development does make things more dangerous with nukes moving around, but Russia did this in  and they use nuclear deterrence as an offensive strategy.

about what seeds to plant in the next few months.It’s a very satisfying project: dig your garden, plant some seeds, watch them germinate and nurture them into strong plants that you can harvest and eat, all in the space of a few months.These joys, though, are usually only accessible to those who have their own garden or space to grow in.That’s why Time for Change member Lix Armstrong wants to start a community food growing project in Ardrishaig, giving everyone the chance to experience the many benefits of growing their own food.The project is still in its planning stages, but will hopefully take shape in the form of allotment-style raised beds, and a shared polytunnel space to grow vegetables and fruit.Not only would this food growing project reduce greenhouse gas emissions relating to food miles, packaging and chemical fertilisers, it will also reduce food waste, as people are much more likely to eat misshapen or wonky vegetables that they’ve grown themselves.Vegetables that don’t look perfect are often left to rot in fields due to supermarket demands.In fact,  per cent of all food that is produced is wasted either on farms, in supermarkets, or in people’s homes.Not only is this a huge waste of resources, it is also a big source of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly methane.Food waste in the UK produces  million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions every year.Emissions aside, community food growing also comes with huge social benefits, such as allowing more people to access fresh fruits and vegetables, reducing their reliance on less healthy processed foods.It’s also great for both the mental and physical health of participants, as repetitive, rewarding tasks like gardening are proven to lower stress levels and help people feel connected both to the land and to the community.Gardening also provides a steady, low impact form of exercise that is more sustainable than when exercise itself is the main goal.Lix hopes that this project will link with community groups and local primary schools so that as many people as possible can share their learning and grow things together.Growing projects like Lix’s planned one in Ardrishaig could exist all over Argyll.Crucial to this project’s success, says Lix, will be the accessibility of the project to people in the area, security of land, and a willingness from the community for it to thrive as a long-term project.If you are interested in lending a hand, oryou have any skillsto contribute, Lix would love to hear from you, so send us an email at timeforchangeargyll@gmail and we will put you in touch.If you#d like to find out more about Time for Change Argyll and Bute, email timeforchangeargyll@gmail or visit the group#s Facebook page."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters another

chronotypes, have a genetic basis that controls one#s biological clock, but this can be modied by ious factors such as light exposure, age and lestyle.However, when the genetic and environmental cues are not aligned a chronic condition known as #social jetlag# may ensue.This problem is exacerbated during adolescence when chronotypes become increasingly delayed, but schools start early in the morning.This can cause sleep loss that may lead to major health and psychological problems and also affect academic performance.In a recent study scientists examined how the interaction between chronotype and school start time influenced inidual academic performance* by taking advantage of a high school system where  students had been randomly assigned to lessons in the morning , afternoonor evening .This enabled the unbiased testing of the effect of chronology and school schedules on academic performance in adolescents aged - years and - years.The results showed that among the early morning group, very few students got adequate sleep.The larksoutperformed owlsin all school subjects and this effect, which increased as students progressed through the school, was most extreme in maths.This outcome, however, was not evident in those having afternoon schooling, and the situation almost reversed in those receiving evening schooling, where students with later chronotypes performed slightly better in languages than the early chronotypes in the same group.Clearly academic performance is influenced by biological iation in daily rhythms, to an extent that has previously been underestimated.The study authors, while conceding that it is impractical to attempt to fully align school timetables to inidual chronotypes, suggest that it may be possible to, for example, progressively delay school start times during adolescence.* Goldin et al.  https:doi.org . s---."},{"url":null,"title":"in columbas footsteps without cuban heels","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , :

feature Mid Argyll as it follows seven celebrities on a pilgrimage through Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland.#Pilgrimage# follows the celebs # of dferent faiths and none # for  days as they follow in the footsteps of Saint Columba, seeking out his legacy as a key figure in early British Christianity, helping spread the faith from Ireland to Scotland and beyond.Along the way Will Bayley, Scarlett Moffat, Monty Panesar, Louisa Clein, Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen, Shazia Mirza and Nick Hewer enjoyed the hospitality of the people of Knapdale.They arrived in Achahoish on September  last year, having set off from Northern Ireland the previous day by boat.Tired and weary, the pilgrims were welcomed into South Knapdale Parish Church at Achahoish, where they met with some of the congregation and shared a meal.South Knapdale Parish Church Minister Reverend David Carruthers explained: #The programme#s producers # and the visitors # had caught wind of the fact that the church in Achahoish has been used previously by pilgrim groups passing through.#The Presbytery of Argyll#s youth workers have previously arranged pilgrim walks under the banner of the Columba Experience and the church at Achahoish was used for accommodation on two successive years.#After their meal at Achahoish, the group started to share with one another something of their backgrounds, beliefs and faiths whilst the TV cameras rolled.After three hours of fascinating chat, the locals went home and the travellers bedded down on the church floors in their sleeping bags.Next day the pilgrims headed northwards via Columba#s Cave near Ellary, where Father Simon MacKenzie of Christchurch in Lochgilphead conducted a short act of worship.The celebrity pilgrims began their journey in Donegal before travelling to Argyll. From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#. The -year-old explained: #I think pilgrimage is about clearing out your mental closet by physical exertion and by spiritual conversation with yourself or,you believe it, then conversation with your God.#I know I come across as all sort of flouncy and floppy and rather cavalier, but I am capable of existing in the real world.#However, I don’t think I’ve walked so far not wearing Cuban heels.#Pilgrimage: The Road to the Scottish Isles will be screened on BBC Two and iPlayer in the spring with three one-hour-long episodes, and is a CTVC production."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 11 2022","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Who am I  What am I  Where am I  How am I  – questions of identity and some of the questions I was left asking when I left a recent meeting.That meeting was part of a world-wide movement – a movement that calls the peoples of the world to pray.Similar questions of identity were raised when I was asked to write ‘a piece’ for this newspaper.

victory over the Aberdour seconds across in Fe.Taking advantage of the wind at Silversands, Kilmory pushed ahead with two well-taken quickfire goals from Alex Cunningham on  and  minutes to take an interval lead.There was no more scoring in the second half with both teams struggling a bit on the  sticky pitch.With Inveraray seniors# Mowi National Division match against Skye called off due to heavy rain # after the Aray lads had reached Fort William # Inveraray juniors had the option of a strong bench for their Mowi South Division Two match versus newly-formed Strachur-Dunoon.The match was reversed from the Winterton to Dunoon Stadium with the more experienced Inveraray side running out - winners.Experience aside, the Inveraray side still contained five players under  and one -year-old.A competitive and hard-fought game started at a good pace with Strachur-Dunoon showing good hitting and a willingness to chase down balls.Inveraray struggled for cohesion and had to wait until the th minute to find the breakthrough, Allan MacDonald scoring with a shot from distance.This settled the visitors and in the nd minute after some hard work by Ryan Pugh, the ball broke to Ewan Donnan, who struck from the angle to find the net.No sooner had the dust settled than Inveraray found themselves three ahead when Craig Taylor found space to put the ball past Dunoon keeper Nathan Ross.The second half was a closely-fought affair with both teams playing good, clean shinty.Inveraray had to step up a few gears to keep Strachur-Dunoon at bay, bringing on Colin Campbell, John MacKenzie and Allan Cameron to ensure composure throughout the team.Good second-half performances from all the Inveraray youngsters ensured the game was safe before Inveraray#s Allan Cameron finished the scoring in the th minute.This was the first competitive match for Strachur-Dunoon, and with a number of players missing # others having not met before the game # they showed plenty of determination, which bodes well for the future.Kyles Athletic#s away tie with Kilmallie in the Mowi Premiership was a Saturday morning postponement.The Kilmallie squad had already planned to attend the funeral of club chieftain Hugh #Shep# MacIntyre ahead of the game as the club paid their respects to one of their stalwarts.In Mowi South Division One, Kyles Athletic juniors drew -

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement.

The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

We believe we must take positive action now to tackle these and other challenges by helping schools to work more effectively together.#By making these changes, we believe we will protect our schools, enhance the education of our pupils and build a stronger team of educators.#But this view is challenged by parent councils across the region # and they also question the process.The council is consulting on a #proposal in principle#, and this worries parent councils representing schools in Mid Argyll and Kintyre.In a joint statement they said: #Parents and communities need to be clear that the proposal in principle does not carry any technical detail. This will only be worked out once the decision has been made to progress the model # all subject to change.#Not only can [the education authority] give us no evidence of this model working but it has not provided us with any risk assessments or proof that this will do no harm.#To make valid feedback we have to hear both sides of the story.#The statement added that when the plan was first presented to the council#s community services committee in June , it was already clear that parents opposed school clusters.#It is extraordinary that the education authority has now spent time and money using a marketing company to #sell# the same model to parents rather than thinking it worthwhile to engage parents with possible alternative models for discussion,# the statement continued.Mid Argyll councillor Dougie Philand endorsed those concerns, saying: #I believe the authority needs to listen to our communities who are clearly saying this proposal is one they do not support.#Fiona Hoad, chair of Ardrishaig Primary School Parent Council, said: #Trying to distil this down has been a process and a half. It didn#t need to be like that but it was the approach the authority took for its own end goal.#We don#t want change for change#s sake. We#ll be out of the frying pan into the fire.#Suggestions have recently been made that the issue should be make-or-break for candidates in May#s council elections.Islay community councillor Calum Murray, a former teacher, said: #My feeling is to nip this in the bud, that with the elections coming up very soon in May, we should ensure that not one councillor is re-elected that would support this measure.#"},{"url":null,"title":"way to work is just the job for employers and candidates","story":"AdvertisingUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThe Way to Work initiative aims to get , unemployed workers into jobs by the end of June.

We did not expect the extremely positive and proactive response we received from the jobcentre. The team was very helpful,# said Jordan.The support Elite got from the jobcentre was invaluable in streamlining and accelerating its recruitment process which would take up to five weeks.#Now, the jobcentre advertises our vacancies via a sector-based work academy.#Candidates attend a two-week course at Weston College, Yeovil, to gain their Scaffolding Operative Training Scheme and Health  Safety Certications, as well as to prepare for an interview. Now when we interview candidates, they already have a scaffold labourer trainee card and the basic knowledge and understanding of the scaffolding industry. What’s more, all this support via the jobcentre comes without the additional fees of private agencies.#Out of seven candidates, six were offered jobs and five have remained with Elite which has  qualied operatives.#The process was seamless and effective, providing quality candidates who were keen to learn.#Working with the jobcentre is a no brainer! As well as alleviating the burden of interviews that don’t progress into jobs, the savings in cost and time to get candidates suitably qualied are a bonus. It takes the pressure off our own resources and provides top quality candidates in the process.#‘Delighted’: Simon, Employer Adviser, Yeovil JobCentreSimon joined the Department of Work and Pensions as a work coach two years ago after  years in sales and marketing in the private sector. He became an employer adviser a year ago.Once approached by Elite Scaffolding, also based in Yeovil, he set up a meeting with one of its office managers and worked out a bespoke recruitment package.As part of the programme, he contacted the local Weston College and together they “built” the course content.#I arranged for the employer’s contracts manager to present to the class through an online  so they could explain what the business could offer them and what they we were looking for.#At the end of the two-week course, six candidates were offered a place on the apprenticeship scheme at a starting salary of £,.#Elite had exhausted all other channels to recruit and were delighted with the outcome#, he said.Moreover Elite referred other local employers to the jobcentre and Simon is running another sector-based work academy with a local roofing company.#If you’re looking to fill a vacancy, Jobcentre Plus can offer you a named employer adviser in your local jobcentre that knows the local geography for both employers and those looking for work.#The jobcentre has an incredible pool of talent.

on those exciting pathways graduated and got those qualications.”Nicola McDowell, the councils head of education, welcomed the positive destination performance.She said: “The last few years have been challenging from an economic and educational perspective due to Covid-, which is why I am so pleased to see the data confirm that East Lothian’s young people are being well supported to make positive steps into the world of work, education and training.“Working with our partners and schools, East Lothian Works has transformed how we operate to respond in a way that meets the needs of our learners and school leavers, giving them the tools and opportunities that they need to succeed.“We will continue to develop programmes and initiatives that make sure all of our learners have access to the support that they need during their time in school and beyond.”"},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-businessman-sponsors-county-snooker-star-ross-muir---hopes-inspire-love-sport","story":"Former boxer

For me, it’s not just about doing something on the issue of climate change, important as that is. It’s also about extending and caring for a wood, which for me is a sacred place.Butterdean isn’t actually a remnant of ancient woodland, but parts of it have that atmosphere. It’s a planted wood but has been in existence for hundreds of years. There are references to it from the th century and earlier.It has changed over this time because parts of it have been felled and replanted, and some of the trees look like they have been coppiced. It has clearly been a woodland resource for many centuries.Its survival in itself is part of its remarkable story, of which I have previously written. But the dferent phases of management of the wood have left it with a fascinating character. Dferent parts of Butterdean Wood have dferent types of trees and atmosphere.In some areas, native deciduous trees dominate, such as silver birch, oak, hazel, ash and rowan. In others, there is a preponderance of tall non-native coners, although all over the wood there are also some wonderful examples of native Scots pine. There are also many towering beech trees, the queen of the forest. The undergrowth is lush in the deciduous sections, while the tall coners create a forest floor perfect for kids to play. I’ve met people in the wood who are lost, as there are around km of pathways crisscrossing each other.One of the special features of the wood are the old trees which can be discovered everywhere. It’s asthey had been forgotten or overlooked when their siblings were felled, or have grown quietly and unnoticed by the tree-fellers and somehow survived. We have our favourite old oak tree, for example, hidden in a corner of the wood, and the beech which still has been our umbrella for family picnics since my grown-up kids were toddlers. And now, with the careful management of the Woodland Trust, the wood is regenerating itself into an increasingly important native natural habitat.In this week’s sunny weather and lighter evenings, we were all finally able to have a weekday afternoon walk, a perfect way to unwind after a day in school. It was actually warm, with rays of sunshine streaming through the still-leafless but budding branches of the trees spring has well and truly arrived. I love such days, relish such moments in a wood.I have been called a tree hugger by some, and it is a label I accept and take as a compliment. The term may have its origins in India. In , the ruler of the Jodhpur area wanted to build a new palace, so he sent his soldiers to cut down the forest which was close to a village named Khejarli.The villagers regarded the forest as sacred because of their Bishnoi faith, but also because of what the forest gave them. They defended the trees by literally hugging them. The protest was initially led by a local woman called Amrita Devi, but hundreds of poor villagers were part of the tree-hugging protest.It was an act of incredible bravery, for Amrita, as well as  fellow villagers, were brutally killed as they hugged the trees, trying to protect them. Three of Amrita’s daughters were among the martyrs.This protest became the inspiration for the later Chipko movement in the s, when women in Uttar Pradesh likewise hugged trees to protect them from felling Chipko means ‘to embrace’.So I am proud to call myself a tree hugger, although I fear I would not have the courage or dedication to protect my sacred trees in the way Amrita and her fellow villagers did. Yet many of those currently protesting the destruction of forests and woodland all over the world, and indeed much closer to home, often have their spirit. We need many more modern-day tree huggers.But all we need to do on Saturday is head off regardless of the weather, be prepared to get a bit muddy and help plant some native trees. In doing so, we honour the dedication of those early tree huggers, in our own way, and make a dference. If you want to be part of the tree planting, please book by emailing kirstyduncan@woodlandtrust.org.ukIt will likely be busy, so please park at Alba Trees nursery rather than the usual car park.

To see them hanging again is fantastic.”There are more than  grand tapestries and carpets in the Burrell Collection, as well as Chinese pottery and porcelain produced over a -year period, making it one of the most signicant collections of Chinese art in Europe paintings by renowned French artists including Manet, Cézanne and Degas medieval treasures such as arms and armour Roman and Egyptian antiquities sculptures by Rodin and exquisite stained glass.It is one of the world’s greatest personal art collections, amassed by Sir William Burrell and his we Constance over a period of  years and given to the city of Glasgow in . In , it finally found a home in a purpose-built museum in Pollok Park. For the last five-and-a-half years, the building has been closed for renovations to the tune of almost £ million, but on Tuesday the ‘new’ Burrell – refurbished, redesigned and reinvented – finally opens its doors.The doors, in fact, are a somewhat prickly subject, depending upon who you talk to. There are now three entrances instead of just one. This caused consternation among fans of the original stone archwaywho do not enjoy the addition of a large, glazed ‘piazza’ and atrium, and separate café entrance. Dornan argues the change was necessary.“Our aim was to improve physical and intellectual access to the collection,” he explains, on a short tour of the building as final preparations are made before the grand public unveiling.“Visitor numbers had fallen, and we did a lot of audience research into why that was the case – what were the barriers stopping people coming to the Burrell  One of them was the entranceway. People found it intimidating, and it was a long walk to the galleries and the objects themselves.”He adds: “You had to walk almost the fullof the building just to get to the café – you could see it, from the park, but you couldn’t get in.”Other changes include the removal of two of the three ‘Hutton’ rooms, which reproduced interiors from the Burrells’ family home, Hutton Castle in the Borders and the creation of a new central stairway, allowing visitors to access the lower floor of the building for the first time, where they can watch items not on display being cared for. Similarly, new galleries have been created on the upper floors, giving access to areas never before open to the public.“The Hutton rooms were not popular with visitors,” explains Dornan, matter-of-factly. “We know Burrell didn’t simply want the city to rebuild his whole house, it was much more subtle than that.“Interpretation in those rooms was very traditional, and people just weren’t going in. So two of the rooms have now been repurposed – one explains who the Burrells were, and their connection to Glasgow, which is really important.”He adds: “Without understanding that, the collection doesn’t make sense. William and Constance Burrell were private collectors, buying what they liked, just as any of us would do – albeit with slightly less exotic subject matter.“Few people went upstairs – the original staircase was narrow and quite dark, and didn’t really look like a public space. Opening it up encourages people to circulate around the building, to understand there are three levels open to visitors.”There is seating in this area, and films will be shown in the space. “It brings back le to the centre of the building,” adds Dornan.In total,  displays will spread across  galleries, displaying  per cent more of the collection than before. The displays include innovative digital elements such as video walls, interactive games and hybrid systems created to help people engage with the stories behind the collection“Digital interpretation adds depth and provides more methods for people to engage with the collection,” says Dornan. Suggestions that the digital offering ‘dumbs down’ the museum misses the point, he explains.“We all learn in dferent ways, and films, interactive exhibits, tactile labels – these are all designed to improve access,” he says. “We want everyone to find a way into the collection.”Public expectations have moved on enormously since the museum opened in , he points out.“However, the ‘traditional’ museum-goer, who wants an aesthetic experience, can still have that experience – to stand, to look, to get lost in a particular object, that is very powerful,” says Dornan.“The digital elements at the Burrell are not like those you might find, say, at Riverside, [Glasgow’s transport museum] where it’s all primary colours and loud and bold and in your face. Here it is much more subtle and muted. It has been done in a considered way, so it does not overwhelm the tranquillity of the galleries. The objects remain paramount.”Conservator Stephanie de Roemer has worked on around  of those objects, including Guanyin, Goddess of Mercy, a th century statue from the Song Dynasty.“During the pandemic lockdown, I had all of these lovely sculptures in my workshop and actually, that is when it really hit me,” explains de Roemer. “These sculptures, from ancient civilisations, are all about the human condition – suffering, anxiety, grief – everything that was unfolding around us during Covid.“As everything shut down, and we could no longer go into work and meet people, it made me think about how timeless these things are.”De Roemer is originally from Osnabrück in Germany where she left school unsure of what she wanted to do but very clear about what she did not.“I did not want to be what my parents wanted me to be, which was a banker,” she smiles. “I remember at a job interview, putting all sorts of details about myself and my hobbies into a computer which would tell you what career you should do.”She smiles: “For me, it suggested conservator. I didn’t know what that was, but it sounded super-interesting, so I looked into how to go about doing it.”After studying art history and then classical architecture and anthropology, De Roemer came to the UK to study conservation, and ended up working for Glasgow Le via a Masters degree at Durham University.“I always thought conservation was about objects, but it’s really about people,” she says. “Every object brings you into contact with people from the past – those who made it, used it, collected it. I feel like we are the doctors, or carers, of cultural heritage.“I think what Glasgow has done with the Burrell is very clever. Six years ago, with the leaking roof, the problems with the building, and the visitor numbers falling, it was obvious something needed to be done. Rather than going for a patchwork approach, the decision to completely close and rebuild was taken. That must have been scary, but it was the best thing.”The biggest challenge in caring for a collection like the Burrell is, de Roemer says, the ‘conservator’s dilemma.’“We are the ‘object police, the ‘do not touch’ brigade,” she jokes. “We want the ideal ‘black box’ scenario – no light, in a vacuum, completely protected  days a year, everything lasts forever.”She pauses. “But of course, no-one will ever see it,” she adds. “William Burrell wanted his collection to be seen, so our job is to balance access and protection.“The Burrell renaissance brings it back to people – not just those who made and sold and bought the objects, but the people of Glasgow.“The community engagement work, watching people take ownership of the museum, has been lovely, and showing the stores, where people work on the objects behind the scenes, is great.“For me, Glasgow is being really progressive by being so open – it allows people to engage with the objects on a human level.”De Roemer smiles: “It’s exciting, now that we are about reopen – that’s when these objects come alive.”Project curator Laura Bauld has “lived and breathed” every aspect of the Burrell Collection since she included research on William Burrell in her final year dissertation in art history at Glasgow University.“I used to volunteer at Pollok House, helping to run school tours, and I got to know Pollok Park really well,” she explains. “I’d look at the Burrell and think – that must be an amazing place to work.“I got the job as assistant curator in  and have worked full time on the Burrell ever since. It feels like things have come full circle in a way, back to where it all started for me.”Bauld is curating the Burrell’s first exhibition, which will open later in the year.“It is about Sir William Burrell as a person, and the story of his decision to donate the collection to Glasgow in ,” she says.“He kept collecting, right up until his death in  – he added something like  objects on top of the  he had already donated. The exhibition will provide some insight into the man, and the collector, why this building was located here, and how we as a city were given this amazing gt.”What Sir William would make of the ‘Burrell renaissance’, is the “million dollar question”, agrees Bauld.“He donated the collection to the people of Glasgow, to inspire them,” she says, thoughtfully. “What he’d think of all the whizz-bang technology, I don’t know, but I think he would be happy that his collection is still being used, so many years later, to inspire a new generation.”As a curator, Bauld’s speciality is decorative art, including silver, ceramics, furniture and table glass. “I helped research the collection and put together the new displays, and the concepts we explore in the dferent galleries,” she says.“One of my favourite displays – although favourite is the wrong word – is The Price of Sugar, which includes th century furniture and th century silver owned by people who took part in the slave trade.“Glasgow’s museums have a huge commitment to anti-racism, and to making sure histories that are often overlooked or hidden, such as those of the LGBT community, are represented.”She explains: “This display is a good example of something that on the face of it looks simple - just some lovely chairs and beautul decorative glass – until you look a bit closer.“Those chairs were owned by a wealthy merchant who invested in the plantations in the Americas and the Caribbean, who probably had direct involvement in the evolution and expansion of the slave trade in these areas. The chairs were built off the profits of slavery.”She adds: “The Dutch engraved glass looks beautul, a rural scene carved into a goblet.“But the picture was a coded message for the owners, to toast their own successes, and it depicts slaves, working in the fields. The glass representing the skin of the white people is clouded, while that depicting the skin of the African figures is left clear so that when a red wine was poured into the goblet, those areas would appear black. It is racially charged, quite sinister – and an important story to tell.”An oil painting nearby, is likely to have equally strong resonance with modern audiences.The Flight into Egypt, attributed to Master of the Prado Adoration of the Magishows Mary and Joseph travelling to Bethlehem.“It is easy to look at it and see the biblical story, but Mary and Joseph were refugees, fleeing from their homes, fearing for their lives,” says Bauld.“The interpretation for this painting will include the voices of refugees and asylum seekers – and that is all the more relevant in the light of what’s happening just now in Ukraine and around the world.”Relating the past to modern le, through telling the stories of the objects in Burrell’s collection, has been at the heart of the process for Bauld and her team of fellow curators.“It is a dferent way of working but the benefits are so vast,” she says. “This is a collection for the people of Glasgow, and it is only by including their voices, perspectives and truths that we make it relevant to them, and to the city today.”With the emphasis on flexible displays, increased access and a storytelling approach, even regular visitors will always be able to find something new, Duncan Dornan points out.“We now have flexibility to change objects quickly and easily, and staff can alter digital elements themselves, so the collection can keep evolving,” he adds.“It is a very considered collection – Burrell was wealthy, but he was up against some serious collectors, so he had to work hard to make sure he got the best for what he could afford.”He tuts impatiently at criticisms Burrell was a ‘magpie’.He adds, smiling: “And it’s great fun. You really don’t know what you will see around the next corner, and that is quite wonderful.”The Burrell, Pollok Park, Glasgow, reopens to the public on Tuesday"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13610531.jpg?type=article-full","title":"sophie-ellis-bextor-week-ahead","story":"Agatha Bas, Rembrandt.

After Easter — from April  — we will stop recommending that people who don’t have symptoms, should test for COVID.“This change will apply across the population — including in most workplaces and in early years centres, schools, universities and colleges.“Then, at the end of April, routine testing will end — even for people who have symptoms.“At that time, physical test sites will close — although some mobile testing units and capacity will be retained for possible future use. Contact tracing will also end.“Free testing will not generally be available to the wider population.

And the Chief Executive should be barred as a director.“The shameful misconduct of PO Ferries has ruined livelihoods, and is harming the UK’s key shipping routes.”The trained, experienced, loyal crew should be reinstated.And the Chief Executive should be barred as a director.The shameful misconduct of PO Ferries has ruined livelihoods, and is harming the UK’s key shipping routes. https:t.co jnAAUNu— Louise HaighMarch , Labour has written to Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng asking whether the Government will seek the removal of Mr Hebblethwaite as a director under the Company Directors Disqualication Act .In a letter, the party accused the Government of “sitting on their hands” rather than taking action to hold PO to account, adding that the “toothless response risks giving the green light to exploitation”.Alliance East Antrim MLA Stewart Dickson welcomed the impounding of the ferry as a safety measure.“It’s not like the crew of an airplane getting off one Easyjet and getting on to the next one where the controls are the exactly the same, and everything is in the same place,” he told PA.“No two ships are the same, and you cannot just fly a crew in and expect them to be able to sail a ship. Every control will be in a dferent place, but particularly all those health and safety drills that have to be gone through, everything from leboat stations to how each item of equipment operates.“It seemed to me it was going to be very dficult for staff to be able to take on that role in such a short period of time.“I am absolutely delighted they have .

The identity of a person could undoubtedly be forged by the place of their birth and the community of that place, particularly at a time in the past when populations were less mobile.The traits of a person’s parents manest in their physical appearance their spirit, likes and dislikes, and sometimes even interests or inclinations might appear hereditary – not just from mother and father but perhaps from an ancestor remembered only by name and special characteristic, like poesy or craft skill..The failure by clan chiefs and other landed gentry to recognise this customary right held by the people since time immemorial underpins the Clearances, while demands for its recognition echo through much of the collective action undertaken against this violence, trauma, and dispossession. as far back in history as I can.The world and society these people lived in was so dferent to ours today, making context crucial to understanding the words being used and the philosophy from which they derive.Aside from the multitude which are in still in use today, there are published proverb collections as well as countless sound recordings, many digitized and made easily accessible by Tobar an Dualchais.By their nature proverbs cut across boundaries of class and gender, their survival relying upon oral transmission, on being commonly known in a community and thus reflecting its values.

The Minister announced that a more targeted approach to testing will be introduced on a phased basis from next month, with the focus on supporting and protecting those at highest risk of serious illness. Testing will continue to be available for those eligible for COVID- treatments. Under the new policy, PCR testing will cease for most people with symptoms from  April - however free lateral flow tests will continue to be available to the public to use should they develop symptoms of COVID-. Lateral flow tests will also continue to be available free of charge to support those living in, working in or visiting a higher risk setting such as a care home until the end of June, with further review then. The policy covers testing and contact tracing and takes effect from  April. No changes will be introduced until that date. The policy will be kept under review during the period of transition up until the end of June. The Health Minister stated: “The new policy reflects the new realities of the pandemic. While the prevalence of the virus remains at a high level, the risk of serious illness has been signicantly reduced - thanks in no small measure to our vaccination programme and the use of innovative COVID- treatments. “The risk posed by the virus at the present time does not justy testing and isolating large swathes of the population at the levels that we have seen to date in the past two years. Test and trace will continue to have a key role and will be used in a more focused and targeted way to support and protect our most vulnerable. This will be kept under very close review and we will have contingency plans in place so that we can scale up should it be required.” A range of changes will take effect from the  April: PCR testing will no longer be recommended or available for most people with symptoms. It will still be available to support the small group for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. The PCR home ordering service will remain available for the general public to support those for whom PCR is recommended.Publicly accessible COVID- testing sites will close. Local Health and Social Care Trusts will continue to provide PCR testing to support clinical care.Those with symptoms will be advised to use lateral flow devicesto test instead of booking a PCR. This will be kept under review and could remain in place up to the end of June depending on disease trajectory.Routine asymptomatic testingwill continue to be advised for those living, working and visiting health and social care settings including hospitals and care homes and other high risk settings in line with public health advice. This will be kept under review.Asymptomatic LFD testing for the wider population will cease. Access to free LFDs for this purpose will cease.Routine asymptomatic workplace testing will cease.Routine asymptomatic testing in most educational settingswill cease at the Easter break.Asymptomatic testing in special schools will continue after Easter and will be kept under review. It may continue until the end of June .Routine population contact tracing will be phased out between mid-April and the end of June.  Chief Medical Officer Professor Sir Michael McBride said: “We will continue throughout the transition phase to support and protect our most vulnerable. After these changes are introduced from  April, I would urge people to check on NI Directtesting remains recommended for them - for examplethey are eligible for new treatments. In the coming weeks, the Department will also be working to provide advice and support to those eligible for treatments. It is particularly important that those who are at higher risk of serious illness follow the guidance on getting tested.” The Chief Medical Officer added: “The tools at our disposal to protect people who are at higher risk from COVID- have advanced considerably since the early days of the pandemic. Alongside the vaccine and booster programme, new COVID- treatments continue to be used by patients in Northern Ireland and new treatments are in development. “As the amount of testing across society reduces, our behaviour and actions have an even more important role in preventing transmission and keeping others safe. I urge everyone to continue to follow the public health guidance including continuing to wear a face covering in enclosed settings like public transport and when visiting hospitals and care homes.” The changes do not take effect until  April, and current testing provision will continue until then.

Restricted numbers were permitted at the wake and funeral.Laurence was  years old, but fit and strong for his age.His daughter Cathy believes “ he hadn’t got Covid, he’d be doing well – he had a good few years ahead of him”.It was bittersweet for her family when Tyrone won the All-Ireland title last September.James, who said he had considered “not going back to football” when Laurence passed, was persuaded to go to the final that day with a friend, but it was an emotional event for all.Laurence’s other son, Conleth, has a poignant memory of his dad being at Tyrone’s winning All-Ireland final in .“After the game was over, he gave me a hug but there was a couple in front of us from Kerry with a young lad of about eight years old, and he was balling and crying.“My father leaned over and he said, ‘Listen, you will win many more. I might never see another one’.”And sadly, he never did.Read More‘I’ve found the whole perception over death from Covid disrespectful – Basil was my brother, people have been so dismissive of his death’Most ReadNorth Belfast security alert: Watch moment Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney evacuated after vehicle hijackedStormont department criticised for building Derry park-and-ride which breaches planning rulesUVF blamed for north Belfast bomb hoax aimed at Simon CoveneyWe live in fear, says mother of boy attacked ‘for being Protestant’Outrage as schoolboyis victim of ‘sectarian attack’ in north BelfastTop VideosPlayIrish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney evacuated from north Belfast event due to security alertPlayVideo: UVF behind Simon Coveney north Belfast security alert say police PlayVideo: Wall collapses in north BelfastLatest CoronavirusEnd of an era as Reids Shoes of Sandy Row goes on the market for £,Mapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageViewpointOpinionParents need more information on jabOscars : Anxious wait for Covid-hit Ken Branagh and Ciaran Hinds with hopes pinned on BelfastNorthern Ireland schools are ‘too afraid’ to promote Covid jabsLatestMan Utd forward Alessia Russo excited for Old Trafford opportunityRewards on the line as teams prepare for final day drama‘Huge loss for music’ as Foo Fighters’ Taylor Hawkins dies at ‘Trailblazer’ Margaret Beckett, first women foreign secretary, to retire as MPUber ‘delighted’ to be granted two-and-a-half-year licence for London,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This isn’t vengeance against PO, it’s about passenger safety and the safety of the crew as well.“It was reckless of the company to think they could not only act in the way in which they did about dismissing staff but they don’t seem to have had a plan as to how they were going to take this forward and now it is falling apart on them.”Meanwhile, the RMT union said it welcomed the detention of the European Causeway and it demanded the Government “seize the entire fleet” of PO vessels.General secretary Mick Lynch said: “The seizing of the European Causeway by the MCA tonight shows that the gangster capitalist outfit PO are not fit and proper to run a safe service after the jobs massacre.“This mob should be barred, their ships impounded and the sacked crews reinstated to get these crucial ferry routes back running safely.”Protests about PO’s actions are expected to take place in Liverpool, Hull and Dover on Saturday.Most ReadStormont department criticised for building Derry park-and-ride which breaches planning rulesNorth Belfast security alert: Watch moment Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney evacuated after vehicle hijackedWe live in fear, says mother of boy attacked ‘for being Protestant’UVF blamed for north Belfast bomb hoax aimed at Simon CoveneyOutrage as schoolboyis victim of ‘sectarian attack’ in north BelfastTop VideosPlayIrish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney evacuated from north Belfast event due to security alertPlayVideo: UVF behind Simon Coveney north Belfast security alert say police PlayVideo: Wall collapses in north BelfastLatest Northern IrelandProtests over sacking of hundreds of PO workers as calls grow for boss to quitMike Lowry: Ulster and Ito South Africa in a much better place than we both were for Cheetahs mauling‘How dare anyone do this ’ – Grieving woman hits out as bomb hoax ‘destroyed’ mother’s funeralViewpointOpinionNothing will be gained by scare tacticsSteven Davis rides to the rescue as Northern Ireland flatter to deceive in late victory over LuxembourgLatestProtests over sacking of hundreds of PO workers as calls grow for boss to quitMan Utd forward Alessia Russo excited for Old Trafford opportunityRewards on the line as teams prepare for final day drama‘Huge loss for music’ as Foo Fighters’ Taylor Hawkins dies at ‘Trailblazer’ Margaret Beckett, first women foreign secretary, to retire as MP,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Kelvin Boyes PresseyeGarrett HarganTwitterEmailMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Department for Infrastructurehas been strongly criticised for building a second park-and-ride facility on the outskirts of Londonderry in breach of planning conditions.The River Faughan Anglersgroup spoke out after Stormont’s Public AccountsCommittee said in a scathing report that it was “alarmed and appalled” at the abysmal performance of, and lack of transparency in, the planning system.In August , the DfI park-and-ride facility beside the A bridge over the River Faughan was damaged by flooding. Cars were swept into the river and people were rescued from the rising waters.It was then discovered it was operating without planning permission or environmental assessments.Read MoreWe live in fear, says mother of boy attacked ‘for being Protestant’Council rapped for spending £k on ‘fancy cameras’ for zoom meetingsThis was because what permission it had was temporary, and a condition required the facility’s removal and the restoration of the site by , a full year before the flooding struck.

In addition, the NIEA, along with the department’s consulting advisors and dedicated environmental team, were on site extensively during construction,” they added. “During this period, they did not raise any concern or issues relating to either the environmental controls or working methods adopted.”The local council confirmed it was aware of an alleged breach of conditions. A spokeswoman said: “A report of an alleged pollution incident was received. The council engaged with the DfI, the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and NIEA officials on the matter.”Related topicsDepartment for InfrastructureNorthern Ireland AssemblyRachel WoodsDepartment of Agriculture, Environment  Rural Affairs - More On Department for InfrastructurePlanning system is chronic failure, says Stormont watchdog PremiumLong delays for major planning applications ‘costing jobs and prosperity’ in Northern IrelandBelfast taxi driver fears any rise in fares could drive customers awayNorthern Ireland taxi journeys set for further increase following last year’s .% rise in maximum faresCareless driving set to become £ fixed penalty notice offence in Northern IrelandMost ReadStormont department criticised for building Derry park-and-ride which breaches planning rulesNorth Belfast security alert: Watch moment Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney evacuated after vehicle hijackedWe live in fear, says mother of boy attacked ‘for being Protestant’UVF blamed for north Belfast bomb hoax aimed at Simon CoveneyOutrage as schoolboyis victim of ‘sectarian attack’ in north BelfastTop VideosPlayIrish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney evacuated from north Belfast event due to security alertPlayVideo: UVF behind Simon Coveney north Belfast security alert say police PlayVideo: Wall collapses in north BelfastLatest Northern IrelandMike Lowry: Ulster and Ito South Africa in a much better place than we both were for Cheetahs mauling‘How dare anyone do this ’ – Grieving woman hits out as bomb hoax ‘destroyed’ mother’s funeralViewpointOpinionNothing will be gained by scare tacticsSteven Davis rides to the rescue as Northern Ireland flatter to deceive in late victory over LuxembourgJulian TaylorOpinionNorthern Ireland’s victory in Luxembourg masks lack of cohesion on an uninspiring evening for Ian BaracloughLatestMan Utd forward Alessia Russo excited for Old Trafford opportunityRewards on the line as teams prepare for final day drama‘Huge loss for music’ as Foo Fighters’ Taylor Hawkins dies at ‘Trailblazer’ Margaret Beckett, first women foreign secretary, to retire as MPUber ‘delighted’ to be granted two-and-a-half-year licence for London,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It spooked the party, a leadership challenge followed, and three months later Arlene Foster was gone.Polls increasingly appear to set the agenda. The TUV’s ratings rise has arguably led the DUP to harden its protocol stance and to collapse the Executive.The UUP’s strong showing in successive surveys since Doug Beattie took over has surely strengthened his hand with conservative elements in the party who otherwise might have publicly aired opposition to his liberal direction.Lacklustre ratings for the SDLP in both LucidTalk and a recent Irish News University of Liverpool poll — putting it on just % — cast a shadow over the party as it prepares for May’s Assembly election.“I think too much attention is given to polls in Northern Ireland,” Colum Eastwood said recently. That’s an entirely understandable complaint from his viewpoint.There’s a danger for the party that the polls become a self-fulfilling prophecy — the ‘loser’ label is fixed in the public mind before a single vote is cast.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up A key debate has long been whether polls simply measure public opinion or influence it.Some believe that the ‘bandwagon effect’ makes polls positively dangerous. Negative ratings are fatal as people’s preferences sht to whoever is ahead.Rather than making informed choices, voters conform to majority opinion. The subconscious desire to join the crowd, to be on the winning side, leads them to support parties with a high level of support.Some argue that rather than being just a tool to discover the wishes of the public, polls disrupt the democratic process. Critics claim that pollsters are too powerful.Bill White, who runs LucidTalk, robustly challenges that argument. “Did the DUP dump Arlene Foster on the basis of last February’s LucidTalk poll  No,” he said.“I would be very worriedI thought that seasoned political figures made decisions based purely on a poll. It may have been a spark that led to moves against her but that would have been because it chimed with what DUP people were already hearing on the ground.“Had it not matched what they were being told on doorsteps it wouldn’t have been taken seriously. Polls have to feel right.”There are numerous large polling organisations in Britain. LucidTalk and Social Market Research, which conducted the Irish News University of Liverpool poll, are two Belfast-based companies carrying out political polling here.White, who worked in market research and IT in London and Dublin, set up LucidTalk in .“Online polling came to London in the late s. About a decade later, I thought it was a good thing to start here,” he said.White was “greatly encouraged” by Liam Clarke, the late and highly respected political editor of the Belfast : “Liam would conduct his own informal polling at party conferences, asking delegates for their views on a range of topical issues.“He was very data-driven and thought online polling with a really good sample size would be a big step forward.“By , nearly everybody had a computer or laptop and an email address. The great thing about online polling was its confidentiality and that’s so important in a place like Northern Ireland.“You do it in your own home, and you do it directly. You remove all human interaction. When you vote somebody hands you a ballot, but you mark it in the privacy of a polling booth.“Nobody knows your views unless you choose to tell them. Polling benefits when the same approach applies.”While occasional opinion polls were carried out in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, White says regular and political polling would have been impossible for a local company as the conflict raged.“Somebody would have threatened to blow your head offthey didn’t like the results, particularlyit concerned a contentious and emotional an issue like the border” he said..“I get a bit of grief on social media nowadays. Somebody recently told me: ‘Be careful you don’t get a knock on the door’.“Imagine what a pollster would have endured in the Seventies and Eighties here “It would have been only a small minority getting upset, but it would have been a very dangerous minority.”White says many other problems would have plagued pollsters during the Troubles: “With no internet, face-to-face polling would have been necessary.“It would have been challenging for interviewers to go into republican or loyalist areas, knock on doors, and ask people who they were planning to vote for. A lot of doors would have been slammed in a lot of faces.“In other cases, people would have been reluctant to tell the truth about who they were voting for because they wouldn’t want to offend the interviewer.“They would have been reserved for fear of hurting the feelings of the questioner. Other folk would just have been genuinely nervous about opening up.“It’s a sign of how Northern Ireland is progressing to a normal society, how the situation is calmer and more settled, that we actually can conduct regular polling on political issues.”The few polls that were carried out during the conflict, and in the decade after the ceasefires, often signicantly under-estimated support for the DUP, and particularly Sinn Fein.A survey just before the  Westminster election put Sinn Fein on %. It secured a % vote.A poll ahead of the  Assembly election put the DUP and Sinn Fein both on %. They secured % and % respectively.The existence of the ‘shy’ Sinn Fein or DUP voter — reluctant to say they voted for a party considered extreme — skewed many polls.In Britain, politicians have made fatal mistakes based on polling.Theresa May opted for an early election in April  when the Tories’ average poll lead over Labour was % points. Fty days later, a general election resulted in a hung Parliament.White believes much criticism of polling is unfair: “Pollsters don’t have super powers, we don’t predict the future.“A poll is only a snapshot in time. You treat a poll like the weather forecast.“It says ‘Showers in North Down’, so you take an umbrella, but you don’t knowit’s actually going to be raining at precisely .pm when you’re visiting Aunt Mabel in Bangor. Polls are about identying trends.”White warns that polls struggle much more with the outcome of referenda than elections.“A referendum campaign is entirely dferent to an election campaign,” he added.“It’s big and unknown. You’re spinning the roulette wheel. In Scotland the pro-independence campaign started on % — it was neck-and-neck near the end of the campaign. If a border poll was called here nobody knows how it would go. There are countless factors that could influence how it developed. So many people who never voted in elections would likely turn out.”Related topicsLucidTalk pollArlene FosterTraditional Unionist VoiceNI ProtocolThe Executive OfficeUlster Unionist PartyDoug BeattieSDLPColum EastwoodSinn FéinMore On LucidTalk poll PremiumViewpointOpinionChange has been a long time coming PremiumJon TongeOpinionWill Alliance’s moderate politics become a big deal in May Integrated education campaigners throw down gauntlet to UUPPoll: Unionists more concerned about NHS than Northern Ireland protocolKaty Hayward and David PhinnemoreOpinionDo you understand the Protocol, and does it really matter anyway Most ReadStormont department criticised for building Derry park-and-ride which breaches planning rulesNorth Belfast security alert: Watch moment Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney evacuated after vehicle hijackedWe live in fear, says mother of boy attacked ‘for being Protestant’UVF blamed for north Belfast bomb hoax aimed at Simon CoveneyOutrage as schoolboyis victim of ‘sectarian attack’ in north BelfastTop VideosPlayIrish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney evacuated from north Belfast event due to security alertPlayVideo: UVF behind Simon Coveney north Belfast security alert say police PlayVideo: Wall collapses in north BelfastLatest Northern Ireland Assembly elections Mallon labels DUP ‘a party of irrational mood swings’SDLP leader says election offers chance to break ‘cycle of crisis and collapse’DUP veteran who quit after ousting of Arlene Foster ‘delighted’ to run for party in Assembly electionSuzanne BreenOpinionThe DUP’s failings are Sinn Fein’s biggest strength in the upcoming Stormont electionCall for unionist parties to stand aside in west Belfast for community candidate in Assembly electionLatestRewards on the line as teams prepare for final day drama‘Huge loss for music’ as Foo Fighters’ Taylor Hawkins dies at ‘Trailblazer’ Margaret Beckett, first women foreign secretary, to retire as MPUber ‘delighted’ to be granted two-and-a-half-year licence for LondonUkraine eyes fresh Russian setbacks as Moscow hints at scaling back of ambitions,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Faulkner and other Cabinet ministers address a mass rally of Vanguard supporters from the balcony of StormontMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailAt .pm, on March , , Northern Ireland’s House of Commons adjourned. It was never to meet again. Two days later the NI Temporary Provisions Act became law, introducing direct rule, ending  years of unionist government, bringing devolution to a stop and shutting down NI’s Parliament. It was the biggest crisis for unionism since the  Home Rule Bill.At lunchtime on March , Brian Faulkner, destined to be NI’s last Prime Minister, led his Cabinet onto the balcony to address the enormous crowdwhich had gathered in the grounds. He had only a loudspeaker.“People of Ulster, I am speaking to you still as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. I want to say, not just on my own behalf, but on behalf of every one of my colleagues in the Government and the Parliamentary Party here at Stormont, that we understand absolutely the feelings which have persuaded you to come out to Parliament Buildings today… we share the resentment that you feel. We have tremendous power.“Our power is the power of our numbers our power is the justice of our cause our power is the responsibility of our conduct. Let us never play the game of the murderers of the IRA. Let us show the world that, so far as we are concerned, violence and intimidation are out. British we are and British we remain!”The previous day Faulkner had addressed an emergency meeting of the Ulster Unionist Council, informing it that his government had lost confidence in Edward Heath’s administration.By his own admission it was an angry meeting seething at what was regarded as a betrayal and surrender to unionism’s enemies. But he also warned them to shun violent responses and rely, instead, on the ‘Unionist veto’ which lay in the strength of their numbers.Exactly  years later, on Monday March , the present Assembly will be dissolved in preparation for an election on May . There are many within the unionist community who believe that, like its predecessor on March , , this institution will not meet again.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Political unionism is again seething with anger, believing that another Conservative government has betrayed it and rolled over to the demands of those who want Northern Ireland removed from the United Kingdom. Indeed, they would argue that the process of removal has been advanced by a protocol which traps Northern Ireland in some sort of constitutional halfway house between Great Britain, the Republic of Ireland and the European Union.When Brian Faulkner spoke of unionism relying on the strength of its numbers it was at a time when the combined pro-Union vote hovered around two-thirds of the overall vote.At the election for the first post-NI Parliament Assembly, in June , the pro-Union votewas %. In the  Assembly election that votehad reduced to .%.That election also saw unionism reduced to a minority within an NI Parliament and Assembly: and there is now a possibility, come May , that unionism won’t even have the numbers to qualy for the position of First Minister.And yet unionism remains as ided now as it was back in . The narrowing of the demographic gap between unionism and nationalism, along with an ongoing reluctance by successive British governments to be seen to be what might be described as pro-active on behalf of unionism, hasn’t pushed it in the direction of prioritising a coherent, collective, long-term strategy for survival.Even the thundering hammer-blows rained down on the DUP by Boris Johnson continue to be greeted with fairly mild responses from the party leadership.Speaking on Monday evening Jeffrey Donaldson acknowledged the problem: “It’s not a question of throwing the DUP under the bus. The Prime Minister threw Northern Ireland under the bus and the harm that this protocol has done to Northern Ireland is, I think, something the Prime Minister now recognises. But we need him to do something about it.”The problem, of course, is that Donaldson has been saying this since September last yearand Johnson has done nothing. He’ll continue to do nothing until May : and, in all likelihood, will do nothing after that, either.In March  Brian Faulkner and the UUP decided to risk the collapse of the NI Parliament rather than allow control of security to pass from the NI government to Westminster.A few days before Stormont was prorogued Faulkner had written to Edward Heath: ‘We wish to point out with a sense of the heavy responsibility involved that the imposition of this proposal, involving as it will the resignation of the Government of Northern Ireland as a whole, may have the gravest consequences, the full extent of which cannot now be foreseen.’We now know the primary consequence of the resignation and subsequent prorogation: the end of majority rule, the introduction of mandatory power-sharingand the sapping of unionist confidence that their future position within the United Kingdom was, to all intents and purposes, secure.What Faulkner did — although I fully understand why he had to do it — was hand over the political negotiating process to a British government which was determined to build an entirely dferent relationship with its Irish counterpart.In his biography, Memoirs of a Statesman , Faulkner hinted at regrets: “... when unionists of vision tried to stimulate new thinking and broaden the appeal of unionism in the s s I did not come out and support them. I did not think they were achieving anything useful...but we should have spent more time watering the roots of tolerance.“We did not take the initiative in reforming our society until events forced change on us. By  we were reacting to events rather than controlling them and one was always conscious of running very fast merely to make up lost ground.’Since then, a number of other unionist loyalist leaders have voiced fairly similar regrets. Sometimes about their own personal lack of foresight and sometimes about opportunities which unionism may have missed over the decades.Yet as Faulkner noted, there was always a sense that unionism was a few steps behind the thinking of others when it came to mapping out Northern Ireland’s post- future. Or, as former UUP leader Reg Empey put it, “every time unionism walks from the table it inevitably and iniably s to another table with a weaker hand”.In the early s a Minister of State based in the NIO told me: “The problem with unionism — and it’s a particular problem for those outside Northern Ireland who try to understand it — is that there are far too many ieties. They spend as much time complaining about their unionist rivals as they do complaining about their more specic political and constitutional opponents.”From until the collapse of Stormont in  the isions could mostly be controlled by the mantra — ‘United we stand. Divided we fall.’ But once the fall came there was nothing to hold unionism together and it splintered and continues to splinter.Faulkner and power-sharing were destroyed by the United Ulster Unionist Council in . Shortly afterwards the ious members of the UUUC — who couldn’t come up with an agreed alternative to the Sunningdale deal — turned on themselves.The UUP descended into civil war between -. The loyalist paramilitary groups, essential to the ‘selling’ of the Good Friday Agreement, have now withdrawn support for it. The DUP has had a horrible  months and is still beset with internal dficulties.A growing element of younger loyalism is pushing its anti-protocol campaigning towards prioritising the final collapse of the GFA institutions. And Jeffrey Donaldson and Jim Allisterhave laid down pre-election preconditions on both the protocol and the eventuality of a Sinn Fein First Minister.Change a few names and organisations and we could be talking about that period from March  to May  — when unionism and loyalism were struggling to find a route map from the crisis forced on them by widespread political societal instability and British governments which were determined to impose change upon them.But here’s the reality:the strategies and policies adopted by unionists didn’t work back then, why does anyone think terribly similar strategies and policies would work today: particularly when the constitutional crisis is worse now than then and the shadow of a border poll is hanging over every aspect of the coming election.A British state paper released in  had this assessment of the  Assembly election: ‘Mr Faulkner’s position is undoubtedly dficult. He will have less than half of the Protestant vote behind him, as Dr Paisley and others will no doubt vocerously remind him,and when he makes an effort to work the new system.“It was always to be anticipated that the Protestant vote would be fragmented… but the outcome has left the potential accepters weaker and the ‘wreckers’ stronger than expected.’Something very similar happened to David Trimble in , allowing his internal and external opponents to destroy him. Might the same thing be about to happen to Jeffrey Donaldson  Between  and  the DUP vote represented a majority of unionist votes cast — but even then, the party had to temper a lot of decisions and steer away from potential compromises and concessions. If the DUP doesn’t represent the majority of unionist votes cast and seats won in the Assembly on May  it will make it very dficult for Donaldson to reboot the executive.We seem to be on ‘the more things change, the more they stay the same’ territory for unionism. Again. But there is one dference. I was in that crowd in the grounds of Stormont on March , , a few months short of my th birthday.I recognised the scale of the shock: but I also recognised something , a new opportunity for unionism to do things dferently.

This is simply not fair on local families.Mr McGrath said a pattern was emerging whereby motorists in Newcastle sped along the Shimna Road from Donard Park and made their way up the Castlewellan Road.He urged police to get to grips with the issue to ensure people who live locally are no longer subjected to such behaviour.Cllr Devlin said the ldquoselfish actions of some drivers were not fair on residents, insisting that she and Mr McGrath will support those affected by the issue any way they can.ldquoWe shall be requesting a speed assessment of the area and asking police to consider monitoring any adverse behaviour, she confirmed.ldquoWe would appeal to local familiesthey do witness any reckless behaviour on the roads that could endanger lives to report it to police so they can gather all the necessary data..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch Camera Club competition in memory of Charlie  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Camera Club members welcomed Vitorrio Silvestri, from CPA Camera Club, last Thursday night to judge the entries which had been submitted for the annual Charlie Rutledge Memorial competition.Charlie was a much loved and respected founding member of Ballynahinch Camera Club and his great passion was mono photography.After Charlie passed away in  it was decided to hold a competition each year in his memory and what other genre of photographs could such a competition attract but black and white Vitorrio gave a critique on each image and, in some cases, demonstrated how they could be improved.

The Ballynahinch scheme represents excellent value for money and should have been prioritised during the past two years.Mr Hazzard said more than poundbn of capital resources has been spent by the roads minister and her department during the letime of the current Assembly.ldquoIt is hugely disappointing that a small, yet strategically important scheme, such as the Ballynahinch bypass has been left on the shelf. In light of the economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would have been a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of the local community, said the MP.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWe can only hope now that when the Executive is restored after Mayrsquos election, that the local community can have a minister in place who recognises the value of the Ballynahinch bypass and finally begins construction.Mr Casement said the bypass could help kick-start the economic regeneration of the town and provide the wider South Down tourism economy with a signicant boost. He said it was vital a start date for construction work is confirmed as soon as possible.A key member of Ballynahinchrsquos Regeneration Committee for many years alongside the late Vincent Fullam, Mr Casement has never given up the battle to secure a bypass, which was first mooted in the late s.ldquoThe bypass is included in a list of strategic projects and is effectively ready to proceed.

crowned Bobby Dalzell Cup champions after defeating local rivals Ardglass in the deciding penalty shoot-out at Meadowvale last Thursday.A goal on the stroke of half-time from Ardglass midfielder Stephen Deegan was cancelled out on  minutes by the close range effort of Celtic striker Jordan McCoubrey.The teams refused to be split in extra-time and following the shoot-out mdash which went well into the sudden death stages mdash Blaine Connolly converted the all-important spot kick to gt his Hoopsrsquo side the victory.A large crowd turned out in Drumaness for the St Patrickrsquos Day showpiece between the current first and second-placed sides in the Newcastle Leaguersquos Premier Division.Adding to the pressure of the occasion was the alternating weather conditions, with the teams contesting the final in periods of sunshine as well as wind and rain.Nevertheless, Celtic kicked off the affair with the blustery conditions heavily in favour of their opponents.It didnrsquot take long for the tone of the match to be set as Ardglass defender Caolain OrsquoShea launched a very physical tackle on Hoops striker Jay Gibney.Ardglass enjoyed early momentum with experienced defender Neil Teggart seeing his wind-assisted free kick from his own half trouble Celtic custodian Nathan Curran less than ten minutes in.Celtic remained calm and soon strung their passes together through clever one touch football with eventual man of the match winner Conor Doherty in the thick of these sequences.However, Ardglass remained a threat and came close when Teggart clipped a cross into the danger area, although striker Michael Magee glanced his header wide.Stand-in Celtic captain Shaun Megahey attempted to play a through ball to team-mate Gibney, but on this occasion the Ardglass defence timed the offside trap perfectly.Celtic did come close when Barry Treacyrsquos corner kick was fumbled by Ardglass lsquokeeper, Mark Armstrong, although Hoops defender Paul Brady couldnrsquot dispatch the ball quickly enough before the danger was cleared.OrsquoShea continued his earlier eagerness and picked up a yellow card for a mistimed tackle before his team-mate, Magee, was unfairly clattered at the other end of the pitch, although Teggartrsquos effort flew past the wrong side of the post.Teggart continued to be a problem from set pieces as his free-kick delivery whisked past the head of striker Magee and out of bounds.Moments later, Mageersquos misfortune continued when he was shown a yellow card for expressing his disagreement with referee, Barry Mullan.After initially allowing the match to flow freely, referee Mullan clamped down on his decisions with less than ten minutes to the end of the opening half.Celtic defender Gary Carberry was the latest to enter the book for a late challenge on Ardglass marksman Magee.Despite this hiccup, Celticrsquos Carberry kept himself in contention for the man of the match accolade after he proved pivotal in stopping potential goalscoring chances from the Ardglass opposition on numerous occasions.As the half-time whistle approached, Celtic arms were raised as they appealed for the red card to be shown to Ardglassrsquos OrsquoShea, who may have considered himself lucky to escape an early bath after he was second to the ball.Ardglass launched another attack and it looked asMagee would have a free route to goal. However, Celtic veteran Brady recovered valiantly to prove he still has plenty of miles left in his tank.With the last attack of the half, Ardglass were awarded a corner and they took full advantage of their opportunity. Midfielder, Stephen Deegan, climbed high above the rest to head his effort beyond the outstretched hand of Celtic lsquokeeper Curran to open the scoring.As the second half kicked off it was evident that both sides would refrain from going for broke. A lot of the following ten minutes contained attacks, although both sides lacked a killer instinct and the match was heavily contested in the middle of the pitch.This is where Conor Doherty earned his post-match award for his performance, as he often won the midfield battle.Goal-scorer Deegan picked up a yellow as the weather took yet another turn for the worse.Celtic joint-managers Jason Galbraith and Matthew McKenna made the first of their substitutions as the clock struck the hour mark with Sean McMahon entering the fray in place of Conaill Kerr.Ardglass opted to put  men behind the ball in order to frustrate the opposition and waited patiently for their opportunity to counter-attack.Ardglass made changes of their own in the form of Jordan Finnegan before Celtic made a second substitute with the talented Sean Ferris making his way onto the pitch.Ferris made an immediate impact, adding another string to Celticrsquos bow by spreading inviting passes into his forward line.With just  minutes left of the , these Celtic substitutions came to fruition after the ball found its way to McMahon, who lofted an inviting ball into the Ardglass box which was steered home by the boot of striker McCoubrey.Celtic continued to mix things up as Corey McCartan made his way onto the pitch and gave a good account of himself with his tireless work rate.Despite this period of succession for the Hoops, the remaining minutes of the  played out finely balanced.Ardglass never let their headsand should be commended for their effort as they cancelled out any further attack whilst continuously seeking the crucial next goal.As tempers flared, the final whistle sounded and both teams prepared for extra-time.The highlights of the first half of extra-time came in the form of Celticrsquos Treacy picking up a yellow card before team-mate Ferris crashed his left-footed effort off the crossbar.During the next interval, both of Ardglassrsquo Magee and Celticrsquos Ferris threatened but they couldnrsquot do enough to get the ball over the line and it would be penalties that would decide the final outcome.Amongst the numerous penalties which took place, both Celtic and Ardglass players were ordered to retake their spot kicks.Firstly, Celtic striker McCoubrey saw his effort denied by Armstrong before referee Mullan blew his whistle after adjudging the Ardglass custodian to be off his line as the penalty was taken.McCoubrey fired in the retake and it wouldnrsquot be long before Ardglass substitute Finnegan would go through a similar course of events after he missed his initial penalty but converted at the second time of asking.Eventually, as the penalties progressed well into sudden death, Celticrsquos Blaine Connolly remained calm and converted the deciding spot kick to send the Hoopsrsquo support into delirium as his side were crowned champions.Following the conclusion, man of the match Conor Doherty gave his thoughts on his sidersquos victory.ldquoI thought we were the better team in the first half but then they snuck a goal before half-time, he said.ldquoBut, even with the wind we started to press on, it was a long  minutes.ldquoIt was a hard hitting game but Irsquom just glad we got on the winning side of it.He added: ldquoAll the penalties were top class, it was a really good shootout.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey , B Connolly, P Brady, G Carberry, C

The business centre would also encompass a multi-purpose meeting room.The committee, which is headed by local businessman, Mr Michael Heron, is seeking funding under the CRISP programme of the Department of Environment and the International Fund.It would act as the lsquocorersquo project to trigger other public and private sector investment in the town in areas such as upgrading footpaths, improving lighting and restoring derelict buildings.STRANGFORD mdash The Department of the Environment has been urged not to cancel a package of improvements for Strangford.The appeal was made by the chairman of Strangford Village Committee, Mr John Steenson, who said the recent decision by residents to veto plans for a new ferry jetty should not jeopardise improvements earmarked for the village.Speaking at the committeersquos annual meeting, Mr Steenson said a new, re-styled ferry terminal would be widely welcomed by residents, while a traffic scheme in the DoE car park would do much to reduce traffic congestion within the village.Mr Steenson said he was ldquogratied by the number of residents who attended the public meeting at which the improvements were discussed.ldquoThe great majority at the meeting were implacably opposed to the building of what seemed to them to be a long and unsightly jetty into the lough to act as a mooring for the two ferries, Mr Steenson remarked.ldquoAlthough there was no detailed discussion of the committeersquos suggestion that the ferry terminal be relocated outside the village, or the village by-passed by a new road, I think most people accepted, able reluctantly, that the proposal was simply not possible because of the cost, he said.KILLYLEAGH mdash Delamont Country Park, outside Killyleagh, looks set to be officially opened around Easter, it was agreed this week.Down Council is to push ahead with the opening arrangements following complaints that it has taken too long to get the prestigious project off the ground.Councillors have complained that a prime opportunity to publicise the park has been missed because it was not possible to hold an official opening when Ulster Television was filming in the district over St Patrickrsquos week.At the monthly council meeting it was also revealed that a businessman, who has opened a garden centre in Delamont, is annoyed because he was told the official opening would take place at Halloween last year.Mr John Cushnie opened his centre in July  and he claims he was given assurances by council officers that the park would officially open within four months.When the opening did not take place, Mr Cushnie went back to the councilrsquos recreation committee and only last month was told the opening ceremony would take place around St Patrickrsquos Day.Another businessman, who plans to open an exotic bird centre at Delamont, claims he has been kept waiting for firm proposals regarding the piece of land on which he needs to build the centre.ARDGLASS mdash District nursing sisters Philomena Hanna and Pauline McEvoy are continuing a tradition which dates back to the th century and Florence Nightingale.Butthe district nurse had her beginnings in Victorian Britain, she is very much a part of the late th century, having at her disposal all the skills and resources of the modern health service.Even sock there remains the fundamental commitment to the wellbeing of the community which inspired the founders more than  years ago. Based in Ardglass, Sisters Hanna and McEvoy carry on the tradition of combining the roles of nurse, friend and comforter.It was on the advice of Florence Nightingale, lsquoThe Lady With the Lamprsquo who sprang to national prominence for her pioneering work during the Crimean War, that a certain William Rathbone established the first training school for district nurses in .The aim was to educate women in all aspects of nursing care and therefore bring relief to the poor who were living in appalling conditions in the urban slums created as a consequence of the Industrial Revolution.By , there were  district nurses in the Liverpool area. As the benefits quickly became apparent, the service spread to other parts of Britain.

After a briefto live in the south of England, Pat eventually settled in New Zealand where he spent the rest of his le.Patrsquos landscape photography is stunning and his portraits of local people are without parallel mdash they reveal a strong sense of place, identity and the character of the people.Particularly important is that most of the people have been identied.The photographs were mostly taken in the s and s, but since then the world has changed in many ways. Some of the landscapes may look the same, but buildings have gone, farming le is radically dferent and the fishing industry decimated.Cecil Newman grew up in Belfast, but from a young age enjoyed hiking and youth hostelling. He studied engineering at Queenrsquos University and joined the Royal Engineers during World War II.Whilst working in Berlin after the war to help with the processes of reconstruction, Cecil took some striking photographs of the devastated city. Some of these images were later given to the Berlin City Museum.After the war Cecil ed to work as surveyor for Belfast City Council and later as a planner in the Northern Ireland Civil Service. Amongst the many high-profile projects with which he was involved were the first Newry Area Plan and the Mourne Study. Both these publications included his photographs.During the s he concentrated particularly on aerial photographs. He was a leading member of the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside and Mournes Advisory Council, often giving talks illustrated with his photographs and slides. After his death the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside erected a memorial in his honour at Trassey car park in the Mournes.Photographs taken by him which are now in the Down County Museum collection reflect both his work and passion for the Mournes. An outstanding feature of Cecilrsquos photographs is that they were accompanied by date and Ordnance Survey map grid reference mdash what curator could ask for more The importance of these two photographic collections is that they complement each other, in covering the same geographical area, but taken for dferent purposes and at dferent times.The number of images represented is smaller than the DJ McNeill archive so it was possible for the museumrsquos curatorial staff to catalogue them all and the Museum Photographer to digitise them.What remains to be done is adding the images and full information to the Museumrsquos database and more to the website. There are always more jobs to be carried out on the collection.However, using the images effectively, and in the way the Hudson and Newman families, and indeed all other donors, wished, requires wide knowledge of all the collections by experienced and qualied professional staff working with them on a daily basis.The photographic archive is recognised as one of the most important in Ireland and contains a wide range of images, including daguerrotypes, glass negative plates, lantern slides, black and white and colour film, transparencies as well as digital images.Understanding of all the processes involved in their making is essential to how they are cared for and used.Lesley Simpson is secretary of the Friends of Down County Museum and former Keeper of Collections at the museum..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Success at Downpatrick  ","story":"PRIOR to Sundayrsquos Randox Ulster National Handicap Chase meeting at Downpatrick Racecourse, manager Richard Lyttle stated that he was looking forward to welcoming racegoers back to the track for the first time in three years.They certainly turned up with car parks filled to capacity, packed enclosures and long tailbacks on the Ballydugan Road prior to the first race.The Randox Ulster National has been the local tracks major race of the year now for many years and the maximum  runners faced the starter for the three mile four furlong race that sees prize money paid right down to the first six past the post.A bit like the big Aintree race, there was plenty of fallers with two coming down at the very first fence and Envoi Pierji then unseating Donegal jockey Conor Orr, who had ridden Screaming Colours to success for Bill Durkan in the Midlands National at Uttoxeter the previous day.Later in the race there was more fallers at the regulation fence.With two fences to be taken the race involved four runners with the  winner Amaulino travelling like the winner under David McGrath.But this combination then faded, eventually finishing fourth for Co Armagh trainer Keith Watson.The eventual winner in the famous J P McManus Silks proved to be Spades Are Trumps, ridden by Cheltenham winning jockey Mark McDonagh, a lb claimer.Finishing second was Agent Born, ridden by Darragh OrsquoKeefe with Peaches and Cream third.Co Meath trainer Gavin Cromwell, who also had success at Cheltenham, saddled the winner and also the third past the post.

They were used as a commercial rabbit warren when John De Courcy arrived and built Dundrum Castle in .The lucrative trade in rabbit pelts continued for centuries afterwards. Rabbits are still common today, although the population was decimated by the myxomatosis disease in the s.The s was also when the National Trust began managing the habitat on behalf of its owners, the Hill family mdash commonly known as the Marquises of Downshire.The Hill family came to the area in the late th century but had lived in Ireland since the late s, when a young army officer named Moyses Hill, originally from Devon, was posted to Carrickfergus garrison in  to command forces sent by Elizabeth I to subdue the rebellious OrsquoNeill clan and colonise Ireland.Moyses ended up staying in Ireland and marrying the sister of a local clan chief. In , he was granted land at Cromlyn, an area which later took his surname and became known as Hillsborough. His descendants then acquired Murlough in  and began using Murlough Farm as their summer residence.They built Murlough House in , which still stands today at the end of Keel Point mdash at the northern end of the beach. While built to have a spectacular sea view, stormy weather kept breaking the windows, so trees were planted around the house in , and the woodland remains to this day.In , the th Marquis of Downshire, Arthur Hill, sold the surrounding land to the National Trust and then sold the house in . The area became Irelandrsquos first nature reserve in  and remains the most extensive dune heath in Ireland .But prior to being sold to the National Trust, Murlough House and the dunes were a hotbed of military activity ndash particularly during WWII. The house was a base for the US Armyrsquos st Armoured Division and the th Tank Destroyer Battalion.They built several firing ranges in the dunes, including, allegedly, a mortar range. Spare bombers and fighters were also hidden there as Murlough Farm had its own landing strip, called lsquo Satellite Landing Groundrsquo .Murlough beach itself was dotted with anti-aircraft and anti-invasion posts mdash whose rotting remnants are still visible today. They were dug-in when a full-scale German invasion was a threat in the early s.They were part of a counter-invasion strategy that centred on slowing or stopping the enemy at certain locations until other forces could be mustered and deployed. This involved constructing a so-called lsquocoastal crustrsquo along beaches and inland lsquostop-linesrsquo along rivers, canals and high ground.With Northern Ireland being prime invasion territory, a coastal crust was set up from Magilligan in the north-west to Newcastle in the south-east, alongside an inland stop-line along the route of the River Bann. Anti-aircraft landing posts, like those at Murlough, were important in preventing aircraft or boats from landing, but another type of defence was the centrepiece of this strategy: pillboxes.When events at Dunkirk in  sparked invasion panic, the Directorate of Fortications and Works at the War Office was created to construct defensive systems around the UKrsquos beaches. The Royal Engineers and civilian contractors erected over , pillboxes by in a matter of days ndash including on eight of Northern Irelandrsquos beaches.Such structures can still be seen at Magilligan, Portrush and Portstewart. County Down also has intact examples in Bangor, Donaghadee and on the Strangford shore between Comber and Newtownards. Beaches at Minerstown and Tyrella also had multiple pillboxes, as did Murlough. They were spaced to have interlocking arcs of fire, so invaders had little unchallenged space in which to land.One of these pillboxes is still visible in Newcastle, on the beach just below the outdoor swimming pool. The remnants of the other are still visible at the northern end of Murlough, next to the inlet that feeds Dundrum Bay. Yet all that is left are large slabs of reinforced concrete as this pillbox was supposedly destroyed in the early days of the Troubles to prevent it being used to attack the nearby Ballykinlar Army Camp.But these remains are now also under attack from erosion. They are gradually being absorbed by the sea. With this stretch of coastline losing five to ten metres of coastline a year, the remnants of the pillbox, originally built at an elevated height in the dunes, is even starting to be submerged at high tide.What was once a reflection of an indominable spirit is now an unassuming pile of rubble used only as a seat for resting walkers ndash most of whom are unaware of its history. Soon, it will be completely forgotten and the only reminder of this stretch of coastlinersquos rich military history will be the occasional washed-up ordnance.Ben Acheson spent seven years deployed to Afghanistan, including stints as Director of NATOrsquos political team and as Political Adviser to the EU Special Representative.

Such dedication is a hallmark of the Northern Ireland football captain’s career and has led her to making history with her squad as they head to the Women’s Euro  finals. But ahead of Mother’s Day she also has an inspiring, important message for the next generation of female sporting stars - being both mother and top athlete is possible.Marissa said: “It’s so important for women in sport to know thatthey want to have kids it can happen. That women do believe it is possible to have kids and have a career in sport.”   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

On our team we have Sarah McFadden, and she has a wee girl Harper, . She came back and played an international match three months after she gave birth. “It’s raising the awareness and telling the stories that it is possible so we can inspire the next generation of women in sport.”Growing up in west Belfast in a time when an international women’s football side wasn’t even in existence, never mind a possibility, it’s little wonder the passionate player has become a role model for women in sport and for the next generation of female athletes.“I do take pride in inspiring the next generation of girls coming up,” said Marissa.“Football has given me so much in my journey, I love to show young girls that it’s a great sport to be in. But not just football but any sport – the le lessons you learn – you can’t put a price on it. “Football’s my passion and I just want to let young girls know that football is great for your mental and physical health. I don’t know where I would be without it.”However, despite great strides being made in sport the statistics show there is still work to do. A signicant gap between men and women taking part in sport still exists, with women less likely to have taken part in sport at least once within the last year, %, than men, %. Unfortunately, according to Sport NI figures this gap gets wider on our sidelines with women representing just .% of the overall sports coaching workforce in Northern Ireland and this dropping to just % for those who coach our World, Olympic or Paralympic medallists.To help close this gap Sport NI recently launched their Women In Sport Panel that sees women from dferent sporting backgrounds offering their expertise on how to overcome barriers and create more opportunities for women and girls at all levels of sport.Marissa believes that listening to women and funding in sport are key factors in closing the gap.“It’s so important to listen to women from all levels of sport to be able to improve experiences and see what we can do better. This  also gives visibility to women who are in sport, coaching, leadership, and governance levels. That is so very important for females to see these real-le scenarios and see that it’s possible to achieve these roles.”Marissa points to Angela Platt, Irish Football AssociationDirector of Women’s Football and Women In Sport Panel member, as an inspiring example.“It is very powerful to have a female in the director’s role and to have that role created for the first time, especially as football is still very male dominated,” she said.The Cltonville player coach, who is mum to Quinn, , seems to have found the enviable balance between family le and her job on the pitch. She’s quick to credit her supportive partner Paula and the recent funding from the IFA, sponsors, and the Department for Communitiesfor helping make that work – le balance happen.“In January we got fully funded to train professionally. So those who were working fulltime got put on secondment and are training up at Newforgefulltime,” she explained.It means that Marissa’s job as the IFA’s Girls’ Participation Officer has been put on hold until September, after the World Cup qualiers next month and the Euros in July. “That has been a massive gamechanger for me.”Not only is it allowing Marissa, and the rest of the women’s international team to concentrate on their game, but for the captain she’s getting precious time with her little boy.“I’m able to drop him off and pick him up at creche. We get home, make dinner and have normal family le. Whereas before we got the investment to go fulltime you were working in your day job and were out most evenings. My partner was doing an awful lot whereas now it’s nice to have that family time. “I’m fortunate to have a supportive partner there who understands what it means to play at this level. Obviously, we go away a lot so that can be tough. “But at the same time, I know that I do it for the love of the game – it’s my thing. For our Quinn, I just think it will be amazing for him to look back on. I know he’s only two now but at least I’ll have a great story to tell him. It’s better for him to believe he can do anything.“We as the women’s international team have made our dreams come true in what we have achieved. I think it’s important for him to see his mum achieve what we have achieved and hopefully that will inspire him when he’s older.”As Quinn chats away in the background Marissa reveals he’s already showing some promise with his feet.“Quinn loves football. We have footballs of all sizes and shapes here. He’s ‘mama football’ and we play away. He does associate football with me so when football is on TV, he’s ‘mama, mama.’”As for now Marissa is the first to admit she’s “living the dream”.She has the Euros to look forward to and the World Cup qualiers coming up against Austria, April , and England, April .“We’re solely focused on getting into that squad and getting the squad prepared for those big games. They’re two unbelievable sides and two massive games so we have to make sure we’re fully ready for it,” she added.“The momentum we’ve built here within the women’s game here is incredible. If you look back three years ago, we would have had maybe  people watching us play. Obviously off the back of our success and qualying for the Euros there are over , tickets sold for the England game at Windsor. “It’s really hard to believe. I definitely think it’ll be an emotional day when we’re there at Windsor with that many fans.“There’s a lot to look forward to.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It will still be available to support the small group for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. The PCR home ordering service will remain available for the general public to support those for whom PCR is recommended.– Publicly accessible Covid- testing sites will close. Local health and social care trusts will continue to provide PCR testing to support clinical care.– Those with symptoms will be advised to use lateral flow devicesto test instead of booking a PCR.– Routine asymptomatic testing will continue to be advised for those living, working and visiting health and social care settings, including hospitals and care homes and other high risk settings.– Asymptomatic LFD testing for the wider population will cease. Access to free LFDs for this purpose will cease.– Routine asymptomatic workplace testing will cease.– Routine asymptomatic testing in most educational settingswill cease at the Easter break.– Asymptomatic testing in special schools will continue after Easter and will be kept under review. It may continue until the end of June.– Routine population contact tracing will be phased out between mid-April and the end of June.Chief Medical Officer Sir Michael McBride said: “We will continue throughout the transition phase to support and protect our most vulnerable.“After these changes are introduced from April , I would urge people to check on NI Directtesting remains recommended for them – for examplethey are eligible for new treatments.“In the coming weeks, the department will also be working to provide advice and support to those eligible for treatments. It is particularly important that those who are at higher risk of serious illness follow the guidance on getting tested.“The tools at our disposal to protect people who are at higher risk from Covid- have advanced considerably since the early days of the pandemic.“Alongside the vaccine and booster programme, new Covid- treatments continue to be used by patients in Northern Ireland and new treatments are in development.“As the amount of testing across society reduces, our behaviour and actions have an even more important role in preventing transmission and keeping others safe.“I urge everyone to continue to follow the public health guidance, including continuing to wear a face covering in enclosed settings like public transport and when visiting hospitals and care homes.”Robin SwannNorthern IrelandPCR  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularBryson dubs Simon Coveney a ‘meddling aggressor’ saying the Dublin government ‘swans around NI asthey own the place’Irish League football legend David Jeffrey ‘giving up the day job’UDA probe: PSNI welcome sentences handed down to father and son after drugs seizureAnti-Protocol activist says loyalists could take protests to heart of Dublin as Saoradh members fail to materialiseMessage purportedly from Saoradh calls for counter-demo during tonight’s Protocol rally in DungannonMost PopularWhat’s going to happen in Season  of Netflix’s Bridgerton: what happens in Julia Quinn’s novels, where to buyLEGO launch new Back to the Future DeLorean set with Marty and Doc figures for  of the best duvets for winter UK: how to chose, synthetic, down or wool fill, and what tog to keep cosy Bike helmets UK : Eight best cycling helmets for womenBeautul bouquets for Mother’s Day UK : the best flowers to have delivered to mum for Mothering Sunday                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

A plan to redevelop the venue into a ,-capacity stadium has been beset by delay and controversy.The contents of the letter provoked a backlash from other executive parties, including UUP MLA Mike Nesbitt who claimed Mr Lyons was acting prematurely in discounting support for the bid, and Sinn Fein’s John Finucane who said a “can do attitude” was needed.However, a Department for Economy spokesperson later told the News Letter that “departmental officials remain involved in the process,” and added: “The Minister fully supports our involvement in any bid, but, as Northern Ireland enters the pre-election period it will be for a new Executive to formally agree our participations.“While there are clearly obstacles in place at the moment, the Minister is confident these can be overcome.” Gordon LyonsNorthern IrelandIrelandDUPGAA  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularBryson dubs Simon Coveney a ‘meddling aggressor’ saying the Dublin government ‘swans around NI asthey own the place’Irish League football legend David Jeffrey ‘giving up the day job’UDA probe: PSNI welcome sentences handed down to father and son after drugs seizureAnti-Protocol activist says loyalists could take protests to heart of Dublin as Saoradh members fail to materialiseMessage purportedly from Saoradh calls for counter-demo during tonight’s Protocol rally in DungannonMost PopularWhat’s going to happen in Season  of Netflix’s Bridgerton: what happens in Julia Quinn’s novels, where to buyLEGO launch new Back to the Future DeLorean set with Marty and Doc figures for  of the best duvets for winter UK: how to chose, synthetic, down or wool fill, and what tog to keep cosy Bike helmets UK : Eight best cycling helmets for womenBeautul bouquets for Mother’s Day UK : the best flowers to have delivered to mum for Mothering Sunday                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Only then will it be reinspected.”The MCA said there were no passengers or freight on board the European Causeway vessel when it was detained.Mr Shapps tweeted: “Following my instruction to inspect all PO vessels prior to entering back into service, the @MCA_Media has detained a ship for being unfit to sail.“I will not compromise the safety of these vessels and PO will not be able to rush inexperienced crew through training.”The detention of ships is based on concerns over their safety and to prevent them going to sea.The European Causeway entered service in  replacing the Pride of Rathlin, according to the PO Ferries website.“Specically designed for our Cairnryan to Larne route, she has not operated where and has only been taken out of serviceshe needs a refit,” the website said.It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson backed Mr Shapps’ call for PO Ferries’ chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite to quit, over the sacking of  workers without notice.In Larne, the local mayor of the Mid and East Antrim Council, William McCaughey, said they would support the reinstatement of the staff immediately.“It is ridiculous what PO has done to the staff, we in Larne would be very keen to see staff reinstated, it is the least that PO could do,” he told the PA news agency.Meanwhile, the RMT union said it welcomed the detention of the European Causeway and it demanded the Government “seize the entire fleet” of PO vessels.General secretary Mick Lynch said: “The seizing of the European Causeway by the MCA tonight shows that the gangster capitalist outfit PO are not fit and proper to run a safe service after the jobs massacre.“This mob should be barred, their ships impounded and the sacked crews reinstated to get these crucial ferry routes back running safely.”More from this reporter:Click here: Detectives call for information to help crack notorious murder case which saw Protestant minister beaten with nail-studded bats  years agoClick here: Protest at Belfast factory over ‘ludicrous nature of arms trade’ with equipment built by Thales being used by both Ukraine AND RussiaClick here: Plan unveiled for huge expansion of Co Antrim village bringing hundreds of new residentsClick here:Joe Biden tells St Patrick’s Day gathering: I may be Irish but I’m not stupid——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMr Drakeford was speaking while defending the news that compulsory mask-wearing in shops and on public transport in Wales will end on Monday - despite cases rising due to a new iant of the virus.During a press conference this lunchtime, Mr Drakeford said that, while people will no longer be legally required to wear masks on public transport or in retail settings from Monday, the Welsh Governments ‘strong advice’ would be to continue to wear them.He also confirmed that from the same date, there will be no legal requirement to self-isolate after testing positive for the virus, and issued the same ‘strong advice’ that people should do it.He said to help with people continuing to isolate, the £ isolation payment for families on low incomes would remain in place until June and that free lateral flow testing for people who think they have symptoms will also remain available.When askednow was the right time to do this considering the increase in cases relating to the BA strain of covid – which Mr Drakeford called “more transmissible than the omicron iant” – the first minister responded that it had previously been planned to end all restrictions in this weeks review, but he and his cabinet felt they were unable to do so due to the increase in cases.He likened the move to other viruses including measles.“We have to manage it like we would other conditions,\" he said. \"If you have measles, you wouldn’t go to work with it. That’s not law, it’s what is right.”He also called on the public to be sensible and use what they have learnt over the past two years. Mr Drakeford said: “For a disease that is moving from being pandemic to endemic, the public response has to move as well.“Because the cases are higher than expected, we are not able to move beyond that place and that is why we have not fully removed the restrictions..remove“People are able to do the right thing from their experience of two years of the virus and our strong advice as well.”MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford also highlighted how, unlike in Wales, it was never a legal requirement to self-isolate after a positive covid test in Scotland, and yet isolation levels were not reported to be lower compared to other nations.He also urged employers to not force their staff into workthey test positive after the self-isolation period ends.“No employer should put their staff in that position,\" he said. \"They shouldn’t do it for all the public health reasons, but they shouldn’t do it for their business either.”He continued: “If you force an employee to go in, all that will happen is more people will get infected and then the business will be infected and affected.”What are the changes From Monday, March , it will not be a legal requirement to wear masks on public transport and in retail settings, although it is still strongly advised.From the same date, it will not be a legal requirement to self-isolate after testing positive, but again it is strongly advised.The £ isolation payment for low-income families will continue until June. It is hoped that this will continue furtherit is needed and the funds from the UK government allow.Free lateral flow tests will be available in Wales until around June but it is hoped they will be available longer depending on UK government funding.You must still wear a mask in all health and social care settings unless exempt.Businesses must continue to carry out risk assessments and implement measures to prevent covid spreading as much as possible.Bosses should not force employees who have tested positive for covid to go into work.Teachers, staff and secondary school pupils should wear continue to wear masks for the rest of the term.The next review will take place on Thursday, April . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I will not compromise the safety of these vessels and PO will not be able to rush inexperienced crew through training.— Rt Hon Grant Shapps MPMarch , Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he will not compromise the safety of PO vessels and insisted that the company will not be able to rush training for inexperienced people.The company has sacked almost  seafarers and plans to replace them with agency staff on cheaper salaries.A spokesperson for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said: “We can confirm that the European Causeway has been detained in Larne.“It has been detained due to failures on crew familiarisation, vessel documentation and crew training.“The vessel will remain under detention until all these issues are resolved by PO Ferries. Only then will it be reinspected.” vw,vw,px, px\"PO European Causeway ferry docked at Larne Port last week The MCA said there were no passengers or freight on board the European Causeway vessel when it was detained.Mr Shapps tweeted: “Following my instruction to inspect all PO vessels prior to entering back into service, the @MCA_Media has detained a ship for being unfit to sail.“I will not compromise the safety of these vessels and PO will not be able to rush inexperienced crew through training.”The detention of ships is based on concerns over their safety and to prevent them going to sea.The European Causeway entered service in  replacing the Pride of Rathlin, according to the PO Ferries website..remove“Specically designed for our Cairnryan to Larne route, she has not operated where and has only been taken out of serviceshe needs a refit,” the website said.It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson backed Mr Shapps’ call for PO Ferries’ chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite to quit, over the sacking of  workers without notice.In Larne, the local mayor of the Mid and East Antrim Council, William McCaughey, said they would support the reinstatement of the staff immediately.“It is ridiculous what PO has done to the staff, we in Larne would be very keen to see staff reinstated, it is the least that PO could do,” he told the PA news agency.Labour’s shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh also called for the sacked workers to be reinstated and for Mr Hebblethwaite to be “barred” as a director for his role in the crisis.She wrote on Twitter: “The trained, experienced, loyal crew should be reinstated. And the Chief Executive should be barred as a director.“The shameful misconduct of PO Ferries has ruined livelihoods, and is harming the UK’s key shipping routes.”The trained, experienced, loyal crew should be reinstated.And the Chief Executive should be barred as a director.The shameful misconduct of PO Ferries has ruined livelihoods, and is harming the UK’s key shipping routes. https:t.co jnAAUNu— Louise HaighMarch , Labour has written to Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng asking whether the Government will seek the removal of Mr Hebblethwaite as a director under the Company Directors Disqualication Act .In a letter, the party accused the Government of “sitting on their hands” rather than taking action to hold PO to account, adding that the “toothless response risks giving the green light to exploitation”.Alliance East Antrim MLA Stewart Dickson welcomed the impounding of the ferry as a safety measure.“It’s not like the crew of an airplane getting off one Easyjet and getting on to the next one where the controls are the exactly the same, and everything is in the same place,” he told PA.“No two ships are the same, and you cannot just fly a crew in and expect them to be able to sail a ship. Every control will be in a dferent place, but particularly all those health and safety drills that have to be gone through, everything from leboat stations to how each item of equipment operates.“It seemed to me it was going to be very dficult for staff to be able to take on that role in such a short period of time.“I am absolutely delighted they have . This isn’t vengeance against PO, it’s about passenger safety and the safety of the crew as well.“It was reckless of the company to think they could not only act in the way in which they did about dismissing staff but they don’t seem to have had a plan as to how they were going to take this forward and now it is falling apart on them.”Meanwhile, the RMT union said it welcomed the detention of the European Causeway and it demanded the Government “seize the entire fleet” of PO vessels.General secretary Mick Lynch said: “The seizing of the European Causeway by the MCA tonight shows that the gangster capitalist outfit PO are not fit and proper to run a safe service after the jobs massacre.“This mob should be barred, their ships impounded and the sacked crews reinstated to get these crucial ferry routes back running safely.”Protests about PO’s actions are expected to take place in Liverpool, Hull and Dover on Saturday..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: PO ship detained in Larne after being deemed  uunfit to sail u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This will result in post-primary pupils no longer being recommended to wear a face covering on school premises. The news was confirmed by Education Minister Michelle McIlveen.She said, As was the case with the change relating to the use of face coverings in classrooms, this further change takes place in the context of a broadly improving epidemiological landscape in schools. Nonetheless, COVID continues to circulate in our communities and in our schools and we should continue to reduce the risks of COVID in our schools through the range of other mitigating measures that remain in place to protect all pupils and staff.  It is for this reason thatany inidual wishes to continue to use a face covering anywhere at school, I would encourage them to do so. At this point pupils will still be recommended to wear a face covering when using public or school transport. This position will be kept under review.  A guidance note will issue to schools on this issue later today and my Department’s COVID guidance will be updated to reflect this position.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aefadfdaccccfd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_efbdbddeaafaf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
