But the question of who owns land in Britain has been bound up with wealth, inequality and exclusion for centuries.Traveller communities are likely to be worst affected by the government’s plans, so a good place to start is Damian Le Bas’s The Stopping Places, a lyrical memoir about life on the road. Le Bas’s journey is a quest to rediscover his Romany roots, and along the way explore the challenges and prejudices facing Travellers.Rightwing populism needs a marginalised group to blame for society’s ills, and we’ve been here before: in the 1990s, the Conservatives introduced the Criminal Justice Act to crack down on Gypsies, anti-roads protesters and raves. George McKay’s Senseless Acts of Beauty is a wonderful history of the forgotten counterculture that sparked this clampdown, from the free festivals of the 70s to the Dongas tribe who occupied Twyford Down to halt a bypass. Land, and who controls it, lay at the heart of this uprising.Much remains off-limits, however, and one of the reasons why is the prestige that comes with owning land – none more so than the sporting estate. Such pretensions are memorably skewered in Roald Dahl’s Danny the Champion of the World, in which a boy and his father poach pheasants from the local bigwig’s wood. After his father is caught in a mantrap – the epitome of the landowning gentry’s desire to exclude the great unwashed – Danny hatches a cunning plan to get his own back.Since devolution, Scottish politics has taken a very different path to England’s – on land as on so much else. Andy Wightman’s magnum opus The Poor Had No Lawyers is an essential guide to who owns Scotland and why land reform has flowered there in recent years.And for a bitingly witty history of the Highland clearances, take a look at John McGrath’s play The Cheviot, The Stag and the Black, Black Oil.Exclusion from the land can be viewed through the prism of race as well as class. Official surveys show that BME communities are much less likely to visit the countryside than white Britons. The Forestry Commission’s appointment of Zakiya Mckenzie as a writer-in-residence is one recent nod towards trying to decolonise the countryside. Mckenzie’s poem “Writer in the Forest” explores feelings of belonging in nature: “This land that I own as every part of myself  Yet know I have no ultimate claim to contend”. It’s a philosophy that we urgently need to embrace: that the Earth does not ultimately belong to us – rather, we belong to the Earth.• Who Owns England? by Guy Shrubsole is published by William Collins (RRP £20).

Who is she, I’m confused” – before clarifying that he was joking.“After she goes and studies economics in college she can come back and explain that to us,” Mnuchin added, at a press conference at the World Economic Forum in Davos.Davos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and\u0026nbspthe elaborate system of badges\u0026nbspreveals your place in the Davos hierarchy. The meeting is sponsored by a huge number of international banks and corporations.For critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all\u0026nbspa big waste of time.\u0026nbspThe 2020 meeting is being advertised as focusing on seven themes: Fairer economies, better business, healthy futures, future of work, tech for good, beyond geopolitics and how to save the planet. Young climate activists and school strikers from around the world will be present at the event to put pressure on world leaders over that last theme.\u0026nbspMnuchin’s comments expose the huge gulf that still exists between climate activists and the White House. Pressed on the climate emergency, Mnuchin insisted that environmental issues are “clearly complicated”.He said: “When I was allowed to drive I had a Tesla. I drove in California. I liked it. “But nobody focuses on how that electricity is made and what happens to the storage and the environmental issues on all these batteries.”He also claimed the US was showing leadership in tackling emissions – but through its private sector rather than government. President Trump believes in clean air and water, and a clean environment, Mnuchin insisted, but also believes that the real environmental issue centres on China and India.People who call for estment should remember there are “significant economic issues, issues with jobs”, he continued. “Many economies are transitioning to more efficient and cleaner energy. That doesn’t have to be all renewables.”He also revealed he will travel to London for talks with the UK chancellor, Sajid Javid, this weekend. They will discuss US concerns over whether Britain will use Huawei’s 5G technology.Angela Merkel, though, spoke warmly about the work of the new generation of climate activists.“The impatience of our young people is something that we should tap,” the German chancellor said. In a special address to the WEF, Merkel called for more international cooperation to tackle climate change.“I am totally convinced that the price of inaction will be far higher than the price of action,” she declared.Thunberg has used this week’s gathering in Davos to push for radical change on the climate emergency.She called for an immediate exit from fossil fuel investment, an end to subsidies for the industry and a halt to investment in fossil fuel exploration and extraction by companies, banks, institutions and governments.“You might think we’re naive but if you won’t do it, you must explain to your children why you’ve given up on the Paris agreement goals and knowingly created a climate crisis,” she told delegates.Mnuchin’s comments clearly show the White House has yet to heed the call.The US labour secretary, Eugene Scalia, called for a balanced approach. The energy sector has been an important source of jobs and fully esting from fossil fuels would also harm US pensioners, he said.On Tuesday, Trump told Davos that delegates should be optimistic.“To embrace the possibilities of tomorrow, we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse. They are the heirs of yesterday’s foolish fortune tellers,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/091693fd8b19397ba7cab0faf6ad929855ba2fad/0_2_7509_4506/master/7509.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cdcffe98c47b17318893388b10916a5","title":"are todays teenagers annoying pouting selfie sharers or expert wordsmiths","story":"Social media has its negatives – but it has elevated the craft of writing for today’s younger generation in a way mine never knewSocial media muddlesdistortsruins young minds, we are told.

Connectivity, one would hope, is generally a good thing, be it virtual or physical. What I really like about it all, though, is that the written word is now more important, for teenagers especially, than it has been in my lifetime. When I was a kid in the last century, I rarely wrote down anything outside school. I kept a daily diary for about a week, wrote the odd letter or postcard, and that was that.I almost never communicated in writing with any of my friends, many of whom I started school with in 1971 and am privileged still to be close to. For the first 20 years of our friendship, I don’t think the five of us exchanged more than a dozen letters. In the past 20 years, however, via phones and computers, we have written tens (perhaps hundreds) of thousands of words on hundreds of subjects, many of them personal and intimate. We’ve all had to learn, usually through trial and error, the craft of writing, considering the meaning and nuance of every word. And we’ve had to learn concision. Yes, these means of communication might be reductive, but all these words surely add up to a lot more than nothing.So for every pouting, selfie-sharing, influencer-influencee teenager getting on your wick, let’s try to consider that they are having to be wordsmiths in a way that people of my generation never were."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7c7a7a8bb6e7af83b3ec3ed7c5d9e49def7dc9b/0_126_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7231b74ac4166803cd8ec550c27b1dbb","title":"juan guaido regime change venezuela chavismo maduro","story":"A year ago, on 23 January 2019, Juan Guaidó, chairman of Venezuela’s opposition-controlled national assembly, proclaimed himself president of the country and vowed to remove Nicolás Maduro from power. Guaidó’s pretender government was swiftly recognised by the Trump administration, as well as by the UK, France, Germany, Spain and Brazil, and eventually some 50 countries in total. As street protests flared in Caracas, it seemed to many outside Venezuela that Maduro’s days in office were numbered – and with them those of Chavismo, the radical left-populist movement that first surged to power in 1998 under Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chávez. Yet, one year on, Maduro remains firmly ensconced in the presidential Miraflores Palace. And not only has the US-backed attempt at regime change failed to dislodge him, but it is now Guaidó’s position at the head of the Venezuelan opposition that is looking shaky.Why did predictions of Maduro’s imminent departure prove so ill-founded? The mismatch was partly the product of wishful thinking on the part of international establishment opinion. There has been a through-the-looking-glass aspect to much coverage of Venezuela over the past year, as if the reality were simply whatever the opposition said it was, rather than a political struggle it was the media’s job to analyse and explain. But it is also clear that the US-sponsored drive towards regime change in Venezuela was premised on a series of miscalculations.It was based, firstly, on an overestimation of the popular appeal of the Venezuelan opposition. A fringe politician before being elevated to the chairmanship of the national assembly, Guaidó was always something of an ersatz figurehead, better at cultivating a following on Twitter than among ordinary Venezuelans. The confrontational strategy advocated by Guaidó and his political mentor, Leopoldo López, was in part designed precisely to compensate for their lack of a broad support base, ratcheting up the pressure so the situation more closely matched the fever pitch of their anti-Chavista rhetoric.After failing to topple Maduro last January as planned, other debacles followed, notably an abortive army putsch on 30 April. This effort was very clearly concerted with US officials, including John Bolton, then national security adviser, who lamented that senior Venezuelan officials who were supposed to have changed sides had not done so. This pointed to another major miscalculation: the opposition had clearly exaggerated the degree of discontent with Maduro within the army, and officials in Washington either didn’t know better or didn’t care to question this misleading view.But perhaps the biggest miscalculation of all, both by the Venezuelan opposition and the Trump administration, was to underestimate the resilience of Chavismo. Amid a desperate economic situation, and with a population suffering from unemployment, hunger and police repression, Maduro’s popularity had plummeted, his support dwindling even in loyal constituencies. Yet discontent with Maduro was one thing getting behind the Venezuelan opposition quite another. The fact of US backing for Guaidó’s coup attempt was itself a major factor in rallying support for Maduro: Venezuelans have good reasons to hesitate before opting for a government glued together in Miami and Washington.Once the initial drive for regime change fizzled out, the Venezuelan opposition camp also ran into other problems. Last June two of Guaidó’s aides were mired in a corruption scandal, and more sleaze came to the surface in December over ties between nine Venezuelan opposition members and a Colombian businessman who was facing US sanctions. Another dent to Guaidó’s image came in September when photographs surfaced of him alongside members of one of Colombia’s rightwing paramilitary groups.But the most damaging blow came on 5 January 2020, when the national assembly voted to replace Guaidó as chair with a rival oppositionist, Luis Parra. This deprived Guaidó of his already slender constitutional claim to the de facto presidency. Accounts of what happened next are highly contested: Guaidó claims he was barred from entering the national assembly, and was filmed climbing the fence that surrounds the building other opposition deputies, however, reportedly entered freely, and many of them voted for Parra. Later that day, Guaidó held a parallel vote in the offices of an opposition newspaper, El Nacional, that reinstated him as national assembly chair. A week later, on 13 January, the US made its feelings clear by imposing sanctions on several opposition deputies who had voted for Parra, as well as on Parra himself.Behind these manoeuvres lies a highly significant ision within the opposition, between those still committed to regime change at all costs and those willing to negotiate with Maduro to find some kind of political solution to Venezuela’s crisis. Guaidó represents the former group, but with the regime-change strategy stalled, the initiative last year began to shift to the latter camp.In May 2019 and again in July, talks brokered by Norway were held between representatives of Maduro and the opposition. It was partly to break the momentum of these talks that the Trump administration announced a new and even more punitive round of sanctions last August. Aimed at tightening the screws on the Maduro government, they amount, like all sanctions, to collective punishment for the entire population, and have undoubtedly made an already dire situation much worse.The sanctions are also unlikely to tilt the situation in the opposition’s favour – as the US should have learned from 60 years of failed sanctions on Cuba. On the contrary, Maduro has been boosted by the mere fact of surviving in the face of such pressure. Parts of the opposition seem aware of this and have continued to negotiate with the government, with one eye on parliamentary elections due to be held by the end of 2020. Guaidó still has the backing of the US and more than 50 other governments, including Brazil and Colombia, both major regional players. On the anniversary of his previous attempt, he is now trying to reinvigorate his push for regime change, having crossed over to Colombia to meet the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, on 20 January. But there is little reason to think it will work any better this time.What does the situation in Venezuela tell us about the outlook for Latin America as a whole? Coming hot on the heels of Jair Bolsonaro’s election victory in Brazil in 2018, and of successes earlier that year for the right in Colombia and Chile, Guaidó’s attempted coup seemed set to confirm a decisive swing to the right in the region. Yet Maduro’s surprising endurance has bucked that trend, and while the November 2019 coup against Evo Morales in Bolivia reaffirmed the rightward shift, there have also been countervailing tendencies: Bolsonaro’s slumping approval ratings, President Mauricio Macri’s defeat in Argentina, Chile’s continuing constitutional emergency, and mass anti-government protests in Colombia. There is no doubting that the right has been on the rise in Latin America. But its ascendancy is far from consolidated – and in this uncertain interregnum, much remains to be decided.• Tony Wood is an author who specialises in Latin America and Russia.

I didn’t even look inside the parcels it would have felt incredibly intrusive, a little like poking through someone else’s shopping trolley. The first backlash moment I remember was when someone – a reader, I couldn’t possibly guess of which newspaper – spotted some Maldon sea salt on a food bank shelf. Thus was the truth unmasked: that these people were not hungry at all, they were just in it for the incredibly expensive salt. Jack Monroe, the Bootstrap Cook, who has done the extraordinary work of building a recipe encyclopaedia from the foods you might get at a food bank, pointed out that they were just working with whatever people had donated. Users may, occasionally, get some peaches in armagnac that would not be proof positive that they weren’t destitute.Despite making perfect sense, the point did not land: the new normal was that food had to be extremely basic, otherwise food bank users were somehow in breach of their “contract”. There is necessity and there is pleasure, and if they ever coexist, the need is a lie. Monroe has worked tirelessly against this, insisting on pleasure in whatever bag of lentils she chances upon, but she seems to be doing this almost singlehandedly. By 2017, some supermarkets were handing out suggested shopping lists if you wanted to donate: tinned meat, fish, fruit, veg, soup and pulses UHT milk tea, coffee, rice and pasta. Of course, they have to be tinned, since they can’t be perishable (although arguably, usage is so high now that shifting a few bananas wouldn’t be very hard).Absent a can of condensed milk, this is exactly the food my mum used to keep in the cellar (she said in case we got snowed in, but really for the untoward event of a nuclear war). To give “austerity” its fullest meaning, this – minus the pasta – is a postwar shopping list, the food you would eat without complaint in the immediate aftermath of a national disaster. The Trussell Trust typically tries to include some biscuits, but its offering is still strikingly pared down. This is about more than what people happen to donate: there are conventions, now, around what you’re supposed to donate. So in Cardiff, two Christmases ago, there was a glut of baked beans and tea bags, but an urgent shortage of sponge puddings. That made perfect sense: if a food parcel is political, which it is, then its contents will be scrutinised, and somebody, somewhere, will call a pudding empty calories. Why would a person in genuine need eat an empty calorie? Beans? Now there’s an honest food. Basic enough that nobody is getting something for nothing.It is actually the food itself, more than the widespread experience of hunger, that distils the difference between charity and social security. With charity comes the end of privacy, since your basket is everybody’s business. But it also builds a very functional view of the body, insofar as the least it requires to survive is also the most that it needs, as though you are talking about horses, or rabbits (dogs are exempt from this narrative God knows how they got away with it, but it would be considered very inhumane never to give a dog a treat). And the fact that you can imagine all these foods on the basics list of a ration card, instead of ringing any alarm bells (hang on a second: we didn’t have a war we don’t have a national food shortage), only serves to reinforce the notion that it is somehow character-building, because, you know, wars are."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82ec7cc543fa803cde416b586ac039cf9eead6a4/0_213_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=798e515733627654e6cd9af05916cf2d","title":"manchester city financial fair play breaches 2012 13 accounting sponsorships uefa champions league","story":"• Accounting rejected and £118.75m of sponsorships questioned• City could face Champions League ban in second Uefa inquiryManchester City were found to have made inadmissible submissions to Uefa over financial fair play in 2014 and were reported for not making their bank statements available, the  can reveal.City’s submissions for the 2012 and 2013 financial years were questioned in relation to £118.75m in sponsorships from companies in Abu Dhabi, the home state of the club’s owner, and their accounting methods over transfer fees and the formation of two new companies were rejected.Almost £60m was added to the club’s losses by the European game’s governing body as a result of findings relating to accounting methods, the ’s investigation can reveal.The findings against City were made by consultants appointed by Uefa in spring 2014 to delve further into the accounts the club submitted.  can reveal Uefa concluded City had made losses totalling approximately €180m in 2012 and 2013, vastly exceeding the €45m FFP maximum deficit allowed, provided those losses were covered by an owner.Uefa’s first inquiry into City over FFP has been known about for six years. So too has the deal which City eventually and reluctantly agreed with Uefa to limit their transfer spending. But the detail of the process, revealed today by the , has never officially been made public. understands that within Uefa there were people who believed the regulations should have been more strictly enforced in 2014 and one staff member working on FFP is said to have left shortly after the settlement was agreed.The exposure of these details has come as a second investigation into City’s FFP compliance, sparked by revelations in November 2018, is nearing completion.The Abu Dhabi sponsorships became bitterly contested issues in November 2018 when Der Spiegel published “leaked” internal City emails and documents which suggested the club’s owner, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, was largely funding the Etihad sponsorship deal himself, unknown to Uefa.The “adjudicatory chamber” of Uefa’s Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) is understood to be hearing the charges made against the club this week.If its panel finds the charges proven it could ban City from the Champions League, the trophy the club has most coveted since the start of Mansour’s £1.3bn project and transformational 2016 appointment of Pep Guardiola as manager. City are certain to appeal against any adverse finding to the court of arbitration for sport.In 2014 European football’s governing body was led by the now Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, and leaks published in 2018 by Der Spiegel appear to show he was personally involved in the settlement.The club risked severe sanctions for the scale of its deficit including possible exclusion from the Champions League, yet a controversial settlement was agreed in May 2014. City vehemently objected to the process and the conclusions, and were seriously threatening legal action against FFP, arguing that the break-even principle could be considered unlawful.The consultants reported to Uefa that City had not provided them with bank statements so that the payments, including from the sponsoring companies, could clearly be seen, the  understands.City did make available their online bank account, which went back 12 months to the spring of 2013, but that did not cover 2012 or most of the 2013 financial year, which together constituted the first accounting period of Uefa’s FFP regulations.City are understood to have replied that the paper bank statements were not accessible to the club’s management at the time the consultants came to Manchester. The club’s hierarchy suggested to Uefa that the consultants could have made further requests for statements before highlighting that they had not been provided.The consultants are also understood to have reported to Uefa that some multimillion-pound sponsorship contracts with Abu Dhabi companies had not been signed. City dismissed that as an issue, telling Uefa that they also had contracts with non-Abu Dhabi sponsors which had not been signed, and that it was clear the deals had been done because the sponsorships were being fulfilled.The FFP regulations, introduced in 2010-11, were aimed at dampening players’ wage inflation and encouraging European clubs not to make huge losses. Under FFP losses cannot be reduced by owners putting more millions in via excessive commercial partnerships with companies related to them.City were taken over by Sheikh Mansour of the Abu Dhabi ruling family in 2008 and he with his executives instantly transformed the club’s finances and ambitions.City faced a severe challenge to comply with the €45m loss limit when the club’s spending was escalating dramatically, with the multiple signings of star players City’s sponsorships with the Abu Dhabi entities were examined closely by the CFCB.In 2011 City’s sponsorship by the Abu Dhabi state airline Etihad was converted into a 10-year deal, to include the stadium, and by 2013, after City had won the Premier League for the first time, it is understood to have gone up to £67.5m a year. The deals with three other entities from Abu Dhabi are understood to have been £15m a year from the investment firm Aabar, £16.5m from the telecommunications giant Etisalat, and £19.75m from the Abu Dhabi Tourism Authority.In 2014 Uefa’s consultants, reported to be PwC, are understood to have advised the CFCB that Aabar and Etisalat were “related parties” to City because Mansour was the chairman of the investment funds which owned them. After further research Uefa was also advised that Etihad should be considered a related sponsor because of relationships of Mansour’s with members of the extended ruling family involved in the airline.City have strenuously rejected the conclusion that Etihad or the other two companies are related to City under the rules, arguing Uefa needed to show Mansour had substantial influence over their management, not just that he was the chairman of the funds owning them.Uefa is understood to have asked specialist sponsorship consultants to consider whether the money being paid to City by the Abu Dhabi companies was “fair value”. The Etihad deal is thought not to have been considered too excessive.In the ultimate settlement agreed with Uefa City committed “not to seek to improve” the value of two of the secondary sponsorships, which were not named, and Uefa is thought to have agreed not to press the argument that the companies are related.In relation to transfer fees the consultants added £31m to City’s deficit after rejecting allowances City had claimed for the cost of players signed before June 2010. The rules allowed a club to take off the wages of players signed before FFP was introduced but not the transfer fees.City are understood to have argued fiercely that despite Uefa issuing guidance that such annual accounting for transfer fees, known as amortisation, was not an allowance for FFP, the rules did not exclude it.A further £28m was put on to the club’s deficit by Uefa’s consultants regarding the formation in January 2013 of two companies, City Football Services and City Football Marketing. The companies were to provide resources including scouting, analysis and marketing to the group of clubs worldwide which Sheikh Mansour was intending to buy. City submitted that the club had in effect sold the companies, receiving approximately £11m for each, and that the companies had taken around £6m of staff costs off the club’s payroll.City argued strongly that this was a legitimate way of accounting for the companies but the CFCB’s consultants are understood to have concluded that it should not be allowed.Under a settlement with Uefa City undertook to repay €20m from the 2013-14 Champions League revenues, have a European squad limit of 21, constrain transfer spending, not increase their wage bill until 2016 and make a maximum €30m loss for 2014 and 2015. City’s chairman, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, made clear publicly that he disagreed with Uefa and the settlement but argued that given the club’s success they would comply with the break-even rules after 2014.Etihad, Etisalat, Aabar and the Abu Dhabi Tourism and Culture Authority did not respond to emailed questions from the  about the sponsorship contracts. Etihad has previously stated that the City sponsorship is the airline’s “sole liability and responsibility,” and that it “continues to deliver important ongoing and accumulative returns on our investments”.Uefa declined to comment in response to any questions about the 2014 assessment and settlement, or the current proceedings.A spokesperson for City said: “The 2014 settlement agreement resolved all open matters between the parties and was based on comprehensive information disclosure. The settlement agreement contains confidentiality provisions that prevent Manchester City from commenting on both the agreement and the investigation that it settled.“It continues to be our position that we will not be providing any comment on out-of-context materials. The attempt to damage the club’s reputation is organised and clear.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca30cd8ee93e58c292a3d14df19d10e083045d99/0_160_4957_2974/master/4957.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e95c1087a9848ac1d9446843b0003bc7","title":"the psychology of football rivalries","story":"Why does supporting one club mean you have to hate another?By Paul Hyland for The BlizzardEveryone reading this probably has a favourite football team. I’d also be willing to bet that all of you have at least one football club that you hate. Maybe it’s because their star player is a er, or because they once broke your hearts in a season-defining, must-win game. Though probably it’s because you have to. Being a fan of one club means being expected to hate at least one other. But isn’t it just a little bit arbitrary? Who told you that you have to hate United or City? Arsenal and not Spurs? Then again, who told you that you have to hate anyone at all? Why does supporting one football club even have to mean hating another? In other words, why do we as football fans choose our rivals? And more to the point – how?Our motivations for choosing rivals are an interesting psychological phenomenon, one which the work of the Austrian psychoanalysts in the early 20th century can help to explain. The contemporaries Otto Rank and Sigmund Freud might go a long way to explaining why rivalry is meaningful, why it is that we’re so viscerally connected not just to seeing our local team do well, but also to cheering on just about anyone who crosses paths with rival clubs.But first, a caveat. Psychoanalysis is not an exact science and, in many cases, is not a science at all. Many of Freud’s theories, including the much misunderstood Oedipus complex, have been discredited by modern psychology. Many of his grandest psychological pronouncements were methodologically problematic, derived from anecdotal evidence contorted to fit a pre-conceived narrative. It was when psychoanalysis abandoned its claim to scientific enquiry that it provided its most genuine insights. And there is no better insight into the psychological bent to rivalry than the discussion of the uncanny among Austrian psychoanalysts.“Now and then it is appropriate for a psychoanalyst to take a certain interest in the area of aesthetics,” says Freud in his 1919 essay The Uncanny. What interests Freud in this essay is why certain narratives in human literatures produce a specific effect, not quite fright, but an ineffable sense of disturbance. Why are we so repulsed by certain horror stories? Why are we so unsettled by stories of a person meeting their exact double? The answer to those questions will also help us to understand why we make rivals of some clubs but not others.The German term for “the uncanny” – “das Unheimliche” – combines various etymological strands. “Heimlich” is the German word for “secret” or “clandestine”. For something to be uncanny, or “unheimlich”, it has to be revelatory of something that ought to have remained hidden. In addition – and this is why it applies to football rivalries – “heimlich” comes from the German word “heim”, meaning “home”. So, Freud argues, something is uncanny when it violates the safety of home as a space. A rival produces an uncanny effect in us for two reasons: they are a double who reveals uncomfortable truths about ourselves and they threaten our sense of connection to our home.Home is important in football. The feeling of going to a stadium to cheer on your team is almost always of a pilgrimage to some Edenic space of safety, comfortably surrounded by thousands unified by their common emotional connection to the place. But the boundaries between home and away are diffuse. Anfield and Goodison Park are separated only by a public park Dens Park and Tannadice Park in Dundee are practically next door to each other in Italy major rivals in Rome and Milan are both tenants of the same home.Roma and Lazio, Liverpool and Everton, Dundee and Dundee United are similar yet different, opposite yet equal. This is a specific reason as to why rivalry forms. A deep sense of resentment and rejection develops because the rival threatens the other’s claim to their home space. Look no further than the way television outlets flog their football packages in the buildup to local derbies, when what’s at stake is almost always local bragging rights. Beating one’s local rival is to overcome another version of oneself, a team similar to us but just not quite similar enough.When a team threatens our sense of safety at home, a sense of hatred brews. That hatred is channelled into trying to wrest our home back from our rival, to undermine the other team’s claim to represent the community they’re in – as seen in the flurry of social media posts cawing that “Manchester is Blue” after City beat United. Or their billboard welcoming Carlos Tevez to Manchester after he left United to chase City’s new money in 2009.Seven years earlier, down the East Lancs Road, David Moyes walked into Goodison Park and declared that Everton were “the people’s club” on Merseyside, with that self-given moniker still adorning an outer wall of the old stadium. Everton, staring possible relegation in the face while Liverpool chased trophies, needed a rallying cry. And they found one in the claim that for all Liverpool’s might, Everton represented the people of the city in a way the Reds could not.They were trying to reveal something about the city of Liverpool that would threaten the football club bearing the name. There are more of us than there are of you. The city will always be ours. The nickname was an overt threat to their rival’s sense of comfort as the dominant force in the city.This is also an example of how clubs’ identities are bound up together. We are us, and we are also not them. Being you also means not being someone else. Club identity is strengthened by taking rivals. Setting yourself in opposition to a rival gives a club a better sense of who they are. And, for a rivalry to work, there has to be some shared feature. So on some level, a rival is always a kind of double of your own team.Doubles are always rivals and rivals are always doubles. Common to practically all human literature that treats doubles and doppelgängers is the theme of enmity. In Dostoyevsky’s novel The Double, Golyadkin is chased out of St Petersburg and drowns. He’s made obsolete by the physical double of himself. The double became automatically his enemy. Poe’s William Wilson is thwarted in his every life’s endeavour by a double of himself bearing the same name. Dickens’s A Tale of Two Cities and José Saramago’s The Double both tell the story of men with an uncanny resemblance to another, and both are rivals for the love of the same woman. These narratives are common to practically every human culture. We’re drawn to them because they tell us something about ourselves. Our identity must be our own. When our identity is shared, it is threatened and it becomes the object of a battle with an “other” in order to wrest it from their grasp.That duality is common to footballing rivalries. Our rivals strengthen us just as much as they threaten us. Look at how often clubs affirm their own identity not by telling you who they are, but who they are not. Fans on the Gwladys Street can be heard at every game claiming not to care what the red side say. Back in the days before Manchester City were an oil-enriched, reputation-laundering vanity project, fans on the Stretford End delighted in singing that this was how it felt to be City when United were winning comfortably. And then there’s Millwall, whose fans revel in their club’s unpopularity by shouting: “Fuck ‘em all, United, West Ham, Liverpool.” It writes into the fabric of each club a sense that they exist not just to be themselves, but also not to be someone else. Which raises the question: how can a club have a positive sense of identity when it is so heavily based on negative cohesion against others, when the existence of a rival is a challenge to the very identity of one’s own club?Otto Rank wrote in his 1914 study of doppelgängers that the idea of the double is essentially narcissistic, and that it is designed to reaffirm our sense of self. It provides us with an external view of our own identity. Clubs need rivals because it satisfies that narcissistic need for an identity of our own.Knowing who your rivals are is enough to tell you who you are. When DJ Spoony interviewed Alex Ferguson in 2012, he spilled the beans that he was a Liverpool fan. After laughing that he felt sorry for his interlocutor, Ferguson suddenly took a solemn tone. “Listen,” he said, “these two clubs need each other.” Ferguson was saying that, if there were no Liverpool, Manchester United would be less than the Manchester United they were. If there were no Manchester United, Liverpool would be less Liverpool. They rely on each other for their identity.This is why mimicry, another uncanny act of doubling, is such a powerful device in football. Rivalry is a threat to one’s refuge, and expressions of rivalry are always an attempt to make another’s refuge feel less safe, less theirs. There’s a banner at Old Trafford commemorating a title and European Cup-winning season 11 years ago, deliberately aping the logo of the City of Liverpool’s successful European Capital of Culture bid. It reads ‘Manchester – European Capital of Trophies 2008’. Their celebrations for winning the league and European Cup would not have been complete without borrowing the markers of another city’s identity. Fans of Chelsea and Manchester City enjoy singing in quite colourful language about how Steven Gerrard once slipped on to his posterior. The tune and lyrics are lifted directly from a favourite Kop ditty of years gone by. Liverpool fans could now never fully reclaim the chant.Rivals threaten us, but they also reassure us. The stronger your rival, the stronger the sense of identity that comes from cohering against them. Perhaps this is why clubs such as Bayern Munich have offered financial assistance to some of their fiercest enemies. In 2004, Borussia Dortmund were on the brink of bankruptcy, nothing like the image of financial stability and creative recruitment they are today. Bayern offered them an interest-free €2 million loan with a generous timetable for repayment. For as much as it was a gesture of real sportsmanship, it was in Bayern’s interest for Dortmund to remain competitive. It was important to have a strong rival. Direct competition incentivises progress and shores against stagnation. Bayern’s financial assistance to Dortmund can’t easily be orced from their desire to be better than them.Teams without a direct local rival are determined to find one. Fiorentina’s greatest distaste is reserved for Juventus. Ipswich v Norwich is not truly a local derby, but one based on being the best East Anglia has to offer – to demonstrate Suffolk’s superiority over Norfolk or vice versa, and to be recognised on a national level as the best in the region.To Freud, home is an artifice. Cohering with others into a home community is contrary to basic human drives. In order for home to be a space of refuge, all of us must sacrifice aspects of ourselves and our desires, otherwise the group will fail to cohere. The frustrations caused by the group’s imposition on our inidual liberties are expressed outwardly. In arguably his greatest work, Civilisation and its Discontents (1929), Freud discusses our inhumanity towards other humans. He explains that humans are predisposed to rivalry. Your neighbour is the target of the aggression built up from having to cohere into a specific group, and we exist in societies that expend a great deal of energy keeping our aggression towards neighbours in check. While opposition is a healthy relationship between neighbours, this opposition often gives way to enmity. In football, the more local rivals are to each other, the more likely they are to refer to each other as enemies.Rivalries tend to be local for a specific reason. Neighbouring communities are the ones most predisposed to aggression towards one another, as Freud explains: “I once discussed the phenomenon that is precisely communities with adjoining territories, and related to each other in other ways as well, who are engaged in constant feuds and in ridiculing each other – like the Spaniards and Portuguese, for instance, the North Germans and South Germans, the English and Scottish, and so on. I gave this phenomenon the name of ‘the narcissism of small differences’, a name which does not do much to explain it. We can now see that it is a convenient and relatively harmless satisfaction of the inclination to aggression, by means of which cohesion between the members of the community is made easier.”An expression of our safety in a group is to threaten the security of other, nearby groups. Admittedly, some of the foundation of Freud’s argument can no longer be credited: he argues that narcissism is a by-product of the Oedipus complex, or the human drive to overcome those who would deny us access to our base desires. But all the same, this notion of the narcissism of small differences chimes directly with how local rivalries form.Local rivals are the ones with whom we have most in common. We often live in the same cities, attend the same schools, drink in the same pubs and speak with the same accents. The smaller the difference between rivals, the greater the hatred. There are few identifying markers that could distinguish a Spurs fan from an Arsenal fan, a United from a City fan, a Liverpool from an Everton fan. It’d be a little easier to guess a Liverpool from a Spurs fan or an Everton from an Arsenal fan. The teams who are least different are the ones who hate each other the most.Of course, there are caveats. Rivalries are always subject to change and new ones are springing up all the time. The arrival of nouveau-riche clubs such as Chelsea and Manchester City has changed the way clubs make rivals. Since around 2005, Chelsea and Liverpool have been locked in a rivalry not because they are similar, but because they are so different. Chelsea, bankrolled by an oil billionaire from Russia, presented an obvious breach of the worldview that gave Liverpool relevance. Manchester City now do the same.Admittedly, these rivals are not quite as internecine as any local rivalries. City still hate United more than they hate Liverpool. But what these shifting relationships show is that rivalry is not always geographical or spatial. Rivalries occur when one club’s specific set of values is challenged by another. Chelsea challenged Liverpool’s sense of identity by rising to success without a longstanding tradition of winning trophies.And so Liverpool fans expressed exactly that as part of their burgeoning enmity with a team they’d had few dealings with. “Fuck off, Chelsea FC. You ain’t got no history,” the Kop would sing, and still do. There’s an argument for authenticity as opposed to the rival’s artificiality. Chelsea’s success was one in the eye for the romantic attitude that footballing success cannot simply be bought. To bring this back to the language of the uncanny, Chelsea reminded Liverpool of themselves: Liverpool fans rejected Chelsea because they revealed something that ought never have been brought to light: that the two clubs actually were more similar than anyone would care to admit. There was a time when Liverpool were England’s biggest spenders. Their greatest player of the last century was a record-breaking £440,000 acquisition from Celtic. For all of the notion that there was something specific about Liverpool, their success was also heavily bankrolled. The difference between Liverpool and Chelsea became all the smaller. And so, a rivalry broke out.When Freud discusses what causes us to reject entities that give us uncanny sensations, he argues that it is because the uncanny “leads back to something once known to us, once very familiar.” When the artifice of our identity is challenged, it leads to an unsettling, uncanny effect. Chelsea don’t want to recognise themselves in Liverpool, nor vice versa. But they must.Rivalries are often a case of familiarity breeding contempt. Liverpool and Chelsea crossed paths in an inordinate number of important matches in the mid-to-late 2000s. Their rivalry also developed out of a sense of closeness, with both teams standing at a crossroads that only one could traverse. The fact they so often had the fate of the other in their hands caused them to identify with each other in a way they could not tolerate.Of course the clubs need to be different enough. Chelsea could claim to be the very model of a modern major football club, in contrast to a club whose identity was never so much about the here and now as it was about the there and then. In a similar way, a series of tense games in the 1960s and 1970s between two clubs not especially local to each other has given rise to one of English football’s strangest rivalries – the almost-local-but-not-quite conflict of the M23 derby between Brighton and Crystal Palace. Some of Europe’s hottest rivalries are not based on geography at all. The sworn conflicts between clubs in Milan and Turin, Rotterdam and Amsterdam, Madrid and Barcelona fall much more along class, demographical and political lines.Those rivals take us out of our home space and bring us into a place where we have to face ourselves, see ourselves for who we are. It is the narcissism of small differences that makes our closest neighbours our fiercest enemies. A derby is only a derby when a team is within an arbitrary geographical proximity to us. But common to all rivalries, whether local or not, is that they spring up because they threaten the myths we tell ourselves about ourselves and the football clubs that represent us.• This article was published first on The Blizzard• Follow The Blizzard on Twitter and Facebook• Follow Paul Hyland on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b47de6786197598a40817b9ffc7a34d10a041405/0_587_4431_2659/master/4431.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb737f28583a811fc9a13215769055cb","title":"success the witcher golden age game tv adaptations","story":"With their long, complex stories, video games fit television better than film – especially now streaming services have the firepower to make such projectsIt is a truth, universally accepted, that video games do not translate well to the big screen. From Assassin’s Creed to the Super Mario Bros movie, the result is usually a compromised monstrosity, ignorant of the source material and quickly disowned by the studios, directors and actors responsible for it. There have been exceptions – Detective Pikachu was weird but fine and the Resident Evil films have their fans. But films based on games are usually a mess. Have licensing managers been looking at the wrong screen the whole time?The show’s makers have said the TV series is based more closely on the original fantasy novels by Andrzej Sapkowski than on the games, but let’s be honest: it wasn’t the books that got this series commissioned. The Witcher video game series has sold more than 40m copies worldwide, and Henry Cavill’s portrayal of lead character Geralt, who travels the mythical landscape slaughtering demonic beasts for cash, is highly influenced by the game’s depiction. There are clear nods, too, to the game’s fandom, most obviously in the bathing scene, whose game manifestation became a staple of The Witcher 3’s marketing and memes.Fans’ reactions to the series have been mixed, but they’re clearly watching, which raises the possibility of further video game to television adaptations in the future. In a lot of ways, now that channels such as Amazon and Netflix have the capacity and expertise to commission such projects, video games make much more sense in TV than in film. Narrative games are a long-form medium, with stories that  tens, or even hundreds of hours of play. They feature many characters and plotlines that weave and intersect, often across sequential titles – a tough call for a movie studio looking to put out a 90-minute adaptation.Certainly, movies have successfully translated long novels – The Godfather, Misery and Great Expectations spring to mind – but those books have usually been built in ways amenable to film translation, with clear three- or five-act structures and steady, focused character arcs. But game stories don’t work like that. They are very long and highly episodic, split into self-contained levels, quests or missions, the overriding story accompanied by dozens of side-quests and branchings. This is much more analogous to TV. The writing process behind epic narrative games also matches the TV system – with a team of writers working collaboratively on overarching plotlines, but also inidually on separate episodes or elements.So will The Witcher pave the way for other big video game TV adaptations? It has certainly demonstrated that the storytelling format of games can be replicated. Each episode advances the wider story of Geralt, the sorceress Yennefer and princess Ciri, but also involves its own side-plots, characters and locations. Scripts, structures and narrative models built for the games can be translated.Ubisoft has its history-ning drama Assassins Creed in the works for TV treatment and a Halo TV series, based on the Xbox sci-fi shooter, is in production. And there are persistent rumours that Netflix is considering a Resident Evil series. But there is plenty more material, now that video game stories are maturing and ersifying, and appealing to wider audiences. Blockbuster titles such as Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption and the forthcoming Cyberpunk 2077 are the names that get batted around, but the success of modest, character-based dramas such as Life is Strange, Her Story and Firewatch show that video game TV wouldn’t necessarily have to involve mega budgets and cutting-edge CGI effects.Television adaptation would also allow for a more interesting interplay between the interactive and linear versions of a narrative. In Japan, there has been a constant cross-pollination between anime and video games for more than 30 years, with prominent titles crossing between the two formats, interacting and influencing each other. The extended Marvel universe has shown how effective cross-platform storytelling can be, with films, comics and games all combining to explore plots, events and character developments.Hollywood will not stop making video game movies: we have Uncharted, Minecraft and Monster Hunter on the way, among many others, so don’t panic. But perhaps what The Witcher has shown is that as television evolves, as game players ersify, and as the games themselves tell more complex, long-arc human stories, these two media are much more comfortably aligned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fc5770c9ee15fd4e3a2ed6d54cd8390325ff791/1633_337_3002_1801/master/3002.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0cdfe0cba35553f2e4733db697c88dc","title":"bereaved parents entitled two weeks paid leave work uk jacks law","story":"Jack’s Law, for parents who lose a child under 18, will come into force in April, says government Working parents who suffer the loss of a child will now be entitled to two weeks of statutory paid leave, the government has announced.Ministers have said the new legal right, known as Jack’s Law, is the most generous parental bereavement pay offer in the world and will support 10,000 families a year in the UK.Expected to come into force from April, it will cover all working parents who lose a child under the age of 18 or have a stillbirth, irrespective of how long an inidual has been with their current employer.The measures have been announced following a campaign by Lucy Herd, whose 23-month-old son, Jack, drowned in a pond in 2010. At the time, his father was only allowed three days off work to grieve, one of which had to be for the funeral.“In the immediate aftermath of a child dying, parents have to cope with their own loss, the grief of their wider family, including other children, as well as a vast amount of administrative paperwork and other arrangements. A sudden or accidental death may require a postmortem or inquest, there is a funeral to arrange and there are many other organisations to contact, from schools to benefit offices,” Herd said.She added: “When I started this campaign 10 years ago, after the death of my son Jack, I always hoped that a positive change would happen in his memory. Knowing that nearly 10 years of campaigning has helped create Jack’s Law is the most wonderful feeling, but it is bittersweet at the same time.”Parents will be able to take the leave as either a single block of two weeks or as two separate blocks of one week each taken at different times across the first year after their child’s death.Kevin Hollinrake, the MP for Thirsk and Malton, who proposed the law in a private member’s bill, said: “Losing a child is every parent’s worst fear, but no one could ever fully understand the utter devastation of such a loss. While most employers are compassionate and generous in these situations, some are not, so I was delighted to be able to help make leave for bereaved parents a legal right.”Announcing the law the business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, said: “There can be few worse experiences in life than the loss of a child and I am proud that this government is delivering Jack’s Law, making us the first country in the world to do so. When it takes effect, Jack’s Law will be a fitting testament to the tireless efforts of Lucy Herd, alongside many charities, to give parents greater support.”Meanwhile, bereavement charities welcomed the change in the law describing it as a significant step forward.Steven Wibberley, the chief executive of Cruse Bereavement Care, said: “I cannot stress enough how important it is that parents are given time and space to grieve in the aftermath of a child’s death. Support from employers can play a huge part in this. We are pleased the government has laid out the minimum provision for bereaved parents, and we know many employers will go much further than this.”Alison Penny, a coordinator with the National Bereavement Alliance, said: “Many parents are forced to make hard choices about returning to work at a desperately difficult time following their child’s death, fearing loss of pay or job security if they take time off.“We welcome the significant step the government has made in introducing minimum provision for parents, and would like to see employers demonstrate a genuine commitment to grieving colleagues by treating them compassionately and with the support they need.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53667137ce9512e96784cfb040c18b23320f6d05/0_169_5067_3040/master/5067.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc4ce4a7801cb3081511ee8908f63752","title":"marks spencer yule log best before use by","story":"Confusion over what the ‘best before’ label and the ‘use by’ label meanOn 28 December I bought a £15 Yule Log cake from M\u0026ampS.

The lead singer, Steven Tyler, the guitarists Joe Perry and Bradley Whitford, and the bassist, Tom Hamilton, have all been recently sidelined with injuries and illnesses and weren’t asked to re-audition for their jobs, Kramer said.“This is not about money,” he said in a statement ahead of Wednesday’s hearing in Plymouth, Massachusetts. “I am being deprived of the opportunity to be recognised along with my peers, for our collective, lifetime contributions to the music industry.”Representatives for Aerosmith did not comment on the judge’s decision.The band has previously said it had invited Kramer to join it for the Grammy events but there was not enough time to rehearse together for him to play on stage.“Joey Kramer is our brother his wellbeing is of paramount importance to us. However he has not been emotionally and physically able to perform with the band, by his own admission, for the last six months,” the band’s statement reads.“We have missed him and have encouraged him to rejoin us to play many times but apparently he has not felt ready to do so.“Joey has now waited until the last moment to accept our invitation, when we unfortunately have no time for necessary rehearsals during Grammys week.”Kramer said after Wednesday’s decision he appreciated the band’s offer, which he said amounted to “red carpet photo ops”. But he said it was still “extremely hurtful” to know someone else would be playing in his place.In his lawsuit, Kramer said his fellow band members deemed his “try out” was not “technically correct” and lacked “energy” – an assessment he strongly disputed. He added it was “devastating” to miss out on being honoured on the music industry’s biggest stage.“The greatest magic and success of Aerosmith happens when all the band’s founding members are together in the house,” he said. “To be removed from my rightful place on stage to celebrate our success – a success that acknowledges my own life’s work – is just plain wrong.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88f2763f0efa8c50f2ec6b8255405575b2fc09d7/62_582_1513_908/master/1513.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb313e9571496990d6b5c3439fc2b017","title":"zoe brock my case against harvey weinstein podcast","story":"Like dozens of women in the entertainment industry, the actor, model and writer Zoë Brock has claimed she had a traumatic encounter with the film producer Harvey Weinstein.

First, the 25-year-old Momentum member’s data sheets melting to illegible shreds in the rain while knocking on doors. Second, the moment the exit poll came through after a 14-hour campaigning shift in Stevenage.“Six of us were out all day. Then we walked through the door of candidate Jill Borcherd’s house and it was devastating. To find out the moment you walk through the door … we were shocked,” he said.“We didn’t want to bother her so we got back in the car and had a long drive back to London, looking on Twitter as the results came in.” As a grassroots group set up explicitly to support Jeremy Corbyn, Momentum would always be challenged by an election loss and the ushering in of a new leader. Momentum thrived on “Jezzmania”, Corbyn’s Glastonbury appearances and telegenic outdoor rallies that could be clipped by their savvy tech team to go viral. They have been hugely influential on policy, in effect fast-tracking the Green New Deal to the forefront of the manifesto.But with a new Labour leader in place in two months, the 40,000-strong organisation must decide what its future will be - if it is to survive at all. With its brand of leftwing politics rejected at the ballot box through Labour’s worst electoral defeat since 1935, the group is focusing on how to rebuild itself. So far, its attempt to stay relevant as the continuity Corbyn outfit has got off to a rocky start.Angry exchanges peppered Twitter this month when Momentum hastily organised a members’ ballot to decide who they should endorse for the leadership and deputy leadership. Just 5,000 members recommended the only choices on the ballot paper – the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, and shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner.One furious member who has given hours of their time on the doorstep declared Momentum a “mess”.“Why wasn’t it an open ballot?” she said. “I’ll probably head back to the anti-war movement now. There’s other things I can do in politics. I’m not going to be as involved any more. People are worried about where it’s all going.”Writer and organiser Michael Chessum was among the high-profile Momentum activists who criticised the ballot.A close ally of the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, the Salford MP and shadow business secretary has been groomed as a potential leftwing contender for the top job.Pitch\u0026nbspPromising to champion “progressive patriotism”.The Wigan MP has built a reputation as a campaigner for her constituency and others like it, many of which have fallen to the Tories. A soft-left candidate, she resigned from the shadow cabinet in 2016 over Corbyn’s leadership and handling of the EU referendum.Pitch\u0026nbspWants to “bring Labour home” to voters that have abandoned the party in its traditional strongholds.Ambitious former director of public prosecutions has led the charge for remain in the shadow cabinet. He was instrumental in shifting Labour’s position towards backing a second referendumPitch\u0026nbspLaunched his campaign by highlighting how he has stood up for leftwing causes as a campaigning lawyer, and unveiled the slogan “Another Future is Possible”, arguing Labour can win again if we make the moral case for socialismThe shadow foreign secretary and MP in Islington South and Finsbury, she will have to fight allegations of being part of the “metropolitan elite”.Pitch\u0026nbspHas the political nous and strategic vision to reunite the party, gain the trust of the public, and can take on Johnson in parliament.He tweeted: “Ludicrously, we only have one option for each position. This is a joke, and you should vote No on principle. (Even if, like me, you might end up voting for one of the chosen candidates).”While Momentum’s website reads “the fight goes on”, it is clear some members have justifiable fatigue, having spent the past two years as election foot soldiers. Even loyalists agree that the members, many of whom trudged through long winter nights in marginal seats, want to see change within the organisation.The fact founder Jon Lansman is part of Long-Bailey’s campaign team is not lost on activists. The centralisation of power around Lansman is nuanced and not always as the public see it, some activists say, but he remains an influential figure.The current structure, which has a National Coordinating Group at the top of the organisation that decides on major policy positions, has not always made members feel like it works for them. Activists complain about the “top-down” structure.Sophie Wilson, 24 – a councillor in Sheffield who stood as the Labour candidate for Rother Valley, which, at the election, went Tory for the first time since 1918 – said Momentum was invaluable in livening up the local Labour scene but it needed to change.She said: “A lot of the public think that Jon Lansman controls everything, but he’s not the person pulling the strings, it’s just that the structure is at fault.A 62-year-old Labour veteran who joined the party in 1974 and worked for Labour icon Tony Benn during his deputy leadership campaign in the 1980s. Lansman served as director of operations for Corbyn’s leadership campaign. After Corbyn was elected as the leader of the Labour party in 2015, Lansman founded Momentum, a pro-Corbyn campaign group.Momentum, often described as a ‘party within a party’, has radically transformed the Labour party over the last four years. Local groups have challenged party orthodoxies and national membership rules, and fought to get their activists selected.“I don’t want the Labour party to become a faction fight,” Lansman said in a 2016 interview with the . “What I want is a level playing field. I want the Labour party to be able to have a democratic debate.” But in recent weeks, Lansman, and Momentum, are back in the news for being key figures behind another Labour party civil war.Lansman was behind the move to scrap Labour’s 40-year-old student wing last week, arguing the group needs reforming and had not paid its affiliation fees. Critics described the move as a cynical attempt to shut down a “moderate” wing of the party. Lansman also tabled a last-minute motion at the NEC on Friday night calling for Watson’s job to be scrapped. The motion was withdrawn after Corbyn intervened.“It needs to consult with members more. Be more grassroots. It still is in some ways but it has morphed into this top-down thing which means that one or two people have a lot of power.”Setting up community centres in Labour heartlands could be one way of giving Momentum a sense of purpose in the five years of a majority government, she suggests.She likes the idea of taking over buildings earmarked for regeneration as part of the “meanwhile use” movement. In South Yorkshire the loss of the miners’ welfare clubs has been a huge blow and in coalfield communities Labour struggled to get the vote out. These centres could be a way of re-engaging with people long term.“There are a lot of lefties and left activism. There’s a strong history of trade unionism, but after the defeat we need to be looking at more community organising,” she said.Charlie, a trade union campaigner who helped campaigning in Harrow East, Battersea and Putney in the general election, said Momentum’s strength was publishing a public-facing strategy in advance so members knew why they were knocking on doors – mirroring US Democrat Bernie Sanders’ transparency.“When we got to Putney, for example, people could explain why we were targeting this particular road and people had bothered to go through the data,” he said.• The “red wall” was a huge block of Labour-voting constituencies stretching from north Wales into Merseyside, through Greater Manchester along the Midlands and up to the north-east. The origin of the term is unclear but some believe it was first used in 2019.•\u0026nbsp Thirty-three Labour leaders spoke to the  and all but three supported Sir Keir Starmer or Lisa Nandy to become the party’s next leader. All of the 33 local authority areas voted for Brexit in 2016.• Of those who would disclose their least favourite candidate, all but two said Rebecca Long-Bailey. The other votes were for Jess Phillips and Emily Thornberry.• Labour leaders in six of the 10 longest-held Labour seats that fell to the Tories said they were backing Starmer or Nandy. They are the Labour leaders in Rotherham, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Wigan, Bassetlaw, North East Lincolnshire and Bolsover. The other four leaders had not responded to requests for comment.He has no intention of turning away from the movement. “A lot of us went through a politicisation through the Corbyn period and I don’t think that’s going to go away.“One thing I’ve noticed is the Corbyn movement brought people together, different movements and campaigns. The Labour party was a pretty blunt tool coordinating that activity and Momentum hasn’t always done that as well as it could do, but you don’t want to go backwards.“But the National Coordinating Group isn’t working. There needs to be a place members can come together and plan at a variety of levels. New regional structures perhaps.”In a sign there is still enthusiasm, this past weekend dozens of Momentum activists met in Bradford to discuss mini-festivals planned under The World Transformed banner. Its main political, literary and arts festival held at the same time as the Labour party conference has been a huge success. The spin-off events are expected to attract 200-plus people in 20 locations.Momentum’s head office naturally remains optimistic about the future,with senior figures reluctant to signal a winding down. They are wedded to Long-Bailey and, like the activists, there is a feeling the organisation can do more to embed itself in local communities.Long-Bailey has likely returned the favour of winning Momentum’s endorsement with her announcement she would back open selections of MPs. The left see this as the best way of getting MPs in parliament who are most closely aligned with the membership’s view.A spokesman for the organisation said after the election result came through they were hugely disappointed, but “not for a minute” did they think about giving up.He said: “We always knew there would be no short cuts to socialism and the rise of the nationalist right as well as the huge crises of climate change and inequality only make our mission more urgent. Our movement has transformed Labour.”Immediate plans are pushing the Long-Bailey campaign and seeking more “member power” to help organisers, councillors and MPs in the future.Sophie, who quit her job the week before the election, thinks Momentum will keep going and successfully outlive Corbyn’s leadership.“There’s a place for it now more than ever in terms of where we need to be putting our efforts. Momentum is barking up the right tree. I’m sad to see Corbyn go, but now we can move on to the next thing and it will be even better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b80d9020e4bf71f517ef973b5f79339c7b5a0e22/468_400_3132_1879/master/3132.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ac58ce5e42abb227bca4a7c0b8bc2a5","title":"have you encountered any precautionary measures for coronavirus","story":"If you’ve experienced additional measures while travelling or have any information, we’d like to hear from youPassengers who arrive at Heathrow from Wuhan in China will be asked to enter through a separate area as a precautionary measure to try and prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals – possibly seafood. Many of those infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city. New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are examples.The virus causes pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. Antiviral drugs may be used, but usually only lessen the severity of symptoms. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get breathing support as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Those who have died are known to have been already in poor health.Human to human transmission has been confirmed by China’s national health commission, although it does not appear to be happening easily as was the case with Sars. As of 23 January the Chinese authorities had acknowledged 517 cases and 17 deaths. In the past week, the number of confirmed infections has more than tripled and cases have been found in 13 provinces, as well as the municipalities Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin. The virus has also been confirmed outside China, in the US, Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan. There have not been any confirmed cases in the UK at present, but there is definitely potential for cases to emerge due to the volume of international air travel. The actual number to have contracted the virus could be far higher as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by WHO experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be 4,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 1,000 and 9,700.There are fears that the coronavirus may spread more widely during the week-long lunar new year holidays, which start on 24 January, when millions of Chinese travel home to celebrate. At the moment, it appears that people in poor health are at greatest risk, as is always the case with flu. A key concern is the range of severity of symptoms – some people appear to suffer only mild illness while others are becoming severely ill. This makes it more difficult to establish the true numbers infected and the extent of transmission between people. But the authorities will be keen to stop the spread and will be anxious that the virus could become more potent than it so far appears.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. It increases the likelihood that the World Health Organization will declare the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern on Thursday evening. The key concerns are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.Healthcare workers could be at risk if they unexpectedly came across someone with respiratory symptoms who had travelled to an affected region. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children. Experts say there is no need for people to change their travel plans at this stage, but basic hygiene measures such as washing hands are sensible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/849eb328655d898fe035a173d3774bfc275f2735/0_81_1787_1072/master/1787.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8acd0eadd40bc9622d5bee413388e6c1","title":"a mountain of culture your guide to austrias ski juwel alpbachtal wildschonau","story":"If you’re looking to immerse yourself in the local customs and traditions of a new place while enjoying the slopes, Ski Juwel Alpbachtal Wildschönau in the Austrian region of Tirol has plenty to offerWhen it comes to skiing holidays, you won’t find me battling down a black run in a blizzard or getting up at dawn to carve fresh tracks on virgin powder. But atmosphere is something I am choosy about I want to go somewhere that has charm and character, somewhere that has life both on and off the piste. Just a 45-minute drive from Innsbruck, the Wildschönau and Alpbach valleys tick all of those boxes. Steeped in Tirolean culture, the mountains are dotted with pretty villages, handsome wooden farmhouses, onion dome churches and a great choice of family-run hotels and restaurants serving up hearty Austrian fare. And it’s good value too, making it an ideal choice for families and first-timers.SkiingThe Ski Juwel Alpbachtal Wildschönau is one of the larger ski regions in the Tirol, with 68 miles of pistes. At its heart are two mountains, the Wiedersbergerhorn (2,128m) and the Schatzberg (1,903m), which are linked by cable car. Between them they can cater for most levels of skier, but families and novice skiers will particularly appreciate the wide, gentle nursery slopes around the villages of Inneralpbach and Niederau. Intermediate skiers can take their pick from a variety of attractive, meandering runs, such as the 2.5 mile tree-lined run that sweeps down from the Pöglbahn station towards Inneralpbach. Those in search of more challenging terrain will find some rewarding black runs and off-piste skiing above Niederau and at the top of the Wiedersbergerhorn. There are two snow parks where boarders and skiers can work on their tricks, and you can try night skiing at the Reither Kogel, whose slopes are floodlit every Friday and Saturday from Christmas until the beginning of March.Where to stayThe villages of the Wildschönau and Alpbachtal valleys offer a perfect antidote to bland purpose-built resorts. For chocolate-box Tirolean charm, few places can rival Alpbach, which has been voted Austria’s “prettiest village”. New for this ski season is Die Alpbacherin, a four-star boutique hotel with smart rooms, a spa, infinity pool and restaurant specialising in regional food. If you want to be right on the slopes, the hamlet of Inneralpbach, a little higher up the valley, is a good option, with a smattering of family-friendly hotels, a small microbrewery and direct access to the lifts. Niederau is perfect for first-time skiers, with a string of good-value family-run hotels, many of which are a short walk to the slopes. We enjoyed the warm hospitality and excellent home-cooked food of the Wastlhof hotel in Niederau, which has spotless rooms and a great indoor pool and spa. The hotel recently opened a new wing across the road with family-friendly apartments overlooking the ski slopes.Where to eat and après-skiIf downing shots and dancing into the small hours is your idea of après-ski heaven then you might want to look elsewhere. The scene here is lowkey: think cosy mountain huts serving locally-brewed beers and hearty meals brought to your table by lederhosen-clad waiters. This is dairy farming country so cheese and cream get star billing on menus. I still daydream about the brezensuppe (pretzel soup) I tasted in the Gasthaus Thalmühle in Oberau – a rich beef broth laced with pretzels and topped with melted cheese and fried onions. Another great place to try out regional specialities is the Böglalm hut in Alpbach. On sunny winter afternoons skiers queue for schnitzel and spazln (the Austrian answer to gnocchi) cooked up in huge pans on outdoor stoves. Wash it down, like the locals do, with a shot of krautinger schnapps, which is distilled from turnips and which only a handful of families in the Wildschönau valley are licensed to make.Things to doWhen you tire of hurtling down the slopes on skis or a board, you can hurtle down them on a toboggan – there are runs in Niederau and Auffach. Or you can buckle up for a ride on the Alpbachtaler Lauser-Sauser – an Alpine coaster that gives the thrill of high-speed sledging on rails. Learn how to drive a piste basher at Reith im Alpbachtal or to build an igloo in Niederau.

They have come back after losing the opening Test at Centurion, a match in which the tourists were badly affected by a sickness bug that affected 11 members of the squad and six support staff.Given three key players – the opener Rory Burns, Jimmy Anderson, England’s all-time leading wicket-taker, and the spinner Jack Leach – have also been ruled out through injury or illness, winning the series during a tour even the players at one point had dubbed “cursed” would be a remarkable achievement.Root’s best results in his first three years as Test captain have been a 3-0 series whitewash in Sri Lanka in late 2018 and a 4-1 home win against India, the world’s No 1 team, the same year. Asked if winning this series would be his biggest achievement, Root said: “I think it probably would be, because of the different things we’ve had to manage throughout this tour.“We’ve had injuries with senior players having to fly home and a lot of illness to deal with. We have adapted to very different conditions and for a very young group of players to manage that has been very pleasing and a sign we’re doing the right things.“If we can harness that and keep taking that forward and look to improve as a group then I do think the sky’s the limit for this team. But I do think we’re very much at the start of something and we’re not perfect by any means. We have to keep that attitude and keep driving that forward for a long period if we want to get to No 1 in the world.”Root remained coy on team selection for the final Test. No decision has yet been made whether to pair Jofra Archer and Mark Wood in the same attack at a venue which has the reputation as having one of the quickest pitches in the world.In his first Test appearance for 11 months, Wood took three wickets in Port Elizabeth and England are positive he will be able to play consecutive Tests for the first time since 2015.Wood looked untroubled when he bowled during practice on Thursday. The same can be said of Archer, who has missed the past two Tests with an elbow injury but looks ready to return in Johannesburg.“It would be nice to see how they go together,” Root said. “It would be a relentless barrage of pace, which is exciting especially on the surface you typically get at the Wanderers. It would be great to have that extra bit of firepower.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2b6e49c7d71346ecd061e30c4e7b86bcaf3e80e/0_236_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1207e8a7ed89b3c6ed286e1e2cd11fc4","title":"talking horses gerald mosse hails british rehab facilities as best in world horse racing tips","story":"Much-travelled French jockey, now based in Newmarket, is being helped back to action at Oaksey HouseThe rehabbing facilities available to jockeys in Britain have been hailed as the best in the world by Gérald Mossé, who speaks with authority after more than three decades of riding in many different countries around the globe. Mossé, who has ridden winners of the Arc and the Melbourne Cup, is spending this week at Oaksey House, the Injured Jockeys Fund’s facility in Lambourn, with the aim of getting back in the saddle in mid-February after sustaining what he describes as a minor injury in Bahrain at the end of last year.“I’ve been lucky in my career, never to be injured too much,” said Mossé between treatment sessions on Wednesday, “but what I will say is, it is amazing. This place really provides the jockey with everything needed to be able to get the best treatment, helping you to go back as quick as possible.”Mossé, who has a home in Newmarket and has based himself in Britain in recent seasons after spending much of his career in France and Hong Kong, went first for assistance to the IJF’s Peter O’Sullevan House and was referred on to Oaksey, which has an anti-gravity treadmill that ought to be particularly helpful in speeding his recovery.” It is the best place we can find to get me back to business as soon as possible.“We have a nice apartment with kitchen, TV, fireplace. You feel like you’re at home. There’s a room to be with other jockeys here, watching racing, TV programmes, with newspapers and fruit, drinks … what else do you need? I’m very pleased to be here.”Mossé sustained his injury in a pre-race fall from the sprinter Evergate, formerly trained by Robert Cowell but now based in Bahrain and described by the jockey as being “a gentleman” most of the time. “But he just lost his mind and become uncontrollable, I lost control and he went maximum speed through the fence.”The jockey hopes to return to action in mid-February, so as to be race-fit in time for the Saudi Cup at the end of that month. Perhaps surprisingly, he bears Evergate no ill will. “I can’t wait to go back and ride him and win again.”Nor has he even the smallest idea of retiring, smiling as he responds to the question with: “You wanna upset me? I’m absolutely not thinking to be retired because it’s not my job, it’s my hobby. What I do is what I like. I always wanted to be a jockey and even if I’ve not been the best, I’ve been able to do what I like and this is the most important to me.”It’s Thyestes day at Gowran and I was half tempted to give another chance to Borice, who is surely better than he showed in the Ladbrokes Trophy. But he might need a better surface and could possibly be sharper next time, wherever that happens to be.So I’ll go with Chef Des Obeaux (3.00), who ran a big race at Leopardstown over Christmas and would have gone closer, but for ing through the third-last. With Robbie Power up for the first time and having only his third start for Willie Mullins, he is open to further progress at 6-1.The nap is at Fakenham, where Little Light (1.25) has come down to 13-8 for a four-runner novice handicap chase. She responded well to wind surgery to put up a dominant performance at Leicester last time, though she tired on the run-in and prevailed by only a head. This sharper track should suit her better.At Wetherby, Starplex looks an opposable favourite and Adelphi Prince (1.35) could be the answer at 4-1. There was some encouragement in his handicap debut, in a race for conditionals and amateurs, and he can show more on this step up in trip with Tommy Dowson aboard.

Here, the courtroom is made up of bickering, bantering women who must decide the outcome of a heinous crime in 18th-century Suffolk.A child has been murdered and an openly unfaithful wife, Sally Poppy, is sentenced to hang on the testimony of her cuckolded husband. She claims to be pregnant, which will earn her a commuted sentence, and the women are enlisted to vote on whether she is telling the truth. Ria Zmitrowicz is the obnoxious, unlikable Sally, and Maxine Peake is the steely and outspoken midwife, Elizabeth, who seems at first her only defender.Lucy Kirkwood’s previous plays have dealt in large-scale, global themes and The Welkin dazzles with just as much ambition in its examination of the big, immovable structures that inflict violence on women. Her “jury of matrons” forms a sisterhood, of sorts. They bitch, bond and silence the only man in the courtroom. But they are also, unavoidably, the upholders of a misogynistic legal system that disbelieves and condemns a woman on a man’s word and at times they are a miniature version of the baying mob outside, who want to see Sally swing.Kirkwood has previously collaborated with Clean Break, a theatre company that works with female prisoners, and this play has a complex engagement with female criminality, from women’s passive complicity to showing them as both victims and perpetrators. Sally is subject to a law that enables a husband with a grudge to incriminate her the murder victim is an 11-year-old girl and her mother is a wealthy woman who is able to buy a revenge inflicted on Sally’s body.The female body is intimately described, though little is actually shown. Jurors speak vividly of menstrual blood and miscarriage, as well as the visceral gore of childbirth. Women’s biology, in this court of law, has a paradoxical power: women’s ovaries render them incapable of reason and judgment, according to a male doctor, yet it is only Sally’s ovaries, and growing womb, that can save her from the hangman’s noose.Witchcraft emerges as a theme in the second half when a fireplace explodes and a ghostly, elevated body floats above the courtroom, unleashing stories of fearfully wizened midwives and sexually aberrant women. Sally, more and more, appears as the sexually disobedient, flagrantly rebellious outsider scapegoated as the “witch”.There is so much richness in The Welkin in its visual imagination, too. Bunny Christie’s astounding set has the aesthetics of a 17th-century Dutch painting, along with Lee Curran’s contrasts of light and shade. The jurors initially emerge out of the darkness and are choreographed to strike arresting, painterly tableaux on stage.But the play’s large-scale ambition undercuts some of its effects: the complex interplay of power between the women on stage leads to protracted conversations and not enough incident. There are a series of plot twists, but they do not build to pressure-cooker tension in James Macdonald’s production. And, while the ensemble cast give incredibly strong performances – notably Haydn Gwynne, Natasha Cottriall and Jenny Galloway – with Peake’s heroic midwife as the most magnificent, the multiple voices, stories and dynamics make it hard to retain a central narrative focus.Kirkwood has said that she sought to create a “muscular” story out of these provincial women’s lives, so the emotional distancing seems deliberate. It is, above all, a cerebral play that does not require us to walk in these women’s shoes nor empathise with them, but to see their negotiations with power from a clear-eyed vantage point. This makes it arduous and even slightly sterile to watch at times but also profoundly admirable.• At the Lyttelton theatre, London, until 23 May.

It also contained what appeared to be a sardonic message.It read: “Arguing with a woman is like reading the Software Licence Agreement. In the end you have to ignore everything and click I agree.”For Agnes Callamard, the UN special rapporteur who is investigating the murder of Khashoggi, it seemed the message was evidence of an attempt by the future king, also known as MBS, to “intimidate” Bezos.She told the  it appeared intended to make him feel vulnerable, even as his own newspaper, the Washington Post, continued to publish hard-hitting stories about the murder of one of its own journalists.The new UN revelations, which follow the ’s report that Bezos’s phone was allegedly hacked by Saudi Arabia in the months before the Khashoggi killing, point to an orchestrated cyber campaign to target Bezos, and the close circle of iniduals around Khashoggi.Callamard said: “This shows that during this period, there is a concerted effort to hack into the system of people who are considered as a threat somehow to MBS or to the government system of Saudi Arabia. That does not mean it is aimed at picking up particular information. It is done to use that information in the future.”According to a timeline provided by the UN, the story began on 21 March 2018, when Bezos was invited to a small dinner party in honour of the crown prince.A fortnight later – on 4 April – the two men exchanged phone numbers at a dinner whose guest list included former basketball player Kobe Bryant and the Disney chief executive, Bob Iger.And a month after that, on 1 May, Bezos received “a message from the crown prince account … through WhatsApp,” the UN explained.“The message is an encrypted video file. It is later established, with reasonable certainty, that the video’s downloader infects Mr Bezos’ phone with malicious code.”This rapidly infected his phone – and a huge exfiltration of data began.That was the conclusion of a report undertaken for Bezos by FTI Consulting, an advisory firm, whose findings were passed to Callamard, and another UN special rapporteur, David Kaye. has seen this report.If the analysis is correct, the crown prince’s close circle had obtained the contents of the mobile phone of one of the world’s most powerful businesspeople.Bezos – like hundreds of other victims – would have had no reason to know he had been hacked.In the days and weeks that followed, Bezos – who was married at the time – sent private text messages to his girlfriend, describing his romantic feelings.Those texts would later be published in the National Enquirer, although the exact circumstances around their publication have yet to be determined.What is known is that the crown prince had twice met with the owner of the National Enquirer, David Pecker, who was known in Hollywood and Washington as a man who had ties to Donald Trump, and had a history of solving problems for the US president, including “killing” negative stories about Trump and his extramarital affairs.New information published by Callamard and Kaye, the UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression, suggest that the alleged targeting of Bezos was just the beginning of a broader campaign to pick off iniduals who were close to Khashoggi and in frequent contact with the journalist.The timeline published by the investigators on Wednesday refers to four other prominent Saudi critics who were targeted with malware in the weeks that followed: Yahya Assiri and Omar Abdulaziz, who were in frequent contact with Khashoggi, the London-based satirist Ghanem al-Dosari, and an Amnesty International official who was working in Saudi Arabia.On 2 October, Khashoggi entered the Saudi embassy in Istanbul and was killed. US intelligence agencies and Callamard’s own report would later allege that Bin Salman bore responsibility for the killing.Shortly thereafter, the investigators said there had been a “massive online campaign” against Bezos and Amazon in Saudi Arabia, principally targeting him as the owner of the Washington Post.Then, in January last year, the National Enquirer published an exposé of Bezos’s extramarital affair, including text messages that were sent after the billionaire’s phone was allegedly hacked by the Saudis.American Media Inc, owner of the National Enquirer, has denied that any “third party” was involved in it obtaining information about Bezos, and has insisted that it received its tip-off from the estranged brother of Bezos’s girlfriend. But the brother, Michael Sanchez, publicly stated last year that the Enquirer was already aware of the illicit relationship when he was first contacted by the tabloid in July 2018 and had already “seen” text messages between the couple.While experts contend that Bin Salman may have been seeking to silence Bezos, the Amazon CEO publicly accused AMI of trying to “extort and blackmail” him, after the company suggested that it would agree to not publish compromising photographs of the billionaire if he agreed to shutdown his investigation into the leaked texts. Bezos flatly denied the apparent deal.The FTI Consulting report says that Bezos obtained a detailed briefing about the extent of the Saudi campaign against him on 14 February.

A final decision is expected next week.At the beginning of last week, senior US officials flew over to Britain in a last-ditch attempt to persuade Johnson’s government to change its mind, arguing that it would be “nothing short of madness” to use Huawei given the security risk.Since then, there has been a string of leaks, indicating that Britain did not agree. The US had maintained it had fresh information about Huawei but UK sources said last week: “We’d already anticipated the kind of threat.”Downing Street’s remarks came shortly after Reuters had reported that British security officials had agreed to recommend to senior members of the cabinet that Huawei be allowed a limited role in 5G.The UK will see how the Trump reacts in the next few days, with post-Brexit trade talks due to begin next month. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, and the US Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, clashed over trade in Davos at a time when the UK is also considering a special tax on big tech companies.Britain’s biggest phone companies, Vodafone and BT, have also been lobbying to use Huawei in 5G, saying that a total ban could set back rollout of the fast internet technology by a couple of years.But some experts say that because 5G generates greater speeds by having the network’s intelligence in base stations, rather than at the heart of the network, there can be no real distinction between core and non-core. Any supplier would have the ability to take control of the network if it so wished.Britain’s spy agencies have long believed that any risk that Huawei technology could be compromised by the Chinese state to undertake surveillance can be contained, but US officials have said intelligence-sharing with the UK could be halted or reduced as a result.The briefing also follows similar comments by the business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, who told Sky News earlier on Tuesday that not using Huawei would cause problems.“There are other providers but they are limited,” she said. “Ideally there would be more providers of infrastructure similar to the work that Huawei does, but the UK is looking very carefully at this issue and we will be making a final decision soon.“It is an ongoing process and there are all sorts of factors to take into consideration, like the availability of other providers, like the work that Huawei has already done in the United Kingdom, so these discussions are ongoing.”A No 10 spokesman said the issue had not yet been finalised: “The work on the issue of high-risk vendors in the 5G network remains ongoing, and when it’s completed it will be announced to parliament.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b31de2fce51d27fd243092144dda9c94704a75d/0_182_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae1a1379d28353cca6fdacc0f1bafead","title":"10 best wellbeing holidays in europe yoga sauna spa hotels","story":"For our tipsters a healthy break means everything from beach yoga and spa hotels to sensory barefoot forest walking and listening to Puccini under the starsListening to Puccini and other Italian opera classics while sparkling stars lit the night skies was just the tonic I needed last summer.

But in Latvia there’s no special term for it. “We don’t need one – this is just normal behaviour for Latvians,” said Sigita Klētniece, our walk leader in a crisp, cold Gauja national park in the country’s north-east.We stood and breathed deeply, as light dappled through the snow-speckled pines. “Let being in the forest relax you,” said Sigita. “Listen to the sounds and sense nature around you.”It felt like the forest was a spiritual place, where Latvians came to meditate.My own foray into these immense woodlands was a four-day tour of the Vidzeme region, which covers central and northern Latvia. Despite being home to the capital, Riga, Vidzeme is characterised by forest, rolling hills (including Mount Gaiziņš, Latvia’s highest point at 311 metres), morainal lakes, the cliff-lined Gauja River and historic towns with medieval castles. It is a proud region, known as the “cradle of Latvian culture” for its rich artistic heritage.I was on a short small group tour of the country with guide Amanda Kokoreviča of Experience Baltics. The forest was captivating: quiet trails among soaring trees and abundant wildlife. Equally fascinating were the people we met: the local pioneers using Latvia’s forest to create a new wave of green tourism and eco-friendly business.Latvia’s tourism board is fully behind this shift. It wants to encourage visitors away from Riga, which is popular with both rowdy British stag-dos and city breakers enticed by the medieval old town and art nouveau architecture. It wants tourists to use Riga as a launch pad for trips into Latvia’s green lands for bird-watching, forest hiking and bog walks.“It’s such a shame many tourists are in a mad rush, visiting Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania in just a few days,” said Amanda, as we arrived at Mālpils , a classical 19th-century manor with baroque-style grounds and now a design hotel and restaurant. “But things are changing – people are becoming more interested in Latvia’s nature.”The next day, after lunch at stylish Cafe Zeit, housed in a former Soviet factory, we arrived at the Woodcraft Museum in the riverside village of Līgatne. Ponytailed proprietor Rihards demonstrated how he makes bowls using locally harvested wood and traditional techniques. Even the peppermint leaves floating in my tea cup were from the local woods.Forest foraging is almost a national sport in Latvia, with mushrooms, berries, herbs, leaves for tea and birch sap juice on the menu. With half of the nation’s forests state-owned, and favourable public access laws, filling your basket is completely legal. Families are even permitted to take one Christmas tree from the forest every December. As we checked in that evening at HE Vanadziņš – a contemporary restaurant and hotel next to Cēsis’s old town – I wondered whether the owner had personally felled the tree decorating the reception.“My grandmother taught me how to forage,” said Sigita the following day, as we set off on foot past sandstone cliffs into Gauja national park – the oldest and largest of the four in Latvia. “And we pass on that knowledge and passion to our children.”Sadly we had missed the August-October mushroom season, but the forest still provided. While we picked wild cranberries, a family with a young daughter collected pine cones for a Christmas wreath and others filled large containers with spring water. This closeness to the forest is rooted in Latvia’s history: for centuries the forest has represented safety and security for Latvians, particularly in the 1600s and 1700s when people fled to the woods during conflicts between the Russian, German and Swedish empires.That afternoon, as we explored the towns of Cēsis and Valmiera, the Latvian love of nature was still clear. At Valmiermuiža brewery a “forest cola” – made with cranberries, pine blossom and heather – was lauded as a new children’s drink, while at Veikaliņš, a pop-up shop selling handcrafted produce from 35 creatives, the shelves were stocked with items such as biodegradable reed straws and textiles made from recycled linen.“Thanks to the younger generation, more and more Latvians are buying ethically sourced, eco-friendly goods,” said Lelde, the shop’s founder.Jānis, a moustachioed ice-cream maker from near Dunte, echoed this when we visited his farm. “Latvians love local produce,” he told us, as we tucked in to his Gogelmogels ice-cream. He gets milk from his neighbour’s cows, eggs from his own chickens, and flavourings such as sea buckthorn and bee pollen from his fields.Later I headed for the sauna at Lantus, a farmhouse where guests can experience a traditional Latvian bathing ritual. This turned out to be a part-aromatherapy part-massage treatment: the masseur covered my face with pungent eucalyptus leaves before pummeling my body with leafy twigs of birch and oak.Half an hour later I emerged from the sauna, covered in leaf fragments. “Your body and soul should feel cleansed,” said Amanda, glowing from her own treatment. That sums up what the forest means to Latvians. • The trip was provided by the Investment and Development Agency of Latvia (latvia.travel).

While they looked dead, they were actually just too cold to move. Iguanas start becoming sluggish when temperatures drop below 50F (10C) and are susceptible to freezing once temperatures drop to around 40F (4.5C). When frozen, they easily fall out of the trees they call home, appearing lifeless even though they aren’t dead.Floridians shared videos of the phenomenon, giving Twitter an up-close look at the green-scaled reptiles that are probably dreaming of warmer climates, or at least spring.One Twitter user happened to capture the resurrection of an iguana as it took in some warmth in the sunshine and slowly crawled back to life after being temporarily frozen.Iguanas are an invasive species in Florida and can be little nuisances when not frozen.

But ranchers and hunters are putting up a fightThe gray wolf, once numbering in the tens of thousands throughout North America, have faced public vilification and extermination programs that drove it to near extinction in the US. Now Colorado will vote on whether to reintroduce them into the wild after an 80-year absence, thanks to an effort that has cattle ranchers outraged but which conservationists say could restore an ecosystem that has long suffered without the apex predator.The species was systematically exterminated by controversial, US government-backed programs in the 19th and 20th centuries. This was primarily due to wolves’ attacks on the cattle, a booming industry that has been integral to the expanding west economy. By 1940, wolves were almost completely gone.Their inclusion on the 1973 Endangered Species Act, along with a 1995 effort to build a home for them in Yellowstone national park, has helped bring their numbers back up to 5,500 in the lower 48 states.This year, a ballot measure in Colorado will let voters decide whether a home should be built for the gray wolf in the state. Polling indicates the measure is likely to pass, though segments of both the ranching and hunting communities are strongly opposed.Conservationists argue that eradication of wolves threw the ecology of the Rocky Mountains into disarray, with elk and deer excessively grazing in open lands where they otherwise would have been targets for wolves, created a domino effect that has harmed a variety of species.Colorado’s vote comes at a time when safeguards for gray wolves are threatened: the Trump administration announced last year intentions to remove the animals from the endangered species list.“Gray wolves are the ecological engines of the northern hemisphere,” says Rob Edward, president of the Rocky Mountain Wolf Action Fund, who spearheaded the ballot measure and has been working to reintroduce wolves into Colorado for over 25 years. He points to the successes of the Yellowstone reintroduction as evidence that similar efforts would be good for Colorado’s environment.“The Aspen groves, which hadn’t regenerated in 50 years, were totally coming back” as a result of wolves returning, he says. “And with that regeneration came more beavers, which led to more beaver dams, which was good for the rivers, which led to more trout, and on and on with a cascading effect.”He adds that wolves also benefit the landscape by forcing elk to move around. When the elk aren’t hunted, they “can hang out in river bottoms, which causes mass erosion, and the water gets shallower and hotter”, he explains.Edward points out that the measure safeguards ranchers against losses by offering compensation for any wolves that kill their livestock, but Terry Fankhauser, executive vice-president of the 153-year-old Colorado Cattlemen’s Association – which represents the 11,600 cattle farms and $2.8bn industry in the state – believes the matter is more complex than just wolves killing cattle.“Beyond the kills, there are indirect impacts of wolves being reintroduced to cattle,” Fankhauser says. “Cattle are fight-or-flight animals and they’re continually on the lookout for predators. And when there’s reintroduction of wolves, there’s a decrease in gestation, pregnancy, and weight gain, much like elk, deer and moose.”Potential disruption of wild animals is also a concern for opponents of the ballot measure, who advocate on behalf of hunters who don’t want to see their game disappear. Preserving targets for hunters was also the motive behind the controversial, government-sponsored practice of shooting wolves in Alaska from helicopters. Sarah Palin’s endorsement of the practice was fuel for attack ads when the then governor ran for vice-president in 2008.The proposed measure would call for the Colorado parks and wildlife commission to construct a plan – building on scientific data and concerns from public hearings – to reintroduce wolves into public lands by the end of 2023. The Rocky Mountain Wolf Action Fund would like to see enough wolves introduced to return balance to the ecology, with the additional aim of creating a habitat that links the wolves of northern states (along with Canada) and southern states (along with Mexico) stretching the length of the Rocky Mountains.Fankhauser is concerned that the ballot measure will tie the hands of those tasked with reintroducing the wolves to Colorado, forcing them into blunt action where a nuanced approach is needed.“We should not be making biological decisions at the ballot box,” he says. “And to arbitrarily decide, through a population vote, that we need x amount of wolves in Colorado without considering that ecosystem, it’s not only irresponsible to the ranching community, but to the wolves themselves.”The Colorado Stop the Wolf Coalition, another opposition group that describes itself as a group of “concerned sportsmen, farmers, ranchers and businesses”, has been playing up fears that wolves could be a danger to humans. Its homepage cites a story from last summer about a family of campers in Canada being attacked by a wolf, which has the potential to make the millions who enjoy camping in Colorado’s Rocky Mountains a little anxious.Edward finds the suggestion wolves pose a threat to humans wildly misleading. (The Colorado Stop the Wolf Coalition did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)“That is a one-off rarity,” he says. “Millions of people have camped in Yellowstone since wolves were reintroduced, and there has never been an attack. Wolves do not see humans as prey. They’re curious about us, like their descendants, the dogs.”Meanwhile, supporters of the gray wolf have been working to overhaul its fearsome image. A Denver-based musical collective, Lost Walks, wrote and performed a rock opera about a wolf who saves a pregnant woman in danger in the Colorado wilderness.“It felt important to us to use our voices for a creature who is voiceless,” says Jen GaNun, the band’s creative director. “When we found out about how wolves were and are hunted and treated today, we felt like we had to use our internal momentum in this project we started to be a part of a social and environmental movement.”Profits from the album have gone toward the Rocky Mountain Wolf Action Fund, and live events have doubled as signature collection opportunities for the ballot measure.“We have gotten some messages of opposition,” she says, “but mostly find that people are in support and on the side of science and kindness towards animals and the greater ecosystem.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea8d051f2418aa4b1f79fa690e18627a89e14631/0_299_2442_1464/master/2442.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c25a13c9ca3740b3c9731ba2fa0a5678","title":"coronavirus panic spreads in china with three cities in lockdown","story":"Residents in Wuhan, Ezhou and Huanggang hoard supplies and isolate themselves at homeFour Chinese cities with a total population of 20 million have been put on lockdown and Beijing has cancelled a number of major public events in an attempt to contain the spread of a deadly coronavirus outbreak.Authorities banned transport links from Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, on Thursday morning, suspending buses, subways, ferries and shutting the airport and train stations to outgoing passengers. Later in the day, the nearby central Chinese cities of Huanggang, Ezhou and Chiba also announced traffic restrictions to prevent residents from leaving.Starting at midnight, long-distance buses, the rapid transit system, and train station in Huanggang would be shut, according to a notice from the local government. Movie theatres, internet cafes, and other entertainment venues would all stop operating. Residents should not leave the city, except for “special reasons”.A government notice in Ezhou said the city’s railway would stop operating Thursday evening. In nearby Chiba, authorities said buses and rural transport links would be halted. Officials also ordered tour operators to cancel operations and said no more large-scale cultural events were to be held.Meanwhile the state-run Beijing News said the capital had cancelled events including two well-known lunar new year temple fairs. Separately, the country’s railway operator, China State Railway Group, said passengers would be able to receive full refunds on tickets nationwide starting on Friday.There have been 633 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, from the same family of viruses that gave rise to Sars. Officials worry the lunar new year holiday, when hundreds of millions of Chinese will crisscross the country, will exacerbate an outbreak that has reached almost all of the country’s provinces, as well as the US, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand, Japan, Macau and Hong Kong. Vietnam and Singapore confirmed their first cases on Thursday.Chinese authorities have confirmed 95 patients remain in critical condition. Seventeen people have died since the virus was detected in late December, all of them in Wuhan.In Wuhan, supermarket shelves were empty and local markets sold out of produce as residents hoarded supplies and isolated themselves at home. Petrol stations were overwhelmed as drivers stocked up on fuel, exacerbated by rumours that reserves had run out. Local residents said pharmacies had sold out of face masks.“When I saw the news when I woke up, I felt like I was going to go crazy. This is a little too late now. The government’s measures are not enough,” said Xiao, 26, a primary schoolteacher in Wuhan, who asked not to give her full name.Few pedestrians were out and families cancelled plans to get together for the new year holiday. Special police forces were seen patrolling railway stations. Residents and all government workers are now required to wear face masks while in public spaces. Most outbound flights from the city’s Tianhe airport were cancelled.“To my knowledge, trying to contain a city of 11 million people is new to science,” Dr Gauden Galea, the World Health Organization’s representative in China, told Associated Press. “It has not been tried before as a public health measure. We cannot at this stage say it will or it will not work.”Anxiety in Wuhan has been exacerbated by reports that hospitals are turning patients away because they do not have enough room. A hospital contacted by the  on Thursday said it had between 500 and 600 patients and recommended patients go to a community health centre instead. Eight hospitals in Wuhan put out calls for donations of protective equipment, according to Chinese media.Officials on Thursday said they would build a new hospital in six days to accommodate patients, modelled after an isolation facility constructed in Beijing during the Sars outbreak.Hubei officials said schools, on break for the spring festival holiday, would delay the beginning of the spring semester, according to the official People’s Daily.The illnesses from the newly identified coronavirus appeared last month in Wuhan, an industrial and transportation hub in central China. The vast majority of cases in the mainland have been in the city.The significant increase in illnesses reported this week come as millions of Chinese travel for the lunar new year, one of the world’s largest annual migrations of people. Chinese people are expected to take an estimated 3bn trips during the 40-day spike in travel.It\u0027s a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals, or possibly seafood. New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are examples.The virus causes pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. Antiviral drugs may be used, but usually only lessen the severity of symptoms.\u0026nbspChina’s health ministry has confirmed human-to-human transmission. As of 23 January the Chinese authorities had acknowledged 571 cases and 17 deaths. Those who have died are known to have been already in poor health - but mild cases may not be reported at all.There are fears that the coronavirus may spread more widely during the Chinese new year holidays at the end of January, when millions of people travel home to celebrate. At the moment, it appears that people in poor health are at greatest risk, as is always the case with flu. But the authorities will be anxious that the virus will become more potent than so far appears and will be keen to stop the spread.The coronavirus family includes the common cold as well as viruses that cause more serious illnesses, such as the Sars outbreak that spread from China to more than a dozen countries in 2002-03 and killed about 800 people, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, which developed from camels.China is keen to avoid repeating mistakes with its handling of Sars. For months, even after the illness had spread around the world, China parked patients in hotels and drove them around in ambulances to conceal the true number of cases and avoid World Health Organization (WHO) experts.In the current outbreak, China has been credited with sharing information rapidly, and President Xi Jinping has emphasised that as a priority.The WHO is holding a second meeting of scientific experts on Thursday, who will recommend whether to declare the outbreak a global health emergency, which it defines as an extraordinary event that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response.Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf3778b319b1b99638946b34cab3e86c7f780bcc/0_62_4017_2411/master/4017.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b345c3090b32aa38a80d7c2756f69bab","title":"mormons mexico cartels ambush massacre","story":"Cousins who lost nine close relatives in November ambush launch quixotic campaign for justice: ‘Who else is going to say something?’ After nine women and children were shot dead by cartel gunmen in the barren hills of Mexico’s Sierra Madre Occidental, 100 members of their fundamentalist Mormon community fled the country for the United States.Cousins Julián and Adrian LeBarón lost nine close relatives in the ambush, but they never considered leaving the country of their birth. Instead, they have launched a quixotic campaign for justice – not just for their slain kin, but for the many thousands of people murdered or vanished amid Mexico’s cartel violence.“We have to overcome our fears and do whatever we can to put a stop to this shit,” Julián told the .The two cousins – nut farmers from the high plains of Chihuahua state – make unlikely anti-crime activists. But they hope that they can help persuade others to rise up and pressure their public officials to put an end to the bloodletting.It is no small ambition in a country which last year saw its highest number of homicides since records began – and where mass killings fall quickly from the news cycle. Victims of the drug wars are often seen as complicit in their own deaths, and their families left to suffer in silence.But Julián LeBarón argues that Mexico has endured enough suffering – and has precious little left to lose. “People have to experience enough fear, enough pain, in order for them to say: what else can they do to me?” He added: “It’s happened to me.”In Mexico, victims’ relatives and anti-crime activists often end up being targeted themselves, but the LeBarón clan has stubbornly refused to keep quiet, speaking out against both organized crime – and the security policies of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.LeBarón recognizes that such outspokenness is only possible because of his family’s binational status: their ancestors moved to Mexico in the late 1800s to avoid US polygamy laws, and almost of all of the clan retains US nationality.Partly because of that, the massacre dominated headlines around the world and prompted the US president to call on Twitter for “WAR” against Mexico’s cartels.“We have dual citizenship. We have the protection of the FBI and Donald Trump’s tweets that scare the bejesus out of some people. Who the hell else is going to say something?” he said, between sips of macchiato in a crowded Mexico City Starbucks.But the family’s relative privilege, also brings responsibility with it, he argued. “We’re the face and the voice of those women – and everyone that’s suffering in Mexico.”The LeBarón family first rose to national prominence in 2009, when they refused to pay a ransom after a 16-year-old from their community was kidnapped. The boy’s elder brother Benjamín LeBarón led a brief campaign to demand action by the authorities and encouraging others to resist extortion – before he and his brother were murdered.Two years later, Julián joined an anti-violence caravan led by the poet Javier Sicilia who hoped the cross-country convoy of victims would force Mexicans to face up to the devastating impact of the violence.On Thursday, LeBarón will march again with Sicilia who has called for new peace caravans across the country which will converge on the national palace this Sunday.The new campaign is itself a bleak indicator of the limited progress successive governments have made towards establishing rule of law. Crime statistics have continued to break new records every year: 35,588 people were murdered in 2019 and some 62,000 people have vanished since the current war on drugs was launched in 2006.Sicilia confessed that he had never planned to organize another national protest, but told the : “I just couldn’t take so many more deaths, especially what happened to the LeBaróns – women and children murdered in such a repugnant, outrageous way.”López Obrador, or Amlo, promised to end the militarized strategy of his predecessors in favor of a vaguely defined strategy of moral renovation and addressing what he considers the root causes of violence: poverty and corruption.But so far, his promise of “hugs not bullets” has proved ineffectual: the massacre of the Mormons came just days after gunmen from different groups massacred 13 policemen and besieged an entire city. Meanwhile a new national security force has focused more on stopping Central American migrants than catching drug traffickers.Mexico’s “war on drugs” began in late 2006 when the president at the time, Felipe Calderón, ordered thousands of troops onto the streets in response to an explosion of horrific violence in his native state of Michoacán.Calderón hoped to smash the drug cartels with his heavily militarized onslaught but the approach was counter-productive and exacted a catastrophic human toll. As Mexico’s military went on the offensive, the body count sky-rocketed to new heights and tens of thousands were forced from their homes, disappeared or killed.Simultaneously Calderón also began pursuing the so-called\u0026nbsp“kingpin strategy”\u0026nbspby which authorities sought to decapitate the cartels by targeting their leaders.That policy resulted in some high-profile scalps – notably Arturo Beltrán Leyva who was\u0026nbspgunned down by Mexican marines in 2009\u0026nbsp– but also did little to bring peace. In fact, many believe such tactics served only to pulverize the world of organized crime, creating even more violence as new, less predictable factions squabbled for their piece of the pie.Under Calderón’s successor, Enrique Peña Nieto, the government’s rhetoric on crime softened as Mexico sought to shed its reputation as the headquarters of some the world’s most murderous mafia groups.But Calderón’s policies largely survived, with authorities targeting prominent cartel leaders such as Sinaloa’s Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán.When “El Chapo” was arrested in early 2016, Mexico’s president bragged: “Mission accomplished”. But the violence went on. By the time Peña Nieto left office in 2018, Mexico had suffered another record year of murders, with nearly 36,000 people slain.The leftwing populist Andrés Manuel López Obrador took power in December, promising a dramatic change in tactics. López Obrador, or Amlo as most call him, vowed to attack the social roots of crime,\u0026nbspoffering vocational training\u0026nbspto more than 2.3 million disadvantaged young people at risk of being ensnared by the cartels.Amlo also pledged to chair daily 6am security meetings and create a 60,000 strong National Guard. But those measures have yet to pay off, with the new security force used mostly to hunt Central American migrants.Mexico now suffers an average of about 96 murders per day, with nearly 29,000 people killed since Amlo took office.“The president has every right to hug people who are attacking him, but he has a monopoly on the use of force and the tools of security,” said LeBarón. “He has absolutely no right whatsoever to ask any citizen to embrace people that are murdering his family.”He is at pains to stress that he is not an opponent of Amlo, who has twice met members of the LeBarón family since the massacre, and promised that the case will not languish in impunity.But the family’s activism – and speculation that Donald Trump might push some kind of intervention against Mexican cartels – has stoked a visceral reaction from the president’s most ardent supporters. Hashtags telling the LeBaróns to leave Mexico have surged on social media.Adrián LeBarón, whose daughter Rhonita Lebarón was killed in the Sierra Madre ambush, said he was long used to being labelled a vendepatria – or traitor.Both LeBaróns argue that any attempt to confront Mexico’s security crisis needs to start at the bottom, unpicking the networks of corruption which have contaminated government at all levels."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4148199.1579718073!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"i get paid to learn i couldn t recommend it enough","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLee Devery: \u0027For me it’s the best way to learn: it’s hands-on and you practise what you learn\u0027Lee Devery (23), recalls being “constantly” told by teachers in secondary school that university was the best route to take after school.He never followed their advice.Now he is completing a two-year apprenticeship in auctioneering and property services and is delighted with his decision.“I really feel like this is a much better option,” says Devery. “I wasn’t much into the books in school and I don’t think I’d have lasted in third level anyway.”Instead of paying third-level registration fees of €3,000 a year for a college course, Devery is currently being paid €20,000 a year as part of his “earn and learn” course.He spends four days a week with the estate agent DNG and attends college at Ballsbridge College of Further Education one day per week.At the end of it he will have an advanced certificate in auctioneering and property services and will be eligible to apply for an official licence, which is needed to work in the sector.“I went straight into the hospitality sector after school and worked there for two and a half years,” says Devery.“I was interested in getting into property, but didn’t have the confidence to do it... a friend who is a real estate agent told me about this.“I weighed it up... I did the interview, it went very well, and for me it’s the best way to learn: it’s hands-on and you practise what you learn.”Property services is one of a raft of new “white collar” apprenticeships, with registrations jumping from just over 50 in 2018 to 90 this year.“There are people doing the course who have lots of experience, but don’t have the licences, so it’s also a route for them to do it,” adds Devery.While the basic salary is €20,000, he says there is also commission to be made from selling and renting, as well as expenses.“I could have ended up in a third-level degree course, studying for four years, working part-time to pay for it. But here I get paid to learn. I couldn’t recommend it enough.”  Surging Overall, apprenticeships are surging.\u0026nbspThe number of school-leavers choosing “earn and learn” options has more than doubled in recent years.Some 17,500 young people are now completing apprenticeships, more than twice the 8,300 in apprenticeships in 2015.Apprenticeships typically involve a combination of learning on-the-job with an employer as well as studying in college.Many new\u0026nbspapprenticeships are in areas such as accounting, technology, insurance, laboratory analysis and sales they typrically pay learners between €17,000 and €30,000 a year.Most offer a certificate or degree-level qualification at the end or a two- or three-year programme.While apprenticeships are growing in popularity, there is still a major gender gap in the sector, with women accounting for just over 3 per cent – or 600 – of the 17,500 apprentices.  This is because the\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspbulk of learners are still in traditional craft areas – such as construction, electrical, engineering and motor mechanics – which are dominated by men.Of the almost 6,000 or so new registrations in apprenticeships in 2019, almost 5,000 were in these traditional craft areas, while around 1,000 were in “new” apprenticeships.There is a much more even gender representation in this latter category\u0026nbspwhich  areas such as financial services, laboratory analysis, hospitality and sales.In many of these new programmes, the number of potential apprentices applying for positions is higher than the number of employers available to employ them.For example, in the case of tech apprenticeships last year, there were more than 1,500 applications for just 34 apprentice jobs in the civil service.In the case of the accounting technicians’ apprenticeship, each year there have been on average three applications for every available job.Solas is planning for significant growth this year with a further 23 new apprenticeship programmes due to be launched.These new programmes will include training for the occupations of recruitment executive, sales specialists, advanced healthcare assistant and quantity surveyor.While demand is growing, Solas, the State body with responsibility for the sector, says employer take-up of new apprenticeships developed since 2016 by employers has been slower than envisaged.Obstacles Some groups such as the Restaurants Association of Ireland say a key obstacle is the fact that employers must pay apprentices while they are at college.This is in contrast to other apprenticeships developed before 2016 – such those in the construction sector – where a training allowance is paid by the State to apprentices while attending off-the-job training.Solas has said this arrangement was a policy decision taken as part of the apprenticeship review in 2014.It says the new apprenticeship system was developed in consultation with educational institutions and industry and was aimed at allowing more flexibility in their design.Overall, it says, the number of participating employers is rising year-on-year.The numbers of employers hiring apprentices on the “new” apprenticeship programmes is increasing with a total of 540 employers in 2018 compared to around 1,000 at the end of 2019.Latest figures show there are more than 6,000 apprenticeship employers, compared to about 3,500 in 2015.To support apprenticeship expansion, the Government is due to provide an additional €27 million to develop the sector this year.Solas is planning to continue its “generation apprenticeship” campaign this year to boost awareness among school-leavers, and has also launched a new “apprenticeship jobs” platform online at\u0026nbspapprenticeship.ie\u0026nbspto make it easier to find vacancies."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4149135.1579788921!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us treasury secretary tells greta thunberg to go study economics","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin has said Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is in no position to give economic advice until she goes to college and comes out with an economics degree.

Chill Greta, Chill!” The activist responded by updating her Twitter biography to include: “A teenager working on her anger management problem. Currently chilling and watching a good old-fashioned movie with a friend”.It was not the first time the Republican president took aim at the teenager. Last September, Mr Trump retweeted a clip of Ms Thunberg’s speech to a United Nations climate summit in which she angrily denounced world leaders for failing to tackle climate change by demanding: “How dare you?”His sarcastic commentary was that “she seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!”The teenager also changed her Twitter biography following that slight to describe herself as “A very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future.”Ms Thunberg had also been a contender for the Nobel Peace Prize, an honour Mr Trump covets.

Photograph: Jason ClarkeMr Martin, who in 2004 became the first health minister in the world to implement the smoking ban, said he found it “extraordinary that vaping just arrived on the market with no health checks and with no assessment as to the potential harm it could do.” Speaking at a Dublin Chamber of Commerce event organised before the election was called, Mr Martin said vaping became popular without going through any of the rigorous checks that food businesses or pharmaceutical businesses have before releasing products to the market. “We are not sure what this impact it would have on the lungs in the future,” he said. “I find that scary. It’s growing exponentially among young people, and that’s a big worry that I would have. “I would ban it for under 18s. There would be a broad consensus across the political ide on it. We need to do with what we did with tobacco and denormalise it.” Mr Martin made his remarks in a question-and-answer session from the breakfast audience at the Conrad HotelHe accused Sinn Féin and left parties of “spewing out negative hostility” towards multinationals working in the Irish economy.“If you monitor the debates over the last five years, you rarely hear anybody in Sinn Féin or the left talk in any positive way about multinationals.“It’s always the multinational corporations who are out there to rip off this, that and the other. The fundamental underpinnings of the Irish economy over the last 50 years has been the level of foreign direct investment coming into the country.” Mr Martin said Sinn Féin often opposed trade deals that would benefit the Irish economy including the recent deal between the EU and Canada. “Instinctively, we should be in favour of free trade agreements that open up new markets for our goods and services. What you find with Sinn Féin is that it opposes all EU trade agreements.” He ruled out a return to large-scale tax incentives for property development for which previous Fianna Fáil governments had been criticised. Mr Martin said such tax incentives are now “toxic”. “There was a sense that they became abused. The Commission on Taxation was the catalyst for drawing back on tax incentives in relation to property because they just led to runaway and not wise investments.“To be frank with you, there is going to be targeted approaches in some areas to facilitate investments, ie over-the-shop residential. It could lead to some results, but I don’t see any return to wholesale tax relief in terms of development into the future.” In his speech, Mr Martin pledged another €100 million to third level funding as recommended by the Cassell’s Report. He said the multinational sector was thriving but that indigenous businesses were falling behind because the country lacked a national small and medium enterprises plan. In government, Fianna Fáil will establish a SME growth taskforce, Mr Martin said. If elected to government, he also pledged to bring in insurance reform and legislation to cut down on insurance fraud and to reform the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.

A resident of a south Dublin centre for people with disabilities experienced 89 abusive incidents in a nine-month period, according to a report by the Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa).It says the incidents occurred last year as a result of the the failure of St John of God Community Service, which operates the centre in Glasthule, to appropriately support other residents with their “behaviours of distress”.“Compounding factors included some members of staff not completing training or refresher training in the area of behaviour support and the high numbers of relief staff members employed in the centre,” said the health watchdog, which found the centre to be non-compliant on 10 of the 19 regulations it inspected.Hiqa on Thursday published 25 inspection reports on centres for people with disabilities, and said its inspectors found a good level of compliance with regulations in 20 of them.However, in the Glasthule centre, inspectors found it had not protected some residents from experiencing abuse and through a lack of action on the part of the operator, a number of residents continue to experience “incidents of a safeguarding nature” on a regular basis.“The inspector . . . found that the governance systems employed did not ensure that service delivery was safe, of a high standard and appropriate to residents’ needs,” Hiqa said. “While the registered provider was aware of the areas of non-compliance with the regulations, the inspector found that appropriate actions had not been taken to ensure that residents were protected and services of a satisfactory standard were provided.”Overall, the 15 residents were happy with the service provided, inspectors noted.In the reports, Hiqa recommended improvements for two centres operated by St Patrick’s Centre (Kilkenny), a RehabCare centre and two centres run by St John of God Community Services."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4148434.1579770081!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 amicable splits and potential bedfellows in first leaders debate","story":"For the past six years, a large cohort of people have retired at 65 to find that they cannot access their State pension until they turn 66.

Not so, he retorted, they had to stay together for the sake of Brexit.Questioned about the philosophical difference between the two parties, Varadkar pointed out that in the past, in all of Fine Gael’s relationships with other parties they “parted as friends” and that it “ended amicably” with the Labour Party whereas the opposition’s pairings “collapsed in scandal and acrimony.”Asked if it was time that they both “got together and reunited” likes days of old, Varadkar admitted that if pressed, he would prop up a Fianna Fáil minority Government or even form a coalition.Observers outside the studio, who had pulled up a couch under a TV to watch the debate, whistled gently.In an ante-room, three ministers watched on. Paschal Donohoe, Simon Harris and Regina Doherty had arrived shortly after 9pm in a show of support for the Taoiseach. Martin, in comparison, had arrived with his advisor.As was expected, the debate turned to the fortunes of the economy both past and present with the Fianna Fáil leader tackled on a claim that the economy has only just got back on track in the last two to three years partly thanks to the legacy of Fianna Fáil pre-2011.While Martin did reference the “global meltdown” and admit his party “made mistakes,” Varadkar was quick off the mark to claim that there had been no real change since then.The two were then asked about what the public’s perception is of them conservative with a small “c” for Martin, or “lacking empathy” for Varadkar?“I know people say that about me but I care deeply about the country and the problems that people face. I can’t put it into words as well as my opponent...but I do it in actions,” the Taoiseach faltered. It was a rare glimpse of emotion.There were skirmishes on housing and health with both leaders tearing apart each other’s election pledges resulting in Martin asking his opponent “have you any shame at all.”The retort was swift: “we are both former health ministers, (but) I am willing to accept we didn’t get everything right. You’d swear he was a brilliant health minister... it is unbelievable arrogance.” Kenny later mused that if either men had an unfortunate accident, both would get preferential access in an emergency ward.“In an emergency, if I have a heart attack or I have a stroke, or God forbid Micheál does...” at which a peel of laughter could be heard outside the studio. There was a more unusual moment later in the debate - which featured a silence that was around three seconds too long - when both were asked if they had ever taken illegal drugs. No, said, Micheál. The Fine Gael leader said he had answered that question in an interview with Hot Press many years ago. And that answer was? Yes. It was the most awkward moment of the debate, but mainly because of the prolonged delay in answering the question.After the break the two discussed Brexit and their problems with Sinn Féin. The Fianna Fáil leader took a hard line saying it was a moral issue.The debate ended the way it started, with musings and hand-wringing over who would do business with who after the election.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4148436.1579737382!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 varadkar tells debate he is open to coalition with fianna f%C3%A1il","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe first televised debate of the general election campaign between the leaders of the two biggest parties has taken place.Fine Gael would be willing to go into government with Fianna Fáil or to support them in a confidence and supply arrangement in the next Dáil should that be the only way to form a stable government, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said.Mr Varadkar was speaking during the first televised debate of the general election campaign between the leaders of the two biggest parties, which was aired on Virgin Media News on Wednesday.Mr Varadkar and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, who are both vying to lead the next government and win the office of Taoiseach, sparred on various issues including health, housing, and crime.Asked by moderator Pat Kenny whether they would be willing to team up in a “grand coalition” after the election, Mr Varadkar said the leaders “have to be grown-ups”.“My preference would be to form a coalition with old partners like Labour and independents,” he said. “Maybe new partners like the Greens.“But if it’s the case that people voted in a certain way, and the only way we could form a stable government is for Fianna Fail and Fine Gael to work together, well I’m willing to do that.”Asked whether that would include supporting Fianna Fáil in a confidence and supply arrangement, he said he would be willing to do so.“It’s not my preference, but if it’s the only way that we can form a stable government in this country, I’m willing to work with Fianna Fail, whether that’s a confidence and supply arrangement, or whether it means coalition, but it’s not my preference,” he said.Mr Martin, however, was less forthcoming on the issue, insisting that the country “needs a new government”.“We’re prepared to go into government with other centre parties who share a common agenda and who really want to get things done,” he said, but accused Mr Varadkar of engaging in “personal attacks” on him and his party in recent months.Both parties ruled out going into government with Sinn Féin. “I don’t think they are a normal political party,” said Mr Varadkar. “They opposed the setting up of a second special criminal court.”EmpathyMr Martin described government with Sinn Féin as a “moral question” and said the party “continues to try and impose a narrative on the murderous campaign of the Provisional IRA – they try to justify it”.When it was put to Mr Varadkar that homelessness campaigner Peter McVerry has suggested he has no empathy with people in crisis, he accepted the perception was an issue for him.“I care deeply about our country and the problems that people face,” he said. “I show my empathy. Maybe I don’t say the right words but I show it in the work I do.”Mr Varadkar also clarified that his reference to “people who get up early in the morning” refers to “anybody who works for a living”.He said his party had helped these people by reducing USC and income tax, as well as introducing free GP care for children under six.“But I absolutely acknowledge that we haven’t done enough and that’s why I want another term,” he added.On housing, Mr Martin said the “fundamental point is that people can’t save to buy a house because of the cost of renting”.“Fine Gael said five years ago they would end homelessness,” he continued. “They didn’t. They’re standing for election now making the exact same promises now.”Mr Varadkar countered that the issue with Fianna Fáil’s SSIA-style scheme to solve the issue was undermined by the fact that people can’t afford to save.“I know we have not finished homelessness and that is something that I feel that we have let people down on,” he said.Ministers for healthOn health, Mr Martin insisted there was “absolutely no comparison” between his tenure in the ministry and Mr Varadkar’s.“Leo talks about free GP care. Four years ago, Leo promised free GP care for everybody under 18, and, guess what, it didn’t happen. They are using the GP system for electoral purposes.“Leo, you promised us this five years ago. Have you any shame at all? The people are not fools.”Mr Varadkar replied: “The deputy made plenty of promises in government he didn’t honour”, and said it was “easy to come here and say there are easy solutions to these problems, but there aren’t”.“We’re both former ministers for health. One big difference is I accept that I have not got everything right in health and let people down. You’d swear that under Micheál Martin that everything worked. It is unbelievable arrogance.”Mr Varadkar also expressed “deep regret” and apologised “to anyone who has to spend time on a trolley”.“It’s not something that anybody wants and I know the impact it has on patients. I express my regret for that,” he added.Pensions crisisBoth party leaders said they had private health insurance.In relation to the pensions issue, Mr Varadkar said he had listened to people on the doorsteps: “We’ve got the solution, which is to pay a transition pension.” He also admitted it was “undignified” to expect retirees to draw the jobseeker’s allowance.On the same question, Mr Martin said there was “an issue around sustainability of pensions into the future and we all have to acknowledge that”. He added there was “an unfairness there” in terms of how public and private sector workers are treated.Recent political scandals around Dáil voting and expenses also featured. Mr Varadkar said: “Some people brought embarrassment on our party. None of them are candidates in this election.”Mr Martin accused Mr Varadkar of “doing a deal” with – and “facilitating” – former Fine Gael TD Dara Murphy, who was embroiled in controversy over his Dáil attendance and expenses.On the Dáil voting controversy, Mr Martin said “took action immediately” and removed both Niall Collins and Timmy Dooley from his party’s front bench.In relation to crime, Mr Varadkar said he was determined to get to grips with the feud in Drogheda, and said he had pledged additional resources to the Garda during a recent visit to the town. “We need to put these people behind bars,” he said. “We need to take on the underlying factors such as poverty and deprivation.” Mr Martin described the issue as “an emerging crisis”.On foreign affairs, Mr Varadkar emphasised the importance of continuity in relation to the Brexit talks, although Mr Martin pointed out that the State enjoys “an excellent diplomatic team”.Also on Brexit, Mr Varadkar said the country was “as ready as it could be”, but added that if there is no trade deal struck with the UK, the State can “only be so ready”.“If we cut Ireland off from its main trading partner, there will be consequences,” he said.Both men also insisted they would continue in their roles as party leaders in the event they fail to win the election and form the next government.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4149106.1579783772!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar s coalition offer an attempt to wrong foot martin s drive for change","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar (right) raised the question of a grand coalition with Fianna Fáil during Wednesday night’s Virgin Media leaders’ debate with Micheál Martin. But the issue will not go away completely. Though it apparently irritates Martin, the question of how a government would be formed after an inconclusive election outcome will become increasingly important as polling day nears.General elections are, after all, about getting a government for the country. Voters elect TDs TDs elect the taoiseach.And government formation is not just a matter of political preference and policy compatibility it is a numbers game. Dáil numbers will define the limits of what is possible and party leaders will have to live with that.Varadkar’s floating of a historic grand coalition between the two old rivals is not the first time this has happened. After all, Enda Kenny offered Martin a 50:50 share of government after the last election, an offer the Fianna Fáil leader - having explicitly promised he would not do such a deal, and aware of the opposition amongst his own grassroots to the prospect - felt able to resist. Interestingly, one of the supporters of the idea at the time was Kenny’s minister for health, one Leo Varadkar. He said that a Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil coalition would be a bit like same-sex marriage - it would feel strange at first but people would get used to it.Varadkar’s decision to refloat the idea now probably has as much - or more, probably - to do with fighting the election than forming a government after it. DisruptsBy landing the idea into the election debate, it disrupts Fianna Fáil’s efforts to be the party of change. After all, if we end up with a Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael coalition, how much different would that be to a Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael confidence and supply agreement?And with three-quarters of voters, according to this week’s Ipsos MRBI poll, seeking a change of government, the mantle of change is an especially important one in this election. During the Virgin Media debate, the promise of “change” was the centrepiece of Martin’s appeal to voters. If change-seeking voters believe that a Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael coalition is a likely outcome, they might be less inclined to vote for Martin’s party. So Varadkar’s ploy might not win him a lot of votes but it could cost Fianna Fáil. Fine Gael sources acknowledge that it leaves an opening for Mary Lou McDonald to portray Sinn Féin as the real “change” option. But their view is that is more likely to hurt Fianna Fáil than Fine Gael. Either way, the coalitionology question is now out in the open. It is unlikely to go away for the remainder of the campaign.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Growing concern that the flu-like infection might spread as millions travel to mark new yearMore than 730,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar after a military-led crackdown in 2017Victims were American residents air tanker crashed while fighting fires in alpine regionWHO will determine on Thursday if outbreak constitutes a global health emergencyLast year Taiwan became the first Asian country to recognise same-sex marriageControversial new law seen as unconstitutional by opposition, causing months of protestSixth death in China where wider outbreak feared as hundreds of millions begin travelling for lunar new yearHealth commission confirms that coronavirus can spread from person to personCricket ball-sized hail stones smash windows and see residents sledding through streetsOver 60 cases of novel coronavirus identified in Wuhan amid fears it could spread furtherXi Jinping\u0026rsquos name appeared as \u0026ldquoMr S**thole when translated into EnglishAuthorities still battling nearly 100 fires despite heavy rain in eastern parts of countryUS to screen passengers at three major airports arriving on flights from WuhanRescuers save 30 trekkers following incident on Annapurna circuitFacial hair of diplomat, who has Japanese heritage, reminds Koreans of colonisationMany young couples reluctant to have children due to costs orce rates hit recordMelbourne braces for another wave of unhealthy air over weekend\u0026lsquoThese pines outlived the dinosaurs \u0026ndash we had to do everything we could to save them\u0026rsquoBushfires dampened in New South Wales as thunderstorms cause flooding in MelbourneIndustry that has long supported India\u0026rsquos PM and pro-Hindu agenda begins risky rebellion"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4148959.1579778346!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"second chinese city goes into lockdown over coronavirus","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWorkers manufacture protective face masks in a factory, as face mask stocks run low amid the outbreak of coronavirus, in Handan, Hebei Province, China. Photograph: EPA  Huanggang has become the second Chinese city to go into lockdown over the coronavirus outbreak that has killed 17 people and infected more than 630.Health authorities in the city of around 7.5 million, which borders the city of Wuhan where the outbreak is centered, said they would suspend public bus and railway operations from midnight.They also ordered indoor entertainment venues, including cinemas and internet cafes, to close and asked citizens not to leave the city other than under special circumstances. Another nearby city, Ezhou, said on Thursday it had shut its train stations.Huanggang had reported 12 cases of the coronavirus as of the end of Monday.There are growing concerns that the flu-like infection might spread rapidly as hundreds of millions of Chinese people travel domestically and abroad during the week-long Lunar New Year holiday.Of eight known cases of the virus worldwide, Thailand has confirmed four, while Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States have reported one each.Residents of Wuhan scrambled to stock up on supplies on Thursday as authorities suspended transport links in and out of the city in an attempt to stop the spread of the coronavirus, which has raised fears of a global pandemic.The virus first appeared in the central city of 11 million people last month and is suspected to have jumped to people from an animal in a market where animals were sold illegally.The city’s government said it was suspending all buses, trains, subways, ferries and other long-distance transport as of 10 am local time (2am Irish time) in an effort to keep the virus from spreading. Flights out of the city were also being suspended.BlockedThe city made no mention of a ban on private vehicles leaving but one resident told Reuters she could not drive out of the city because guards were blocking the entrance to a highway she hoped to drive on. Authorities have advised residents not to leave the city.Hugo Guo, a 22-year-old university student who returned to Wuhan for the holiday, said he was resigned to being confined to the city for now but would be keen to get back to his studies in Shanghai.“I find it acceptable to have to stay at home, but I’m most worried about whether I’ll be able to return to school,” Mr Guo said.Footage from state media posted on Twitter showed the city’s Hankou railway station nearly empty, its gates barred and the announcement on the suspension of transport posted prominently outside.People were seen queuing at the station’s taxi rank but there did not appear to be many cabs operating.Flight tracking data showed that some planes were still flying out of the city after 10 am, however.“I’m one of the lucky ones since my flight wasn’t actually cancelled,” Sibusiso Sgwane, a Wuhan resident who boarded an Air China plane bound for the city of Shenzhen, said in a video message. “We’re advised to wear a mask at all times.”StockpileSeveral Wuhan residents said people were rushing to stockpile supplies. Big supermarkets were teeming with people and many shelves for staples like meat, vegetables and instant noodles were bare, they said.“Everyone is on a buying spree,” said one Weibo user, showing a picture of long queue at a checkout aisle.People took to social media to complain about surging prices for vegetables and other groceries.“No one will object to Wuhan being sealed but you need to let Wuhan’s residents be able to eat and live,” said another user of the Weibo social media platform.Posted videos showed long queues at petrol stations. One resident said he had to wait for an hour before he could fuel up his car.In Beijing, a group of passengers boarded one of the last scheduled flights into Wuhan. One, named Jane, said she was “very uneasy” given the situation but had to go back for her child.Another passenger, who only identified himself by the surname Yang, said he was not scared to be travelling to Wuhan.“I’m a brave man,” he said. “It’s not like it will be only me.” Ireland’s Department of Health, relying on a previous assessment, described the risk of a case in Europe as low at present.The Department of Foreign Affairs has advised Irish travellers that while the risk of contracting the disease in China remains low, their travel could be disrupted by increased quarantine and containment measures there.It says the Irish Embassy in China will continue to monitor the situation. – Reuters "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4145269.1579516519!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit eu citizens want physical card to prove right to stay in uk","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA report found nine out of 10 EU citizens in the UK would prefer a card over digital evidence  of their rights. File photograph: Will OlivierEPAThe British government is facing fresh calls to issue EU citizens with a physical document to prove they have the right to stay in the country after Brexit.A report found nine out of 10 EU citizens in the UK would prefer a card over the digital evidence they have now to demonstrate their rights in future to employers, banks or landlords.Fears over discrimination, loss of identity and a continuing lack of trust in the government’s willingness to deliver guaranteed lifetime rights emerged as serious concerns in the research – the biggest survey of EU, European Economic Area (EEA) and Swiss citizens in the UK to date.Tanja Bueltmann, a professor at Northumbria University who designed and conducted the poll along with the campaign group the3million, said: “The survey documents, without question, we have an ‘unsettling status’.“This extends beyond the application process, revealing an erosion of trust an erosion of wellbeing and an erosion of the sense of belonging among survey respondents.“The government has a duty to finally give EUEEA and Swiss citizens certainty. Hollow words are not enough.”The findings came just days after the government gave the European parliament’s Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, reassurances that EU citizens would not be automatically deported if they failed to apply for the settled status scheme.The survey, published on Monday, found that nine in 10 of those polled were unhappy about the lack of a physical document to demonstrate their right to remain in the country after they had been granted settled status or pre-settled status.As many as 11 per cent said they had already been asked for settled status proof, even though this is not legally required.This echoes a warning by private landlords that tenants could face discrimination because of the lack of a physical document.On the plus side, many of those surveyed reported a positive experience of the settled status app, with a majority of respondents saying the application process worked well.As many as 97.1 per cent of the 3,171 valid responses to the survey said they had received the status decision they expected.However, the emotional response to having to apply and the consequences of being labelled as someone with “settled status” was largely adverse. The words most frequently used by respondents to describe their feelings were “angry”, “anxious” and “unwanted”.Even those who had already been granted settled status felt worse off, with 80 per cent either strongly agreeing or agreeing that they felt anxious.Eight out of 10 said the process made them stressed and many thought citizenship was far more secure.Maike Bohn, co-founder of the3million, said the report underlined the lack of trust after three years of mixed messages.“Are we the much-quoted ‘neighbours, colleagues, friends’ or are we the ‘queue jumpers, benefits scroungers, unwelcome guests, draining the NHS’?“The government needs to step up local outreach and support, both to EUEEA and Swiss citizens but also to employers, landlords and others who will be forced to check the immigration status of these citizens in order to avoid huge fines.”The British Home Office said the scheme was working and a digital solution was better than a physical document. “This digital status future-proofs their rights and is linked to their passport or ID card, replacing physical documents which can get lost, stolen, damaged, tampered with and expire,” it said.–Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

His celebrity crush is Lily James.Meanwhile, the show has been sponsored by fast fashion brands (Missguided and then I Saw it First) for the last three years, giving viewers the opportunity to shop the female Islanders’ looks directly. Personally, I’ve always thought that Love Island contestants dress terribly: it’s Benidorm beaches meets Kardashian kitsch. But with prices starting at £5, the clothes are devastatingly cheap. Far cheaper than the designer garb we see on most TV stars. So I can understand the appeal. But I also know that every time someone buys one of those bikinis, or sparkly bodycon dresses, they’re adding fuel to fast fashion’s ever-blazing fire.But perhaps the onus is not on the consumer, or even the Love Island star. Lauren Bravo, author of How to Break Up with Fast Fashion, explains that the brands are the ones who should really be shouldering responsibility here. “These days we’re so used to instant gratification, and the idea that anyone can aspire to celebrity, that it seems reasonable for TV stars to sell us clothes and vice versa,” she tells me. “And it’s really hard, because I know what it’s like to love fashion and crave the clothes you’re seeing on people you admire, not to mention the huge social pressures on young people to keep that endless parade of new looks rolling over on their Instagram grid, so telling people who can’t necessarily afford to spend any more that their shopping habits are destroying the planet can feel snobbish and unfair.”Why I\u0027m giving up fast fashion #20PledgesBut, Bravo adds, the fact remains that those clothes simply cannot be made as cheaply as they’re sold. Somewhere down the line, someone is paying the price, whether it’s a garment worker barely surviving on poverty wages or a community grappling with industrial pollution.That’s not to say you can’t “get the Islander look” in a sustainable and eco-friendly way. Bravo suggests heading to secondhand shopping apps, like Depop, where you’ll find plenty of pre-loved items not dissimilar from the ones you see on the show. Some of them will be from fast fashion brands, but if you’re buying it there, you’re keeping that item in circulation as opposed to letting it wind up in landfill.\u0026nbspOr, you could take a closer look at some of the trends championed by Love Islanders, both past and present, and see that many (cycling shorts, mesh, high-waisted jeans and leopard print) hark back to another era, like, say, the 1990s. And what better way to shop Nineties fashion than by heading to your local Beyond Retro or Rokit, which will be jam-packed with original clothing from the decade that is not only more sustainable, but a hell of a lot cooler, too.How to Break Up with Fast Fashion by Lauren Bravo (£12.99, Headline Home) is out nowOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After the initial 18-month period comes to an end – which for many people will be next month – those who have not brought down their balances could be put on to a payment plan or face more severe options.Akansha Nath, credit expert at Credit Karma, which commissioned the survey, said: “It’s daunting to think that we might be well into April before we’re consistently back in the black, but rather than using ‘quick fixes’ to free up some extra cash, there are lots of simple ways to get back in control of our finances, from creating a new budget to reviewing all outgoings or transferring debts to a 0 per cent balance transfer card.”Borrowers seeking a zero per cent credit card now have less choice available to them as banks have withdrawn some cards from the market and reduced the interest-free periods.This month, Bank of England research showed that the length of balance transfer deals reduced markedly and the availability of unsecured debt decreased towards the end of 2019 as lenders became more nervous about the UK economy.Financial website Moneyfacts says the number of cards that allow balance transfers has dropped by more than a third in the past three years to reach a record low.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After the initial 18-month period comes to an end – which for many people will be next month – those who have not brought down their balances could be put on to a payment plan or face more severe options.Akansha Nath, credit expert at Credit Karma, which commissioned the survey, said: “It’s daunting to think that we might be well into April before we’re consistently back in the black, but rather than using ‘quick fixes’ to free up some extra cash, there are lots of simple ways to get back in control of our finances, from creating a new budget to reviewing all outgoings or transferring debts to a 0 per cent balance transfer card.”Borrowers seeking a zero per cent credit card now have less choice available to them as banks have withdrawn some cards from the market and reduced the interest-free periods.This month, Bank of England research showed that the length of balance transfer deals reduced markedly and the availability of unsecured debt decreased towards the end of 2019 as lenders became more nervous about the UK economy.Financial website Moneyfacts says the number of cards that allow balance transfers has dropped by more than a third in the past three years to reach a record low.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They mean that our planet is ablaze with elusive particles that stream up to its surface – but are entirely invisible to our eyes.Astronomers solve mystery of element that helped create life on EarthThe Borexino detector located at the underground\u0026nbspLaboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy aims to see that invisible flow of particles. Scientists have been watching for neutrinos since 2007, and have been collecting informaiton over that time.By last year, the researchers had spotted the new stream of ghost particles as well as making their measurements more certain.Geoneutrinos are the only direct traces of the radioactive decays that occur inside the Earth, and which produce an as yet unknown portion of the energy driving all the dynamics of our planet, said\u0026nbspLivia Ludhova, one of the two current scientific coordinators of Borexino, in a statement.The new discoveries could help shed light on those mysterious processes, which help create the unexplained heat that comes from the centre of the Earth. The world beneath our feet gives rise to a host of strange phenomena – such as the Earth\u0027s spectacular volcanos and magnetic field – which are not like any other seen in the solar system.The new data helps refine scientists\u0027 understanding of how those processes happen. It shows that it is very likely that radioactive processes inside the Earth are generating more than half of its heat, with the rest coming from the original formation of the planet, meaning that those radioactive processes are responsible for those volcanos and earthquakes that change life on the surface.Scientists hope they can learn yet more about those mysterious processes, by measuring the ghost particles with more precision. In China, an experiment called Juno is currently being built that will be 70 times bigger than Borexino and could give vastly more insight.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.The singersongwriter also added that the Brexit referendum nearly tore apart Madness.“Even in my band there were Brexiters and Remainers, like every family in the country,” he said. “We had punch-ups about all that.”Suggs voted to stay in the European Union, and also said in 2016 that the UK was on “a highway to hell” following the Leave victory.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

People would not have looked up from their newspaper for this one if this happened in Greece.“This one happened under a heavily populated area. There would not have been much traffic and so they can actually perceive the earthquake.“People would have been lying in bed, so they would perceive it themselves.”He added: “There would have been a rumbling noise, a little shudder, it would only have lasted for three or four seconds.”Mr Ford said although the UK is not on any major fault lines, it is criss-crossed by smaller ones which still experience stresses from time to time.Additional reporting by Press AssociationOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I want to rebuild our country and the Labour Party.Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon is standing as a continuity candidate, flaunting his loyalty to Jeremy Corbyn and saying it is wrong to blame the current leader for the election defeatShe defended her decision to send her son to a partially selective comprehensive school and said she was opposed to the introduction of mandatory reselection votes for Labour MPs, which are supported by her rival Rebecca Long-Bailey.But she said she would not pick out any policy in Mr Corbyn’s manifesto for last month’s election as being “wrong”, criticising the package instead for being too ambitious and presenting a 15-year programme of change rather than a few priorities which would fit onto a Blair-style pledge card.I wish Jess Phillips was still in the race – she tells it like it isLeadership is hard- as the Labour candidates are suddenly finding outLisa Nandy’s attack on New Labour gives her a chance of victoryStarmer urged to ‘stand aside’ so party can have first woman leaderDespite Labour going down to its worst election defeat since 1935, Ms Thornberry said there was no need for an “existential crisis about who we are and what we stand for”.And, in a sign that the race’s outsider does not want to alienate Corbyn backers, she said she would pick a shadow cabinet of “all the talents” if she became leader.In a possible swipe at her rivals, all of whom entered parliament in 2010 or 2015, Ms Thornberry said she had not stood for leader before because she did not have the “proper experience”, but was now ready to try for the top job having been an MP for 15 years and held seven frontbench jobs.She said she would keep an “open mind” on future free movement for EU citizens after Brexit, arguing it should be decided on the basis of what would be best for jobs and the economy, which she said would involve being “close to the single market”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But with utilities like water and energy, she said she would give companies a chance to show they can deal with problems like excessive profits if they wanted to avoid being taken back into public ownership.She said she would not scrap the HS2 high-speed rail link between London and the Midlands or the renewal of the Trident nuclear deterrent.But she refused to say whether she would press the nuclear button if the country came under attack, insisting that she would follow former prime ministers including Margaret Thatcher in keeping the UK’s enemies guessing about Britain’s strategy.After playing video footage of her smiling as Ms Butler said that “if anyone doesn’t hate Brexit, even if you voted for it, there’s something wrong with you”, Neil told Ms Thornberry that her expression showed she was sneering.She responded indignantly: “I was not sneering… I really object to this.“When they say that I sneer at people, they forget who I am and where I come from.”Ms Thornberry, who was brought up in a council house in Guildford by her mother after her parents’ orce and went on to become a barrister, has previously been forced to defend herself against allegations of sneering over a tweet apparently mocking a white van driver whose home was decked with England flags.She told Neil: “It is the prime minister who has said that blue-collar workers like my brother, who is a builder, are largely unemployed, have low self-esteem and are drunk.“He is talking about my brother. No-one says that Boris Johnson sneers at people.“Somebody like me who comes from a council estate and from a single parent background, I don’t sneer at people, I listen to them.”Ms Thornberry said she had been “laughing at Dawn saying the most extraordinary things”, adding: “I have never sneered and it’s not right to say so, and I do not accept that.”Challenged over her decision to send her son to a partially selective comprehensive school 14 miles away from their north London home, Ms Thornberry replied: “As a politician, what I want to do is make sure we have good schools up and down the country.“But as a mother, I will never apologise for doing the best for my kids. Any mother watching this will agree with me.“As the victim of selective education who failed her 11-plus and went to a secondary modern, I feel very strongly about this.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Road toll booths were reportedly closing down, effecting cutting off exit routes for cars, and guards were seen patrolling major highways.As the city slipped into isolation, queues formed for checks at health centres and supermarket shelves were cleared as shoppers panic-bought supplies. There were fears of a shortage\u0026nbspof face masks widely worn by those who ventured outside, with manufacturers reopening factories which had closed for the holidays and paying staff up to four times their normal wages to return to work.Coronavirus: Everything travellers need to knowHuanggang, a city of more than seven million people just to the east of Wuhan in Hubei province, said it would also suspend its public bus and rail networks at the end of Thursday. Businesses including cinemas and internet cafes were told to close and residents were asked not to leave the city other than under special circumstances, state media reported.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But he added patient numbers alone did not indicate the severity of the outbreak as many cases were mild and the mortality rate had decreased.Researchers at Imperial College London who studied the number and location of reported cases estimated that 4,000 people had been infected by the virus in Wuhan\u0026nbspby 18 January.\u0026nbspIt is likely that the outbreak of a novel coronavirus in Wuhan has caused substantially more cases of moderate or severe respiratory illness than have currently been detected and reported, they said.A panel of scientists were set to meet on Thursday at the WHO’s headquarters in Geneva to consider whether the outbreak of the new coronavirus should be declared an international emergency. The 16 independent experts in disease control, virology, epidemiology and vaccine development were holding a second closed-doors meeting after they were unable to reach a decision on Wednesday.In the US, at least 16 people were being monitored for signs of the disease after they had had close contact with a man in\u0026nbspWashington state who was diagnosed with the first American case.The patient, a 30-year-old man who had recently returned from Wuhan, is recovering well and may soon be discharged from Providence Regional Medical Centre\u0026nbspin the city of Everett, said the hospital\u0027s chief medical officer Jay Cook.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The varied landscapes and lives of residents wedged in these borderlands speak of two different systems that have coexisted on one another’s doorstep.Far from the marches and salvos of tear gas and petrol bombs over the past half-year of anti-government protests that have convulsed Hong Kong, the residents in this border realm have borne witness to both rapid urbanisation, as China booms, and the preservation of a slower pace of life.About 20 miles\u0026nbsplong, this boundary meanders between fish ponds, farmland, sleepy traditional villages and grassy hills on the Hong Kong side, with the gleaming skyscrapers of China’s high-tech city of Shenzhen on the other. Shenzhen, once itself the bucolic backwater, has risen into China’s giddy vision of a digital, high-tech future.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHong Kong is world’s most visited city in 2019We may have won the elections battle, but the war is ongoingHong Kong police ‘hack into more than 3,700 mobile phones’Mr\u0026nbspLam, now in his eighties, lives in a house without mobile phone reception, where he farms and catches crabs. A narrow sliver of water separates him from mainland China. He recalls living in a wooden cabin along the Shenzhen River\u0026nbspwith his family 70 years ago. There were only “old and broken” sheds on the far shore back then, he says, gazing into the distance. “Of course, the mainland is much more advanced than before. Everything is good, even the streets are beautiful.”Over past decades of political upheaval in communist China, waves of mainlanders flooded across the border into Hong Kong, seeking peace and a better life. Lam still remembers the flashlights of the British-run police piercing the dark as they chased illegal immigrants making a dash for freedom.Andrew Kwok, an old fish farmer living in the area, recalls those who drowned making the perilous crossing. “There were a lot of them, hundreds of dead bodies in the river,” he says.The flickering, lonely torches have now been replaced by a vibrant mega-city with a million flashing lights. The living quality for people on both sides may have converged, but a gulf remains. For these two peoples, it remains a struggle to reconcile shifting eras, values and dreams.Merrin Ke, 23, grew up in Shenzhen but got her masters degree from Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University. She had flitted easily between both sides, up until recently, when she moved to Shanghai. “I think the situation in Hong Kong is quite sensitive now, which is easy for people to have conflicts due to different political stands,” she says. “That’s why I’ve decided to leave Hong Kong to work and get away from the intense environment.”Even though the protests in Hong Kong show no sign of abating, Ke remains optimistic unity will overcome ision. She says: “Hong Kong people used to come to have fun in Shenzhen and people from mainland China also liked to visit Hong Kong. But now such things are becoming less and less. I still hope everyone can put differences aside, and it’s not enough for just one side to do this. It requires the joint efforts of both sides.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She should have asked herselfshe was willing and able to behave in accordance with the expectations.Her Majesty’s words show great diplomacy but Meghan’s behaviour has so far not been diplomatic. A diplomat wouldn’t fall out with her own family.Her friends leaked negative comments about the “toxic” Royal Family. She also allowed damage to be done against our family via friends and PR advisers.She watched the media taunt and torture my dad, never springing to his defence like a true humanitarian would.Thomas was an incredible dad. He paid every penny of her education and cared greatly for her.He is now frail, with a heart condition. He doesn’t have a PR team to spin him a good story.The Queen, at , shouldn’t have had to face the stress of seeing her family torn apart.Meghan hasn’t stepped forward to minimise the damage.She knows how Harry leaving has affected them, but she hasn’t spoken up in their defence.Yet in her statement, the Queen says she is “particularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family”.Her Majesty is building bridges there. It would be goodMeghan could do the same.She could have expressed her thanks for the kindness of the Queen and Prince Charles.She could have expressed gratitude to her own father or her first husband, Trevor, who gave her career opportunities.My sister has become a totally dferent person, choosing wealth and fortune over family.Her decision to leave is nothing to do with the behaviour of the royals, or race.Her marriage to Prince Harry was so symbolic of ethnic unity.The preacher and choir were all of African heritage. It was a lovely joining together.The royals embraced that. They welcomed Meghan into their lives, into the culture, and allowed her to promote people of all races. I have never heard anything racist coming out of the Windsors about my sister.Supporters who claim a racist element forced Meghan out are frustrated their hoped-for fairytale princess didn’t work out.These social equality-obsessed people had pinned their hopes on Meghan. They hoped for an equality of race right at the higher echelons of society.At least Harry and Meghan were right to decide tothe £.million they received to renovate Frogmore Cottage and not take any more public funds.In the Queen’s statement, she hopes Meghan and Harry can “start building a happy and peaceful le”. We have to hope for the sake of my sister and for the Royal Family that this agreement achieves that aim.My fear is Meghan’s decision isn’t about moving to Canada for a quiet le as a young mother.Nothing about their actions so far suggest they truly desire a private le out the limelight.They have paraded themselves on the red carpet, tried to make deals with Disney, and become pals with the Clooneys and other A-list stars.Smooching up to Vogue magazine, to fashion and to the film industry is not consistent with taking a step back.Their objective is fame and fortune — to be Hollywood.Meghan’s goals are not consistent with those of the Royal Family. Personally, I don’t believe she ever expected to fit in with the strict structures and traditions of the Windsor household.Even after marrying she kept her lawyer and publicity adviser, suggesting she wasn’t willing to sever her ties with her old le.Perhaps she always had the idea toto her le as an actress and lestyle influencer.In the statement from Buckingham Palace, it says “the Sussexes have made clear everything they do will continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty”.My concern is that this is a face-saving statement, which won’t work in reality. The Royal Family has always been opposed to merchandising and corporate endeavours outside of them.If Meghan and Harry want to honour the Queen, they will consult her before doing deals.She thinks she can be at the top of the world, but using the royals to get that international notoriety is tacky.Meghan was a cable TV actress before marrying Harry and would not be on the front of every newspaper and magazine without him.In the US, the Press is still positive, praising her attempts to modernise the British monarchy and saying how cool she is.The media in Calornia and New York are likely to remain in her corner but I don’t think Meghan and Harry will ever be able to overshadow Prince William and his we Catherine.They are exemplary they are iconic. There is no comparison.It is clear Meghan cares for Archie, but I do worry about his future. There doesn’t seem to have been a lot of consideration given to his cousins George, Charlotte and Louis and how often he will see them. Harry has put Meghan above his brother, father and grandmother. A house ided cannot stand.I am worried that Meghan and Harry will never find true ­happiness. They could not find contentment with the Royal Family, will they be able to find it away from them Maybe they will meet up with counsellors who can help them to heal the wounds.Perhaps they will make amends by apologising.We need sincerity and dignity from Meghan in order to find peace. Then, perhaps, she will have the peace she needs to go forward.I loved my sister, but I do not like the person she has become.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He warned the Left’s obsession is providing a cloak for crime.The Sussexes’ decision to quit was “not racism”, he told a cheering crowd. “We’re the most tolerant, lovely country in Europe.”Signicantly, the applause came not from the far Right but from right-on BBC Question Time — an audience carefully chosen, stressed presenter Fiona Bruce, to reflect Britain by age, sex and politics.Fox — famous as DS James Hathaway in TV’s Lewis — was instantly denounced as a “privileged white male” and therefore with no right to an opinion.“Oh, God!” he cried. “I can’t help what I am, I was born like this. It’s an immutable characteristic, so to call me a white privileged male is to be racist.”His landmark moment went viral.Ricky Gervais spoke for the silent majority when he told the Golden Globes nominees “who know nothing about the real world” to tear up their political speeches.But it took the furore over Megxit — and Fox’s unanswerable case for the defence — to trigger Britain’s own fightback.Fox has given a voice to ordinary, decent citizens who are incensed by finger-wagging know-alls smearing them as racists, Nazis and fascists.These ugly insults were hurled at millions who backed Brexit and the overwhelming majority who voted for Boris Johnson.Until now we’ve been too polite to fight back, gagged by Thought Police who bark: “You can’t say that.”So we put up with politically correct sniping from such “identity” obsessives as rapper Stormzy, MP Clive Lewis and the entire Labour Party, who smell racism under every rock.Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan sparked uproar when he challenged black and Asian commentators to produce a “shred of evidence” of Press racism. They failed.Fox’s one-man mission is more than a poke at the PC brigade. It is about free speech — and hypocrisy.Scattergun charges of racism offer an alibi to serious crime, he says, citing the Pakistani sex gangs who systematically raped and trafficked white victims across Britain — with police blessing.“It’s one of the dangerous things about throwing racism around,” the actor told Question Time.“People become so conscious of it that things like the Manchester grooming scandal get ignored.”He spoke as police finally confessed to deliberately turning a blind eye to decades-long vile abuse of vulnerable, underage white girls.A police report confirms a -year reign of sex abuse went unchecked after an unnamed chief inspector ruled: “With it being Asians, we can’t afford for this to be coming out.”Fear of the race card also partly explains why police failed to halt the slaughter of mostly black victims by mostly black kne gangs.The same “cultural cringe” stops prison staff tackling dangerous Islamist gangs who have seized control in Britain’s terror jails.It’s why forced marriage and honour killings go unchecked.Now, at last, black and Asian voices are bravely confronting the race zealots.Leading commentator and ex-Equality Commissioner Trevor Phillips, son of poor immigrants, condemns “feel- good” racism detectorists.“It might make ‘right-on’ white liberals feel better,” he says. “But the price of their smugness is an ongoing bloody massacre of black children.”Home Secretary Priti Patel, daughter of Uganda-Indian migrants, has declared war on the race industry.The BBC strenuously denies “institutional bias”, despite abundant evidence from within the Beeb itself – including from former Director-General Mark Thompson.Now Boris Johnson is in power and the bloated corporation’s £BILLION subsidy is at risk.Perhaps that’s why Question Time is now apparently balanced, Andrew Marr is being polite to Tory guests and on Radio ’s Today, Nick Robinson has gone almost silent.“We live in a great country, a land of opportunity for all,” she said. “Institutionalised, corrosive behaviour that disregards victims has to end.“Tackling this abuse is a priority for the Home Office. There will be no no-go areas.”At last, perhaps, we have a senior politician of colour who is prepared to follow Laurence Fox’s advice and “speak truth to nonsense”.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On the contrary, it is an abdication that has sadly plunged him into turmoil.He is a man pulled in opposite directions, torn between patriotic duty and his deep love for his we, between his loyalty to the monarchy and his desire for a new, less constrained role.That explains why, throughout the recent crisis that he and Meghan inflicted on the House of Windsor, his stance has been so confused and contradictory.He speaks of his devotion to Britain but seeks a fresh start in Canada.He expresses his desire to serve but gives up the commitments that go with his position.He trumpets his yearning for privacy, yet he and his we appear keen to set themselves up as a millionaire celebrity couple - hardly the way to avoid attention.He continually wails about media intrusion, yet he resigns as Captain-General of the Royal Marines so he can spend more time on his social media accounts.He and the Duchess endlessly talk about their need for emotional support, yet they have shown little concern for the needs of their own families.Those inconsistencies were graphically exposed in the speech he made on Sunday night at a charity dinner in London to try and justy his recent conduct.His address was given in the immediate aftermath of the deal reached at Sandringham, where he and Meghan agreed to the loss of public funding and the use of their titles infor their independence.It was clear that the saga had exacted a heavy toll on him. In a voice often cracking with emotion, he told his audience that they would “hear the truth from me”.But what they actually heard was a catalogue of embittered anguish.As often, he moaned about the press, which he painted as a sinister, powerful force which needs to be curtailed.Unfortunately, despite all his professed love of Britain, Harry appears to have no understanding that a free, open media is essential to our democracy.He has proved unable to handle any criticism at all – even when it is justied, as in the hypocrisy of his green campaigning while indulging in the use of private jets.It is ashe thinks the media should be filled with fawning sycophants who never scrutinise but just lavish him with praise.That is the kind of regime that belongs to a totalitarian dictatorship, not traditionally liberal Britain.Much of Harry’s hostility to journalists stems from their relationship with his mother. But, however understandable, this is another myth.Princess Diana was not naïve when it came to the press. She was a shrewd, sometimes ruthless operator, who was quite willing to exploit the newspapers when it suited her.With some indignation, he complained that the Sandringham deal was not what he wanted. But it was foolish of him to believe that he and Meghan could have semi-detached Royal status, enjoying its privileges without its obligations.The Queen could never have tolerated that, especially because any commercial deals reached by the Sussexes could have badly compromised her family, just as their cherished fashionable causes could have undermined the Crown.Royalty cannot be a vehicle for self-enrichment or political posturing.The Duke’s inner agony was at its most obvious when he spoke of his regrets for the le he is leaving.Having revealed that he and Meghan were excited to “fly the flag and carry out our roles for this country with pride”, he referred to his “great sadness” at the step they have taken.Yet he claimed that they had “really no other option”. It was another moment of self-deceit, for there were certainly other courses open to them.They could have either stuck to their Royal positions without creating such a psycho drama about themselves, or,they really wanted freedom without scrutiny, they could have retired to live quietly as ordinary citizens, as some other members of the Royal family have done in the past.But such modesty would not have fulfilled their ambitions to be globe-trotting celebrities.It is this craving for fame that highlights the emptiness of Harry’s language about his devotion to service. “I will continue to be the same man who holds his country dear and dedicates his le to supporting the causes, charities and military communities so important to me,” he declared at the charity dinner.Yet this is the same man who was revealed to have touted his we’s voiceover skills to Disney bosses at the London premiere of the Lion King last summer.In the eyes of their critics, the real dedication that Harry and Meghan will probably soon show is to TV deals, book advances, and brand partnerships.In a further attempt to justy their actions, Harry implied that they had been suffering for a long time through the crushing restrictions of Royal le.The final move had been made, he explained, “after so many months of talks and so many years of challenges.”He and Meghan have only been married for  months. A true model of stoical determination, the Queen has been on the throne for almost  years without any public complaint.That just illustrates Harry’s lack of perspective. Insulated by privilege, he has little understanding of the lives of ordinary British citizens, many of whom have endured far greater struggles than anything he has ever experienced.After the Queen had been so publicly generous about him and Meghan in her statement from Sandringham at the weekend, saying that “they will always be much loved members of my family,” it was bad manners of Harry to complain about the deal he had just accepted.He should have responded to his grandmother’s generosity in the same spirit.But what’s done is done. Our monarchy has survived its latest crisis. The moment for recriminations has passed now that a new chapter is about to begin.As he settles in Canada, Prince Harry is bound to miss aspects of his old le in Britain, which even now he describes as “my home and the place I love.And the British public will miss him. At his best, he brought a lovable humour, spontaneity and lack of convention to the Royal Family.We can only hope that now, after taking this drastic decision, he finds the peace that he and Meghan crave.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Which makes Hall’s defence of the licence fee even more ridiculous.In an era of multiple-choice subscription TV it is absurd for one broadcaster to be funded by a tax enforceable by criminal penalty.It is even more laughable to claim it “ensures independence­ . . . obliges us to serve everyone and reflect every part of the UK”.Hall’s BBC spent his entire tenure turning a deaf ear to half the UK. Hence its shock at last month’s Tory triumph.Hall’s decision to rob over-s of the free licences he agreed to in  was equally outrageous.The idea that the £million cost will harm vital BBC services, when so much of its content amounts to needless competition with commercial rivals, is fatally flawed.His successor must run a smaller Beeb, more in touch with the public, less in the grip of suffocating “wokeness”, focused not on gratuitous expansion but the high-quality shows it does best.This new chief should accept that non-payment of the licence must be decriminalised and the levy finally replaced with a voluntary subscription.Only then will the BBC join the st Century.THE problem with Harry saying he and Meghan had no option but to move abroad to avoid our “powerful media” is that not a word of it is true.It is sheer paranoia to say the Press has done anything but legitimately scrutinise a publicly-funded couple.And the reality is they do not want to avoid media. They want to avoid criticism.Indeed they crave media attentionit meekly writes their PR puff pieces.

She left the body in the back bedroom.Rachel knew she killed the one-year-old female when she stopped kicking, a Phoenix police investigator wrote.Henry then chased her three-year-old into a back bedroom before smothering him.Rachel described singing to the three-year-old as he scratched her chest and pinched her, the report detailed.She next fed the seven-month-old female a bottle in her bedroom until she fell asleep.A court document said she sang her a song while killing her.The childrens little bodies were then placed on the living room couch as though they were taking a nap, the report says.A relative who lives at the house called police late Monday, and officers found the kids in a living room with no obvious trauma.Officers performed CPR on the little children but they were pronounced dead by paramedics.Detectives havent determined a motive for the childrens tragic deaths.The Maricopa County Medical Examiners Office will determine how they died.Theyre now trying to figure out what prompted Henry to commit such a senseless act.Court documents also say had the youngsters taken away from her - only to have them ed prior to the killings.A representative from the Maricopa County Attorneys Office said that Henry apparently admitted to having a history of addiction to methamphetamine and that her children were previously removed from her care.However, its likely this happened in Oklahoma before Henry moved to Arizona last year - as the Arizona Department of Child Safety told The Arizona Republic it had no previous contacts with the young mum.But court documents say she was not under the influence of drugs at the time of her kids deaths.Henry, who recently moved to Arizona from Oklahoma, was arrested Tuesday and charged with first-degree murder.Her next court appearance is Jan.  and shes being held on a million bond.Do you have a story for The US Sun team Email us at exclusive@the-sun or call   .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You have to be creative and aggressive and think two steps ahead of the celebrity.”And therein lies the rub. Largely stripped of his royal status, Harry is now a common-or-garden celebrity who has to take his chances with the rest of them in the jungle of hustling for work amid bustling premiere crowds.Then there’s news website TMZ and its myriad wannabe imitations. They’ll be dogging his every move with a video camera, hoping to catch a magical clickbait moment.Its website — together with a frenzied voiceover — is already jokingthat Meghan might sign up for The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.As a former actress on cable show Suits,Meghan was of little interest to the Hollywood glitterati and the parasites that feed off them.But now  She’s gold-dust — particularly as her inner circle includes A-listers such as the Clooneys, Serena Williams, Oprah and the Obamas. And therein lies yet another rub. If you attend premieres of movies you’re not in, holiday on rich people’s jets and yachts and hang out at members-only clubs where the hoi polloi are only allowed in to clean up after you . . . then you are wilfully choosing a “celebrity le” and, with that, comes media attention, particularly from the Wild West of online.They need you for clickbait, and you need them to maintain the “popularity” upon which you trade and, without which, you are nothing .Unless, of course, you have a God- given talent like Meryl Streep, Judi Dench, Gary Oldman, Benedict Cumberbatch etc, etc — all of whom put on a suit frock when they have a film to promote but otherwise live a perfectly normal, unremarkable and, therefore, largely “peaceful le” unbothered by the media.Or a member of the British Royal Family who can retreat to one of their many estates for a spot of fishing and contemplation.So . . . “a more peaceful le” outside the protective environs of the monarchy  Dream on.But then, deep down, one suspects that Harry and Meghan both know that and are simply using it as a smokescreen for the real story.His we was homesick, found royal duties restrictive and dull and wanted toto her old le with royal knobs on.And because Harry loves her: “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.”Good luck to them.

But let’s not pretend they had no other option because of something this country did or didn’t do.HARRY and Meghan might be forced to ditch their proposed Sussex Royal brandThe Queen sees it as cashing in on their former royal status.As they’ve already registered it for everything from magazines to mugs, dropping it altogether could prove expensive.So perhaps a little tweak — to  Sussex Royle — might be an easy and appropriate compromise As the incomparable Jim Royle, aka Ricky Tomlinson, might say: “Have their cake and eat it  . .

There may be other proteins involved.”The expert believes that the new strain was an RNA virus, meaning that its mutation speed was  times faster than that of a DNA virus such as smallpox.Coronavirus is an airborne virus, spread in a similar way to colds and the flu.The virus attacks the respiratory system, causing lung lesions.Symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever, shortness of breath, chills and body aches.It is incredibly contagious and is spread through contact with anything the virus is on as well as infected breath, coughs or sneezes.Symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever, shortness of breath, chills and body aches.In most cases, you wont know whether you have a coronavirus or a dferent cold-causing virus, such as rhinovirus.Buta coronavirus infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract , it can cause pneumonia, especially in older people, people with heart disease or people with weakened immune systems.There is no vaccine for coronavirus.In  an outbreak of a similar virus, SARS, infected more than , people in  countries before it was brought under control, killing  of those worldwide.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I did it to change my image.”He admits he is still making money off the images, adding: “The reality is that those images will sell forever.”Thomas confessed that he lied to Harry on the phone about posing for the pictures. “I’m not proud of that, but I did, he said.And when speaking about his grandson Archie, the -year-old hopes the child has his famous Markle nose.He said: I hope he has my nose because every time they look at Archie they’ll see me.The American-born retiree says the last time he spoke to Harry was on his hospital bed after he suffered a heart attack days before the royal wedding.He claims he told the prince: “It’s a shame I didn’t die because you both could pretend that you’re sad and then I hung up.I haven’t heard from them or spoken to them since.”Defending his decision not to travel to the wedding, he later added: If I didn’t treat the heart attack I wouldn’t be here now, according to the doctor.This comes as Harry was reunited with Meghan and son Archie in Canada after their bombshell decision to step back from royal duties.On Saturday the Queen confirmed that from the spring they will relinquish their HRH titles as they seek a more independent le in North America.Following that Thomas, , accused the couple of cheapening the institution of royalty, saying: They are turning it into Walmart with a crown on.He added: Every young girl wants to become a princess. She got that and now shes tossing it away.It looks like shes tossing that away for money.He has never met Prince Harry or his grandson, Archie.He told the broadcaster: I want everyone to know that Im not all the trashy things that are being said about me.I want Harry and Meghan to see this and know that this is not fair.Discussing the first time he heard his daughter was dating the sixth in line to the throne, he said: She calls me on the phone and she said Ive got a new boyfriend and I said Great and she says Hes British. I said OK, she said Hes a prince I said Alright she said Hes Prince Harry.I said Oh, OK. I didnt know what it meant. She could have been dating a Hollywood star and it would have been just as important to me, because you know either way they are both high numbers.He later found out his daughter was pregnant - when he heard the news on the radio.Thomas recalled: I was sitting in my car waiting to cross the border and I heard the good news from the royals is that Meghan is pregnant. Which is almost a joke when you tell people, well you heard it on the radio.This is my daughter, talking about my grandchild. Shes going to have a grandchild thats mine. Im not hearing about it on the phone, Im hearing about it on the radio.Thomas was then unable to attend his daughters wedding ceremony due to ill health. Prince Charles agreed to walk his future daughter-in-law down the aisle in his place.In a direct message to Meghan and Harry, he said: I apologise to you. I want to apologise to the queen and to the royal family. I want to do that and I was told by them, dont. And I was scheduled to go to the airport and go fly to England because they still wanted me to come to the wedding and be at the wedding.And at that time I got a massive heart attack and was then taken to the Sharp hospital, across the border.Buckingham Palace confirmed on Saturday that Harry and Meghan would no longer be working members of the royal family.Responding to that, Thomas accused the couple of destroying one of the greatest long-living institutions ever and cheapening it.He said: They couldnt have done anything worse to harm the Queen - probably the most loved and respected woman in the world.He added: I cant see her reaching out to me, especially now - or Harry for that matter.But I think both of them are turning into lost souls at this point. I dont know what theyre looking for. I dont think they know what they are looking for.Shot over six days in his Mexico home, Channel  filmed Thomas during October last year.Thomas Markle: My Story aired last night at pmOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That threw me. So I got the Barclays bank app up, went through onto it and there it was, Asda, for the amount for the shopping. I tried to leave and this woman started shouting at me saying I’d not paid. I was trying to go and she was saying aposno you havenapost paidapos. I got really upset. She added: I asked to speak to a manager, I said, aposIaposve paid, Iaposm leavingapos and he said, aposno, you haven’t paidapos. I showed him the app. He said apositaposs only in pending, it means nothingapos. I said aposit does, it means my money is waiting to come throughapos. They weren’t going to let me leave. So I said, aposOK, I want my money back because at the end of the day I’ve paidapos. This went on for ages.

In the end her bank came to her rescue after she called them.She said: Iaposm disabled, my heart was going, my blood pressure was going up to all sorts of degrees, my daughter was getting upset. Everybody was looking.I was fuming. In the end I said, aposright, I’m ringing the bank, because Iaposve paid and you are stealing my moneyapos and he said aposyou are stealing our shoppingapos. So in the end I rang the bank, virtually in tears. The manager went away, he did something at the till and it produced the last receipt from the till and it wasn’t my shopping. That just did not compute because we had scanned everything and the machine had taken the payment so where did my receipt go  Ms Hopcroft said Barclays Bank told the manager that the payment had been made but he still refused to let her leave with the shopping. In the end the bank put the money back into her account which allowed her to pay again. Iaposm warning everybody, do not use their self-scanning systems, Ms Hopcroft said.

Residents were woken up by a loud bang and a aposshudderapos in Stockton-on-Tees this morning, leading some to fear that an asteroid had hit the area.However, it turned out to be just the latest in a series of increasingly frequent earthquakes to strike the UK. Blackpool, the earthquake capital of Britain, saw more than  tremors in , with many blaming the phenomenon on fracking. The Government stopped fracking across England in November, saying it would only allow its resumptioncommunities and scientists were in favour of it. In total, there were  earthquakes across the whole of the UK last year, the same amount as in , which was the last highest year on record. After todayaposs quake rocked homes in the north, here are the hot spots for seismic activity in the UK: Blackpool Up to November last year, Blackpool experienced  tremors, according to data from the British Geological Society . That is more than anywhere  in the UK and comes on top of  more in . Most of the earthquakes reported in the Blackpool area happened during fracking, a process that releases gas from shale rock. This included a . magnitude tremor in August.  The BGS said this quake had an intensity of six - meaning it would be felt by most people indoors and many outdoors and could cause minor damage such as small cracks and falling objects. The Oil and Gas Authority halted fracking indefinitely at Blackpoolaposs Preston New Road site following the August earthquake. The high number of tremors in Blackpool is likely also due to the string of BGS monitoring stations in the area. Surrey The area around Newdigate, in Mole Valley, Surrey, witnessed  earthquakes up to November last year, the BGS said. A . magnitude quake which struck Newdigate in February was dubbed the aposSurrey swarmapos. The BGS believes the tremors in Surrey are natural - in comparison to the ones linked to fracking in Lancashire.  There was a . magnitude quake on April , , followed by five others above . on the Richter scale. Seven of the earthquakes in the area were felt by residents, with some raising concerns that they could be linked to a nearby oil production operation. However, BGS found there was no link. The high number of seismic incidents in the area may also be due to the prevalence of BGS monitoring stations in the area.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThey were once called the most evil men in Britain and were by a distance the most infamous gangsters the East End has ever produced. Murderers, torturers, hardened criminals… but, to their mother, Violet, twins Ronnie and Reggie Kray were her “lovely boys”. It was a sentiment shared by the identical twins themselves. “They were classic narcissists... image was important to them,” says world renowned criminologist David Wilson, who took a fresh look at their le and crimes. Wilson, a professor of criminology at Birmingham University, adds: “The Krays were very able manipulators. “There is still a fascination with them and the organised crime associated with them from the s.” They were arguably the most notorious criminals of the decade, heading a criminal empire, built on intimidation and brutality. When they moved to Bethnal Green from nearby Hoxton as children, Ronnie and Reggie quickly became involved in juvenile crime. Both were promising amateur boxers. Yet this and National Service in the Army did little to instil discipline or control the violence that would become their trademark. In the s they first moved into “protection” – demanding money with menaces from businesses who would face brutal reprisals for not paying up. And it paid off handsomely for the twins. By the following decade, their Firm had spread its operations west, open gambling club Esmeralda’s Barn in wealthy Knightsbridge. There they wined and dined celebrities, including Judy Garland and Barbara Windsor flocked to the club.It is said Reggie, the charming one, could have been a straight businessman, but his brother’s psychotic tendencies made that impossible. Ronnie loved the gangster image, insisting the pair had identical suits and slicked-back hairstyles. Unlike most villains the pair revelled in the spotlight. “They came managed to create an image for themselves in a way that nobody  had done,” says criminology lecturer Dr Ruth Penfold-Mounce of York University. “Most criminals become famous when they get go to jail. They achieved it while they were still active.”  When rumours about homosexual Ronnie’s friendship with Lord Boothby surfaced in  he became front page news on the Sunday Mirror. A portrait of the twins taken by David Bailey cemented the twins’ position in the public consciousness. Despite their growing fame, they continued their reign of terror, seemingly beyond the reach of police. But the law finally caught up with them as their ruthlessness reached new heights.  First, Ronnie shot George Cornell in Whitechapel’s Blind Beggar pub in . “He was a drunkard and a bully and I done him,” Ronnie would later say. “Me – not my brother.” In December that year, the Krays, helped Frank Mitchell escape from Dartmoor Prison. Once out, they put him in a friend’s flat in East Ham. But Mitchell, known as the “Mad Axeman”, became hard to control. He disappeared without a trace. Then, in , Reggie murdered Jack “The Hat” McVitie, a minor member of the Firm who had failed to fulfil a contract to kill Leslie Payne."},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton describes feeling isolated","story":"NewsKate Middleton describes feeling isolated as first-time mum while Wills was awayThe Duchess of Cambridge spoke candidly at The Ely and Caerau Children’s Centre about living in Anglesey with a \"tiny, tiny baby\" while Prince William was working night shtsShareCommentsByRussell MyersLorraine King:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video kate-visits-ely-caerau-childrens-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news kate-middleton-describes-feeling-isolated-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Kate spoke candidly about her experience as a first-time mum living in Anglesey with a tiny, tiny baby during a visit to a childrenaposs centre in Cardf on Wednesday. After arriving at the centre, Kate said it was nice to be back in Wales before telling her hosts: “I will have to remember my Welsh!” The Ely and Caerau Children’s Centre is located in an economically deprived area of the city and offers a welcoming environment for parents and kids. Kate said: “If only I had had a centre like this. It was the first year and I’d just had George – William was still working with Search and Rescue and we came up here and I had a tiny tiny baby in the middle of Anglesey it was so isolated, so cut off. I didn’t have any family around and he was doing night shts. During the visit, Kate also mentioned Charlotte and Louis, adding: “We will be taking a trip down to Anglesey at some point.” Kate spoke to several parents about the centre and the facilities it offers to locals.  Speaking to mum Rhi, , who uses the centre with her -month-old daughter Eleanor Logue, Kate said: So many families now are so spread out. “It’s much harder to rely on other generations for support.” Rhi told her: “You can come here and tell people, ‘I haven’t slept’. “And everyone  is like, ‘I haven’t either!’” laughed Kate.  “It normalises it. No one is going to judge you for it. And it’s a social thing for you.” Afterwards Rhi said: “We talked about post-natal depression and how hard it is to have a kid and how important centres like this are. I would have been in such a dark place without it. “It’s lovely to see her in a place like Ely. It’s such a deprived area and there have been so many funding cuts. Sometimes you are scared to walk the streets, but coming here you feel safe. You don’t feel like you are going to get mugged.” In another room, Kate was charmed by -month-old Indie Corten-Maynard and one of her two mums Estelle Corten.  Estelle said: “She was asking me what it was like coming here as a same-sex couple and I told her how welcoming the centre has been. “It was amazing to have the future Queen here in Ely!” In the English language part of the centre’s bilingual nursery, Kate sat down with older children who were playing with dough and joined them in making doughballs as she was told how the children spend lots of time outdoors. One little girl told her: “We are talking about your nursery! It’s so cool I would love to come here. What’s your favourite thing about it  Do you like playing outside ”  She then took the little girl by the hand and asked her to show her the outdoor area, stopping to meet the resident guinea pigs Willow and Bella in a wooden hut, appropriately bearing the sign “Cath’s Cottage” She crouched down to stroke the black-and-white pet, Willow, telling the children: “I had guinea pigs when I was little. I think your nursery is the best. She’s so soft, isn’t she ” Watching as the children fed them carrots and sprouts, she joked: “I did not know that guinea pigs liked Brussels Sprouts!” Introducing herself to another group of youngsters who were drawing, Kate said: “Nice to meet you, I’m Catherine.  These guinea pigs are a lot quieter than the ones I had at home!” She told Carolyn Asante, head of the centre: “They are so happy in there! It’s like their own little world.” In the centre’s Welsh medium nursery, Kate was presented with flowers and a drawing of herself by four-year-old Erin Jones, who briefly hesitated when prompted to hand them over. “Are you shy ” asked Naomi Asante Chambers, a senior teaching assistant.  “Don’t worry, I am too,” the Duchess told the little girl. “Is this my dress ” she asked, pointing at the drawing. “I love your hair, I should have done mine like that today. I love the drawing too, thank you! Thank you so much, what a special morning I have had.” She also joined three-year-old River Roson, who was playing with pretend food.

Royal commentator Omid Scobie said the Duchess believed there would be a honeymoon period after she joined the royal family - in which she would be allowed to falter and make mistakes.

Both are due to leave from their roles as senior royals and give up their HRH titles. On Meghanaposs short time as a senior royal, Omid said: I think one of the biggest mistakes Meghan made, and I’ve heard this from sources close to her, is that she naively went in thinking this role came almost with an instant popularity, he said on the Heirpod podcast.you start in a good place and there is this, no matter what, there is a honeymoon period that comes with marrying into the royal family that allows you to falter at times, or figure something out, or whatever it is.

I think everyone somehow had this level of expectation from her from the get-go that was perhaps somewhat unrealistic, and perhaps she herself had some unrealistic expectations from the role too.

Chloe Blight had picked up her eight-year-old son Ruben from a friendaposs on Friday night when she stopped by a branch of the fast-food chain in Wolverhampton for a quick dinner. After waiting for his Chicken Mayo burger to be freshly made without lettuce, it was only when the family arrived back at home that Chloe, , discovered what she called a half-eaten scabby burger. Stomach-churning images show a burger with what appears to be a large bite right the way through both halves of the bun and out of the chicken burger too. Chloe claims friends have suggested the burger might have been a ed item they were given in error but she believes it could have been a member of staff who took a bite. Chloe, who has three children, says her family are aposfinishedapos with the fast food giant now. A McDonaldaposs spokeswoman said they follow aposrigorous standards to avoid imperfectionsapos and that the family were offered a full refund and replacement meal as soon as it was brought to their attention. Chloe, from Codsall, Staffordshire, said: It was a disappointment. Ruben was shocked - we all were. We waited longer for this to be made to order. It was supposedly fresh. Itaposs horrible to think someone is working there doing this. It makes you think of all the other times youaposve had food from McDonaldaposs. People have been saying maybe it was one thataposd been ed and given to us as a mistake, but I donapost know how that would happen. Surely that would go straight in the bin. We had a bit of a laugh afterwards but at the time, it wasnapost funny. It was my sonaposs tea and the time of night when you want to get the kids settled. I think weaposre finished with McDonaldaposs now. I canapost really see any coming back from it.  The mum is adamant that the food remained untouched on their journey home from McDonaldaposs as the bag was with her in the front and never left with the children. McDonaldaposs explained that when Chloeaposs partner Ashley Henry, , called the branch to complain, they were offered a full and replacement meal. However the family claim they were not interested in this and were dissatisfied as they believed the manager did not seem interested in establishing how their burger had ended up that way. Chloe said: It was about pm and it was late for the kids, so we decided to get a quick tea for the oldest. He has a Chicken Mayo with no lettuce, so it always has to be made fresh. We donapost eat in the car, so we got outside the house, checked the food and saw that one was missing. We rang [the store]. They didnapost offer to check the cameras or anything. They didnapost say they would be investigating and the manager denied all knowledge of it.

The grotty weather continues throughout the UK with driving conditions continuing to be perilous despite the cold snap having lted. New weather fronts are moving in, the most striking of which could see snowfall after the weekend, but not before an almighty downpour and an awkward blanket of fog. After a cold night, Thursday will see a lot of low cloud, mist and fog in places, according to Met Office forecaster Luke Miall. It will be quite grey, quite gloomy, he added. BBC meteorologist Stav Danaos said high pressure remains pushing into the northwest of Scotland to bring more substantial rain, while much of the country will have to contend with mist and murk, and the odd shower. And while there are no weather warnings in place for the foreseeable future, the rains are bringing with them  flood alerts across England, as per the Environment Agency. Pretty dense through the morning and it will tend to lt into low cloud, he said of the thick band of fog expected. A lot of cloud around but the best of any breaks again, northeast Scotland and northeast England where it will turn quite mild into the afternoon. And this front is set to bring substantial rain to parts of Scotland as well as the odd spot of drizzle across much of the rest of the country. Temperatures for most in Britain will be around  or C and tonight is unlikely to see frost, just days after the cold snap saw the UK drop to -C - lower than Iceland, Russia and Finland. Mr Danaos said into the weekend there will be more rather leaden skies - while the Met Office is warning of snowfall early next week.  The long range forecast, beginning on Monday, includes heavy rain, most likely focused over western parts with snow possible across some northern hills. It will be windy throughout with a chance of gales at times, which will reduce the risk of overnight frost and fog. added the Met Office report. UK  day weather forecast Today: Mostly cloudy but largely dry. Early mist and fog across England and Wales slow to clear and lingering all day in some parts, especially Wales, the Midlands and eastern England. Brighter in the north and rain developing northwest Scotland. Tonight: Mostly cloudy with mist and fog likely over parts of England and Wales. Rain over Scotland sinking southwards with clearer skies and scattered showers following into northern Scotland.

While her fans love her youthful looks, Gina says she actually thinks sheaposs rather odd looking. The mother-of-four and grandmother-of-one said: I wouldn’t describe myself as glamorous – I’d say I’m quite odd looking. But I am single right now. And sheaposs even offered some advice for anyone trying to impress her. She said: The best way to get my attention is to know a good grandma joke. Then they might be in with a fighting chance. American accents have always done it for me,” she tells us. I love guys who talk like Mathew McConaughey or Patric Swayze – I guess it’s that southern drawl, or charm.

She said: This post met guidelines - Iaposm confused as to what the problem was with the photo. Itaposs pretty tame in comparison with a lot of posts on Instagram these days - it compiled with Instagramaposs nudity guidelines and showed nothing a swimsuit wasnapost show. So I feel it has been taken down for hypocritical reasons I canapost fathom - is it ageism, or because Iaposm a grandmother   Gina said she felt censorship on Instagram is a contentious issue as it has become aposauthoritative and dictatorialapos. She pointed out there were posts in which breasts were clearly on display which had not been removed. In its response to Gina, Instagram said the post breached guidelines on nudity and pornography. Gina explained: I have felt forced to take a stand as the aposworldaposs hottest grandmaapos, and show what is happening to me. Iaposm not only fighting for my rights, Iaposm fighting for everyone. Next censorship will tell us what we can and cannot write on Instagram and social media in general.  The rules are arbitrary and could even be seen as a form of bullying. Instagram later confirmed Ginaaposs post had been mistakenly removed and had since been restored.

Wuhan, where the virus originated, has been quarantined, as the virus continues to spread.

A clip showing a girl putting one of the creatures in her mouth with chopsticks while eating with friends has had a similar reaction. The Wuhan coronavirus’ natural host could be bats … but between bats and humans there may be an unknown intermediate, said a statement from scientists published in the South China Morning Post.  News of the bat soup comes as the Foreign Office warned Brits not to travel to Wuhan amid fears of a global outbreak. Last night China confirmed  total cases of the new coronvirus outbreak. As of Wednesday evening,  deaths have been reported, all in Hubei province. Around  medical workers have also been infected.

The man inside the box is wearing a protective suit, a mask and gloves after he reportedly showed possible symptoms, including a fever, during screening and was isolated from other travellers. The box is surrounded by staff wearing blue masks as it is wheeled to a waiting ambulance outside a terminal at the airport in Fuzhou in south-eastern China. The number of deaths in China stood at  on Thursday as the outbreak - which began in the central city of Wuhan - spread to other countries and the epicentre was locked down amid fears it could become a global pandemic. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror. China has reported more than  cases of the virus, which is believed to have originated at a market that sold live animals and seafood. It is suspected that it emerged from illegally traded wildle late last month and one study by medical experts suggests it may have originated in snakes, with a link to infected bats. Government medical adviser Zhong Nanshan had also identied badgers and rats as possible sources. Airports around the world have introduced screening measures for passengers arriving from the affected region. Flights from Wuhan to London Heathrow have been halted due to the lockdown in the Chinese city.In Wuhan, a city of million, residents were told not to leave as transport was shut down. Flights were suspended, bus, train and ferry services were cancelled and roadblocks were set up on the outskirts of the city. Some flights were still operating after a am deadline, however.  The Hankou railway station looked like a ghost town and toll booths had shut down, effectively cutting off road access. Guards were patrolling major highways, one resident told Reuters. There was panic as shoppers stormed a store that sells masks, cleared out supermarket shelves, queued for petrol and thronged into hospitals for checks.  Neighbouring Huanggang, a city of about seven million people, has implemented a similar lockdown to prevent people from travelling and spreading the virus. The lockdown of  million people is unprecedented in public health history, so it is certainly not a recommendation the WHO has made, Gauden Galea, the World Health Organisationaposs representative in Beijing, told Reuters. Lunar New Year celebrations have been cancelled in a number of major cities, including Beijing and Wuhan. Health officials fear this new strain of coronavirus will spread rapidly as hundreds of millions of Chinese residents travel domestically and abroad for the Lunar New Year, which begins Saturday."},{"url":null,"title":"pregnant 13 year old says","story":"NewsPregnant -year-old says she fell in love at first sight with boy, The children have been together for a year and plan to raise their child with help from their parents, but have faced bullying in their home town of Zheleznogorsk, RussiaShareCommentsByRoksana PanashchukKelly-Ann Mills:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video pregnant--year-old-appears-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news world-news pregnant--year-old-says-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Daria, , and Ivan, , have appeared on TV in Russia ahead of their babyaposs arrival to share details of their relationship. According to the children they met each other a year ago and fell in love at first sight. Daria, who is just eight weeks pregnant, said during the On Air show, which they appeared on with parental permission: A friend of mine introduced us and two days later we started dating. Ivan said he was in love with me. We tried to spend as much time together as we could. We like walking down the streets holding hands and kissing. But there are some questioning whether the -year-old boy could have fathered a baby at all. Local paediatrician Nikolai Skorobogatov said: Theoretically both children could have reached reproductive age. But Dr Evgeny Grekov, a urology and andrology expert, says Ivan could not be the father. He said: We rechecked the laboratory results three times so there cannot be any mistake. There cannot be sperm cells. He is still a child.  There is even no testosterone. And just to add, he still has childish sex organs. Puberty has not started. So we have a lot of questions. According to the girl, who is planning on keeping the child, she and her boyfriend take care of each other and set their social media as aposmarriedapos. The schoolgirl said: Ivan has gastritis and I do not allow him to drink carbonated beverages. Sometimes I worry about my weight but he says that I am in perfect shape and do not need to go on a diet. He is very kind. Daria revealed that she and Ivan had sex at his home when his mother was away. She said: After we did it for the first time, we hid from each other under the blanket out of shame. Soon after Daria started to feel sick and had nausea most days. The girl’s mother Elena took her to hospital for examinations but doctors failed to find the cause of her aposillnessapos. Finally, Elena bought a pregnancy test kit for her daughter. Elena, who was also participating in the show, said: The test showed that Daria was pregnant. After that, she confessed to having sex with Ivan.  I was in shock. I could not say a word. When we started talking she said she would not kill the baby and I support her decision. I do not want her to go under the kne. Ivan and his mother Galina, , are planning to help Daria to raise the child. Galina said: I did not know what to say after learning that my -year-old son fathered a child. I think Ivan himself does not quite understand what happened. He said they came to our apartment and Daria offered him to have sex.  They did not use any contraceptives and obviously did not realise the possible consequences. Some of the familiesapos neighbours express doubts over whether the boy is indeed the father. A man living next door said: I think somebody  got the girl pregnant and now they want to put all the responsibility on the boy. And a woman said: I do not believe the boy is the father of the child. I doubt he is developed enough for that. Father-to-be Ivan said: Daria has never been with another man. I know that for sure. I am the father of her baby. The children say they became a target for bullying in their hometown of Zheleznogorsk in central Russia’s Krasnoyarsk Krai region. Daria said: aposSome children from my school called me a w***e and said that I am sleeping around. I wanted to die after hearing that.

We see this as the way and Dundee and Angus College would be involved in taking this forward, with enhanced provision.#Both these schools are grade C in terms of quality and both need upgrading but looking at the financial elements we cannot afford it.#The priority is in the east and we cannot have Braeview Academy people sitting in portable cabins.#Mr Alexander, a former pupil of St Saviour#s High School, outlined how #vocational partnerships# between Braeview and Michelin would be continued at the new campus at Drumgeith Road.He added that a joint project between Dundee City Council and Dundee and Angus College would be launched to accommodate people with additional support needs.Mr Alexander said: #I spoke with three executives from Michelin and we are really focused on making things work.#The consultation,approved by committee on Monday, would start on February  and run until the end of March. We have to be honest with the public and we want the feedback from parents.#This is the very start of the process.

petition has been discussed at the Scottish Parliament in the hope that a solution can be found.Rachel said: “Val and I have been campaigning since last March.“Steve Szalay, the managing director of Aberdeen International Airport, has always been supportive of us and Val and I met up with him in March last year when it all began.“We keep in regular communication with him on progress and he is

hoped that Aberdeen Airport could eventually be on a level with Inverness Airport, where an exemption is in place.Rachel said: “We are looking for a fair level in the hope it gives us a higher chance of negotiating or bringing back airlines to Aberdeen.”Val said she has met MP David Duguid, who hopes to meet Secretary of State for Transport Grant Shapps to discuss the issue.She added: “We are

boss Derek McInnes today urged the Red Army not to panic as he remains confident Euro qualication will be secured.Aberdeen were booed off the pitch after crashing - to Motherwell at Pittodrie to lose valuable ground in the race for third.McInnes insisted the supporters’ reaction was understandable as third-placed Well moved four points clear of the Reds.The Dons boss accepts a lack of cutting edge and creativity in attack was a fundamental factor in the defeat.He aims to recty that with signings before the January transfer window closes.It is understood McInnes is set to resurrect his move to sign St Johnstone winger Matty Kennedy this month.McInnes said: “The reaction from the fans at the end is understandable as we are all frustrated.“I have been here long enough andyou don’t win your home games that is the way it is.“However, it is nowhere we have not been before and we still have plenty of the season ahead of us.“We have lost a battle but we can still win the fight. We still believe we can win that European spot.“We will dig deep, stick together, hopefully get these changes done in the window and then kick on for the remainder of the season.“The supporters can clearly see the players are putting plenty into it. However we are all looking for that more quality. That more consistency and threat in the final third that we have always had here.“At the minute we are lacking in that.”St Johnstone winger Kennedy has already agreed a pre-contract to join Aberdeen for next season.However, McInnes attempted to secure the -year-old this month only to hit an impasse in talks with Saints.After further frustration with his attack it is understood the Reds boss will launch another attempt to secure Kennedy this month.McInnes said: “There was that lack of quality, cutting edge, quality of pass, cross and composure in the final third. It meant we didn’t score and Motherwell went away with three points.“By and large that creativity, speed and quality in the final bit to help us is nothing new. It has been there for a few months.“I am looking for more as we have been too reliant on Cosgrove.“Hopefully we can get the necessary players in that can help us.”Aberdeen were denied a clear penalty when Andy Considine was brought down by Declan Gallagher in the box with  minutes remaining.Referee Willie Collum did not award a spot-kick, to the frustration of the Dons boss.He said: “I thought we should have had a penalty kick. I have seen it again and Andy Considine gets wiped out as there was no touch of the ball.“Their player comes through, goes to ground and takes Andy out.“You still need a bit of good fortune and the referee to make the right decision.”Motherwell grabbed the lead on the stroke of half-time when Liam Donnelly was allowed to head in a free-kick unmarked at the back post.McInnes said: “It was a decent delivery but with the size of us we should be taking more responsibility and attacking the ball to see it off.“Motherwell are a big side but you still have to deal with what is in front of you and a lack of responsibility cost us there.”Aberdeen finished fourth last season and had to wait on Celtic retaining the Scottish Cup in the final to confirm Euro qualication.With an automatic European slot awarded for third he was under no illusions as to the importance of the fixture. The manager said: “We billed the game as a very important game so the result is everything.“We were up against a good side and there were no surprises from Motherwell as we had to fight for every inch in that first half.“I thought the midfield area was pretty even in there and we were not getting pushed about.“We could have passed the ball about a bit better at times.“I thought we were the better team but ultimately the result is everything.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event. And to Gavin #Top Tog# Brown, who has been an avid rally man for years and continued to watch us all through the lens, capturing some of our most heroic moments. was a busy year, with a few of us still tinkering away in sheds.  will hopefully see theof Ally and Del Galbraith in their #new# MK Escort and Donald Bowness in the giant killing Nova making aafter some time out.PICS:Dougie Watt and Ian Parker flying in Finland before winning in Aberdeen Photo: Jii Pihlaja. no_a_RallyFinlandFather and son duo Craig and Ross Callendar came in th overall at this year#s Mull Rally.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along.

ahead of Galashiels, Hawick and Selkirk.But the Chief Executive told the towns Community Council she thinks Peebles should now be first on the priority list for a new school.Ms Logan explained: ldquoAt the moment my view is, and this is only my view, this has not even endorsed by the Council as yet, is that given the constraints that we have around what will be available financially, the Scottish Government have been really helpful in that they are offering their full support and we will make a bid late spring for funding through the schools programme.ldquoThere will obviously be a financial settlement from the insurance.\"But we need to find the best way forward, so my expectation is that we will retain the Sports Complex because it is undamaged and pretty new, we will also retain the Millennium Wing because again itrsquos not that old and is entirely usable.ldquoI would imagine that we will probably end up taking away everything  and replace it with something new.\"What that will look like, I have no idea.

This is a fascinating and picturesque structure from the th century, which lies semi-hidden amongst the trees that cling onto the steep sides of the slope.Dunglass is such a beautul area, and the ancient Dunglass Collegiate Church, dating from the th century, is one of its architectural jewels. Itrsquos open to the elements now, but well preserved and a popular place for weddings.The castle that once stood nearby is long gone. A more modern house sits on the spot where a mansion once stood, and before that the castle. Being on the main route south, the castle inevitably saw action during the ious times of war with England, being burned and damaged on a number of occasions in the s.But in August , the castle was effectively blown up in a huge explosion, and a version of events emerged which placed the blame on a vengeful servant called Edward Paris.It was a time of war and religious rage. Thomas the nd Earl of Haddington was leading a Covenanting force charged with defending this important route from the south, as the Covenanting army had entered England a few days earlier. He had established his force at Dunglass Castle, an obvious strategic location, to defend the armyrsquos rear.On that fateful day, August , , he was said to be in conversation with some fellow nobles when a huge explosion erupted from the vaults, instantly demolishing the central part of the castle which became little more than a pile of debris.Thomas and many others were killed, their bodies pulled from the rubble. They had been crushed by the collapse of the walls in the explosion.History has repeatedly recorded the names of the nobles killed on that day, but there were many others, as the castle was busy and full of people. Fty-four unnamed lsquocommon servantsrsquo were killed, and more than  other people badly injured, some later dying of their injuries.Edward Paris was Thomasrsquos servant and he has been blamed for this tragedy. The th-century writer Andrew Stevenson claimed Edward had the keys to the vault in which huge amounts of gunpowder had been stored, and he had been ldquoseduced by the enemies of the covenant to commit this act. He was an Englishman and another account says he was incensed at derogatory remarks made by Thomas about his countrymen.Irsquove always thought this explanation never really had the ring of truth. It was initially deemed an accident, and the story of Edwardrsquos role emerged later, instigated by a writer called William Lithgow, a man who had certain axes to grind. In one account, Edward is said to have thrust a hot poker into the gunpowder or set fire to it. The detail of this is suspect in itself, for who survived as a witness to this act  I suspect that a dreadful accident, possibly caused by incompetence and carelessness, was turned into a deliberate act of vengeance as it made a more useful explanation.Of course, it is very possible that Edward was offended or annoyed at things said by his master, and perhaps he mentioned this at some stage, later to be used as evidence of his guilt. But in truth, most servants will have seen or heard things which will have offended them, it was a part of their job.Imagineservants had been able to write and publish the things they had overheard and seen, what dferent historical narratives we would have!Motives for wanting to interpret the cause of the explosion in this way can be guessed at. It was a time of atrocity and massacre, with religious, political and national hatreds. Who was responsible for the dangerous stockpiling of the gunpowder in such a manner  It seems just too easy to blame a disgruntled servant. Even later, when writing up this period, religious and political loyalties influenced interpretation.If Edward Paris really did venture down to the vaults of Dunglass Castle on that fateful day, with the intention of committing suicide in order to kill his master, along with dozens of others, then he must have been infected with a deep hatred, as well as a total disregard for the lives of his fellow servants and his own.The truth is we will never know what really happened. But Edward Paris is a servant whose name we know. Countless numbers of so-called lsquocommon servantsrsquo whose lives and fates are deemed unimportant by history remain unrecorded just as the things they witnessed remain absent from our history books.Irsquove often thought it would be fascinating to meet Edwardrsquos ghost and ask him what really happened on that day.Silly idea, of course, but you never know."},{"url":null,"title":"public-exhibition-held-plans-revive-dunbars-east-beach","story":"Dunbarrsquos East Beach, which hosts the townrsquos annual Loony Dook, was once a magnet for tourists but the disappearance of its golden sands over the years due to coastal erosion has led to fewer visitors.East Lothian Council has already been given permission for the first phase of work on the beach, which it is hoped will help sandwhile also protecting the shore.A public exhibition detailing plans for a second phase of work ndash and the project overall ndash takes place in Dunbarrsquos Bleachingfield Centre on Monday afternoon.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, explained the desire to see the beach restored to how it was previously.She said: ldquoIt has been a long-held ambition.ldquoPeople reminisce about how wonderful the beach was and there has been a lot of disappointment that it has been so rocky for so long.Dave Northcott, East Lothian Council structural engineer and project leader, visited the community council shortly before Christmas to outline the plans.Consent is already in place for the construction of a breakwater at the southern end of East Beach.Refurbishment of the existing groyne at the same end of the beach has also been approved, alongside the placement of rock armour at the toe of the seawall. A marine licence is in place until the end of May, with work to be complete before then.At the same time, plans are being drawn up for a second phase of work, which would see the creation of a breakwater at the northern end of the beach.A marine licence will be needed for that piece of work, with the hope that could be in place before the end of May to allow work to simply continue from the first phase.If that is not possible, the contractor will leave the site andat a later date to construct the northern breakwater.Mrs Swan, who is also chairwoman of Dunbar Shore and Harbour Neighbourhood Group, encouraged people to head along to the public exhibition, which takes place between pm and pm.Those in attendance can speak to the consultants and East Lothian Council about the plans.Mrs Swan added: ldquoI think it is really, really important for people to come to the exhibition for two reasons.ldquoOne is to understand the thinking that has gone into the regeneration project and the other one is to become aware of the impact it might have on them during the construction weeks because it is going to be at least six weeks and it could run into months.ldquoThe nature of the breakwater is they are built of huge rocks, between three and six tonnes, and they are all coming from the quarry at Markle.

He was said to have been martyred at sea with an anchor round his neck and was therefore regarded as the patron saint of sailors. The cult of Clement spread to Scandinavia in about the th century and then to Britain.ldquoSt Clements Wells were probably named by Scandinavians living in the Tranent area.ldquoWe know they were here because of the presence of a powerful landholder of likely Scandinavian descent, Thor of Tranent, son of Swain, who is mentioned in many th-century charters. He held extensive lands in the area and granted the church of Tranent to Holyrood Abbey.Mr Hadden said: ldquoI am sure the new stone sculptures will add another piece of culture to our area when in place to the east and west sides of Wallyford alongside those we have already.ldquoThese include the mining memorial stone and coal hutches located at St Clements Housing estate just off Salters Road, the  mining stones at the Wallyford Bing, a community woodland depicting dferent mining scenes, and also the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh memorial at the west side of Wallyford.The shapes and patterns proposed relate to the themes of the wells, water, ripples, distilling, agriculture and the sense of space and open skies of the site as it is now.

Christmas time had been dficult because it was the first Christmas without her granny, who had died earlier in the year. But now she was back at school and into the routine with her friends.Her parents had hoped this would help, but her sense of loss was still overwhelming for her. Perhaps at her age she didnrsquot understand exactly what was going on inside, but all she knew was that her granny shersquod loved was gone and she missed her.Then one evening during a bedtime story, Jessica started to cry and told her dad that her granny was melting like a snowman. At first he wasnrsquot sure what she meant, but then he understood.Jessicarsquos memory of her granny was fading. This was a second loss for her. The first loss was of her grannyrsquos physical presence, her actual hugs, her voice and care and love, even the smell of her perfume. Now Jessica was losing her memory of all this and she knew it. So she felt that something inside her was melting too, something that had been so much of her was vanishing.And this made Jessica fear that others in her le could disappear and then melt away as well, even her dad or mum. It was a terrying thought and it made her not just sad but scared and insecure inside.Her dad tried to reassure her that he or her mum werenrsquot going to die, but despite being only six years old, Jessica now knew that such promises couldnrsquot be kept forever.ldquoNana didnrsquot want to die either, but she did.

So they didnrsquot go.But later that day, Jessica began to talk about Nanarsquos seat. ldquoShe always gave me sweeties and wersquod look for whales and pirates. She told me a story about how a pirate once landed here at Prestonpans, but he didnrsquot leave treasure, he just built the town.ldquoGreat story, said her dad.The next day, Jessica agreed to go to her nanarsquos seat. When they arrived, she hesitated to sit and had a wave of emotion.ldquoI miss Nana, she saidldquoSo do I. Shall we sit on her seat and miss her together.ldquoBut we have to eat sweeties.ldquoJust so happens Irsquove got some in my pocket, said the dad with a smile. His daughter smiled back and sat on the seat. Her dad joined her.ldquoNo, dad, that was Nanarsquos place, you sit this side instead.And so they sat, missing Nana together, being sad together, but also remembering her together.ldquoCan you tell me the story about the pirate  asked the dad.ldquoDonrsquot want to.ldquoOK, maybe next time.The next day, they ed to Nanarsquos seat. This time, Jessica told a bit of the pirate story. The dad remembered it from his childhood and realised that his own grief in losing his mother had closed him down to talking about her.

And, when the women speakers pointed out the irony and injustice of this set-up  Calm down dear, yoursquore getting hysterical.Question Time provided perhaps the most eye-watering example of this when actor Lawrence Fox - who had been invited to sit in the ldquovoice of the people chair - unleashed a shocking but very revealing attack on a mixed-race member of the audience who suggested Meghan Marklersquos treatment by the media and others had been racist.:The curse of the House of Windsor: how love has torn apart the royal familyMr Fox, a Harrow-educated member of an established acting dynasty known for his role in the detective series Lewis, tore into the woman - who it turns out is an academic researcher in race and ethnicity - talking over her, aggressively calling the suggestion of racism ldquoboring, adding imperiously: ldquoWersquore the mostly tolerant, lovely country in the world.\" The actor compounded matters by using the tired and predictable ldquoyoursquore the racist defence when quite reasonably questioned on how a spfing white chap like him could be so sure about what racism is and is not.:Netflix chief confirms interest in deal with Harry and MeghanI donrsquot doubt that from Mr Foxrsquos privileged perch, Britain is indeed tolerant and lovely.

Whatrsquos going on  We simply wouldnrsquot have tolerated such behaviour in public  years ago.But with Boris Johnson in Number , a man who defends his writings about ldquopiccaninnies with ldquowater melon smiles, ldquobum boys ldquogirly swats and how voting Tory will ldquogive your we bigger breasts, I suppose such behaviour has both permission and a champion.Make no mistake, the faction of the Tory party that has taken over Britain in the wake of Brexit will revel in and stoke culture wars of this kind. It feels threatened by attacks on pale, male stale dominance, of course.

But Scotland could still offer the national income of Portugal with the population of Slovakia.:Nicola Sturgeon to set out plan for Scottish independence referendum next weekSo, we can forget the  nonsense about going to the end of the queue or being blocked by Spain. There is now a reservoir of goodwill, especially in the European Parliament, following Scotlandrsquos determined resistance to Brexit. Wersquod be back in, probably within - years according to Kirsty Hughes of the Scottish Centre on European Relations.However, there is one small problem. Scotland would have to be fully independent first. Unless Scotland has a referendum in this transition year there is no longer any prospect of Scotland, as it were, remaining in the European Union as rUK leaves. We may still be under the same regulatory environment as Europe in the transition period, but donrsquot think that can just be extended as in Northern Ireland.Mentioning the Irish backstop is not the way to get a sympathetic hearing in the European Union. Many states are unhappy about Northern Ireland being allowed to remain, effectively, in the European single market without being part of the EU or the EEA.It breaks all the rules. And Scotland can forget about being given similar treatment. Speaking to Brussels officials this week confirms that there will be no read-across to Scotland from the Northern Ireland protocol. They wonrsquot even discuss it.So, there is no half way house. Scotland needs to take the leap into full independence. That means having a central bank and an autonomous currency before Scotland could become a candidate for accession. There are two problems here, but they arenrsquot insurmountable.Scotland would have to formally agree to the Maastricht Treaty, and membership of the euro. It is most unlikely that Scotland would get a formal opt-out from the euro, but it could drag its feet for a very long time, like Sweden. Whether Scotland would want to is another matter. Euro membership has worked well for many small countries.A more dficult issue is convergence. Scotland would have to show that its economy meets the terms of the stability pact, which means having a deficit of less than three per cent. At present, according to the GERS figures, Scotland has a deficit of more than twice that.However, after independence these numbers would almost certainly change. There will be a lot of fiscal give and take between Scotland and the rest of the UK over assets and liabilities.But Scotland would have to show that it is capable of harnessing its currency to the euro, evenit doesnrsquot actually join it. Currency autonomy might be hard to establish , as in the Scottish Governmentrsquos scenario, Scotland keeps using the pound for a decade after independence.: In post-Brexit Britain, Nicola Sturgeon cant keep telling her troops that Indyref is round the corner. It isntIf a nominally independent Scotland were still subject to interest rates operating in a country that is outside the European Union, that would be a dficult sell. The EU is very good at finding novel ways to get round problems like this. But it might take a few years.There may be a trade deal on regulations between the UK and the EU that solves some of Scotlandrsquos accession and border problems. We just donrsquot know. This is one of the imponderables of Scottish independence. It is actually very dficult to make a clear prospectus for indyref when we donrsquot yet know how the UK is going to stand in relation to the EU.But there is a bigger question than all of these: would Scotland necessarily want to rejoin the European Union  Nicola Sturgeon takes it as read, but there would be a debate at the very least. Around a million Scots voted for Brexit and many of them were supporters of independence.Brussels has had some bad press in the last decade. Austerity policies were imposed after  which were worse than in the UK and caused problems across the Mediterranean states. Its behaviour toward Greece during the sovereign debt crisis would have shamed the British Empire at its worst.Brussels stood idly by while one member state, Spain, imposed draconian repression in Catalonia, breaking heads and locking up elected politicians. There was scarcely a word from Brussels, let alone sanctions. Then there is fish.Many in the independence movement believe the EU is a neoliberal club ndash which it is ndash and would be happier with an arrangement like Norwayrsquos which has control of fishing grounds, is not subject to EU rules and has a managed economy. The case for a referendum before Scotland rejoined the EU would seem to me to be unanswerable.At the very least, the SNP could not take it for granted. Unionists will continue to argue that it makes little economic sense for Scotland to leave the Union with the UK, which is where the majority of Scottish exports go. There would be a hard border, currency controls, possibly tarfs.Ms Sturgeonrsquos problem is that the very arguments the SNP used against leaving the European Union ndash freedom of movement, zero tarfs, regulatory harmony ndash apply equally to leaving the United Kingdom. Theyrsquoll come winging back. Aversion to Boris Johnson may not be enough to persuade Scots to take the biggest leap in  years.Read more: Sturgeon cant keep telling her troops that Indyref is round the corner"},{"url":null,"title":"right-call-time-mistakes-past","story":"If you want to be truly up to the minute on the decorating front, how about putting the head of an ldquoold, white man with reactionary views above the fireplace The description comes from a film critic for the German paper Tagesspiegel, reacting to the news that the British actor Jeremy Irons has been made president of the Berlin Film Festivalrsquos international jury.Irons is the latest high profile figure to finds his past comments chasing him like The Mummy in a old horror film.On women, Irons is on record as telling the Radio Times: ldquoIf a man puts his hand on a womanrsquos bottom, any woman worth her salt can deal with it. Itrsquos communication. Canrsquot we be friendly :Alison Rowat: I spy with my little eye, an excitable Tennant gushing about the jungleThen there was another comment, this time to the Huffington Post, about gay marriage. Could a father not marry his son to dodge inheritance tax, Irons mused to the interviewer.The quotes unearthed, commentators rush to criticise the appointment, saying it sent the wrong message at a moment when the film festival, like the industry as a whole, was trying to reinvent itself.One observer said: ldquoIf [the festival] really cared about the necessary change in the film industry, they would not have chosen a jury chairman who has played down sexual harassment in the past, but a person who fights with determination for a non-violent and equal industry and world.Should Irons find himself promptly uninvitedhe could be a candidate for the ldquoold white man with reactionary views gallery.In recent months the place has been filling up fast. Before Irons, there was a push to have director Terry Gilliamrsquos head stuffed and stuck on the wall for telling The Independent that he was tired, ldquoas a white male of being blamed for everything that is wrong with the world. ldquoI didnrsquot do it! he pleaded.Another frequent resident of the trophy room is John Cleese, who has not said anything controversial for at least two minutes.Then there is Boris Johnson, the first among equals of oldwhite men with reactionary views. He has several claims to a space on the wall.Now, it is a tough gig trying to defend old white men with reactionary views. Poor souls. They have had things all their own way for thousands of years, and suddenly they are out in the cold, unloved, unwanted, called to account.In the case of Irons and Gilliam, it is dficult to understand why anyone would take the thoughts of actors and others in the entertainment industries seriously enough to be upset by them. These are people who play dress up for a living, and they get paid rather a lot for it .In the case of Irons, though, the plea in mitigation is not that hard to frame. The comments he has been slated for were made nine and seven years ago respectively.So what, you might think, they are still offensive. But the crucial dference here is that Irons has acknowledged he was a pillock , at least in the case of his comments on gay marriage, and moved on. As the row over the Berlin Festival shows, not everyone is prepared to do the same.Irons finds himself scolded because of our inability or unwillingness to leave a persons past behind, and our suspicion of those who change.:Alison Rowat: Chris has no easy answers about our crowded worldActors are particularly at risk of being lashed with old quotes because every time they are in something they have to publicise it. That means singing for their supper with interviews. If they are not to be insufferably boring or po-faced, which does not work either, they relax and go with the conversational flow.The industryrsquos classiest interview acts, the Helen Mirrens and Julie Walters and Roger Allams of the world, know this. They are perfectly capable, just like most non-actors, of chatting for  minutes without causing offence.Previously, only those who found themselves in the public eye had cuttings files. Now anyone who uses social media has a digital folder to lug around. Comments, photos, your past and present self is out there, and accessible at the click of a mouse. It is too late to close the box now.Knowing this, you might think people would be more forgiving and understanding of mistakes, butanything they are more condemnatory. Have evidence, will judge. Should people be allowed to draw a line under a comment  Cant there be a statute of limitations on being a numptie It depends. Politicians used to steer clear of digging up anything that happened before the age of , which seems reasonable.After that, it depends on what has been said, how recently, and how relevant it is to your current position. Some sentiments are stone cold wrong whenever they are expressed. See several of Boris Johnsonrsquos comments.He has dismissed these as just one of those things that happen when you write columns. They are not. Crucially, he has never said that he was wrong, which is reason enough to keep his head on the wall.By not having a statute of limitations on being a pillock we are saying that people are incapable of changing. What a dull, judgmental world it would bewe were to condemn people for ever and a day, despite, as in Ironsrsquo case, acknowledging that they were wrong.:The Andrew Marr Show reviewOne of the best things about the human species is its capacity for change. We need to believe that people can be better, can change their views and habits, otherwise we are all in trouble.As for Irons, he has done a pretty good job for the Berlin Film Festivalfor no other reason than people are talking about his association with it.Time, in this case, to forgive, forget and enjoy the movies."},{"url":null,"title":"loganair-backs-plan-central-air-control-system","story":"Western Isles Council, a union and politicians have all hit out Highlands and Islands Airports Ltdrsquos plan.The move involves Sumburgh, Dundee, Inverness, Kirkwall and Stornoway.But Loganair has now supported the decision to centralise air traffic control systems.In a statement, Jonathan Hinkles, Loganairrsquos chief executive, said:The upgrade to air traffic systems at Hial airports will be a signicant step forward in the islandsrsquo infrastructure.ldquoThe new technology will provide additional safety protections versus those available with the current systems based on technology and procedures dating back several decades, and these will also help to reduce flight times and consequently reduce carbon emissions. From a safety and operational perspective, we welcome the developments.But he added:The key questions to be addressed are around the economic impact of the removal of jobs from the island communities and how it will be ensured that the transition can be achieved given that the current ATC units will need to be fully manned right up to the day of transition to the new systems.ldquoIn a world where air traffic controllers are amongst many groups facing skills shortages, this is a signicant challenge that should not be underestimated.Hial said the change, which would be phased in, would modernise air traffic control.But the union Prospect said the plan puts  jobs at risk and described it as ldquopoorly thought through.Unmanned towers would feed information to a new combined surveillance centre at New Century House in Inverness.The building near the Kessock Bridge at Inverness is currently the offices of Highland News and Media, publishers of the Inverness Courier newspaper.The change would be phased in over the next few years, but Prospect understands it could be  before it takes effect at Dundee due to the complexity of the air space there.Comhairle nan Eilean Siarsaid that the project would see Benbecula downgraded to an Aerodrome Flight Information Serviceresulting in a loss of jobs and an inability to grow air services in Benbecula.ldquoTogether with a loss of jobs at Stornoway as a result of centralizing air control services in Inverness, there could be a loss of up to  jobs in the Islands, a signicant number of skilled jobs in an Island location, said the council.Uisdean Robertson, Chair of Transportation and Infrastructure, added: ldquoIt seems to me that Hial are looking at Stornoway and Benbecula Airports as burdens rather than assets. They are intent on running them down with the resultant loss of employment.ldquoThis displays an incredible lack of ambition for the future of air services to and from the Islands. We should be looking at how these assets can be grown and developed to best serve the communities of the Islands.ldquoI will be calling upon Ministers to ensure that agencies like Hial grow their staff headcount in our islands not remove valuable jobs and families from our communities.Councillor Robertson also highlighted that safety and resilience were at risk of being comprised under the proposed measures for centralization.ldquoOur communities have extreme transport challenges ahead. Our ferry services have deteriorated because of ill thought through decision making made by mainland based management.

It represents something quite unsettling in society: the desire by adults to retreat into a world of childish preoccupations. The show began in South Korea in  and has swept the world with TV franchises across the globe.Adults have always enjoyed some flicker of childhood remaining in their lives. Whether itrsquos grown men playing with train sets, or families in the s watching Itrsquos a Knockout, or women dressing up like pink princesses on a hen night, or Generation Xers like me still playing computer games, the adult world has always contained a memory of childhood. Thatrsquos fine and good. We need to retain a little childhood silliness to stave off the calcication of the soul that accompanies being an adult.But over the last few decades, itrsquos sometimes seemed asthe adult world is more childlike than fully grown. It may have started with JK Rowling. Now donrsquot get me wrong, therersquos much to admire about Rowling. I adored reading her books to my children. She turned an entire generation into bookworms. God bless her for that, and I applaud her literary success.But in the late s, when I started to look up from my train seat and see grown men and women reading Harry Potter books, I despaired. I wasnrsquot expecting them all to be reading Crime and Punishment, but a book for an adult might have been nice. What were they doing retreating into a world of boy wizards and spells  If they wanted fantasy, therersquos plenty of adult fantasy out there.But it was cosiness they were craving. That was the key. They wanted comfort and safety ndash culture, art, literature, which did not challenge or threaten. They wanted childhoodrsquos comfort blanket.Then came the superhero movies ndash the endless, repetitive superhero movies. I should like these films. I grew up reading comics. But I hate the sight of superhero films today. Superheroes were for my childhood. I have no more need for superheroes and comics, than I have for a BMX and bunny hops in the park.Thatrsquos not to say there are no decent superhero movies ndash there are, though many also share the day-glo genetics of The Masked Singer, and are one endless round of jumping, punching, screeching, and bedazzling. I felt  percentage points of my IQ drop when I watched Thor.What Irsquom going to say next will get me burned as a heretic, but to hell with it, Irsquove gone this far. The same goes for Doctor Who. I loved it as a child, but I see no point in it for me as an adult.Itrsquos not that consuming any of these shows is ldquowrong as an adult. If you like to tune into The Masked Singer, or a superhero film, or the Doctor, thatrsquos fine with me. I watch crappy reality shows to switch off and unwind. Itrsquos the proleration and domination of these infantilising programmes which worries me.

It can take one big vessel and possibly a small vessel. But in my opinion, we could not facilitate to build two vessels that size so close together because the ground wasnrsquot sufficient enough.He said there was a plan, which he called ldquofine in concept, to build one hull on the slipway then launch it to make way for the completion of a second partly-built hull, but it didnrsquot work.The hulls were called  and .Mr Logan went on: ldquoWe started the  hull and it was moved to the side towards the castle side, and it was all kind of soft ground.ldquoIf you started putting hundreds of tons of units on that then itrsquos going to sink. It wasnrsquot sustainable to do that.ldquoFor the build schedule we had, we couldnrsquot have done it because it would come to a complete standstill on  while  was prepared for launch.He claimed said staff concerns had been dismissed by managers.He said: ldquoItrsquos plain to see ndash the size of the vessels that they were building, and the breadth of them on the berth, that the two vessels werenrsquot going to [fit].ldquoWe needed a mobile crane to go down in between them, and the space as you started building the two together, there wasnrsquot enough space.Askedthe workforce had warned managers about the looming problem, Mr Logan said: ldquoThe management team said they didnrsquot like our negativity.He also said managers caused problems by hiring agency workers to cope with the contract who arrived earlier on site than full-time staff and commandeered vital machinery.He said that left skilled welders with little work bar sweeping up.Mr Logan said design changes had been made ldquoconstantly and there was still not a finalised design for the boats.Without it, the work was ldquolike building a jigsaw when yoursquove got missing parts. Yoursquore never going to complete it.Mr Logan said CMAL and Ferguson managers ldquocame to loggerheads.He said: ldquoThey wouldnrsquot agree on the design so we couldnrsquot move forward, so it just came to a standstill.

For poundm we have got two-half finished hulks and a lot of red faced officials.ldquoThe Scottish Government need to come clean on what due diligence was done before a contract worth tens of millions was dished out.ldquoRight now there is no evidence that any lessons have been learned or that a nationalised shipyard will be run efficiently and effectively. This needs to be rapidly addressed.The SNP tried to distract from the criticism by criticising the committeersquos Tory chair Edward Mountain for askingHyundai in South Korea could have built the vessels quicker instead.Mr Hair said they indeed could have done it in under five years.Inverclyde SNP MSP Stuart McMillan said: ldquoThe Tories have presided over decades of decline in Clyde shipbuilding.

To meet this demand, the number of CABs began to prolerate.The advent of Legal Aid and the NHS led to a surge in enquiries.s: Housing problems continued to grow as people struggled with the housing shortage, overcrowding, and the end of rent controls.Hire purchase promised le on the ‘never-never.’ For many this led to mounting debts.s: Rents were rocketing, yet many people were still living in slum conditions and homelessness was rising. By  housing problems accounted for a quarter of the . million problems dealt with by CABs across the UK.Divorce reform too led to a surge in enquiries, with family problems representing  per cent of the CAB workload.s: Family, housing and benefit problems remained the top priority, but the consumer boom saw personal debt soar too. Industrial change saw an increase in redundancies and workers’ rights issues.s: Consumerism brought with it two recessions and debt and benefit cases doubled. Employment enquiries rose by  per cent. But debt, stemming from easy credit, became the biggest CAB issue.s: Social security became the top issue and sharp rises in VAT didn’t help. Repossessions and homelessness increased.-: Payday loans, combined with a lack of affordable housing, caused unprecedented levels of debt. Welfare reform left many families in debt, with Universal Credit generating enormous numbers of enquiries."},{"url":null,"title":"good turnout for wildlife group event","story":"About  people attended the first meeting of the Bailies of Bennachie Wildle group recently.

In January last year, we featured his incredible aim to run  ultramarathons along some of Scotland’s ancient pilgrim routes.The Running Home  challenge combined his two passions – running and his work with charity Embrace the Middle East, for which he is regional manager for Scotland and the north of England.He hoped to raise £, to rebuild war-torn areas of Iraq while covering the  miles, gathering support and funds along the way.While there were times when Mark didn’t think he’d see the finish line, he successfully completed the challenge.He also surpassed his fundraising tally – with £, currently banked.And he’s hopeful that even more funds will be amassed before he travels to Iraq this spring to see it put to good use.Marksaid: “There were occasions when I wanted to go home.“I knew,I was to quit, I was going home to a nice, comfortable house. The people I was running for don’t have that option.“That was a monumental reason to keep going.”Mark had extraordinary support along the way, not least from his crew – Gareth Brocklebank and Andrew Clarke – who followed him in a camper van, which also acted as shelter in areas where overnight BB stays were not an option.Mark’s we Karen and his two daughters also cheered him every step of the way as did many strangers.“People welcomed me into their churches and communities and generously donated large sums of money,” he said.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.hawick-news webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Hands-on...Superintendent Sharon Comriehas worked for the SSPCA for an incredible  years.

I was feeling great but, within ten minutes, a niggle turned into barely being able to walk.“I had to find a couple of sticks from the woods to use as shin splints.”However, it was an earlier, shorter run – St Cuthbert’s in March – which cost Mark a full day and also taught him a very valuable lesson.“I wanted to run from Melrose to Lindisfarne, where I planned to stay overnight, but I had to be there for a certain time due to the tide restrictions.“I got lost early on and was chasing my tail for the rest of the day. I started pushing really hard and ended up lost in the hills for  minutes, with no water, torchlight or phone charge.“I rushed checkpoints and didn’t take the time to check my kit properly.“I was dehydrated, didn’t stay on Lindisfarne and lost a whole day because of it.“It taught me a very good lesson – that I couldn’t do it alone and that these runs were pilgrimages, not races.“I had my tail between my legs the next couple of days but the reception at Durham Cathedral reminded me of what I was doing and why.”Mark enjoyed a similar reception at the Forth Bridges, where supporters and family joined forces to cheer him on before he reached the finish line in St Andrews on November .The following day, he addressed parishioners in St Leonard’s Church.It was the perfect place to end Running Home as St Andrews was once such a centre of pilgrimage.Mark took a breather to enjoy Christmas and New Year but has a busy  planned.He added: “I’m heading to Iraq in the spring to see how the money is being spent.“I also plan to revisit some of the places and people I met this year, by car though!“I passed through a lot of villages that were torched in the Highland Clearances.“People were forced out of their homes, and in some cases country, so there’s a sense of solidarity there with today’s refugees.“I was conscious of not being able to spend much time in places where I got a great deal of support.“So I’m hoping to revisit some of those communities, combining storytelling and traditional folk music to consolidate the friendships I made this year.”Karen is not keen for Mark to pull his running shoes back on too soon, but he will be taking on the York Marathon in October.

Currently, it supports communities in northern Iraq, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Egypt and Syria. Mark said: “Our focus is enabling people to rebuild their livelihoods. We do that by offering skills training in everything from computer skills to bee keeping. That one struck me as odd but it turns out everyone loves honey!“Embrace the Middle East also supports intercommunal peace building. The charity is led by local partners and shows how changes, big and small, can make a dference.”While many Iraqi citizens have chosen not toto their homeland, Embrace is there to help those who do.Mark added: “Their homes and agricultural land have been damaged. Our focus is future-proofing their ability to stay in their communities.“We’re not an NGO which is there for a short-term fix – we are there for the long term.”As well as working for Embrace the Middle East three days a week, Mark is an honorary fellow at Aberdeen University and has also taught social sciences at Stirling and Durham Universities."},{"url":null,"title":"these are the 20 most popular baby girl and boy names in the world","story":"Your name forms part of your identity for the rest of your le, so choosing a moniker for your newborn can be a tough decision.title\"Share on Facebook\"class\"article-sharetool__facebook\" id\"sharetool_facebook\"href\"https:www.facebook sharer sharer.php uhttps%A%F%Fwww.inverurieherald%Fnews%Fpeople%Fthese-are-the--most-popular-baby-girl-and-boy-names-in-the-world--\"target\"_blank\"data-provider\"facebook\"data-base-share-url\"https:www.facebook sharer sharer.php u\"data-window-\"\"data-window-width\"\"data-url-to-share\"https:www.inverurieherald news people these-are-the--most-popular-baby-girl-and-boy-names-in-the-world--\"xml:space\"preserve\" xmlns\"http:www.w.org  svg\" xmlns:xlink\"http:www.w.org  xlink\"l.-.c-.,.-.,.-.h.V.h-.c-.,-.,.-.,.v.h-.v.h.V.z M,C.,,,.,,C,.,.,,,s,.,,C,.,.,,,z\" style\"fill-rule:evenoddclip-rule:evenoddfill:#AB\"  width\"\" \"\" viewBox\"  . .\" style\"enable-background:new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c-.,.-.,.-.l.-.V.C.,.,.,,.,C.,,.,.,.,.v.H.v.h.v.H.z\"  title\"Share on Twitter\"class\"article-sharetool__twitter\"id\"sharetool_twitter\"href\"https:twitter intent tweet textThese+are+the++most+popular+baby+girl+and+boy+names+in+the+worldurlhttps%A%F%Fwww.inverurieherald%Fnews%Fpeople%Fthese-are-the--most-popular-baby-girl-and-boy-names-in-the-world--\"target\"_blank\"data-provider\"twitter\"data-base-share-url\"https:twitter intent tweet text\"data-window-\"\"data-window-width\"\"data-tweet-text\"These are the  most popular baby girl and boy names in the world\"data-share-link\"https:www.inverurieherald news people these-are-the--most-popular-baby-girl-and-boy-names-in-the-world--\" xmlns:xlink\"http:www.w.org  xlink\"l.,.l-.-.c-.-.-.-.-.-.l-.-.l-.,.c-.,.-.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.-.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,.,.l.,.l-.,.c-.,-.,.-.,.c.,.,.,.,.,.l.,.l-.,.c-.,.-.,.-.,.C.,.,,.,,.c,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,.-.c.-.,.-,.-.c.-.,.-.,.-.c-.,.-.,.-.c.-.,.-.,.-.c.-.,.-.-.-.c-.,.-.,.-.-.c.-.,.-.,.-.c-.-.,.-.,.c-.,.-.,.-.,.l-.,.l-.-.c-.-.-.-.-.-.C.,.,.,.,.,.z M,C.,,,.,,C,.,.,,,s,.,,C,.,.,,,z\"  width\"\" \"\" viewBox\"   \" style\"enable-background:new    \" xml:space\"preserve\"c-.,.-.,.-.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.,-.,.-.,.c,.,.,.,.,.C.,.,.,.,.,.c-.,.-.,.-.,.c,.,.,.,.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.v.c,.,.,.,.,.c-.,.-.,.-.,.c-.,-.-.-.-.c.,.,.,.,.,.c-.,.-.,.-.,.c-.,-.-.-.-.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,,.-.,.-.l-.-.C.,.,.,.,,.z\" title\"Share via email\"class\"article-sharetool__email\"id\"sharetool_email\"href\"mailto: subjectThese are the  most popular baby girl and boy names in the worldbodyhttps:www.inverurieherald news people these-are-the--most-popular-baby-girl-and-boy-names-in-the-world--\"data-provider\"email\"data-base-share-url\"mailto: \"data-email-subject\"These are the  most popular baby girl and boy names in the world\"data-email-body\"https:www.inverurieherald news people these-are-the--most-popular-baby-girl-and-boy-names-in-the-world--\"viewBox\"   \" s xml:space\"preserve\"M.,.C.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,.-.c,,,,-.C.,.,.,.,.,.z M.,c.,,.,,.,c-.-.-.-.-.-c,,,.-.,.c-.,.-.,.-.,.c-.,.-.,.-.,c-.-.-.-.-.-.c,,,-.-.C.,.,.,.,.,z M.,c,.,,.,,c.-.,.-.,.-C.,.,.,.,.,z M.,c.,.,.,.,.,c-.,-.,-.C.,.,.,.,.,z\" width\"\" \"\" viewBox\"   \" style\"enable-background:new    \" xml:space\"preserve\"l-l-c.-,.-.,.-.s.-.-.-s--.--.HHz\" L,L,z\" window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substring.article-sharetool.article-sharetool--mobile display: noneTuesday  January  :Claire SchofieldIf you are feeling overwhelmed by choice and need some inspiration, Nameberry has revealed the top baby names that have worldwide appeal.

CLAN receives no statutory money from government bodies, and our services are completely funded by the work we and our supporters do.“In , we saw a % increase in the number of people who came to us for support, and so we need even more people to join us in fundraising.“The group that went to China in October had the adventure of a letime and the money they raised will go towards providing wellbeing support and services for people affected by cancer across the north-east.“Taking part in a challenge such as the Great Wall of China can be daunting so we are delighted to welcome the team from Global Adventures and some of ’s participants who I know will share their enthusiasm and help build excitement for the  trek.”For more information please contact fundraising@clanhouse.org or visit the CLAN website.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Ellon Primary School pupils with the cooking team and their special guests at the kitchen opening event\"  School celebrates new kitchen viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"January ,  at : amOfficers from Police Scotland’s cybercrime prevention team will be running an event for parents and carers tonight, to help raise awareness of the most common issues faced by young people online.

While the Government continues to dither, local people will feel the impact as we move from being rule makers to rule takers.“Last week I spoke in the house about the risks that new tarfs and trade barriers could have for businesses in the Northern Isles. Food and drink production are a staple part of the isles economy. The impact that continued and intensied tarfs could have on rural communities is signicant and organisations such as the SWA are understandably concerned.“This could be just a taste of what is to come as we leave the EU and our economic clout is reduced. If there were any doubt about the limits of our leverage in future trade negotiations with the US, this is a reminder of the precarious position that the Government is putting us in.“I will be writing to the Secretary of State for International Trade to explain what efforts they are making on these tarfs as a matter of urgency. With the UK losing our seat at the table in these trade talks at the end of this month, the next two weeks are crucial. We must give a voice to our local producers in these trade talks while we still can.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While HIAL has gone through the motions of consulting, having clearly failed to take on board any of the concerns raised, it is dficult to see what purpose this has served.“Since the announcement last week, I have been in discussions with local ATC staff who feel badly let down by HIAL.  Nobody disputes the need for modernisation, but even HIAL’s own consultants concluded that the remote tower model was the most costly and risky option. Alternatives were identied that could have delivered the improvements needed at a fraction of the cost.“While I welcome that HIAL is to carry out an island impact assessment, given its approach to consultation so far, there have to be questions over how robust or independent this assessment will be.#In the meantime, ministers must wake up to the scale of opposition and dissatisfaction amongst HIAL’s ATC staff. They should also recognise the clear threat this poses to delivery of leline air services in Orkney and across the Highlands  Islandsstaff choose to vote with their feet. That alone should give Ministers pause for thought and allow more time for alternative options to be explored”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The most dramatic step taken by the Scottish Government to date has been the introduction of minimum unit pricing for alcohol, a controversial measure but one which was credited with a . per cent fall in shop sales, according to a study published in the BMJ journal.However, while a minimum price is a way of using market forces to improve our nation’s health, it was never going to be the solution all by itself. What is also required is a broad change in attitudes towards alcohol within society. Too many young people still appear to think that getting drunk is a good idea and underage drinking is a serious problem.: Scottish tourist town calls for ‘boozed up teenagers’ to be banned from celebrating Hogmanay: Minimum unit pricing has cut Scots alcohol spendingEven in the Borders town of Melrose, there are no calls for teenagers to be banned from celebrating Hogmanay because their “intimidating” drunken behaviour is so bad that it is putting off tourists.A new study, based on interviews with  youths aged  to  who drink alcohol, found that there had been no impact of minimum pricing on their consumption. While this is a small number of people on which to draw conclusions about behaviour on a national scale, the research, as Alcohol Focus Scotland said, should be “concerning”. “The apparent ease with which these young people are able to acquire alcohol raises serious questions about enforcement of existing licensing legislation and age-verication arrangements which are there to protect young people,” said the group’s Alison Douglas.There are some who will regard any government interference with our drinking habits as an infringement on civil liberties by a ‘nanny state’. As ever, the trick is to find the balance between helping people do what they would probably accept is the right thing and allowing them to make their own decisions. While further state intervention may be required before Scotland learns to drink in a reasonably responsible way, there is a limit to how much politicians can do using legislation and the level of such interference the public will tolerate.However, politicians and other leading figures in society can and should try to bring about a cultural change in how people in Scotland, particularly the young generation, view alcohol.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"reimagined princes street gardens would host 15 major events a year under new business plan","story":"A business plan for the long-awaited Quaich Project would see the redeveloped park used as a catalyst to ldquoreimagine Princes Street and the west end of the city in the next few years.There will be no limit on the number of ticketed events which do not restrict wider access to the gardens in future. The cap only affects concerts and other major events which close off all or part of the park to non ticket-holders during normal opening hours.The business plan, which is due to be discussed by councillors next week, would effectively give the green light for major events like the Summer Sessions pop and rock concerts, the Fly Open Air dance music festival, the cityrsquos festival fireworks finale and the Hogmanay concert in the gardens to continue.The proposed limit on events which restrict public access to the gardens is three times the size of a previous official cap, which has been in place for years. It was effectively relaxed when the council decided to treat an extended series of concerts as one event.The business case also raises the prospect of new medium-sized events being staged in the gardens, such as the ldquoSummer Nights events held in Kelvingrove Park in Glasgow. It is thought there would also be flexibility to accommodate large-scale one-off events involving the likes of the BBC, MTV or the Tour de France.The overall vision for the project, which has been in the planning for five years, is to \"create and sustain a space for all in the heart of the city, celebrating nature, reflection, community and performance.\"Income from all-ticket events would help subsidise the staging of smaller-scale events in the gardens, such as a Pride event, cinema screenings, showcases for buskers, school prom events and light shows.Other new events could include theatre productions, traditional arts and culture events, live music performances, spoken word events and family activities. Under the vision for the future of the park, which dates back to the mid-th century, ldquoevery Edinburgh citizen and visitor to the city will have experienced West Princes Street Gardens and the Quaich Project. Community groups would only pay a nominal fee, which could be as low as £, for the use of the gardens for their events under the new financial model, with the city council handling bookings from event organisers and promoters.It is hoped up to £, a year could be generated from the hiring out of the gardens for events and income from the new two-storey ldquogateway centre, although running costs for the new-look gardens are estimated to come to up to £, in future.The Quaich Project, a public private partnership being pursued by the city council and a trust set up by Apex Hotels founder and former Edinburgh Playhouse owner Norman Springford, would see the run-down Ross Bandstand, which opened in , replaced by a ldquoHobbit House-style pavilion for performances and an amphitheatre instead of the existing concrete bowl.A two-storey complex featuring a visitor centre, cafe and corporate hospitality facilities would offer direct access from Princes Street and boast spectacular views of events below Edinburgh Castle. The business plan has been published ahead of detailed designs for the revamp of the park being submitted to the council in the spring. A key aim is to deliver ldquoa balanced programme of activities ranging from small scale community events  learning programmes to festivals and major events throughout the year, befitting a capital city, world class visitor destination and much-loved public lsquogarden.rsquoIt states: ldquoWe will curate the use of spaces and activities throughout West Princes Street Gardens to enable a primary focus on community events which reflect the nature of the spaces involved.\"These include school and family events, lectures and talks, garden and nature tours, traditional art and culture, live music and theatre, heritage and historical programmes. The new facility will be offered at low cost for community groups and schools.ldquoWe will also procure and programme a specic number of major events which will provide high profile and high-income streams to create the affordability to community groups.ldquoWe will promote and market the project to a wide range of community bodies, schools and colleges, event and festival organisers to ensure that a healthy balance exists to enable an active yet tranquil and accessible space across the year.It is hoped that the impact of the Quaich Project will help the west end of the city withstand the impact of the new St James development, which is due to open later this year. Work is also due to be finished within months on a new Johnnie Walker visitor centre in the former House of Fraser department store, while there are plans to turn the former Royal Overseas league building opposite the bandstand into a hotel.The blueprint states: ldquoSitting in the heart of Scotlandrsquos capital, the Quaich Project offers a unique  for promoting a wide iety of activity in a spectacular setting, underpinned by a core aim of providing a mix of events and activities that fulfil our mission.ldquoIt also offers a catalyst for the re-imagining of Princes Street and its environs. With the opening of the new St James Centre and the refocusing of retail activity to the eastern end of the city centre, the project has the potential to drive the context of the area ndash cultural, social, wellbeing and environmental themes dominating a space currently occupied by buses and shops.In his report for next weekrsquos culture committee, place director Paul Lawrence states: ldquoThe completion of the refurbishment and development of West Princes Street Gardens in general, and the redevelopment of the Ross Pavilion and the construction of the associated gateway building in particular, is to the benefit of residents, visitors, event organisers and festivals, and Edinburghrsquos reputation.Donald Wilson, the city councilrsquos culture chief, said: ldquoThis is a very important stage in the project to reimagine West Princes Street Gardens.ldquoThe core focus for the business model is on community access and activity by creating and sustaining a space for all in the heart of the city, celebrating nature, reflection, community and performance.ldquoThis is a model where big events that involve exclusive access to the gardens are kept to a minimum, but these will make it possible to offer low cost rental of spaces to community or charitable organisations. Crucially, it proposes no more event days than we have at present.ldquoWest Princes Street Gardens are open almost every day of the year, with early closure for events, mainly in the evenings, amounting to less than % of normal opening times. It is estimated that within the new operating model this would continue.ldquoThe proposed new access route behind the pavilion is estimated to reduce event set up and takedown times by at least  per cent, thus reducing the impact on the gardens.David Ellis, managing director of the Quaich Project, said: ldquoOur vision is to improve the entirety of the gardens with a focus on making them a more enjoyable and accessible place for the benefit of Edinburgh residents and visitors all year round. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"senior labour msp scottish independence referendum should be decided by holyrood","story":"In a major break from party policy Mr Rowley, who sits in the Scottish Partys shadow cabinet, says that the \"option of the [referendum] power sitting in the Scottish Parliament... is worth serious consideration\".Currently the power to hold a referendum has to be transferred by a Section  Order from Westminster to Holyrood. It is this order which Boris Johnson has refused to grant despite demands by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon that the general election result gave the SNP a mandate to hold indyref.A former deputy leader of Scottish Labour, Mr Rowley has long been an advocate for \"home rule\" - a position recently touted by his partys leader Richard Leonard - and has now produced a pamphlet discussing his views on independence and a second referendum.: Senior Scots Labour figures come out in favour of independence referendumHe says that Scottish Labour needs to erge from the unionism of the Conservatives and the \"illiberal\" Liberal Democrats, that it is \"the sovereign right of the Scottish people\" to decide the countrys future, but stops short of backing independence.Mr Rowley is the second senior Scottish Labour member to push for a change in the partys policy on a second independence referendum. Shadow health spokeswoman Monica Lennon has also said the \"future of Scotland must be decided by the people of Scotland\".His idea of \"home rule\", he says, would result in further substantial powers being devolved to Holyrood - leaving areas such as macroeconomics, defence and foreign policy in Westminster. The whole issue, he says, should be put to members of the Scottish Labour Party and not decided by a \"small band of MSPs\".Mr Rowley writes: \"There are some within the Scottish Labour group who want us to rule out any referendum for the foreseeable future. This would put us alongside the Tories and illiberal Liberals and would play direct into the hands of Nicola Sturgeon.\"He also says that while he does not believe the Scottish Government has a mandate for another vote, the issue is not one that should be determined by Westminster. \"My own view is that the option of the power sitting in the Scottish Parliament with a requirement of a two-thirds majority to trigger any future referendum is worth serious consideration.\": Euan McColm: Aping the SNP wonrsquot help a Scottish Labour party in declineVotes from  MSPs would be needed to make up two-thirds - meaning pro-union voices would have to be persuaded to supplement the  independence-supporting MSPs from the SNP and Scottish Green Party.However he also claims the First Minister is \"not serious\" about holding another vote this year, a position she has this week stood by despite the Prime Ministers rejection of the powers to hold another referendum.Mr Rowley suggests the SNP was looking to make the  Holyrood election into a vote on Scotlands constitutional future - something he claimed was a \"deliberate deflection tactic\" from the partys record in government.He added: \"We should also be clear that Labour supports the sovereign right of the Scottish people to determine their own future and we should not weaken that position by being caught in this  argument about another referendum.\"Right now in Scotland there is no majority demanding a referendum so let us focus on our vision for Scotland.\"Despite Mr Rowleys apparent sht, SNP deputy leader Keith Brown accused the party of attempting to \"block democracy\". He said: \"Labour always seem desperate to create new schemes and wheezes to block Scottish democracy.\"This latest plan is reminiscent of the infamous % rule in  - where Labour conspired to block a Scottish Assembly despite a majority of Scots voting for one.\"While its welcome that figures in Labour are increasingly realising that Scotlands future must be for the Scottish people to decide, they need to ditch this plan to tie Holyroods hands.\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"loganair jet ran over dropped towbar on landing at southend from aberdeen","story":"They said no damage was caused in the runway incident but such objects \"have the potential to cause serious harm to aircraft\".Metal debris on a runway led to the Concorde crash in Paris in  which killed  people.The incident happened at :pm on  August last year, involving a Loganair Embraer  jet with  passengers and three crew on board. - Scottish fish farm rejected - after campaigners warn fishermen could be lured to their deaths by fairiesThe towbar had been accidentally dropped on the runway  minutes earlier by the solo pilot of a Cessna  light aircraft.He had forgotten he had left it attached to the nose wheel of his plane and it fell off as he took off.The UK Department for Transports air accidents investigation branchsaid he may have been distracted by thinking about nearly colliding with a cyclist who pulled out in front of him as he drove to the airport on his motorbike.The report said as the Loganair planes commander applied the brakes on landing, \"he saw an object on the right of the centre line approximately -m in front of the aircraft.\"He estimated the aircraft was travelling at between  and  knotsat this stage. - Scottish neighbourhood dubbed the Bronx after warring children terrorise residents\"He applied slight left rudder as the object disappeared out of view and felt a small bump through the rudder pedals, but was not surethis was caused by the aircraft clipping the object or running over the centre line.\"The AAIB report said: \"A general aviation towbar was inadvertently left attached to an aircraft because the pilot had been distracted by an earlier stressful event during his journey to the airport.\"The towbar dropped onto the runway during the departure and remained there for approximately  minutes, during which two other aircraft used the runway and a runway inspection was completed.\"A landing aircraft then ran over it.\"The towbar was inconspicuous because it did not have any reflective or other high visibility markings.\"It recommended the Civil Aviation Authority \"communicate to the general aviation community the importance of increasing the visibility of ground equipment\".©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"administration accounts manager with garriocks ","story":"Garriock Bros.

He is in thehot seat this week, speaking to us about his love of music and choosing his top ten tracks - not an easy task by any means.Vincent enjoys a busy family le AND has five children and five grandchildren.He is a finance and property expert, and in his spare time helps out as a quiz master, which keeps him sharp!However music has always been a big part of his le, and he has had an interest in it since he was only a boy.“Music is a passion and something that has followed me since childhood,” explained Vincent.He confesses that his top  favourite songs are constantly changing, so when revealing his list, he decided to focus on a top  that brings back the strongest memories for him throughout his le.At number one is the Beach Boys with ‘God Only knows’.“This was released in  off the incredible Pet Sounds album. “Although I didn’t discover it until my teens, this is an enduring song of beauty.” Number two on his list is ‘The Long and Winding Road’ from The Beatles.He said: “It’s impossible not to have a Beatles track in here. This is just before my time but this song from the  ‘Let it Be’ album is my pick from many contenders.Number three is Love Affair – Everlasting Love. “This is my earliest memory from the  pop classic. “The remake of a ‘ hit for Robert Knight sung by the wonderful Steve Ellis.” The number four spot is reserved for ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’.“Coming up to its th anniversary, my constant favourite song of all time by Simon and Garfunkelis Bridge Over Troubled Waters.” Number five goes to Sam Cooke with ‘Bring it On Home to Me’“What top  couldn’t contain this amazing singer and composer who contributed to the success of Aretha, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and Al Green.” Number six belongs to a Pink Floyd classic.“Probably in the mid ’s my favourite group was Pink Floyd. It was during this period that I began to collect albums.“Dark Side Of The Moon being my first Floyd purchase, however my pick is ‘Wish You Were Here’ off their ‘ album of the same name.”Seventh spot goes to The Eagles. “Sticking my mid ’s periodof music and my infatuation with The Eagles.“I rather quickly acquired their early albums ‘Desperado On The Border One Of These Nights’, however my selection is ‘The Last Resort’ off their th studio album Hotel Calornia.” For eighth spot, Vincent stays with The Eagles.“I’m still in my teenage years and sticking with the Eagles theme, although I’ve moved sideways to select an album I listened to nightly for a couple of years from Jackson Browne.“It was his fourth album and I’ve picked the title track, which is the wonderful ‘The Pretender’. As the list draws to a close, Vincent says: “Running out of room as I juggle with The Four Tops, The Jam, Steely Dan, Stevie, Wonder, Elvis Costello, Al Green, Spencer Davis, The Rolling Stones, George Harrison and OMD.“But I have to stick with my memory theme and at number nine I’ve gone with ‘Supertramp’ which I overplayed at university.“Mainly Crime Of The Century and Breakfast In America and Crisis What Crisis.“My selection is from the latter album and I’ve gone for A Soap Box Opera, it’s orchestral feel just does it to me.”For the last place on his top ten list, Vincent has included a track from the legendary Bruce Springsteen.“I needed Bruce Springsteen in here.“Although how do I pick just one track  Born To Run, The River Nebraska, Born In The USA, The Rising “Again sticking with nostalgia and being a romantic I’ve picked the  ‘Dancing In The Dark’ because it was the year I married Catherine and she’s had to put up with my music ever since!”It’s often hard to think of your favourite  tracks! Vincent admits these “are not necessarily my favourite ever songs as the list changes constantly, but they certainly contain my strongest and fondest memories from down through the years.

I want to make sure the Assembly reflects the new opportunity we have and have said to members both publicly and privately that I have to try and set a standard here of respecting everybody no matter who is in that chamber, they are all equal. The people who vote for them are equal. It’s about respect at the end of the day and I have to earn that as well.”The West Belfast MLA said that his take on the dynamics of the new ing Assembly going forward is that “it’s very important that it rises to occasion”. Having met with British Prime Minister Boris Johnston, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney, Mr Maskey said that both governments need to “respect that as well”. “We’ve got to respect political dference and we have to manage those,” he said. “I had very constructive engagements with them on Monday, obviously the substance of their visits was dealt with by the Executive.”Impartiality in his role as Speaker is a core element of the post, he said.“I had been pushing very hard on securing the funding that was announcement by the Department for Education for West Belfast schools. When it was announced about St John the Baptist I couldn’t even comment on it as I was in the ‘chair’ and that is the type of thing that your constituency needs to see a result on.

The Reds battled back from Leroy Millar’s early opener in the second half to stage a smash-and-grab - win and McLaughlin felt his side emptied everything into their search for a route back into the game. “I’m delighted,” reflected McLaughlin. “You saw how much effort that players put into the second half and you’ve got to give Ballymena credit – they were good on the break, got their lead with a soft goal we gave away and they defended their lead really well. But you saw how much our boys put into the second half, they emptied their heart on to the pitch and gave us everything.“To get the equaliser, we were happy with that and to go into extra time because I thought the momentum was with us. But to go and win it a minute later was an incredible finish to the game. It’s a sore one for Ballymenayou’re a Ballymena fan or player tonight. I’m sure they’re going back absolutely devastated at losing the game in the th minute. Unfortunately someone had to lose and you don’t want to see young players going off with their heads down but you can’t take it away from our boys. They gave it everything and they probably slightly deserved it in the end.” McLaughlin refused to take any credit for substitutes Thomas Maguire and Ryan Curran popping up with the late goals, but he praised the duo for putting their personal disappointment to one side for the good of the team. “The players on the pitch did the business,” he added. “The players on the pitch worked Ballymena really hard, they tried their best to work opportunities, Ballymena defended brilliantly well, you can’t deny them that, but when the seven minutes went up we looked like we had a goal in us. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to be one of those days where it would be a sad story – could we have done this and should we have done that “I felt we would get one chance in that seven minutes and take it to extra time, I felt we were finishing the game the stronger. For Thomas [Maguire] and Ryan [Curran] to pop up, fair play to them because I’m sure they were disappointed not to be starting the game. They put their own personal disappointment to one side to go and do a job for the team.”Such was the intensity of that seven minutes of madness, McLaughlin was unable to remember his feelings during the late drama but acknowledged the backing of the Red Army and paid tribute to their “incredible” support. “I pulled two hamstrings running on to the pitch celebrating and anything after that, I don’t know what happened,” admits McLaughlin. “Your emotions take over you because you can see what it means to the players and what it means to the supporters. You can’t go through any interview and not talk about the supporters tonight. “That was incredible support that Cltonville brought tonight in the County Antrim Shield on a Tuesday night. I think there is only one team in the ision that has that support and it’s Cltonville. You saw what it meant to the players and supporters from the goals went in. My mind went blank straight away and only now am I settling down.”Tuesday’s victory ends a four-year wait for silverware and McLaughlin hopes it will give his players a taste for future success. “Sometimes the first trophy is the hardest one to get. “I didn’t come here to make up the numbers, I came here to try and establish Cltonville back as a contender for the ision and as a team who should be challenging to win trophies. “If I didn’t see that potential in them, I wouldn’t have come up,” said the Derry man. “When I see the quality within the playing squad and the support they get when things are going well, when I see how hard they work, I know they’ve got potential to win trophies. All that hard work’s been justied tonight. “It’s one trophy but we’re not going to rest on that, we want more. It’s such a young squad and for a lot of them it’s their first senior medals. Hopefully now they’ll get that appetite for success and to challenge for trophies even more and you never know where this team might go.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"nicole starts new year at home","story":"NEWTOWNABBEY woman Nicole Adams has finally been allowed tohome after six weeks in hospital.We’ve been following the journey of cystic fibrosis suferrer Nicolewho last year won her battle for access to le-changing drugs.But Nicole was admitted to hospital at the end of November where her condition deteriorated after she caught a flu.Despite her sickness, she was still keen to start the drugs Symkevi and Orkambi after the Department of Health agreed a deal with US pharmaceutical company Vertex to make them available in the north.Unexpectedly, Nicole’s body reacted badly to Symkevi and she was taken into intensive care on December  as she fought for her le.Brave Nicole battled through and has now been given a more powerful drug – Trikafta – as she continues on the road to recovery.This week, Nicole completed a remarkable turnaround as she ed home with one month’s supply of the new drug.“I have one month’s worth of Trikafta in my grasp and it is so surreal,” explained Nicole.“What it has done for me so far is amazing.

That’s where we are and that’s where we’re moving to now’.“Psychologically, I think the DUP has played a huge role in creating that because they really did make it a cold house for Catholics.“And there was no need for it. [In relation to an Irish Language Act], they should have been saying: ‘Of course, there will be an Irish Language Act because it’s very important to a lot of people in this community and that it’s a vibrant language in some parts of the north. Of course we want to facilitate that and protect that,’ and get out there and to be seen publicly supporting it. data-dfpadtargetingJoe Brolly“That’s a civilised society. That’s what a peace process is, and that’s what it should look like. So they’ve screwed that up.”Mr Brolly said he has detected a “distinct change of attitude” beyond nationalist communities towards the DUP.“I detect it all the time, about the DUP, the Old Testament sort of stuff, the inhumane stuff that they espouse, it is no longer acceptable,” he said.Mr Brolly also hit out at the DUP’s stance on Brexit and the “inevitable errors” they made in the party’s dealings with Prime Minister Boris Johnson and predecessor Theresa May - which critics have said bring the future of the union into serious doubt.“They don’t have any long-term strategy, they are more an emotional movement than they are a political party, and that emotional movement is something that we know only too well – that triumphalism, treating you as inferior, that Arlene Foster-Jim Allister style: looking down their noses at people. And it’s not acceptable,” he said.“And these losers who are recruited by the DUP, because they’re tub-thumpers and they’ll get elected, increasingly the unionist community has got to be saying: ‘We’ve got to be doing better, we’ve got to do better’.“Increasingly, people of talent are going to emerge who see a pluralist, sensible, civilised future and will work towards that.”Despite theof power sharing in Northern Ireland, Mr Brolly feels it will not stop Catholics and the nationalist community from working towards a united Ireland.Mr Brolly, who featured in Derry’s  All-Ireland winning team, said the DUP have been “neutered and left powerless” following the general election and that the party had no choice but to reenter powersharing after the Conservative Party secured a large majority in the general election.The DUP has been approached for comment.

In his last tenure as minister before the collapse of power sharing he overturned a decision by his Sinn Fein predecessor which prevented schools preparing pupils for the unregulated tests.The minister said: “I want to wish all those children waiting for results the very best of luck. I understand that this can be an anxious time, particularly for those children who do not receive the results they were expecting.“We are fortunate in Northern Ireland to have so many excellent post-primary schools, both grammar and non-grammar, which are offering fantastic opportunities and are providing excellent pathways for our young people.\"Parents are now in the process of nominating post-primary schools for their children. Mr Weir issued a reminder to parents of the important steps they can take to ensure their children are placed successfully.“Parents can play a vital role in ensuring their child secures a place during the admissions process,\" he said. \"This includes reading schools’ admissions criteria carefully and nominating a minimum of four schools on their child’s transfer form, at least one of which should be a non-grammar school. By doing this they can maximise their child’s opportunity of securing a place at a school of their preference and of not remaining unplaced at the end of the process.”Last year, such was demand for places, hundreds of additional places were created for schools.Minister Weir added: “Securing placement for your child in your preferred location and sector after the conclusion of the process can be challenging. \"No child can be guaranteed a place at a particular school. That is why I would urge all parents to nominate sufficient and realistic preferences on their child’s application form.”On Friday  January, the Belfastwill reveal the lowest grades or scores it took to get into each selective grammar last September.Leona ONeill has compiled the at-a-glance guide which is a must-read for every parent.

My preference is to form a coalition.”Fine Gael has suffered a dficult start to their re-election bid with two recent opinion polls showing a drop in support for the party and his own personal rating.The figures in an  Ipsos MRBI survey published on Monday put support for Fianna Fail on %, Fine Gael on % and Sinn Fein on %.Mr Martin has dismissed polls putting his party ahead of Fine Gael and insisted they will fluctuate in the weeks ahead and the gap between the two parties is close.Askedhe would enter a confidence-and-supply arrangement to prop up a minority administration, Mr Varadkar said it is not his preference butit will form a government, he will do so.Mr Martin accused Mr Varadkar of failing to be grown-up.“There are more personal attacks on me than on Fianna Fail policies,” he added.“We believe there is a need for a new government.”Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald criticised Wednesday evening’s head-to-head debate format on Virgin Media One and said it was unfair that she was excluded as the leader of the third largest party.Wednesday marks day eight of the campaign with pensions, housing and health on the agenda as candidates continue to push for votes.On the campaign trail on Wednesday morning, Mr Varadkar officially handed in his ballot papers in Dublin while his Fine Gael party colleague Simon Coveney went to Co Tipperary to set out the party’s plans for rural Ireland."},{"url":null,"title":"welsh a and e units record worst ever waiting times performance","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Gething said the money is in addition to £ million he previously announced for investment in health services in response to increased winter pressures.He said: “Last month saw record high demand on the ambulance service, the highest number of attendance at emergency departments for any December and record numbers of emergency admissions for over -year-olds.“There has been a welcome reduction in delayed transfers of care but too many patients are spending long periods in emergency departments waiting for a hospital bed.“We want health boards to work with partners to improve the flow of patients through the hospital system and out into the community, and I have made an extra £ million available to support improvement in this area.”Darren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, which represents Wales’s seven health boards, said  had seen unprecedented levels of demand, and he urged the public to only use AE in emergencies.He said: “For the first time ever, the number of red calls to the ambulance service reached over  a day, and this trend emphasises the fact the NHS is dealing with more patients with much more complex needs.“We are at the start of a journey to transform our services, focusing on early interventions, prevention and working closely with our partners, including local government.After the latest release of NHS Wales performance stats, our Director, @WNHSC_Darren says that month after month we have seen unprecedented levels of demand on our emergency departments https:t.co NIpDzeITlk pic FBNsLMxSl— Welsh NHS ConfedJanuary , “This is the right path to take, but we need to deliver this change at pace and scale for the benefit of everyone in Wales.”Welsh Conservative shadow health minister Angela Burns said the figures show “a Welsh Labour Government unable to cope with this continuing crisis, and completely unable to find a solution”.She added: “Our hardworking NHS Wales staff are there to deliver the best care that they can, but they too are being let down by mismanagement at the top.“It’s a credit to them that they manage to cope under such circumstances.“This Welsh Labour administration created this crisis, and doesn’t seem that it can solve it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"stray cat with no ears get new crocheted set and finds new home","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo - Deirdre Heaney, nwpresspics  The move was a big culture shock.I saw a very urgent need to get an organisation together to improve the situation.I felt what was needed was a tenants association.The seeds of the Shantallow Tenants Association were sown when the residents began organising bus runs to Moville and Malin.It was a great opportunity for neighbours to get to know each other and there was a general consensus that more should be done for the young families in the area.In , just before the outbreak of the Troubles, Mr McCauley wrote  to the Belfastasking for help as he knew there were a lot of tenants associations in the Greater Belfast area.Groups from across the North advised him how to go about setting up a tenants association.The Highfield Tenants, Association, Amalgamated Corporation Tenants Asso- ciation, Tullycarnet Tenants Association, Lyne Social Club in Larne, North Belfast Tenants Association and the National Federation of Tenants Associations all wrote to me.I received lots of replies and they supplied me very useful advice.Most of these associations were political and non sectarian and I still have those letters.The main theme of these letters was use your politicians, but dont let them use you.The first meeting was held in a small gun club in the area by founder members, Danny Cooley, Tom Doherty, Sally Fleming and Mr McCauley.Mr McCauley was elected as chairman and Mr Cooley was elected as treasurer and it quickly became clear a community centre was needed.We put a questionnaire around the estate asking would they like a centre and what they would like to see in it and we got a great response.The association met with the Housing Trust  and made their case.We met with a lady called Miss MCCullough. She was a great help to us and I think we struck a chord with her, said Mr McCauley.The reason we were successful was because we were non political and non sectarian.When we went to ask for anything we asked politely and we didnt demand it.The Shantallow Community Centre was the first of its type to be built in the city and cost pound,.Its was only supposed to last  years, said Mr McCauley.The centre was soon a hive of activity and people came from across the city to use it.We had a childrens play group, handicraft classes, Irish dancing classes, piano lessons, a childrens disco and a youth disco on a Saturday night.It was the only disco of its kind in the city at that time we had young people coming from Newbuildings and the foot of Bishop Street for that.You would find them standing outside after and they had no way of getting home, so I would have given them a lt in my big yellow Zephyr.Everyone remembers the Zephyr. If I go to a wake in Shantallow people say to me do you still have that big yellow car The list of activities at the centre continued to grow with gymnastics, rollerskating, indoor bowls and bingo.In  they held a cross community festival for all the churches in the area.It was a good time, said Mr McCauley.It was all young families living in the area and on the summer days you would have thought there was a swarm of bees out on the back square but it would just have been all the children.That was before phones and Playstations.The work of the centre stretched far outside its doors with bus runs, dinner dances, outdoor festivals, sports competitions and luncheon clubs.Mr McCauley dedicated countless hours to it, but he said none of it would have been possible without the support of his we, Rita, who sadly passed away two years ago.She was the most important person, he said.We had six children and she had to rear them all.Mr McCauley eventually retired from the Tenants Association in , but not before he shared his knowledge with community groups across the city. A long list of people gave many volunteer hours to the Shantallow Tenants Association and Community Centre.I would like to wish all future communities the success we had and give a special thanks to all those people who made it so successful. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

She was a great help to us and I think we struck a chord with her, said Mr McCauley.The reason we were successful was because we were non political and non sectarian.When we went to ask for anything we asked politely and we didnt demand it.The Shantallow Community Centre was the first of its type to be built in the city and cost pound,.Its was only supposed to last  years, said Mr McCauley.The centre was soon a hive of activity and people came from across the city to use it.We had a childrens play group, handicraft classes, Irish dancing classes, piano lessons, a childrens disco and a youth disco on a Saturday night.It was the only disco of its kind in the city at that time we had young people coming from Newbuildings and the foot of Bishop Street for that.You would find them standing outside after and they had no way of getting home, so I would have given them a lt in my big yellow Zephyr.Everyone remembers the Zephyr. If I go to a wake in Shantallow people say to me do you still have that big yellow car The list of activities at the centre continued to grow with gymnastics, rollerskating, indoor bowls and bingo.In  they held a cross community festival for all the churches in the area.It was a good time, said Mr McCauley.It was all young families living in the area and on the summer days you would have thought there was a swarm of bees out on the back square but it would just have been all the children.That was before phones and Playstations.The work of the centre stretched far outside its doors with bus runs, dinner dances, outdoor festivals, sports competitions and luncheon clubs.Mr McCauley dedicated countless hours to it, but he said none of it would have been possible without the support of his we, Rita, who sadly passed away two years ago.She was the most important person, he said.We had six children and she had to rear them all.Mr McCauley eventually retired from the Tenants Association in , but not before he shared his knowledge with community groups across the city. A long list of people gave many volunteer hours to the Shantallow Tenants Association and Community Centre.I would like to wish all future communities the success we had and give a special thanks to all those people who made it so successful. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He was an incredible human being with a wonderful family and friends circle. “I know that when any friend musician needed advice of funding I pointed them towards Lyndon andhe had the time, he gave it willingly. I have an incredible amount of memories. I will miss my old friend so dearly, but in truth, I am truly blessed to have met Lyndon Stephens”.Francesca O’Connor, from Quiet Arch ,said “Lyndon Stephens, a man who wanted to make a genuine dference to this world, give the underdogs a  to shine and to show the world the incredible talent coming out of Northern Ireland. “He set up an artist management company, Champion Sound Music and record label, Quiet Arch, to put Northern Ireland artists on the international stage.

As fate would have it, it became his wake. I am a firm believer in the human spirit being how people remember you and I prefer to gather other people’s memories for things like this. Ryan Vail: “The man that gave me a career in music, toured me around the world, put me on tv, put me on radio, made me a headline festival artist, got me sound tracking, got me remixing, got me producing, got me talking on some of the most important industry , got me the most prestigious funding awards my manager, friend, label partnerLyndon Stephens.“I was his very first signing nine years ago and stayed with him the whole time.

But with our lives being so busy we often forget the simple activities bring the happiest times and memories. As parents, and childminders too, we can also feel under pressure to always be teaching our children, so this week I’ve combined these two themes, baking and learning. The curriculum for our young children talks about three prime areas of learningand these are Personal, Social andEmotional Development - this is all about learning to share, to wait, taking an interest and participating in activities, being responsible for tasks, having opportunity to feel valued and able to contribute, talking about what you are doing together, asking questions and having a special bond etc. googletag.cmd.push Communication and Language - this is about listening, paying attention, being able to focus and concentrate, being able to follow instructions, naming dferent items and actions, speaking in sentences, asking and answering questions, having a two way conversation etc Physical Development - is about small finger movements and large movements too, it’s about being able to use and control items, objects and tools etc and also self care, personal hygiene, having own likes and dislikes, being safe and using equipment safely etc. If we consider these and look at all that baking involves we can see all the learning that is going on from collecting all ingredients, selecting and organising bowls, spoons, whisks etc, washing hands, putting on an apron, then reading instructions, following a receipe, talking about what next, weighing, counting, pouring, breaking, mixing, adding, stirring, smelling, washing implements, waiting for cakes to cook then cool before sharing and tasting! googletag.cmd.push  Recipes For You To Make Together Scones - g oz self raising flour, g oz butter, g oz caster sugar, ml fl oz milk, pinch of salt . Method Heat the oven to C F Gas . Lightly grease a baking sheet. Mix together the flour and salt and rub in the butter. Stir in the sugar and then the milk to make a dough. Put onto a lightly floured work topand knead. Roll out the dough to about cm thick and shape into scones. Brush the tops of the scones with a little milk. Bake for - minutes until well risen and golden. Then leave to cool on a wire rack and add whatever you like! If you want to add sultanas or choc chips before you bake then why not! Cheese Pancakes -   cup flour,  frac tsp baking powder,  frac tsp sugar,   tsp salt,  egg,  cupof grated cheddar cheese - too much cheese will make them too sloppy,  cup milk ,  tbsp melted butter. Method Mix together the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt. Stir the grated cheddar cheese into the flour mixture until everything is evenly combined. Beat together in a separate bowl the egg, milk and melted butter. Stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients just to moisten. Heat a lightly oiled frying pan over medium high heat. Spoon the batter onto the pan, using approximately   cup for each pancake. Cook till brown on both sides and enjoy! Cupcakes - g butter , it’s a good idea to get the butter out of the fridge much earlier so it is soft!,  large eggs, g caster sugar,g self raising flour . Method heat oven to C   F  Gas . Fill a cup cake tray with  cake cases. Whisk together butter, sugar then add beaten eggs bit at a time, whisking in between. Add vanilla extract and sieved flour then pop the mixture into the cake cases and into the oven for about  minutes. If you’d like to decorate with buttercream after they have cooled , then to make the butter cream mix together g butterand g icing sugarthen add  tbsp milk and food colouringyou like. You can use a spoon or fork to add the buttercream to the cupcakes or even use a piping bag! Biscuits… - p vanilla extract. Method Heat oven to C C F Gas  and line a baking tray with baking   greaseproof paper. Put the butter in a bowl and beat until soft and creamy. Beat in the sugar, then the egg and vanilla, and then the sieved flour to make a dough - knead. If the dough feels sticky, add a little bit more flour. Roll out to about   cm thickness and cut out shapes using a biscuit cutter or rim of a cup. If you feel adventurous then gently press some clean toys into the biscuit - car tracks, lego shapes etcor add sultanas to make a face! Then bake for - minutes before eating!

In addition their anger has grown on foot of the announcement yesterday that our MLAs will receive pound, increase in their pay with a further increase in April . “NIPSA has no issue with the fact that MLAs, as workers, are receiving a pay increase – however all workers – including civil servants deserve to be treated equally and receive at least an inflationary increase in their pay plus some recognition for the loss of pay over the past  years. This benchmark has now been set. NIPSA is meeting with the Finance Minister later today when we will be pressing him to ensure that civil servants, who it has been acknowledged, have been working in very dficult circumstances in the absence of the NI Assembly, receive an above inflationary pay increase in recognition of the work they have carried out over the last  years without political direction.”Ms Millar went on to say: “We are looking forward to the meeting later today with the Minister and we hope for a positive engagement and a positive outcome in which civil servants can be appropriately rewarded.”People Before Profit Councillor Shaun Harkin said he will be joining workers on the picket line.“Hard working civil servants get no automatic pay increases every year. Theyve had year on year cuts from Stormont. Theyve been lied to and treated with contempt.“The new Stormont deal talks about workers rights but civil servants are still being forced to take strike action for very modest demands.“Let the Stormont Executive parties know they need to start treating workers with respect.”Concluding Coucnillor Harkin said:Solidarity with the strikers and all workers demanding justice, dignity and respect.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In addition their anger has grown on foot of the announcement yesterday that our MLAs will receive pound, increase in their pay with a further increase in April . “NIPSA has no issue with the fact that MLAs, as workers, are receiving a pay increase – however all workers – including civil servants deserve to be treated equally and receive at least an inflationary increase in their pay plus some recognition for the loss of pay over the past  years. This benchmark has now been set. NIPSA is meeting with the Finance Minister later today when we will be pressing him to ensure that civil servants, who it has been acknowledged, have been working in very dficult circumstances in the absence of the NI Assembly, receive an above inflationary pay increase in recognition of the work they have carried out over the last  years without political direction.”Ms Millar went on to say: “We are looking forward to the meeting later today with the Minister and we hope for a positive engagement and a positive outcome in which civil servants can be appropriately rewarded.”People Before Profit Councillor Shaun Harkin said he will be joining workers on the picket line.“Hard working civil servants get no automatic pay increases every year. Theyve had year on year cuts from Stormont. Theyve been lied to and treated with contempt.“The new Stormont deal talks about workers rights but civil servants are still being forced to take strike action for very modest demands.“Let the Stormont Executive parties know they need to start treating workers with respect.”Concluding Coucnillor Harkin said:Solidarity with the strikers and all workers demanding justice, dignity and respect.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We came out and played after that and created a few half chances but I didnt think there was that much in the game.“I thought we battled until the end and we got our reward because we worked hard all season and its something we can be proud of because we came through it together as a team.”Leroy Millars goal for Ballymena had looked to be enough for David Jeffreys side but McDermott admits that the seven minutes of added time at the end of the game gave Cltonville renewed hope.“We saw the board and there were seven minutes left so that gave us a wee bit of a lt when we seen that,” he explained. “We rallied as a group and we got the important goal which, at the time, I thought was going to take us to extra time, but then Curny popped up with a great finish to send the place mad. It was unbelievable to be honest.“It was a sucker punch for them because obviously they have one hand on the trophy in the th minute and we looked down and out. But once we got the goal we got an extra -% in our game and it showed when we got the goal. “I thinkthe game had gone to extra time we would have won it anyway after that, but thankfully it didnt have to go that far because the old legs were starting to go a bit at that stage.” googletag.cmd.push BeliefThe victory is as timely for Cltonville as it was dramatic, with Paddy McLaughlins team still in the hunt for the league title in one of the most intriguing title races for years. Having lost the last two league games, the Shield victory, and the nature of it, could be the boost the club needed according to McDermott.“It instills a winning mentality in the group,” he said. “Not many people have senior medals to their name. Its not the biggest win but to be fair in the County Antrim youre beating all the top teams youre beating the likes of Linfield, Glentoran and Crues, so its still important to us and its one on the board now, and we cam focus on the league against Coleraine now on Monday. To get that win is important to lt the group going forward.”McDermotts renaissance in Belfast continues, with the -year old loving his football once again. “Its brilliant,” he said. “Im back playing football with a smile on my face. Im happy. Its just about getting through games now and playing every week for me. “I dont think Ive missed many games, maybe one or two at most with injury, which is brilliant for me with my track record. Thats something that hasnt been happening for a couple of years so its good to get games under my belt. Im back to where I was a few years ago to be honest. I feel really fit and healthy and the football is taking care of itself now which is great. The main thing for me is keeping that going and being happy.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

If we hadnt won it, it would have been a real disappointment and a real setback for us so all the emotion of the  minutes got to me a wee bit at the end and thats the first time thats kind of happened. It was nice to get the four points dont get me wrong, but hopefully with other games left now in the season we can get through more comfortably.Derry are one of four teams on  points and it as yet hard to predict which way the remainder of the season will go. The bare minimum is staying in the ision, but a play-off place is still very much in sight.Its a really weird table because we are five points off the bottom but only three points off top four,” McCarter agreed.“It is a game where you get away with not playing your best but it was so important to get the four points and thats the way its going to be for the rest of the season. You can try and get perfection every game, but its pretty unlikely thats going to happen, but at the end of the day it is about just getting over the line and winning whatever way you can and that starts again this weekend down in Enniscorthy.” googletag.cmd.push PRESSUREThe league leaders are under severe pressure from Skerries at the top of the table, and having won  from  league games so far, they will remain big favourites against an opponent that has struggled for consistency. Nothing is certain in Division C however, and with Bangor showing that Enniscorthy are beatable, Derry have plenty of reason to be optimistic. McCarter in particular feels that his side can exploit their opponents and be more clinical than they were during a - defeat at Judges Road in December.“Any team is beatable in our league and it really is about playing well on the day,” he added. “I have watched the video of us playing against Enniscorthy at home and my gut feeling at the time and when I watched it the first time was that we were really poor that day. But, when I watched it again last week, the amount of chances we created wads frightening in the first half. “We could have had three or four tries but we just lacked a real clinical cutting edge and thats what you need against there real top teams. “If you dont take your chances youll pay for it butwe can create the same chances again, I would like to think that we wiould take some of them. Its just about putting them under pressure and making them feel uncomfortable in the game andwe do that then you never know. They are definitely going to be big favourites so that maybe takes a bit of pressure off us but I do think we can get a bit of joy down there.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials have this week reaffirmed their commitment to work with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site, with the project being spearheaded by the Department of Communities.Council officials say that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what local people would like to see and what would work at this particular site.Officials insist that there is little point developing options which they think might work, with the forthcoming meeting with all stakeholders designed to secure by-in from them and develop a project that is likely to succeed.The planned meeting with all stakeholders will help shape a development brief inviting potential developers to come forward to transform the site and kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.In addition, the development brief will outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Local councillor Dermot Curran said the recent visit to the proposed Irish Street development site provided an insight into its size and development potential.He is backing the move to involve businesses and residents in helping shape the development brief for the site and hopes that the planned meeting at which they will be asked for their input can take place soon.ldquoWhat we are talking about is the biggest ever investment in Downpatrick town centre. We have to get this right as it has the potential to not only regenerate Irish Street, but the wider town centre by attracting increased footfall which will boost existing businesses, many of them locally owned, said Cllr Curran.ldquoIt is clear that having viewed the Irish Street site that it offers massive potential and can transform Downpatrick town centre and provide a major boost for existing businesses.Cllr Curran said he has spoken to a number of business people who are keen to have the date of the meeting with consultants confirmed so they can attend to help play their part in shaping the future development of a prominent town centre site.He added: ldquoPeople want to see progress on this crucially important development.

His unavailability through injury is a severe blow to Tallyrsquos aspirationsJohn OrsquoHare and Marc Hynes shared the goalkeeping duties in the two McKenna Cup games, but Castlewellanrsquos Rory Burns is still considered as the county number one.Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins, Burrenrsquos Kevin McKernan and Warrenpointrsquos Ryan McAleenan could well man the full back berths with Annaclonersquos Brendan McArdle also in the frame.A knee injury for Saulrsquos Pierce Laverty, picked up against Tyrone, could rule him out of action, but Daniel Guinness could well fill in for him at right half back. Captain Darren OrsquoHagan seems to be favourite to start at centre half back with a mixture of Ross Carr, McArdle, Mayobridgersquos Shane Annett and Guinness flanking him.Midfield has been a bit of a problem for Down, but Loughinislandrsquos Jonny Flynn should start in this sector with either Liatroimrsquos Liam Middleton, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan, Carryduffrsquos Owen McCabe or Longstonersquos Conor Poland most likely to get the nod.The set of six forwards will come from Poland, McCabe, Corey Quinn, Barry OrsquoHagan, Conor Maginn, Pat Havern, Donal OrsquoHare, Brendan Gallen, Ciaran Harney, Liam Kerr and Ross McGarry.Regardless of who Tally starts with, Tipperary will be no pushovers and now under Powerrsquos management, they will be keen to impress.Michael OrsquoReilly, Liam Fahey, Bill Maher, Robbie Kiely, Jack Kennedy, Conor Sweeney and Liam Treacy all showed up well in Tipperaryrsquos recent McGrath Cup campaign and did enough, even without Quinlivan, to suggest that they will be a tough nut to crack..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 22%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Rumours were re this week that it could be another ten years before the adoption of the poundm-plus scheme to provide a lsquoring roadrsquo in Downpatrick.Work on the scheme first started in the late sixties and, ironically, the Department of Environment is preparing to make a public announcement within the next two weeks on the route they want the road to take.But on Monday Downpatrick councillor Mr Eddie McGrady told a meeting of Down councillors that there were local rumours of another ten-year delay.Within the past  hours it has become obvious that the warning could take on realistic proportions.It seems clear that a wall of objections will be raised of the scheme and it could particularly take years to smooth out negotiations and pare the way for a pubic inquiry, which now looks inevitable.Mr McGradyrsquos warning came during a council discussion on a planning decision to refuse alterations and extensions to a dwelling in Saul Street, which is expected to be in the path of the new road.He drew the councilrsquos attention to a planning approval for squash courts in St Patrickrsquos Avenue mdash also likely to be in the path of the road mdash offering one explanation for the conflicting decisions.ldquoThere are rumours that planning permissions might be given in certain circumstances because it might be ten years before the road is implemented, he said.CROSSGAR mdash The st Crossgar Boys Brigade will represent Down Battalion in the Northern Ireland district finals of the squad drill competition in Omagh on Saturday.The Lissara boys qualied for the finals by wining the annual Down Battalion competition held at Banbridge on Monday night.

of information signs and the development of visitor centres.Northern Irelandrsquos only other current geopark mdash the Marble Arch Caves which inhabits the rugged mountainous uplands and gentle rolling lowlands of counties Cavan and Fermanagh mdash contributes just over poundm to the economy in this area.Local council officials, who confirmed a pre-Christmas Recorder story that the formal bid for geopark status had been submitted, have revealed that an Area of Outstanding Natural Beautymanagement team for the three local areas has been created.Council officials say that they are continuing to work secure geopark status which is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism.But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious geopark designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy, with those behind the bid confident that it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors in particular.But securing geopark status is not just about delivering financial benefit.Geoparks in other areas have empowered local communities, providing them with opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.If the local bid for geopark status for a huge swathe of land covering Strangford and Lecale, the Mournes and Ring of Gullion is successful, the international designation is expected to play a key role in helping transform the local economy.The geopark brand will use the geological heritage of the three areas to develop sustainable tourism that generates economic benefits, while providing recreational opportunities and increased awareness of the arearsquos natural assets, working with landowners, businesses and communities.The ultimate aim of a geopark is to enhance the economy and develop employment opportunities for the people who live there, but the global brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been

The tourism season in Newcastle is now all-year long and we want to keep the car-park open.Cllr Devlin said that the council was ldquoa victim of its own success in being able to attract the numbers of visitors to the town.She questioned the proposalrsquos contention that Newcastlersquos parking demand ldquosignicantly decreases during the winter months.ldquoIt used to be that we would have parking problems during particular times such as the Festival of Flight and bank holidays. But now as long as its dry, Newcastle is busy and parking is a necessary part of the town centre, she said.ldquoWhen the overflow car park is not being used, itrsquos complete chaos and parking can create issues for residents in nearby folds.She asked council officers when the new overflow car-park would be open for business andthe current overflow area could be kept open in the interim to help with parking demand.Michael Lipsett, the councilrsquos director of active and healthy communities, said he envisaged the work lasting three months and promised that once the necessary planning approval was gained, his department would be preparing to tender for a contractor as soon as possible.Slieve Croob Cllr Andrew McMurray queried whether the car-park would be a ldquoblanket tarmac covering andit would encroach on the green space.He was told that the proposal was to use a synthetic grid which would allow grass to show through so it would look green but would also indicate the car spaces available and one-way traffic system planned.Mournes Cllr Harold McKee welcomed the development as a ldquogreat idea and said parking in Newcastle was ldquoan absolute nightmare at any time of the year.Cllr Devlin suggested that the current overflow parking area should be in continuous use until the new facility is opened.However, Mr Lipsett said he currently did not have the budget available to cover this but would investigate and report back..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Philip.jpg","title":"Philip and Helen in tandem at Kildare  ","story":"ON a bitterly cold Saturday morning Phillip and Helen Vint were at the start line for the latest in the East of Ireland Marathon series, at Staplestown, in North Kildare, which also provides half marathon and k alternatives, mostly for partners, like Helen who feel itrsquos nice to be there to support your other half, but who feel that running a marathon with them is pushing things a bit too far, . miles too far to be exact.The temperature was -C when they began running and a sultry +C when they finished and underfoot conditions were slippery by virtue of the frozen ice around the route.So, well done to both on completing what they describe as steady runs for their firsts of , Phillip in .. and fth place and Helen in .. and third place respectively.BornRunSaturday saw a big turnout,  in fact, for the sixth of the BornRun Run Forest Run Series.This week the venue was Gosford Country Park which will also host the NI  Ulster Intermediate and Masters Cross Country Championships next weekend.The only distance on offer this week was k and the route headed out in a loop around the start and continued towards the outer boundaries of the forest.The first k was quite level and took everyone into the scenic forest for k where there were a few small inclines, but overall it was a flat, fast course with a good run in the last k down to the finish line.No-one made better use of the terrain than East Downrsquos Jimmy Sloan, who fairly flew round the course in a superb ., which was almost two minutesahead of the second-placed Thomas Carson . with third place filled by Barry McAuley in ..I believe this is Jimmyrsquos first win in club colours and it certainly wonrsquot be his last, given his present form and continuing improvement, which in spite of hearing later that the distance was allegedly  metres short, nevertheless represents a great effort and time.

This year they donated a fantastic amount for the charities, said Raphael. ldquoI am delighted to see young people come on board to help others. They are a credit to their school and their families.Raphaelrsquos chance meeting with Martin, a homeless man living on the streets of Dublin whom he met during a visit to family members a number of years ago, was the catalyst for him to launch his annual appeal which has enjoyed tremendous community support.The photographerrsquos meeting with Martin underneath a railway bridge close to Pearse Street railway station had a profound impact on him, moving him to organise an appeal as soon as he ed home.ldquoThe sight of seeing Martin on Pearse Street back in  will be with me forever. To see homelessness on the rise across Ireland,north and south, means something is badly wrong. There doesnrsquot appear to be any political will to cure the problem. It there was, we would not have homelessness in a modern society. More needs to be done, immediately, said Raphael.Year on year the response to his appeal has increased and this year he will be looking for anyone interested in helping to get in touch to help with the collection, storage and distribution of donations.Raphael confirmed that he plans to launch his appeal for volunteers to join forces with him this October.ldquoI cannot begin to praise every single person who responded to my Christmas appeal. It was so overwhelming, he explained.ldquoAll I do is put the word out about my appeal and people come forward in great numbers to help. The response to the latest appeal was the biggest to date and I cannot thank people enough for their generosity and support.ldquoThe response from the public was truly unbelievable. I am particularly indebted to everyone, in particular, the staff and students at St Colmcillersquos High School.The annual appeal is particularly time-consuming for someone who runs his own business and that is why Raphael is hoping people will volunteer to help him in .ldquoEvery item that is donated has to be unpacked and checked to make sure it is okay to pass on. Then it has to be sorted, re-packed and stored until the time to deliver it comes. This takes up a lot of time and there is only so much one person can do, he explained.Raphael has also singled out the management and staff at Peter Fitzpatrick and Sons Estate Agents in Downpatrick for particular praise for allowing their Irish Street base to be used as a -off point for his appeal.ldquoThe business has been so supportive over the past number of years. I cannot thank them enough for all their help, he said.ldquoDePaul was over the moon with the items people donated and the fact that a signicant number of people took time out at Christmas to think of and help others is very humbling. If more people come forward to help me this year, together, we could do even more.In future Raphael hopes to deliver the majority of donations to more local charities and organisations. He said it only seems right that items collected are distributed locally so in future most of what he receives will go to local charities.He added: ldquoThe generosity and community spirit across the district is something to behold. All I do is announce details of the appeal and people across the community then donate in numbers.ldquoOnce the message gets out there, people are quick to respond and I am so grateful as are the organisations they are supporting. The generosity of spirit that local people have displayed since my first appeal continues to be overwhelming..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Red.jpg","title":"Red High back in business  ","story":"ST Patrickrsquos Grammar School, Downpatrick, booked their place in the MacLarnon Cup play-offs against Carndonagh Community School and are now just one win away from the quarter-finals.The holders didnrsquot start that well as St Louisrsquo grabbed the first two points through Aidan Scullion at the Dub last Wednesday, but as the first half progressed it became clear that St Patrickrsquos were the more accomplished team.Although St Louisrsquo still led at the break by - to -, the writing was on the wall for the mid-Antrim boys with the pace of the Downpatrick wing-forwards and wing-backs, plus the presence of Aodhan Harney, Tom Smyth and Ruairiacute Connor down the centre was always a problem for them.St Louisrsquo looked good in the opening few minutes with Scullion lively and Ruairiacute Hagan and Ryan McQuillan pushing forward, but that penetration was arrested before the end of the first quarter and the scores dried up.Their hopes of remaining in the tie against the strong breeze in the second half rested on a penalty in first half injury-time when Ronan McKillop fed Ryan McQuillan and the Glenravel man was taken down.But Scullion pulled his shot wide from the spot kick and that two points lead did not look good enough.Tom Smyth, Tom Savage, Chris McIlroy and Dermot Donaldson all pointed in the opening six minutes of the second half and the result was not in doubt from then on.Some of these were well taken scores, but the cream of the crop was a seven-player move down the left wing which finished with Conor Murray slinging over the second of his four second half scores in the nd minute.Six minutes later the Red High slammed the door shut on Ballymena.

It is events like this in the very heart of Penarth which demonstrate how lucky we are to have such a ying and vibrant collection of businesses, which are so accessible.It was great to witness how the streets opened up to more traditional businesses of selling hand-crafted Christmas gts and roasted chestnuts, adding to the selection of businesses we already have on offer.Many of you will be aware of Small Business Saturday, which this year falls on December . The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year. Thanks should also go to the local businesses who supported and Irsquod like to encourage residents to visit their local business to support Small Business Saturday. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves. The vast majority just wonrsquot be able to do this.ldquoIntroducing policy which isnrsquot fit for purpose could have severe consequences.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent.

This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The idea was to encourage children to experience the joy of reading for pleasure, rather than seeing it as just something they have to do for school\"Research shows that being able to choose their own books, as well as sitting down regularly to read with a parent, makes a real dference to childrens enjoyment of reading. This in turn benefits their schoolwork across the whole curriculum, not just in literacy.\"We are also grateful to the local businesses who generously donated the coffee shop vouchers to help make this happen.ldquoThe contributions of local businesses show once again what great community spirit we have here in Penarth!\"In total,  local businesses donated coffee shop vouchers.

Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.

The firm is marking two decades leading the way in the industry, and according to founder Terry Moore, the firm is well on its way to doubling its size and embracing the latest technology for its clients Outsource Solutions is a firm which is ahead of the curve when it comes to emerging technologies and a company which embeds itself in a client’s business to ensure total integration – ultimately helping to boost it and help it grow.“Our approach is to embed ourselves into the customer’s business, and take IT out of the boardroom,” Terry says. “What we do is try to get ahead of some of the problems, understand the business and recognise that the technology is there to benefit the company.“We are there to make sure that business is possible – enriching lives, making things easier and safer. An important part of this is the relationships that we have.”Terry formed Outsource Solutions  years ago, around the time of the so-called ‘millennium bug’ when he says some firms were using scare tactics to get businesses to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds, often unnecessarily. “For me, one of the things I felt was missing was understanding a business and factoring that refresh into it over a few years – letting them get on with what they do.”The company – which now has five locations, including Belfast – is a full service IT firm which manages every element of a business’s infrastructure, including security, enterprise wi-fi, telecoms and networking.“We now have just over  staff and are we are on a five-year plan to double in size again. There has been considerable growth in areas such as enterprise wi-fi, converged networks and telecoms,” Terry says.Client retention is also something which Terry and the business prides itself on. “Every customer that we signed up with in , we still work with,” he says. “We will give a recommendation as to how we think a network should be built. If they accept that, then we take it on as a risk.“Technology is just a toolbox for us to allow us to deliver IT – technology to allow them to really access and control their data.”Outsource is a business which has been at the forefront of emerging developments in technology, including cyber-security. Terry says, even just a few years ago, it wasn’t being taken seriously by many businesses. That has now changed signicantly.“In the last couple of years, cyber has completely exploded – but we were ahead of our time,” he says. “My experience of last  years and the last five in particular is that there has been a massive job to do in educating businesses and their users about the cyber threat.“We have reached the tipping point and the human firewall is becoming much stronger – people and users are more sensitive to what it means, making it all a far better place. But there are still businesses which are happy to cut fast and loose, and take risks.”While the company’s client base started off in professional services businesses – such as law and accounting – it’s grown into a host of sectors, including transport, logistics, manufacturing and engineering.“We have carved out a niche in hospitality as well – particularly in areas such as enterprise wi-fi, converged networks and communication, generally.”Terry says Outsource is seeing business growth among many of Northern Ireland’s medium-sized businesses, with more than  staff.“Our job is to enhance, improve and optimise the performance for as many users as we can. Our aim over the next four years is to be able to deliver those services outside Northern Ireland, across the rest of the UK and into the Republic of Ireland.“For us, the constant is that we are always there at that point of where technology is consumed. The role we play is being integrated and a trusted advisor. That’s how we will continue to be successful.”As for the next  years, with a rise in automation and articial intelligence – something Terry says has to become a little more intelligent and a little less articial – the next major leap will be the advent of quantum computing. It’s something which remains in its infancy.“While it’s still early, we are on the verge of the most aggressive technological change that any of us have ever seen,” he says.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
