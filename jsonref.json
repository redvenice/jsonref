They are bodies you don’t often see in magazines or on social media’Several years ago, when I was back home in Lithuania, I went to the beach for the first time in years. I grabbed my longboard, gathered a group of friends and family, and headed for one of the most popular spots on the Baltic coast.On this beach, there is a bridge that overlooks the shore. As I walked across it, I could see all of the bathers lying beneath me on the sand. I had a perfect bird’s eye view. I had never seen the beach from that angle, and it was fascinating. That evening, I began the research for this series, Comfort Zone. I looked through reams of beach photography, but pretty much none of the images had captured the scene from above. I found nothing documenting it from this angle in this clean, simple, almost clinical way.I wanted to create a typology of beach culture – a kind of study of the phenomenon as if I were investigating a different species. I was thinking about what it would be like to come to Earth as an alien and witness this: what sense would you make of it?As well as my camera, I used equipment to help me to shoot from above while I was moving around at beach level: a four-metre-long pole with an attachment for my camera, and a radio trigger for when I was ready to shoot.It was important that the photos were perfectly candid, so I didn’t tell anyone I was shooting them. But people were looking at me. I realised that the people who weren’t looking at me must be sleeping, so I knew which ones I wanted to photograph.I tried to avoid any conversations or arouse suspicion. I wasn’t doing anything against the law, but the beach is a place where people sometimes don’t feel comfortable being shot. Some people did approach me though – you can imagine seeing the same person every day walking with this strange thing on his shoulders, so they asked me what I was doing. I said I was just taking photos of nature, and if they were persistent with their questions, I would show them images I had taken of the sea or the forest.When those images started to be published, there were some concerns, and people questioned my practice. My view is that I’ve never focused on someone’s personal life: my work is about society, community, humanity – it’s not about one particular person.I took this shot on the first day I started to work on the series. It was nerve-racking: I had no idea how the pictures were going to look and I didn’t know how people would respond to me. That evening at home, I looked through the day’s work. Nothing was right apart from this shot. This image convinced me that the whole project was worth pursuing. For that reason alone, it’s special to me.The image tells a story: you can see the very shade of the woman’s lipstick, you can see the veins in her legs, but despite the specificity of the shot, it’s also oddly surreal. There’s a kind of dissonance in it that appeals to me.As in the rest of the series, the bodies you see are real. They are bodies you don’t often see in magazines, online or on social media. Every day we are bombarded with images of people eating perfectly healthy food and being perfectly in shape, and so many people feel excluded by that. The reality we are so often presented with is utterly distorted and represents the minority of us.I don’t consider the beach as a utopian escape from the city, but it does illustrate how our behaviour is conditioned by social norms beyond our control. Why is it acceptable to be half naked on a beach, but not in a library? Why does our environment dictate what we can and cannot wear? It’s because our behaviour is always being shaped by people around us.In the age of social media, we are obsessed with the concept of iniduality and the idea that we must all be different all of the time. These images show that, on some level, we just do what everyone else does. The inidual is much less important than the collective or the whole.I travelled to other beaches across the world, thinking it would be interesting to document how beach culture differs. What I found is that it doesn’t. We buy the same things, we often read the same things translated into whatever language we speak and we use the same brands a lot of the time. You can see globalisation in action on the beach, and how consumerism shapes all of our lives. But you can also see a kind of commonality, the similarities between us, no matter where in the world we are.Studied: MA in Architecture at Vilnius Gediminas Technical University.Influences: “Everything I have seen and experienced has impacted me.

The earnings were still well ahead of the world’s six biggest listed oil companies combined.The once secretive oil behemoth opened its books to international investors for the first time last year ahead of a record-breaking sovereign bond market debut.

A spokesman said the carmaker would have enough parts for about two days of production if deliveries faced disruption, up from the normal stock levels of about four hours.Its contingency plans, which have been agreed with workers, come as the government is reiterating warnings to businesses to prepare for no-deal.Unions and manufacturing workers on Thursday said they were “disappointed” after Michael Gove, the minister in charge of no-deal Brexit planning, failed to provide assurances that the government could prevent damage to industry.In the talks, held at the Cabinet Office and described as occasionally heated, union bosses and workers from companies including Jaguar Land Rover, Airbus, Rolls-Royce and Nestlé outlined concerns that goods may be delayed at the border, tariffs could be imposed on parts and goods, and smaller companies were struggling to build buffer stocks for a second time.“We are not confident with any of the answers that came back,” said Steve Turner, the assistant general secretary for manufacturing at Unite, one of the UK’s biggest unions. “As soon as you go into detail they run a mile.”Jude Brimble, the national secretary of the GMB union, said: “Michael Gove thinks ‘we hold all the cards’ post Brexit. So how come his government is scrambling around at the last minute to safeguard the UK’s 2.5 million manufacturing jobs?“We’ve already lost half a million jobs in the past decade – a no-deal Brexit would be a car crash for UK manufacturing.”Manufacturers such as Airbus and PSA Group, the owner of car brands including Peugeot and Vauxhall, have warned they could move production out of the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit.The Food and Drink Federation separately warned on Thursday that crucial questions for food producers remained unanswered by the government. They included whether checks would be in place on the border with the Republic of Ireland, whether imports of perishable foods would be prioritised, and whether the government would help firms with extra VAT and tariff costs.Two sources with knowledge of meetings between ministers and business groups said the government’s tone had hardened since Boris Johnson became prime minster.Andrea Leadsom, the new business secretary, is understood to have moved the focus to preparations for a no-deal Brexit, rather than the prospects for a deal with the EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/408e27f30449f7d40a4598f320326d5dcd22644a/0_240_4900_2940/master/4900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df20771ab52db0cc4846398d65310063","title":"uk first commercial crop chickpeas harvested norfolk","story":"Up to 20 tonnes of the legume will be dried and packaged to go on sale in mid-SeptemberThe UK’s first commercial crop of chickpeas has been harvested in Norfolk this week.Up to 20 tonnes of the legume – grown by four farmers across the UK – will eventually be dried and packaged by the Suffolk-based pulse specialist Hodmedod’s and will go on sale in mid-September.Hodmedod’s co-founder Josiah Meldrum said: “We’ve been working on chickpeas for about five years, although a Norfolk farmer came to us earlier this year – so this is his first attempt. There are three other farmers growing for us and we know that at least one other UK company is looking at production here.”Meldrum said the company was focusing on two broad categories of chickpea varieties: kabuli, which are the pale smooth round peas with which most of us are familiar, and desi, which have brown skins and are smaller and more wrinkled. Desi chickpeas are generally split and used to make chana dal and gram flour. Kabuli are canned or sold dried and sold whole, and also used to make chickpea flour (which has a significantly different flavour to gram flour).“Chickpeas are a marginal crop in the UK,” Meldrum said, “and when we first tried them they seemed very risky – more likely to fail than succeed. It feels like that’s changing and the likelihood of success is weighted slightly in our favour now. Five years ago we were looking at failed trial plots and wondering whether chickpeas were a step too far.”Two years ago the company launched the UK’s first commercial crops of lentils.

The company has repeatedly distanced itself from the Proud Boys, describing them as “counter to our beliefs and the people we work with”.But the problem is bigger than Fred Perry alone. There are dozens of other brands today that are either intentionally selling clothing with far-right messaging or have been co-opted by the far right because of the symbolic resonance of their logos. This isn’t entirely new: the British brand Lonsdale became popular in German far-right scenes decades ago, for example, when youth discovered that a half-zipped bomber jacket over a Lonsdale T-shirt displayed the letters “NSDA” – the first four letters of the German initials of the Nazi party.The past few years have seen a dramatic shift in the aesthetics of far-right extremism, as the far right has all but abandoned the shaved heads and combat boots of racist skinheads in favour of a broader style that blends in with the mainstream. The new aesthetic includes T-shirts and hoodies laced with coded far-right symbols sold by for-profit brands as well as the suits, jeans and haircuts popularised by the American “alt right”.Smartness of dress has long been a far-right smokescreen: Hugo Boss, after all, manufactured the Nazi party’s brown shirts and uniforms, using pristine tailoring to mark a stark departure from the combat fatigues and drab colours typically favoured by armies. The Nazis wanted fashion to communicate military strength and aggression. The shaved heads, bomber jackets and combat boots that postwar neo-Nazis co-opted from British working-class youth in the 1980s aimed for the same aggressive impression, creating a uniform aesthetic that would come to dominate the far-right’s youth scene for three decades. You can’t blame observers, then, for being surprised by the pressed khakis and white polo shirts worn by dozens of young men bearing flaming torches and chanting “Jews will not replace us” as they marched in Charlottesville in 2017. But the clean-cut look wasn’t coincidental. Far-right leaders knew all too well that the public would struggle to connect hate with a style of dress that looked more like the kid next door than the neo-Nazi of their imagination. So in the days leading up to the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, a prominent neo-Nazi blogger instructed marchers to dress respectably, noting that their appearance was more important than their ideas in getting people to listen.The transformation in aesthetics and style is part of a deliberate, top-down tactic on the part of the far right to appear more mainstream in order to make the public more receptive to their ideas. This shift normalises and disrupts the public’s ideas about what extremists look like and makes it harder to interpret and recognise the far right’s ideas as extreme.The strategy wouldn’t have worked if it weren’t so appealing to a younger generation of people open to the far right but eager to shed the stigma of the skinhead look and blend into the mainstream. Having come of age in the social media era, young people are hyper-conscious about their own appearance and personal brand. Mainstreaming the aesthetic not only helps soften the far right’s message to outsiders, but also changes the conception of outsider and insider – enabling people to slip in and out of far-right modes in ways that would have been impossible in the past.Today’s far-right youth can be mainstream in their appearance, but extreme in their ideas. This is a radical change from the racist skinhead era, when the far right’s “uniform” aesthetic made extreme ideological views more transparent to teachers, employers, parents and peers.What should companies do when they are co-opted by groups they find abhorrent? Typical strategies for brands have included formally distancing themselves from violent or ideologically extreme groups or trying to hire celebrity influencers to reclaim the brand. Such tactics have mixed success.Instead, companies can take a cue from Lonsdale’s approach. After Lonsdale was co-opted by German far-right youth, the company refused to deliver clothing to shops associated with the far-right scene, funded counter-far right programmes and launched a pro-tolerance campaign: “Lonsdale loves all colours”. In turn, anti-racist supporters decided they should support Lonsdale and started wearing the brand. This effectively disrupted the significance of the logo, making it impossible to identify only with the far right.Brand ambassadors and consumers can put pressure on companies to do more than issue public statements disavowing the values and actions of extremist groups who favour their products. Using the profits they earn from those groups to fund initiatives that counter hate is one place to start.• Cynthia Miller-Idriss is professor of education and sociology at the American University in Washington, DC, and author of The Extreme Gone Mainstream"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6e9b3a2249b6acfd442995ad908ead5198aa39f/0_0_4450_2671/master/4450.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b44d274521a5d16946b9515249b9a5c","title":"i have been begged to do strictly come dancing heres why i turned it down","story":"There were more reasons for me not to take part than there are sequins on all the outfits of all the ballroom dancers in the worldOnce upon a time, when I was presenting The One Show, I used to get asked – begged, even – to do Strictly Come Dancing. On one occasion, a couple of channel executives, who have since moved on, took me to dinner to try to talk me into it. They even pulled out glossy 10x8 photographs of the new professional dancers. I am sure this wasn’t their intention – they were just trying to enthuse me about the whole production – but to anyone looking on from another table it must have looked as though they were inviting me to take my pick.There were more reasons for me not to do Strictly than there are sequins on all the outfits of all the ballroom dancers in the whole wide world. It is not so much the dancing itself. In fact, I am a quite brilliant dancer. My problem is that I can do it only when no one is watching – not even me. Seriously: I can’t even look at myself in the mirror doing it. One day this summer, I was looking after my friend’s cockapoo, Hugo, and, close though we are, I couldn’t dance in front of him. I went to pieces.But, home alone, shimmying around beautifully, I know I am a simply superb mover. It is just that, as soon as a set of eyeballs alights on me, it is game over. As for actual dancefloors, I become paralysed with shame and embarrassment, quite unable to move at all.The thing I find especially difficult is the process of taking to the floor the transition between not dancing (ie walking) and dancing. It just seems ludicrous to me, if not as ludicrous as the opposite transition, between dancing and not dancing. Do you just stop abruptly? Or try to segue from a dance to a walk? It is too much for me to contend with.As I say, though, the problem with Strictly wouldn’t have been the dancing. Given enough practice, I could have had a bash. At least there are definite starting and stopping points to every routine, so my transition anxiety wouldn’t come into it. No, it is all the smiling that I couldn’t manage.How do they do it? I find it hard to smile at the best of times, especially while I am concentrating. I do a lot of inward smiling, but that is no good for anything but a scowly tango. As for those outfits, I can’t abide anything see-through, tight or glittery. Just writing those words has me goosefleshing all over.And one other thing: a famous young male TV presenter who had previously been on Strictly once took me aside and said: “Look, what you’ve got to understand is that it’s impossible to be rubbing up so close to your partner without getting aroused.” I like to think this wouldn’t have been the case with me. However, every time I hear that theme music, a mental image of myself dad-dances into view. I am smiling grotesquely, dancing incompetently and plainly struggling with the, er, tightness of my costume. It is horrible.Anyway, back in the day, I ran the idea of going on Strictly past my kids. “No, no, no,” they said. “Absolutely not.” It was a good call.•Adrian Chiles is a writer, broadcaster and  columnist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dd44751f5c41f8a35fa216a2f0d786b344b0524/0_56_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=383844112de0655675aa76ba6960445a","title":"parliament brexit prorogue mps alternative no deal","story":"“A constitutional outrage”, declared the Speaker, John Bercow “a very British coup”, said the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. Not to be outdone, Nicola Sturgeon added “the day any semblance of British democracy died”. Some have compared the situation to 1628, when Charles I prorogued parliament before dispensing with its services entirely. But Charles I was not, unless the history books are grievously mistaken, faced with the problem of implementing the outcome of a referendum.It is time perhaps to tone down the rhetoric and consider the facts. The five-week prorogation appears longer than it is because it includes the three weeks of the party conference season, when parliament does not normally sit. Parliament therefore loses two weeks. In 2014 there was a longer prorogation of 20 days, though that included the period of the European parliament elections and the Whitsun recess.But of course the objection to prorogation has less to do with the time lost than its alleged purpose, frustrating the will of parliament. That the prime minister has unreasonably used his prerogative power to advise the Queen will, no doubt, form the basis of an approach to the courts. Whether that approach succeeds or not, the political dilemma remains: that parliament has willed the end of Brexit without willing the means.In 2017, parliament empowered the prime minister to invoke article 50 by the massive majority of 384 votes when MPs passed the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act. But in 2019, the Commons rejected the withdrawal agreement three times. The EU has responded that the agreement cannot be renegotiated. In logic, therefore, the only way to implement Brexit is without a deal. Since every member of the cabinet except for Priti Patel and Theresa Villiers voted at least once for the deal, they can hardly be blamed for the fact that a no-deal Brexit now seems the only logical alternative.The Commons, it is often said, is opposed to a no-deal Brexit. But it is also opposed, as shown by its votes, to a second referendum (which it rejected by an absolute majority) and membership of the internal market and the customs union, and it has shown no disposition to revoke article 50. The only positive policy MPs have supported is that embodied in the Brady amendment, calling for the Irish backstop to be replaced with alternative arrangements, something the EU declares it will not countenance. MPs may claim that they are losing vital sitting days in September and October. But they have had three years to come up with an alternative policy. They have failed to do so.Opponents of the government seek an extension of the Brexit date. But that is not in itself a policy. Two previous extensions have achieved nothing. Why should a third prove any different? Would MPs then accept the withdrawal agreement? Do they have the leverage to persuade the EU to alter its stance? Without an answer to these questions, a further extension is a mere empty aspiration. And were parliament to pass legislation preventing Britain leaving the EU without a deal, Brexit could be delayed for ever, since the Commons would then be free to reject every deal presented to it.The truth is that 650 MPs cannot make policy. Only the government can do that. The role of parliament is not to govern but to scrutinise those who do. That is especially the case with the treaty-making power. Indeed, parliament has not rejected a treaty since 1864. And parliament is in no position to renegotiate a treaty. It has never in modern times sought to do so. The EU can negotiate only with governments, not with a motley alliance of MPs who are themselves ided between remainers and soft Brexiteers.MPs have rejected the government’s flagship policy without providing any alternative. It is enabled to pursue this course because of the wretched Fixed-term Parliaments Act. Without that, Theresa May could have declared the deal a matter of confidence. That was what Edward Heath did in 1972 when he threatened a dissolution unless the European Communities bill was passed, securing in consequence a majority of eight on its second reading. Had May been able to do the same, the rebels would either have come to heel or there would have been a general election. But the threat of dissolution has now been removed from the prime minister’s armoury.Once MPs have rejected the flagship policy of any government, their obvious recourse is to remove it and replace it with one more to their liking. That requires a successful no-confidence vote and either an alternative government chosen from the existing House of Commons or, more likely, a general election so that the people can arbitrate. But Boris Johnson’s opponents seem unsure that they could carry such a no-confidence vote. So there is an institutional deadlock that threatens to prevent Johnson from breaking the Brexit deadlock. That can now be broken only by the EU. In fact I suspect that the long prorogation is directed as much at the EU as Westminster, to convince the EU that parliament will not be able to stop a no-deal Brexit.Looking at the sorry performance of the House of Commons elected in 2017, it is difficult to avoid remembering Winston Churchill’s condemnation of the parliaments of the 1930s as being “decided only to be undecided, resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all-powerful to be impotent”. Parliament has shown itself not to be the solution to Brexit but the problem. • Vernon Bogdanor is professor of government at King’s College London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf91804cb187ca6706d514dea9afa84399a454e2/0_0_3680_2208/master/3680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c89663b5d5163fd8acbb55debf3eb62","title":"polls labour election victory yougov tories tactical voting","story":"YouGov figures show the Tories have a 12-point lead. But a united remain front and tactical voting could topple themBut polling is only ever a snapshot of public opinion at any one point, and given the unpredictability of politics over the past half-decade, it would be naive to see an upcoming election as a done deal. If Johnson’s victory relies on a more united leave vote than remain vote, there are lots of ways it could come undone.However, with such a large group of voters clearly indicating they were willing to defect from the Conservatives over Brexit, this is clearly a block of voters the new prime minister needs to concern himself with. And if we end up in circumstances where Johnson can be accused of being weak on Brexit (for example if he were forced by parliament to delay Brexit until after 31 October) it is easy to see how these voters might abandon the Conservatives again.Even if the remain vote does remain ided, and the leave vote united, the remain parties could still try to combat the difficulties of first-past-the-post through electoral pacts. These would work by all bar one of the remain parties standing aside in marginal seats to allow the strongest party in that area a clean run against the Conservatives. The tactic was successfully used in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection last month, where Plaid Cymru and the Greens stood aside to help the Lib Dems gain the seat.The Labour party’s reluctance to go along with such a plan will make such pacts far less successful, although even if the parties don’t officially stand candidates down, they could still target their campaigning to more effectively combat the difficulties of first-past-the-post. In addition, we will likely see significant efforts to promote tactical voting by pro-remain forces.Johnson’s victory is like a three-legged stool – it relies on a united leave vote, a ided remain vote and a first-past-the-post electoral system that rewards the first and punishes the second. A Conservative majority is still the most likely outcome, but if any one leg fails, it can topple.• Chris Curtis is political research manager at YouGov"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5408cd0b3ca8b88ff00d3de7f4a018f2bb969acb/0_36_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82a79484ada0c2aa6065d9479bf217d5","title":"richard ayoade webchat","story":"The director, actor, author, presenter and overachiever is joining us for a webchat on 5 September at 12pm BSTIs there another actor who could deliver the line, “I came here to drink milk and kick ass, and I’ve just finished my milk” with as much deadpan aplomb as Richard Ayoade?Before he became a flipping household name as the painfully geeky Maurice Moss in The IT Crowd, the world has owed the actor, writer, director and flaneur a great debt.

It hopes to use the funds to become the first gin distillery in the world to run on hydrogen made from renewable energy rather than liquid petroleum gas.The Orkney gin project will use renewable electricity to run an electrolyser that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen.A spokesman for the distillery, which plans to make whisky in the future too, said it does not believe there is another distillery in the world capable of producing spirits with a smaller carbon footprint.The project could reduce emissions from the plant by about 86 tonnes of carbon every year, equivalent to the emissions from 10 homes or 18 cars.The same technology, at a much larger scale, could create “green” hydrogen to replace traditional high-carbon gases used in industry, or for transport fuels and heating.Lord Duncan, the climate change minister, said developing hydrogen technology means the UK will be able to reduce climate emissions from industry as it shifts to a cleaner economy. “It’s great to know we can all enjoy an environmentally friendly tipple while helping our planet as we press towards a net zero emissions economy by 2050,” Duncan said.The government expects hydrogen to play a major role in meeting the 2050 target because it can take the place of more polluting fuels. It plans to spend almost £400m on reducing industrial emissions, including plans to develop hydrogen technologies, most of which will be channelled into the steel and iron sector.The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy laid out plans for a £250m Clean Steel Fund to help cut emissions from the iron and steel industry, which make up a sixth of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions. It is seeking views on the design of the fund through an industry consultation that runs until late November.The department will also spend £100m to support a competition to find new ways for businesses to use low-carbon hydrogen, and £40m on a nationwide green technology fund."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79cf85ddb65acbe010d614d0d8d595774b35e66f/0_192_4592_2755/master/4592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cffca5f3af3c4ca9cd39acb0f98e708","title":"tell us about your treasured charity shop finds","story":"To celebrate Second Hand September we would like to see photos of your favourite charity shop clothesThis September Oxfam is asking people to opt out of buying new clothes and instead go for secondhand items from charity shops.

Our look is 1980s Camden punk. I mean, it’s not like we are Gucci or someone like that.” After meeting with the head gardener at the Gloucestershire royal estate, where there is a strong emphasis on recycling, the designers recruited a team of students from Oxford Brookes University to help harvest 3,000 nettle plants.“The Highgrove team are really relaxed, but it was hard work in hot weather,” says Vin. “You can’t wear shorts or short sleeves, or you’d get stung to death.”When the 10 or so pieces of nettle clothing make it on to the catwalk of the Savoy, on the last day of London Fashion Week, what the audience will see is a “fabric you might think was a type of alpaca, or maybe a very fine fleece”, says Omi. “It’s a wispy, airy sort of texture – you wouldn’t recognise it as nettle at all. That’s the whole point, to make a contemporary garment out of a waste material.”Nettle fibres have been woven into fabric since Roman times, but the designers worked on a new technique whereby the fibrous strings from each stalk were developed into a fluffy, wool-type fibre and processed with environmentally friendly saltwater bleach to take out the green. Jewellery worn with the nettle dresses has also been made from Highgrove plant waste.“What we like about nettles is that they have no value,” says Omi. “Hopefully that challenges the way we think about fashion. Nettles are everywhere, they are a weed, they are an abundant natural resource in this country.

But it needs to happen at an earlier stage,” she said. “It starts from financing. It starts with studios opening up their systems to more erse directors. We’ve seen a lot of women prove themselves, like Brie Larson who is carrying a huge film and showing it can make box office.”Al-Mansour – who joined the kingdom’s General Authority for Culture, a body that oversees cultural and artistic development in Saudi Arabia – in 2018, spoke of the differing attitudes towards male and female directors in the film industry.“A lot of women do a hit Sundance movie and it takes 10 years before they do another movie,” she said. “Then a male director makes a hit Sundance movie and he will move straight into making $30m movies. He makes that film and his career develops and moves. There is a crack in the system now, and we need to capitalise on it … it’s the only way.”The director became emotional when discussing the changes that she hopes can happen for young women in Saudi Arabia and the rest of the world. “We should come together as women and support each other,” she said.“I think cultivating that sisterhood is the beginning of a real feminist movement at heart where we can empower a younger generation to not have to work as hard as we did to assert themselves. To come to the workplace and be respected. I want my daughter to enjoy a place like that in the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e99230018fe1782844f1da1ed4c1f40c4629ff5/0_273_4422_2654/master/4422.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95af1110a8d14f3e95ba5708c15b6bbd","title":"eat much less meat top vegan tips from worlds tastiest cuisines","story":"While veganism is growing rapidly in the west, other parts of the world have had meat-free cuisines for centuries. For a rich and varied plant-based diet, talk to the Chinese, Indians, Ethiopians … Like most revolutions, the current surge in meat-free eating takes much of its energy from its newness. This is a hip and sexy break with the past, a movement with Silicon Valley solutions to the historic restrictions of a meat-free diet.Consequently, we hear a lot about trashy vegan street food, plant-based wellness and futuristic “bleeding” burgers, but little from those nations where meat-light, vegetarian and vegan food has flourished for centuries. It is bizarre. Such cuisines offer huge inspiration for anyone keen to increase the creativity and flavour of their meat-free cooking. The chef Andrew Wong is baffled by western food manufacturers pouring money into developing mock meats. “Why waste your time R\u0026ampDing this stuff? It’s been done. Just go into Chinatown,” advises the chef-owner at London’s Michelin-starred A Wong.Since Buddhism’s arrival in China about 2,000 years ago, regularly abstaining from meat has been a feature of Chinese life. Wong says a meat-minimal approach to eating is now “ingrained”.“In every province and echelon of society, people understand food is medicine and eating too much meat is not good. In old recipes, there’s never a massive amount of protein. My grandmother would cook vegetable dishes and use a small amount of meat as a lubricating source of oil.”In the Forbidden City’s imperial court, that absence of meat spawned highly playful food theatre in which other ingredients were used to mimic meat. Today, Chinese chefs and food producers simulate meat and fish textures using vegetables, gluten and tofu in endless ingenious dishes and products. In these, mushrooms might pass for eel or offal, for instance, or gently cooked egg whites for crab meat.Despite being widely available in the UK’s Chinese supermarkets, many of the core ingredients in this cooking are little known outside Chinese kitchens. “When westerners think of tofu,” Wong says, “they think of one hard, claggy 80s product, not the variety and finesse in 50 types of tofu all specific to inidual dishes. Now you can get tofu as smooth as creme brulee. Bean curd skin, a tofu by-product, is versatile, too. You can fry and crisp it, steam things in it to give them a skin-like texture or cook it over fire, to create this crunchy, cheesy, stringy thing.”All this mimicry is underpinned by numerous fermented ingredients that build umami flavours into dishes: “Bean curd or chilli bean paste, dried black beans, preserved dried vegetables – these all add layers of savouriness that fool your brain into thinking there must be meat there.”Some Ethiopian staples, such as injera, a tangy, pancake-like bread made from fermented batter, can take years to master. “Sometimes, even I don’t get what I really want,” laughs Melaku, who uses wheat flour, not the traditional teff, in her injera. Export, she believes, is exacerbating the soaring cost of teff back home, so she adapted: “Why do I need to bring teff from my people, taking what they can’t even afford? I can’t do it.”However, from breakfast beso, a pan-toasted barley flour porridge, to tikil gomen, a cabbage and fried potato dish seasoned with whole jalapeño, there are easier ways into Ethiopian cooking. On fasting days, families often enjoy beyaynetu, inidual vegetarian platters where dishes such as fasolia (green beans in tomato sauce), gomen (simmered greens), shiro (a highly seasoned chickpea flour paste similar in texture to pease pudding) and thick, spicy wat stews are all served on an injera flatbread.From misir (red lentil) to atakilt (cabbage, potato and carrot), wat stews of just a few ingredients, perfumed with hot berbere spice mix, are central to Ethiopian cooking. Find a high-quality berbere and take time with the wat’s onion base. The onions must be finely chopped and gently sweated until utterly broken down, which can take over an hour. “We do everything by the book and by hand,” says Melaku.Mayur Patel, co-owner of the northern Bundobust restaurants, insists the Gujarati food he grew up on is “simpler than it’s made out. All the ingredients are available in Asian supermarkets everywhere and we don’t use dozens of spices. It’s more about how you combine and cook them – say, adding the garam masala at the beginning or end, which creates completely different flavours.”You do not need to understand the Ayurvedic roots of meat-free Hindu cooking (certain “hot” foods are thought to dangerously excite the senses, yet fresh green chillies are somehow “calming”) to get to grips with Patel’s beloved dhal baht, “like Indian gravy that you add to rice”, or bataka shak, a dry-fried potato curry. Instead, you need to stock up on seasonings (mustard seed, fenugreek, coriander powder, cumin, asafoetida and curry leaves), buy a pressure cooker to speed up all those lentils you will be cooking and, importantly, perfect your tempering to either start a curry or finish one with a flourish.“Starting by tempering oil with fenugreek seeds, mustard seeds and ground onion is fundamental. That gives you that savoury, jammy, umami flavour, like Marmite. Then, as you add fresh ingredients – green beans, aubergines, potato – you get different textures coming out. Okra, for instance, really thickens the base. It’s like making a cocktail, combining and blending vegetables. I think that gives you more creative space than basing a dish on one simple protein.”It is a learning process. But you have Google and a head start, in that most Britons are familiar with the flavours of Indian food, if not the vast hinterland of Indian regional or even Gujarati cooking. Patel, for instance, is obsessed by his mum’s khandvi, pillowy pasta-like rolls made with gram flour and yoghurt.Salvo’s serves 19 vegetarian dishes and 10 meat-free sides. The Leeds Italian has a dedicated vegan menu, too. The co-owner Gip Dammone relays these stats to demonstrate how, as the son of southern Italians – mum from Campania, dad from Sicily – he has a love of high-quality seasonal vegetables and vegetable dishes in his DNA.The Dammone family lived in Salerno in the 70s: “We were almost naturally vegetarian without knowing. Meat was an expensive commodity, utilised sparingly. Mum would send me to the butcher’s, but I never ordered more than 100g of meat. A meat ragu wasn’t a load of mince you’d be excited to find a scrap of meat in there. We’d have mainly bread meatballs or often ‘meatballs’ made with diced, fried aubergine.”In the poorer Italian south, families had learned to cook without (much) meat and, making a virtue of a necessity, use every last scrap of the beautiful produce growing in the rich volcanic soils of Puglia and Campania. Turnip tops went into pasta with capers and anchovies bitter lettuces were stewed with garlic, oil and water “ amazing” quarter-inch-thick slices of aubergine (known as la carne del popolo, the meat of the masses), were dipped in egg, floured and fried, years before the cauliflower steak. On the courgette-mad Cilento coast, you would see sliced courgettes drying on balconies, so when they were fried, they browned quickly: “They know how to process veg in southern Italy.”Understandably, Dammone is mystified by meat substitutes such as seitan: “It’s like boiling dough. There’s a better mouthful in a lot of veg.” This is something he is reminded of every time he visits Italy, where “vegetables are still revered in their own right”. Could demanding far better vegetables be the key to unlocking Britain’s meat-free future?Jamaica: Ital, a belief system focused on increasing “livity” or life-energy, whose purest adherents eat only organic, vegan food, developed alongside Rastafarianism in 30s Jamaica. Check out the bean and pumpkin curries and stews at Negril in Brixton, south London, or Liverpool’s street-food outfit Ital Fresh. Think jerk-marinated cauliflower wings.Vietnam: In Vietnam, Mahayana Buddhist dietary rules gave rise to dedicated meat-free dishes and veggie versions of everyday staples, such as banh mi sandwiches and noodle bowls. For his much-praised book Vegetarian Việt Nam (£25, WW Norton), Cameron Stauch spoke to monks and home cooks to get the skinny on daily dishes and specials, such as the Twelve Predestined Affinities Salad."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01b5ee90c6ccfe297c466332bcda62c00f874b17/84_337_2476_1486/master/2476.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ee7f42a8b1f9cc366f6528bb1574eaa","title":"lewis hamilton invests in meat free chain neat burger","story":"F1 star teams up with night club impresario and an early investor in plant-based meat substitutesThe Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton has teamed up with a night club impresario and an early investor in a plant-based meat substitute to back a meat-free burger chain.Neat Burger, which willopen its first outlet just off London’s Regent Street on Monday, is currently raising up to £15m to fund expansion. It has lined up restaurants in Covent Garden and Kings Cross, is planning a US launch next year and aiming to open 14 outlets around Europe over the next two years.Hamilton’s co-investors are the Italian entrepreneur Tommaso Chiabra – one of the first backers of the US vegan burger maker Beyond Meat – and Ryan Bishti,who owns the Cirque le Soir nightclubs in London, Manchester, Barcelona and Mykonos, and is also redeveloping Soho’s iconic Windmill club.Bishti said: “We are not aiming for vegans or a plant-based niche, we are aiming to convert meat eaters. We are part of a movement happening when you look at the world today in the Amazon with deforestation for crops and agri-farming. This is a perfect way to make a change.”Bishti said Neat Burger’s chefs had spent 10 months working with the Los Angeles-based Beyond Meat to develop their own patty based on the US company’s plant-based burger mix.It has previously teamed up with the UK restaurant chain Honest Burgers on a vegan burger and is also working with KFC in the US, to produce a meat-free version of the fast food chain’s chicken nuggets and wings.With the number of UK vegans soaring from 150,000 in 2014 to 600,000 in 2018, according to the Vegan Society, and many more people opting to go meat-free a few times a week, manufacturers, supermarkets and restaurants are scrambling to cash in on the expanding market.The consumer goods giant Unilever bought the meat substitute company the Vegetarian Butcher, while Greggs is working on vegan versions of all its bestselling products, from steak bakes to pasties and doughnuts, after the success of a vegan sausage roll.Hamilton, who stopped eating meat in 2017, has a significant stake in Neat, according to Bishti, who is the majority owner of the business with Chiabra.The driver is the UK’s richest sportsperson with a fortune of some £187m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.

Here experts explain how to improve everything from food to financesNotebooks that smell of fresh paper, purchased in the stationery shop. Uniform laid out neatly on a chair a rucksack packed, checked and rechecked. No matter how old you get, the memory of the start of the school year never leaves you. The butterfly nerves of a new teacher and classroom an exhilarating jump that quickly becomes routine.But what if we adults used September as the opportunity for a reset? Because, after the excesses of the summer – sugary cocktails knocked back by a pool and gut-busting barbecue plates loaded up night after night – September can be a time for a much-needed refresh. We asked experts for their advice on how to get your year back on track, whatever your age.New year fitness resolutions are as predictable as the tides: they come and go, but rarely stick. Instead of waiting until January to purchase a gym membership that will go unused come March, set good behaviour patterns now, while the weather is better and daylight are hours longer.“Book the time out in your diary, and treat it like a work meeting that can’t be missed,” says Sarah Overall, a personal trainer. Although it is tempting to go full throttle, a measured approach is better. “Don’t try to binge on exercise and do five sessions in your first week,” Overall says. “Be sensible. Put in two sessions for your first week back, with a few days break in between.” Aim to build up to four workouts a week.Even if you haven’t spent the summer months gorging yourself, September is a good time to refocus your eating habits, away from the diet culture messaging that is so pervasive in the new year. “Get stuck into normality – whatever that is for you,” advises Priya Tew, a dietitian . “Find a good routine for yourself – so three meals a day that are a balanced mixture of fruit, vegetables, wholegrains, proteins and healthy fats.”If you feel you have overindulged on holiday, don’t go on a fad diet. “They don’t work,” says Tew. “They just lead to people falling off the wagon and feeling rubbish about themselves. Rather than falling into that trap of yo-yo dieting, make smaller, sustainable changes.” This might mean increasing your fruit and vegetables by one portion a day, or reaching for healthy snacks such as carrots and hummus instead of the biscuit tin.It is a good idea to set aside some time each week to meal plan, and bulk cooking can help a new routine to stick. “That way, you’re not standing in the kitchen figuring out what to eat,” says Tew. If you are trying to save money from your weekly shop, frozen and tinned food are your friends. “They can be a lot cheaper and provide you with really good nutrition for your body,” she says. Add in a tin of lentils where you would usually use meat for a healthy and cost-saving measure.Whereas the summer often means staying up late or tossing and turning in the sweltering heat, autumn is the ideal time to get sleep back on track. If you are concerned you’re not hitting that magic eight-hour target, remember that there is no one-size-fits-all approach. “Sleep needs are inidual,” says Dr Ari Manuel, a sleep and ventilation consultant at Aintree University NHS trust. Most people will need seven to nine hours a night, but each person’s needs vary. If you wake up feeling exhausted or are often tired during the day, you may be sleep deprived.This can be remedied through good sleep hygiene. “It is about understanding the rhythms of your own sleep and your circadian rhythms,” Manuel says. “When you have signals from your body that it is tired, you should respect them and not push through. Recognise that the night is for relaxation, restoration and sleep.”Go to bed at the same time on weekends and weekdays. “Wind down from technology before sleep, don’t eat too much heavy food or exercise late at night, and have a cool, dark and quiet bedroom,” Manuel says. Your bedroom should be a place for rest and sex and nothing else. Make sure to disconnect from the outside world in the hour before bed. “It is about accepting that this is a time for you to relax and go to sleep – this is your time and no one else’s.” Which means no aimless social media scrolling in bed.There is growing concern about the impact of blue light from screens before bedtime, but Manuel says this misses the point: all light, even from the streetlight outside your window, can disrupt sleep. It might help to invest in a blackout blind or an eye mask.If you’re feeling the pinch after the summer break, now is a good time to think about your financial health, says Jason Butler, a personal finance expert and author of Money Moments: Simple Steps to Financial Well-being.Consider your spending. “One of the reasons people don’t get ahead financially is because they’ve never really addressed their relationship with money,” says Butler. Do you equate spending with feeling good about yourself? Or are you a “passive spender” who never bothers to check the prices of things?Set aside half a day to take stock: could you switch your utility bills to a cheaper provider? Do you really need that pricey phone contract? It may seem tedious, but when you think about the potential savings, it is well worth it. “You might save yourself £500 a year – how many people earn that much in half a day?”Say no to expensive social events that aren’t important to you. Turn off one-step purchasing online to curb impulse buys. “It’s not about becoming a monk and locking yourself away,” Butler says, “but you need to be clear about what you can afford.”And if you are not able to save any money, consider how you can increase your earnings. “If you don’t warrant a pay rise,” says Butler, “think about what you can do: do you need more training? Are there other steps you can take to become more valuable to your employer? Or do you need to retrain and get a new, better-paid job?”It is common to not want to rush back to the office after a summer break. But if the thought of returning to work fills you with panic, it may be time for a professional shakeup. The first step is to look at how you can improve your role, because it is easier to stay in a job than to look for new opportunities.“The ‘stop, start, continue’ method is really helpful,” says Zena Everett, an executive coach and career expert. “Think: what is it that I do that isn’t helping my career? What do I need to stop doing?” This might be as simple as eating lunch at your desk or not speaking up in meetings. Then identify what you need to start doing: develop new skills? Move departments? Get a promotion? Finally, think about how you can continue moving your career forward – which often means networking. “That doesn’t mean going to complicated networking events,” Everett says. “It just means keeping in touch with previous colleagues, grabbing cups of coffee with people and talking to people in different departments.”If you are certain you want to move jobs, work out where you add value. “There is no point in going into the jobs market and telling people what you don’t want to do,” says Everett. “That is not compelling. Think about what you’ve delivered and what your skillset is.” A good way to know your strengths is to think about what doesn’t get done when you’re out of the office – what do your colleagues wait for you to come back to do?If you are feeling very down about work, Everett suggests considering whether there may be other factors afoot. It is easy to attach all of life’s ills to a testy boss or punishing workload – but your job may not be the only thing making you miserable. “Is it a work thing, or something else? If you felt happy and motivated when you were on holiday, it’s probably work related. But if you were on holiday and still felt unhappy and unmotivated, it’s possibly a bigger issue – and changing jobs may not be the answer to everything.”“Periods of relaxation tend to bring up all sorts of thoughts about your relationships,” says Gurpreet Singh, a Relate counsellor. “People go on holiday and relax. When they come back, it’s a good idea to re-energise and think about what they want from their relationships.”Relationships should be viewed as something you need to work at – a piano that needs tuning – rather than something you can expect to take care of itself. “We’re often guilty of taking our romantic relationships for granted,” Singh says. “It’s easy to fall into a pattern – once the honeymoon period is over – of forgetting to spend time together. It’s a good idea to pause and say: ‘Where are we?’”Singh advises having such a conversation at a time when you’re both relaxed and not during an argument. If you are unhappy, explain what you would like to see change in the relationship, but don’t expect miracles overnight – they take time. “Be honest about what you’re unhappy about, and have the courage to engage in the idea of change,” says Singh. “A lot of people may be unhappy but they go on living the way they are, and think that things will get better on their own – but they don’t.” It needn’t take a dramatic change to get a relationship back on track – simple things such as improving how you communicate with each other or making time for a regular date night can be just as effective.It is not just romantic relationships that may need a reset. If you’re feeling lonely, resist the urge to try to make new friends and “invest in building the relationships you already have”, Singh suggests. “Family relationships can be improved with the right help and investment of time and effort,” he says. “But both people have to want to improve the relationship – you can’t do it alone.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcd8a9e86ddb1c18ba63c2d9624b45215ce924ea/0_22_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c42cc0abd2935671209331dc315ae69","title":"oliver most popular boys name in england and wales for sixth year","story":"Oliver and Olivia remain favourite names for boys and girls in England and WalesArthur has entered the top 10 boys’ names for the first time in almost a century, with the television gangster series Peaky Blinders believed to be the inspiration for some of the most popular baby names.While Arthur was the only new entry in the top 10 names for boys in 2018, replacing Jacob, Sophia and Grace replaced Poppy and Lily among the top 10 names for girls, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.“Oliver and Olivia remained the most popular baby names in 2018, although there are the first signs that Oliver’s six-year reign as the number one name for boys is under threat,” Nick Stripe, the head of life events at the ONS, said.“Arthur surged into the top 10 boys’ names for the first time since the 1920s, and Ada jumped into the girls’ top 100 for the first time in a century too, both perhaps inspired by characters in the BBC TV drama Peaky Blinders.”The names Ada and Arthur, popular in the early 1900s, appear to be undergoing a renaissance, with Peaky Blinders, which is currently airing its fifth series, featuring characters with those names.Ada climbed 49 places to become the 65th most popular name for girls in 2018 – the second largest rise within the top 100 names. Arthur has been rising within the top 100 names for boys since 2009 and was the seventh most popular name for boys last year.Despite ranking in 255th place, the name Cillian – Peaky Blinders’ lead character, Thomas Shelby, is played by the actor Cillian Murphy – has also been steadily growing in popularity, rising 295 places in the last five years.Olivia was the most popular name for girls in England and Wales, while Oliver was outranked by Muhammad in four of the nine English regions, and by Harry in north-east England.Grayson, Rowan and Tobias entered the top 100 names for boys in 2018 for the first time, while the girls’ names Delilah, Ayla and Margot – which rose fastest of all the most popular names – also made their first appearance among the 62,729 different names given to 657,076 newborns last year.Stripe added: “On the flipside, the growth in the use of technology assistants in our homes may help to explain why the number of baby girls named Alexa has more than halved compared with 2017. Communicating with young children can be hard enough at the best of times.”For the first time, the ONS also analysed how names vary depending on the age of the baby’s mother. Those aged 35 years and above tended to prefer more traditional names, compared with mothers under 25 who were more likely to choose non-traditional, shortened or hyphenated names.Archie, the name of Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex’s child, was the fourth most popular name for mothers under 25, far more popular than for mothers over 35.Hunter, the 44th most popular boys’ name in 2018, rose 34 places on the previous year. Amelia continued to be the second most common name for baby girls while Ava rose from fourth place in 2017 to third in 2018, swapping places with Isla."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a67023f09dbb4f8f666eabb2d6d45b86aaa9791/287_0_1978_1187/master/1978.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3dc40a993f6ab4e4f5e6e6e66bfd7f51","title":"is there a way out of the epstein mess prince andrew hasnt put his fat finger on it","story":"‘Sources close to’ the Duke of York have tried to cast doubt on his accuser by saying he has chubby digits. They’re going to have to do better than thatWho has the fattest fingers: Prince Andrew or the person who types his press releases? Without wishing to shock you, it’s possible that these two iniduals are sometimes the same person. Furthermore – and if your mind is already close to blowing, please look away now – it could be that the entities described as Prince Andrew’s “friends” in a sympathetic Evening Standard story on Wednesday are ALSO Prince Andrew himself. I know! He’s literally never worked harder. At the age of 59, he’s finally got a full-time job. Unfortunately, it’s convincing people he’s not a sex case.As you may know, Prince Andrew is currently what convention demands we style as “in the news for all the wrong reasons”. The story has long concerned his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender who, at the time of his death in jail earlier this month, was awaiting trial for running an international underage sex-trafficking operation. It also concerns Virginia Giuffre (then Roberts), who alleges she was recruited as a child as Epstein’s sex slave, and on whose bare hip Prince Andrew’s hand is pictured in a now-infamous photograph. Giuffre claims she was forced to have sex with the Duke of York three times when she was 17. He categorically denies this.But rather than Epstein’s apparent suicide making it all go away, the focus on the prince’s friendship with him, and its nature, has intensified. Some of Epstein’s private-jet logs, on which Prince Andrew’s name reportedly occurs several times, have been uncovered, while footage of the prince peering cagily round the door of Epstein’s New York mansion, some time after he was released from jail, has emerged. Last week, emails emerged in which a literary agent recounted seeing Andrew in said mansion, receiving a foot massage with Epstein, apparently from two well-dressed young Russian women. The duke was said to be complaining about public focus on his night-time activities.Perhaps troubled by the continuing inability to just make this shit go away, Buckingham Palace chose Sunday afternoon to put out a press release in which Andrew attempted to – what’s the euphemism?– clarify his position on a number of points. This turned out to be a curious document, different in layout from typical palace communications, and best described as a wildly disingenuous word salad. Milton it was not – although it did have the flavour of something proofread by him in his final years.Having been pored over, it was suspected by some royal watchers to be the work of Prince Andrew himself. Who can say? It wouldn’t be the first time, with the prince having occasional form for going over the heads of staff and issuing things himself. Either way, let’s take a look: “At no stage … did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction.” The suggestion seems to be that a court-convicted sex offender needs to commit his crimes physically in front of Prince Andrew for the prince to suspect he might be guilty of them.Moving on: “I can only reiterate my regret that I was mistaken to think that what I thought I knew of him was evidently not the real person, given what we now know.” Without wishing to raise the tone by quoting Steven Seagal in Under Siege: what is this babbling bullshit? You knew he had been convicted of procuring a 14-year-old girl for prostitution and served jail time for it, in a case with huge amounts of supporting evidence and the testimony of more than 50 women telling similar stories. The rest – all the rest – is bullshit. Especially the bit about caring about the victims. You know the best way to look like you give one hundredth of a toss about the victims of sex cases? Don’t be friends with the sex case in question! Don’t stay with them in their mansions, don’t get foot massages with them, don’t get filmed looking surreptitiously round the front door as a procession of very young women come and go! It just looks … bad.As indicated, this stuff isn’t complicated. But even if it were, it’s important to remember that, unlike most people who pay their taxes to support him being helicoptered between golf courses, Prince Andrew has a dedicated team of people whose job it is to advise him which one of his friends is a weapons-grade scumbag. I’m vaguely paraphrasing the official palace job description here. But it doesn’t matter if we call them public relations experts, background vetters, wrong ’un sniffer-outers, or simply sentient humans over the age of 18 who can read. The royal family has got a team of them, who would have made these points about Epstein very, very clearly and very, very often.Anyway, back to this week. Surprisingly, Prince Andrew’s oddly timed, unprofessional-reading statement didn’t make all the shit go away, just as grinning sweatily in the car seat next to his mother on the drive to the church at Balmoral the previous weekend hadn’t made all the shit go away, either. Again, to fall back on another news cliche, the press release “raised more questions than it answered”.Yet worse was to come. On Tuesday, more than 20 of Epstein’s accusers gathered to testify before a judge in a Manhattan hearing. Outside the courthouse, Giuffre declared of the prince: “He knows what he’s done and he can attest to that. He knows exactly what he’s done – and I hope he comes clean about it.” Her lawyer added that he’d made “multiple” requests to Prince Andrew to “answer real questions”.Well now. This is the route that bring us to this Wednesday’s debut of the “chubby fingers” defence. Even as the rest of the media were obsessing over the breaking news that Boris Johnson was to ask the Queen to prorogue parliament, the Standard went with a splash headlined: “Prince Andrew hits back over ‘witch hunt’: Duke of York insists claims by Epstein’s ‘sex slave’ are ‘categorically untrue’.” Yup, a three-scarequote headline. Your basic fairytale.Right off the bat, we need to note the timing of this, coming as it did as most media outlets were understandably taken up with prorogation – a course of executive action so clearly batshit and messed-up that Courtney Love is boggling at it. (“I love your country. This is insane. Crying,” she tweeted later that day.) In short, Wednesday lunchtime was a very good time to bury bad news. You know what’s best dealt with under cover of a constitutional crisis? That’s right! A nonce-titutional crisis.And with that piece of kidding around, it feels wise to proceed straight to vehement ducal denials. As the Standard had it: “A source close to the Queen’s second son responded to accuser Virginia Roberts – who declared yesterday: ‘He knows exactly what he’s done’ – by saying: ‘Yes, he does know exactly what he’s done ... nothing.’” As this defender went on: “He is guilty only of showing misplaced loyalty to a friend.” Mmm. Is this a version of the classic job interviewee’s answer to the question “What’s your worst quality?” “I would say loyalty’”? Damn straight. If loving our friends is wrong, then which of us wants to be right?Anyway: fat fingers. One “source” cited the famous photo of Prince Andrew with Giuffre and opted to tell the Standard: “Look at his fingers in the photo. The duke has quite chubby fingers, they don’t look right and nor does the height of the duke and the girl.”Is this … is this really, honestly what they’re going with? Finger girth? If so: wow.It feels very late in the day to be pointing this out to Prince Andrew and his “close friends”, but he is a senior royal, on the civil list, and the allegations surrounding him and the close friend he knew was a convicted sex offender are of an order requiring something more than a finger girth theory. Until that is grasped, the search for something to make all this shit go away continues. Do consider this story as “developing”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdecebd5c185b44c4ff713fba890d2b23d232d51/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e090ed0c1c828b33c9222e11e24fdd5","title":"andrew neil to front primetime politics roundup show on bbc","story":"New BBC Two show to launch on 4 September after presenter decided to leave late-night This Week Andrew Neil is to front a new political programme on BBC Two after stepping down from hosting his long-running politics show This Week earlier this year.The Andrew Neil Show will launch on Wednesday next week and will run through the autumn as the UK approaches its scheduled departure from the EU.The 30-minute programme will air at 7pm every Wednesday and will round up political events and feature interviews with key political players.This Week was taken off air in July after Neil, 70, decided to step down from late-night broadcasting.

Of the total, £340m was paid out in June alone.As many as 64m PPI policies were sold in the UK, but very often the cover was mis-sold. Banks and other financial institutions pushed the policies alongside loans, mortgages, credit cards and other deals.The FCA has been running a campaign to raise awareness of the deadline, leading to a more than fivefold increase in its website users and a near eightfold increase in calls compared with the previous nine weeks.

We rank her 22 singles, from her 1997 debut to 2017’s I’m BetterA ballad from the album Miss E … So Addictive, enlivened by its off-kilter rhythm and queasy-sounding sample, retooled as a tribute to Elliott’s late friend and collaborator Aaliyah. While the lyrics sort of fit their new purpose, the accompanying video bizarrely concludes with a version of party anthem 4 My People, apparently intended as Elliott’s comment on 911.A relative flop after a string of hits, perhaps because it abandoned the frenetic futurism of her most famous singles in favour of straight-up retro R\u0026ampB. Teary Eyed offered further proof that Elliott could really sing and packed a decent chorus without causing the seismic thrills of Lose Control or Work It.I’m Better arrived 20 years after Elliott’s debut single – an eternity in hip-hop – and found her paying lip service to current trends: a trap-influenced beat, a hint of slurred vowels about her delivery, lyrical references to “the bando”. Less innovative than her biggest hits, it is still home to some sharp lines: “Missy talk big I’m so grande … I just rant like I’m Kanye.”A heartbroken R\u0026ampB slow jam – featuring dimly remembered trio 702, for whom a pre-fame Elliott wrote songs – rendered into something alien-sounding: the rhythm stammers and never settles the instruments sound slightly off-key and Elliott’s voice floats ethereally over the top, lending its saga of a collapsing relationship a blank-eyed, disaffected air.A paean to hip-hop’s belated discovery of MDMA – “I wanna dance and lick your face,” offers Elliott, while guest vocalist Eve bemoans the ecstasy user’s perennial bugbear, drunks spoiling the vibe – 4 My People’s four-to-the-floor house beat has an authentically sweaty, wild-eyed quality, vastly superior to hip-hop’s subsequent dabblings in shiny pop-house.There is a boldness to Sock It 2 Me – which is based on a sample from the Delfonics’ Ready Or Not Here I Come, a song the world should have had its fill of following the Fugees’ chart-topping cover the previous year. But producer Timbaland warps the sample into a strange, disjointed new shape Missy sings and Da Brat offers a warp-speed guest appearance.Missy back in warped R\u0026ampB mode – a smart, witty take on the standard no-romance-without-finance lyric (“Talk is talk and talk is cheap  Tell it to her, don’t say it to me”), further brightened by the appearance of Outkast’s Big Boi, who goes from rapping about lingerie to issuing threats in archaic English (“I will jab thee and stab thee”).The brilliance of Missy Elliott’s exploration of the topic of premature ejaculation (spoiler: she is not terribly sympathetic) lies in the weirdness of its structure, at least in the version from the video. A minute before the end, it turns into a completely new track, dropping the G-funk synths for a propulsive, percussive, dancehall-influenced finale that is inexplicable and inspired.Subtle but sexy, the final single from Missy Elliott’s debut album is best heard in the remix used on its supernatural-themed video and the soundtrack to teen comedy Can’t Hardly Wait, where the low-riding funk of the rhythm track is disrupted by samples of neighing horses and eventually replaced by strings sourced from Björk’s Joga.Unfairly ignored, Elliott’s second single from the soundtrack of Step Up 2: The Streets was great: a clattering beat that nodded towards the kind of block-party breaks that inspired hip-hop in the first place, Missy hymning the potent effect of her “big old donkey” on any passing men.Haters beware: Elliott is in particularly raw-throated, bug-eyed form in a post-cameraphone but pre-social-media assault on privacy invasion and rumour-mongering that addressed questions about her sexuality. A Fatboy Slim remix highlighted the ultra-hooky chorus, but the best line might be one of Missy’s most inventive disses: “You soggy breasts, cow stomachs.”Missy Elliott was a groundbreaker, sonically and lyrically, turning hip-hop’s standard narrative of sexual power and limited notion of feminine beauty on its head. She does it here: paying tribute to her own gorgeousness on the dancefloor, before sending the guy she takes home packing: “You gets nowhere, just two blue balls down in your underwear.”For all its forward-thinking, Elliott’s sound frequently paid homage to hip-hop’s roots. Never more so than here: We Run This is a thrilling reworking of Michael Viner’s Incredible Bongo Band’s b-boy anthem Apache, tricked out with a blaring horn section, filled with call-and-response vocals that sounds like a guaranteed party-starter.The saga of Missy Elliott’s still-unreleased seventh album – endlessly delayed by ill-health and artistic indecision – begins here, 11 years ago. A head-turning cacophony of airhorns, electronic noise and dub-influenced effects complete with a return to Work It’s backwards-masked vocals, it is hard not to think it would have been a hit six years earlier.Despite a $2m video, the first single from Elliott’s second album, Da Real World, was a relative flop, which may have had less to do with its quality than the sonic risks Elliott and Timbaland were taking. She’s a Bitch is stripped back to almost nothing, a two-note riff that repeats throughout, never changing, and some abstract electronic strings: it is all it needs.The best single from Da Real World. Everyone who appears on the hit remix version – Nas, Q-Tip, Eve – turns in a stellar performance, but the real star is the song itself: Elliott’s breathy, consumed-by-lust vocal chafing against the lyrics’ hard-eyed monetary concerns the backing, with its low-key but addictive steel pan sample and willingness to let the beat drop away into silence.After a sporadic series of promotional releases that failed to attract much attention, WTF was a million-seller. You can see why. Pharrell Williams’ beat recalls the Neptunes’ early 00s imperial phase, while Elliott sounds imperious as she ponders cultural appropriation and offers fair warning to young pretenders: “Blah-blah-blah, you best go rewrite your bars.”By now, Elliott and Timbaland were adept at the alchemical business of making hugely exciting hit singles out of deeply unlikely ingredients. Lose Control variously features 80s electro-inspired synths and a drum machine, Ciara sweetly cooing an old-fashioned R\u0026ampB hook and Fatman Scoop shouting his head off. Shouldn’t work works perfectly.It is worth considering the hip-hop era in which The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly) appeared. It was the year of Puff Daddy’s I’ll Be Missing You, Will Smith’s Big Willie Style and Jay-Z’s pop-facing In My Lifetime: not the ideal moment for a female rapper clad in a bin liner to release a weird, sparse debut single. Its Ann Peebles sample provided a hook, but more important was how boldly it announced a stereotype-smashing, unique talent.Amid the sonic pyrotechnics of her greatest singles, it is easy to overlook what a fantastic rapper Missy Elliott can be. The brilliant Pass That Dutch is primary evidence – a sinister, sparse backing track with a Technicolor vocal performance: at turns insouciant, commanding, intense and very funny, complete with a faux acceptance speech.Influenced by old school hip-hop – it samples Run DMC and Rock Master Scott \u0026amp the Dynamic Three alongside Blondie’s Heart of Glass – but with its eyes fixed firmly on the future, Work It’s mélange of backward vocals, elephant samples and lyrics that would later have been labelled “body positive” is totally fantastic: joyous and ahead of its time.It is a close-run thing, but Get Ur Freak On just shades it as Missy Elliott’s greatest single. A spare, supremely confident Top 10 masterclass in being simultaneously audacious and commercial, its relentless six-note sample – bhangra with a hint of drum’n’bass – keeps dropping out, leaving blank space in which Elliott can roar, whisper and shush her detractors. Horror-movie-soundtrack electronics hover ominously in the background, while voices speaking in Hindi and Japanese weave in and out of the mix. And Elliott is on fire: there is something about the don’t-even-try message to her competitors that feels bound up with the way Get Ur Freak On sounds: an artist who knows she has made a strange, groundbreaking, utterly compelling masterpiece.Actors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema - ranked!Michael Caine\u0027s best films - ranked!The 10 best Glenn Close movies - ranked!Tom Cruise - top 20 movies - ranked!Judi Dench - every film - ranked!Ryan Gosling movies - ranked!10 best Hugh Grant films - ranked!Nicole Kidman’s top 10 films - ranked!The best and the worst Jennifer Lopez films - ranked!All Helen Mirren\u0027s 61 movies - ranked!Robert Redford\u0027s greatest screen roles - ranked!Winona Ryder\u0027s 20 best films - ranked!Movie Santa Clauses - ranked!Jason Statham - every film - ranked!Emma Thompson\u0027s best films - ranked!Biopics trashed by families, friends and fans - ranked!Purr evil: cats in movies with hidden agendas - ranked!Dog weepie movies - ranked!Top 20 J-horror films - ranked!Movies that have grossed more than $1bn - ranked!Palme d\u0027Or winners - ranked!The scariest horror films ever - ranked!The best Shakespeare films - ranked!The 10 best movie shark performances - ranked!The best Stephen King movies\u0026nbsp - ranked!From Trolls to Transformers: toy films – ranked!Worst holidays in cinema - ranked!James Bond on film – 007\u0027s best and worst movies - ranked!The 20 best Marvel films - ranked!Top 10 Merchant Ivory films - ranked!Pixar - every film ever made - ranked!Planet of the Apes - the best and worst of the movies - ranked!Star Wars - every film - ranked!The 20 best music documentaries - ranked!The weirdest Brits performances - ranked!Game of Thrones - every episode - ranked!Oscar nominees - the weirdest ever - ranked!Oscar snubs - the 20 greatest ever - ranked!The biggest Rock \u0026amp Roll Hall of Fame snubs ever - ranked!Super Bowl half-time shows - the 10 greatest - ranked!The best X Factor finalists - ranked!From Niall Horan\u0027s toast to Russell Crowe’s jockstrap: celebrity auction items - ranked!All Abba\u0027s UK singles - ranked!Every one of Madonna\u0027s 78 singles - ranked!Kate Bush – every UK single - ranked!Missy Elliott\u0027s solo singles – ranked!Queen\u0027s 50 UK singles - ranked!Taylor Swift\u0027s singles - ranked!The Who: their UK singles - ranked!Black Sabbath - every album - ranked!David Byrne – (almost) all of his albums - ranked!Miles Davis\u0027s 20 greatest albums – ranked!Lil Wayne\u0027s albums - ranked!Every Mercury prize-winning album - ranked!Joni Mitchell\u0027s albums – ranked!The Rolling Stones – every album - ranked!10 best Paul Simon albums - ranked!Bruce Springsteen\u0027s albums - ranked!Kanye West – every album - ranked!Stevie Wonder\u0027s albums - ranked!20 greatest breakup songs ever - ranked!Aphex Twin\u0027s best songs - ranked!Barry Manilow – all his greatest songs - ranked!Cher\u0027s 30 greatest songs - ranked!The 30 greatest Disney songs –\u0026nbspranked!Elton John\u0027s 50 greatest songs - ranked!From Drake to Wet Wet Wet: songs with 10 weeks at No 1 - ranked!From MC5 to Jeff Mills: the greatest Detroit tracks ever - ranked!Giorgio Moroder\u0027s 20 greatest songs - ranked!Nirvana\u0027s 20 greatest songs - ranked!The best songs from teen movies - ranked!The best UK garage tracks - ranked!The greatest banned songs of all time - ranked!The greatest ever female rap tracks - ranked!The greatest pop music dance crazes - ranked!All 43 Spice Girls songs - ranked!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b5a3b8ed588960a0173deec5fde9da69607c437/0_184_4392_2636/master/4392.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63107758f1d54ca423dd773bec8c3b08","title":"eu citizens are you experiencing settled status issues in the uk","story":"If you have encountered problems applying to the EU settlement scheme or your application has been denied, share your stories with usEU citizens living in Britain have asked the government for clarification on their status in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

And if Corbyn, or anybody else, is unable to form an administration that can command a majority of MPs supporting it, there will be a general election in any case.That does not, however, permanently rule out a no-deal Brexit – there is no guarantee what the result of that election would be.The alternative is that Johnson does not face – or wins – a vote of no confidence. The timetable would then proceed along the lines that the prime minister has set out. Parliament will be suspended during the week of 9 September and negotiations with the EU can continue during the party conference season.On 14 October, MPs will return to the House of Commons for a Queen’s speech setting out Johnson’s domestic priorities. Three days later, Johnson will go to a European council meeting of the EU27, at which he would want them to agree a new deal. If the EU does not agree a new deal, the legal default is still that the UK would leave the bloc on 31 October without a deal.At 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a “third country” in terms of relations with the EU, with no over-arching post-Brexit plan in place, and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn orce payment.The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports – making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO ‘most favoured nation’ rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods – they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to ten years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement (FTA) is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally – the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azevêdo, has told Prospect magazine that in simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none.Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses – eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a ‘managed’ no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.If the EU does agree a new deal, Johnson would have a few days for MPs to debate and agree to it. The UK would then leave the EU with a deal, and all the signs are that Johnson would most likely call a general election shortly afterwards.If MPs do not pass the deal – they rejected Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement three times – then the UK would again default to leaving without a deal on 31 October.It is important to note, of course, that whatever the outcome on 31 October, this will not be the end of Brexit by a long stretch. The deal only sets out what happens during a transition period, during which the government will want to negotiate a new free-trade agreement with the EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/429dcb2bd2913cb9ebd8e6feb8c6e341be439a63/0_472_5306_3184/master/5306.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f35e81c31508e33f505985701421f627","title":"scientists quash idea of single gay gene","story":"Many genetic variants each play role in homosexual behaviour, study findsA vast new study has quashed the idea that a single “gay gene” exists, scientists say, instead finding homosexual behaviour is influenced by a multitude of genetic variants which each have a tiny effect.The researchers compare the situation to factors determining a person’s height, in which multiple genetic and environmental factors play roles. Writing in the journal Science, an international team of researchers report how they drew on existing genetic databases to conduct the largest study yet into genetics and same-sex sexual behaviour.Dr Brendan Zietsch, co-author of the research from the University of Queensland in Australia, said that does not mean the rest is due to upbringing or culture. “For example, it is thought that non-genetic factors before birth, such as the hormonal environment in the womb, also play an important role,” he told the .The team then looked at which genetic variants might be behind the link, using data from more than 400,000 participants in the UK Biobank project and more than 68,000 iniduals whose data was collected by the company 23andMe.Researchers found five genetic variants – tiny differences in DNA – that showed a clear link to same-sex sexual behaviour, two in both men and women, two found only in men and one found only in women. The team believe one, found only in men, might be involved in sex hormone regulation, not least because it is linked to male-pattern balding.Neale stressed that the scale of the influence of non-genetic factors, complexities of sexual behaviour, and difficulties in precisely measuring the size of any variant’s effects, means it is not possible to use genetic information to predict whether an inidual will have same-sex partners.The study provides a number of insights, including that there is overlap between genetic predisposition to same-sex sexual behaviour and traits such as openness to experience, as well as predisposition to mental health problems.“One possibility is that stigma associated with same-sex sexual behaviour causes or exacerbates mental health issues. This could create a genetic correlation,” said Zeitsch.The authors also say their findings call into question the idea that sexuality exists on a single scale.However, the study has limitations including that it is based mainly on people of European ancestry, while the age range of participants does not fully reflect that of the wider population. It also relied on self-reported behaviour.The idea that genetics might play a role in same-sex attraction was propelled into the spotlight in 1993 when Dean Hamer, a scientist at the US National Cancer Institute, and his team found links between DNA markers on the X chromosome and male sexual orientation.The findings caused considerable controversy, with the media dubbing the discovery the “gay gene”.Subsequent research has thrown up mixed results, although recent studies have supported the theory that genetics plays a role in sexual orientation.Hamer said he was delighted by the latest research. “This provides yet another strand of evidence, another approach, showing that there is a strong and significant genetic contribution to people’s sexual behaviour,” he said. However, unlike Hamer’s work, the latest study does not show any special importance of the X chromosome. The researchers say that is not surprising, adding the previous findings would not meet today’s bar for importance, and were based on a small sample size.Hamer said he was not surprised either – although he put it down to the latest study looking at same-sex behaviour rather than sexual orientation. Qazi Rahman, a leading authority on sexual orientation research from King’s College London, welcomed the study but said that the databases involved only captured information from a small percentage of people who were invited to participate. That, he said, means that the genetic variants found in the latest research might reflect another trait particular to those who chose to respond.Rahman added he was not surprised that the genetic variants identified only have small inidual effects, pointing out that since same-sex behaviour is linked to having to fewer offspring, evolution is likely to hide such variants in effect.A website set up by the researchers to explain the study gives a clear message: “This study provides further evidence that erse sexual behaviour is a natural part of overall human variation.”Rahman agreed, stressing that the findings do not change the fact that everyone should be treated with respect. “The causes of a trait shouldn’t influence how we see it,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d006d4c403196cc797b5f6920f623f5e06e7a806/0_433_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd6c4897f74eccbe3cbc8c01274be6bc","title":"food bank supplies low demand surges school holidays","story":"Organisers say donations falling during the summer, just as more families seek helpFood banks in some of the UK’s poorest areas are running critically low on supplies because of a spike in demand during the school holidays.Organisers say more families are seeking help in the summer holidays than in previous years, yet donations are falling. Tricia Ryder, a distribution centre manager at Leeds North and West food bank, said: “We’re running critically low on supplies. The summer months are always the time when we get the least donations, but each summer we’re getting more and more attendants.”Ryder said there had been a drop in donations over the summer, which she believed was due to people being less financially secure.“A lot of the people who donate outside of the summer holidays are people that are then struggling themselves when their children are off,” she said.“It’s really difficult because there may be occasions where people are not getting their regular food parcel because we’re low on certain things.”Like many of the food banks the  spoke to, Leeds North and West, which has seven centres across the area, was short on items including long-life milk and juice, pasta sauce and tinned meat, fish, fruit and vegetables.Although national figures are yet to be calculated for the number of food parcels distributed to people in need this summer, many food banks have reported an increase.During July and August 2017, more than 204,525 three-day emergency supplies were provided by food banks, 73,226 of which went to children. In the two months before, 70,510 supplies were given to children.Foods banks in Preston, Leeds, Watford, Salford, Bradford, Newcastle, Merseyside, Nottingham and north-east Somerset were among those reporting food shortages during the school holidays this year.Andrew Tranter, 75, who runs Watford food bank, said while the shelves were usually well-stocked in winter – due to higher donations during the harvest festival and Christmas – supplies often dwindled in the summer months.He said there had been a year-on-year increase in demand for the food bank’s services. “Our stock in the last month was six tonnes, and we gave out seven-and-a-half tonnes. So far this month, we’ve received three tonnes of donations but given out three-and-a-half tonnes.”Many food banks are using online donations to stock up supplies, including at Waterloo food bank in Lambeth, south London.“This year we’re running a holiday programme for families, including hot lunches and breakfast some days, as well as activities and trips. Despite this, we are still seeing a lot of families at the food bank,” she added.The Trussell Trust’s chief executive, Emma Revie, said: “An increase in demand during the summer holidays can sometimes lead to a shortage in supplies. When this is the case, we urge the public to check with their local food bank to see what they might be short of as each food bank has its own unique needs.“An emergency food parcel, listening ear and compassionate, practical advice at the food bank can be the boost someone needs to break free from poverty. Any donations make a real difference.”With September’s harvest festival on the horizon, during which many schools across the country collect and donate items to food banks, most sites are expecting supplies to pick up over the winter.However, supplies are expected to be at their lowest in early September. “There will probably be even more families coming in during the last week of the holidays because of the additional costs of school uniform,” said Ryder."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19df985060b01b2aa77af69e64d0686de3432ab/0_52_5166_3100/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4c61a12dddafe4eb697a446fdf0307b","title":"helping nine year old eating disorder recovery podcast","story":"We hear about the importance of early intervention in rare cases of pre-teen eating disorders.

Back then it was in the possession of Martin Johnson, the side’s captain, an indomitable character whose face wore the evidence of a career that started in the amateur days when the sport connived at lawlessness and duelling was a game within a game.The former Wales and Pontypool second-row John Perkins was the master of four‑play. “I would always give my opposite number a whack in the opening minutes,” he once said. “If there was no comeback, I knew I was in for an easy afternoon.”Johnson’s career did not quite overlap with that of the Welshman: he was not known for his habit of turning the other cheek and in the second half of his career, when professionalism took root, he found himself answering charges that not 10 years before would barely have caused a referee’s finger to wag.Perkins would not get away with it now and not just because of multiple camera angles and citing officers. The awareness of the dangers of concussion has led to punching carrying a stigma: it is 50 years ago that another No 4, the Wales captain, Brian Price, felled the Ireland flanker Noel Murphy with a haymaker at Cardiff Arms Park when the Prince of Wales was part of the crowd, executing a plan to get the back-rower off the field, an act that earned no more than an admonishment from the referee. A repeat today would earn an enforced rest of several months.Maro Itoje does not have to be vigilant for a fist that appears from nowhere. It is the body of the current holder of the jersey worn by Johnson, rather than his face, that bears witness to the demands of the professional game. The Saracens lock epitomises the best of the modern-day player, athletic, powerful and composed, driven but in control.His performance against Ireland at Twickenham last Saturday was Johnsonian in its impact if not in its manner. Johnson oozed competitive zeal, the first one out of the trench: when Ian McGeechan chose him as the Lions captain in 1997 for the tour to South Africa, the second-row did not then lead his country. He was tall and imposing in a series McGeechan knew would be swayed by the physical contest.Itoje’s enforcing comes through his reading of the game, his rugby intelligence, and England are stronger for his presence. Manu Tuilagi was named man of the match against Ireland, understandably so for the impact he made with and without the ball, vexing a defence that lacked its customary sharpness off the line, but it was Itoje who lubricated England’s engine, from the opening minute when he forced a turnover.Tuilagi is conspicuous but a lot of Itoje’s work is, if not unseen, barely noticed. He facilitates, winning lineouts and sabotaging the opposition, alert for opportunities after a tackle and on hand to sustain attacks. He is adding ball-carrying to his armoury and at 24 still has to peak.Four years ago, he was in England’s training squad for the World Cup but failed to make the cut. Had Eddie Jones been the head coach then, he would surely have been chosen not as someone likely to make the 23 for the major group matches, but as a young, hungry forward whose head would not drop if he remained on the sidelines.Jones said before announcing his squad for Japan that the most important positions in the 31 were the first 15 and the last four. He has gone for the largely untried and untested in the latter group, rather than experienced players who have served him well in the past three years, tyros who will not have to mask disappointment and therefore not drain squad morale.England’s previous two World Cup campaigns were blighted by tension within the group that proved undermining. Jones is a coach for whom the World Cup provides a power surge: he has lost two matches in three tournaments, in the 2003 final to Johnson’s England and to Scotland four years ago when he was in charge of Japan.He appreciates the rigours of a tournament that has broken many a good team. The physical demands placed on his players since taking charge at the end of 2015 have been designed not just to make them comfortable with the ever-increasing pace and intensity of the international game, but to harden them mentally so that when they get to the closing moments of a game that is in the balance, they do not lose their heads, as they did against Wales and Australia in their home tournament in 2015.Itoje is central to that, focused and unruffled. He has in the past conceded penalties in testing the tolerance threshold of referees at the breakdown but he did not give away one against Ireland, putting experience to advantage. He is seen as a future England captain, but he would be a Sam Warburton, leading through example and his sheer will to win, rather than a Johnson, whose demeanour camouflaged a great rugby brain that, for the past eight years, has been wastefully lost to the English game.Leadership was a concern for Jones a couple of years ago but now he has it covered in all areas of the pack through Jamie George, Itoje and Billy Vunipola and in Owen Farrell, George Ford and Ben Youngs behind. They are bubbling at the right time and Jones knows Japan, its climate and culture. They will be ready and they have Itoje to the fore.• This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

A red rivulet drips down her face from a cut above her left eye but she gives a thumbs up and smiles for the camera, blinking the salty spray and the blood out of her eyes.It seems like a lucky escape.“I saw her a couple of minutes ago, she’s real happy,” a commentator reports during a television highlights show. “She has a little tiny scar up there, they didn’t have to put stitches in, she got some glue and she’s back out here enjoying the fun.”Maidana started vomiting that night. She was diagnosed with a mild concussion after a scan at an emergency room and told to rest. She returned home to Hawaii with a black eye. A few days later her mind and her body began to fail.At the time of the competition in March 2014 at Nelscott Reef, a two-hour drive from Portland, Maidana was one of the best big-wave surfers in the world. Since taking up the sport in her early twenties she had worked tirelessly, obsessively, spending hours each day developing her skills in the wild waves on Maui’s famous North Shore and hours on land building up her fitness.Yet within weeks of her board smashing into her forehead she could barely get off the couch or hold a conversation. Her tongue was leaden. She was too weary to walk her dog. Even sending a text message was exhausting. She was dizzy, confused, anxious, depressed and paranoid. Three months after the accident she got orced.“My world just crumbled. I lost my husband, my dog, my house, my sponsorship, I had a coaching business, I couldn’t do it any more. I lost everything,” she recalls. “The cut, the cut in your eyebrow! We were all concerned about the blood, instead of what’s happening underneath.”While concussions in major contact sports, notably American football, attract most of the research and media attention, traumatic head injuries in surfing are the shadow amid the sunshine – rarely discussed and poorly understood despite their potentially devastating effects.Studies suggest a significant minority of surfers suffer head injuries that carry a risk of cognitive decline in addition to the immediate danger of drowning.An analysis of surfing-related concussions on the west coast of Canada by Nikolaus Dean at the University of British Columbia in 2018 found that the sport’s culture “encouraged risk-taking behaviors and the denial and downplaying of the injury”. There is a reluctance to wear protective headgear, limited medical help and established protocols compared to major team sports and peer pressure to return to the waves without adequate recovery time.“The lifestyle is all happy, we’re at the beach, and the sponsors show that image,” Maidana says. “Nobody talks about concussions in surfing and nobody ever wants to talk about mental illness.”Another elite big-wave surfer, Shawn Dollar, set a world record in 2012 by paddling into a 61ft wave. He also competed at Nelscott Reef in 2014. The following year he smashed into a boulder while surfing in a remote location off the central Californian coast, breaking his neck in four places and suffering a concussion. He had to walk with assistance for a mile to reach his car and be driven to hospital.Bones healed but his brain is still a work in progress. “It looked like I’d played the equivalent of high school, college and professional football,” he says. “I’ve had a full recovery but I still am improving, honestly, I still have to take care of myself every day. I’m doing really, really well but it’s taken, like, three years and a lot of work.”He felt less mentally sharp after the blow. “I was kind of paying attention to what was going on in the news with the NFL and stuff like that but I was a little bit in denial about it, it just seemed crazy that I could be experiencing those type of things just from surfing. And there wasn’t any data out there but I was noticing that I was getting more foggy-headed and slower over time, it was affecting my well-being,” he says.Maidana returned to the water but eventually realized that she was “causing concussions over my concussions. Like a boxer’s brain, basically.” In dire need of money, with her medical care not covered by insurance, she tried delivering pizza and cleaning houses but was too unwell.To force herself away from the ocean she moved to Austin, Texas, and took a job in a cafe. “A doctor told me when I got to Austin, ‘you are an inch from a stroke’, if I kept surfing,” she says. “I removed myself from the island to heal to save my life.”At one point, when she did not maintain a strict healthy diet, she had suicidal thoughts. “It was like - just end it, just end it, just end it. A lot of it was the nostalgia of what I lost. ‘Life without big-wave surfing is nothing, look what your life was before, living at the beach, you were in Hawaii, now you’re in Austin, you’re a waitress, life sucks’, basically. And it was so scary.”“It was like a horror movie, so much time underwater, it was just so violent what was happening, the beating in my body and the lack of oxygen. I truly was one inch from dying. I really felt: OK, the next moment I’m going to be on the other side. It was OK, I was peaceful about it. In a way I wanted it to end because I was feeling really bad, I just wanted the peacefulness.”But she did not seek treatment: “I didn’t get hit, I’m breathing, that’s all I need,” she thought. Then the waves in Nelscott were higher than she expected.“That’s when the terror started to creep in, I was very nervous, very uncomfortable in the water. A 35ft wave, nowhere to go, that’s the moment where you have to ditch your board and e as much as you can, go under the wave. I freaked out, that’s when I think the PTSD came, I froze, I saw the wave and I just didn’t do anything and it just took me,“ she says.“It hits me underwater with the lip of the wave - imagine a 35ft wave bringing a 10ft board that’s like a table, into my forehead. I got hit, I felt a quick in-and-out, black stars, pulled my inflatable vest. When I went black, I was like, come back – because if you don’t come back right now, you go.”Daniel Amen, a doctor in California who has treated numerous surfers, including Maidana and Dollar, often finds they have frontal lobe brain injuries which affect judgment and impulse control.“The surfer of a 30ft wave has to be incredibly coordinated and make split-second decisions well, now they’re not quite so good and it means they’re more likely to get another concussion because in their heads they’re going ‘I can do this’ but their processor isn’t reacting as it should,” he says.Maidana hopes her experience will raise awareness of the perils of big-wave surfing. Dollar suspects a culture shift will be hard to achieve. “I don’t think helmets are going to make a difference, I think it’s about surfers being aware that when they take off on a giant close-out wave just for, like, a photo, they could suffer brain damage from that wipeout,” he says.“When I talk to the younger guys they’re aware of what I went through and they’re asking questions like how can they prevent it themselves, how can they take care of themselves, what have they got to do. At the end of the day they’re still all charging really hard and getting hurt constantly. There’s an awareness out there but there isn’t really a change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccf5d5da811df998b086bc345b12ceb54375d491/1071_0_2301_1380/master/2301.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=091020c9db01c1433c2936363cabc63a","title":"jack leach glasses headingley cricket","story":"The Headingley hero’s appearance gives us that ludicrous fake spark of hope that at some point in another life we too could have flicked that single off our hipsIt’s rare a sporting moment makes you shake. Last Sunday, while Ben Stokes was carving Australia to all parts of Headingley, I was in a park watching on my phone. As Nathan Lyon failed to collect the ball cleanly as Jack Leach wandered about in no man’s land I realised I had lost control of my body. The screen was all over the place.It might have happened before – but I’m rarely holding both sides of my TV at those critical moments. My scream of terror was too loud for the sunbathers. I think everyone just thought I was that park’s weird guy on the bench. There’s always one.Leach’s explanation of becoming an instant cult hero is pretty perfect. “It’s probably because I look like a village cricketer out there in my glasses, the bald head and maybe people think: ‘That could be me!’ All the others look pretty professional.”You can imagine his spectacles and grubby cloth being valued at thousands by a big-haired expert on the 2119 series of the Antiques Roadshow standing next to the cryogenically thawed head of Fiona Bruce. “So lucky you’ve got both! Yes these belonged to a man called Jack Leach, who played something called Test cricket – an old version of the 10-ball challenge we have today. Unbelievably he managed to achieve something sporting despite the fact that he wore these things called glasses. You’ll remember they were phased out late in the 21st century.”Since Leach’s exploits, there have been interviews with his optometrist and various lists have done the rounds of bespectacled sports stars – always featuring the hapless ones that fit the narrative, with Eddie the Eagle at the top. One man who rarely reaches the top 10 of that list is Hughie Teape. Yet for some unknown reason the British high hurdler is etched in my sporting memory. Big glasses, and an Eric Young sized headband – he always seemed to be in lane one while Colin Jackson and Tony Jarrett fought it out in the middle for the medals. My 10-year-old brain couldn’t quite compute that coming last in an Olympic final is an extraordinary achievement. He was just the slow guy on the end who couldn’t see very well.From birth we are conditioned to see glasses as the preserve of the brainy but physically weak. In film it’s always a lensed asthmatic who is the first to get picked off by the enemy – whether it’s the first world war, or an alien invasion. He’s the bumbling evil hacker in Jurassic Park who loses his specs in the storm and can’t see the sweet little dinosaur turning into a devastatingly colourful killer. They even tried to soften Arnold Schwarzenegger with them – off for Predator, on for Junior – you’re having a baby – off again, you’re an Expendable.The alternative study into the correlation between sporting weakness and shortsightedness doesn’t seem to have been done. And with good reason. Edwin Moses hurdled passed everyone for years. Martina Navratilova and Billie Jean King dominated tennis. Daniel Vettori is one of New Zealand’s greatest ever cricketers. And it’s not about glasses, either. Your contact-lens six-a‑side team is pretty good. De Gea in goal, with Schweinsteiger in front of Thuram and Boateng – Kaká and Cristiano Ronaldo up front.And I am not here waving a flag for slight visual impairment. As a BBC local radio reporter I once had an eye test as part of a story I can only presume was about eye tests. After identifying the tiny mix of consonants and vowels from a quarter of a mile away, the optician announced I had “better than 20-20 vision” and that I could be a fighter pilot if I so wished. No lover of flying or war, it wasn’t the path for me, but being able to see things clearly was not the thing that stopped me becoming a professional sportsman.Apparently 2010 vision is better than 2020. Either way, Jack Leach has neither, and bizarrely that is partly why his partnership with Stokes was so glorious.In Stokes and Leach you have the two ends of the sporting spectrum – the super-human and the human. The biological optimum and the guy who looks like a competition winner. Clearly this does Leach a huge disservice but if we analyse why we love sport, appreciating both of these figures is a huge part of it.No amount of net sessions, press‑ups or protein shakes would give any of us the ability of Stokes. He is a sports star for us to observe in awe. He is Michael Johnson or Serena Williams. He is Steve Smith. Combining that eye, that strength and that indefatigable will to carry on, even when he’s so obviously shattered, takes him beyond normal comparisons.Meanwhile the narrative for Leach – however incorrect – is that he is you and me, trudging about in ill-fitting gear he’s borrowed from a mate, cleaning his steamed-up glasses. He joins that list of unlikely looking spin bowlers – Panesar, Tufnell, Such.We’ve all had that debate about how good we could have become at spin bowling if that’s all we’d done since we were 10 – forget clarinet lessons and GCSE geography, I’m perfecting the arm ball. Chances are most of us would be nowhere nearer a central contract and considerably further away from any other achievement. But Leach gives us that ludicrous fake spark of hope that at some point in another life we too could have flicked that single off our hips.The truth for all these athletes is far less interesting. The most natural, mercurial talents work hard, and the most “normal” have natural talent. But Leach is a sports star who doesn’t look like a sports star. How glorious that in between the Ireland game and his recall at Lord’s he went back and played for his local side, Taunton Deane – and came on as third change. Every interview and every quote makes him more likable.It will be someone else’s time at Old Trafford. But for now – in a week when there has been lots to mourn as a sports lover – let’s revel in one of us taking almost centre stage, however poor their eyesight, and however much better than us they really are."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9ce7235c5fdbab410291c24ce0b2e3104945630/0_135_3648_2189/master/3648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eda64785aa67a87b2b39fa0b8bb1cce9","title":"us open 2019 zverev halep osaka kvitova konta evans day four live","story":"Naomi Osaka has also taken care of business, beating Poland’s Magda Linette 6-2, 6-4. Last year’s champion and this year’s Australian Open winner be pleased with that after appearing to be a bundle of nerves in her first-round, three-set win. It means if Coco Gauff beats Timea Babos tonight, it’ll be Osaka v Gauff in round three. Yes please.You wait three days for another British winner, and then two come along at once. Just minutes after Evans’s victory, Konta serves up a second-set bagel in New York for a brutal win over the stunned Russian Margarita Gasparyan in 55 minutes. “It’s never straightforward,” says a modest Konta. “It was tricky conditions. The match-up worked in my favour but it’s never straightforward. Very happy to have come through. Yesterday was a long day for everyone who didn’t get to play so I’m pleased to make the third round.”The way this match has gone, this game is likely to be anything but straightforward for Evans. But then the 29-year-old likes to defy expectations. 15-0, 30-0, 40-0. Three match points. Pouille’s rasping return saves the first. But the Frenchman lobs long on the second! Evans knocks out the 25th seed after three hours and 10 minutes of fluctuating and sometimes fascinating tennis. Next up for Evans: a certain Mr Federer.Then at 4-4 between Evans and Pouille, Evans has two break points. Will this be the final twist in this match? No, because Pouille saves both, the second with a remarkable forehand winner down the left sideline! Deuce. But then Evans charges straight back at Pouille with the next two points and he’ll serve for the match!Evans is channelling his inner Kyrgios on Court 12, where he receives a warning for an audible obscenity when Pouille moves to break-back point. Pouille pings a perfect winner for 3-3. This match will end after Konta’s at this rate, because Konta is still ripping through the games, leading Gasparyan 6-1, 3-0.As for the score on Louis Armstrong, Osaka briefly forgot she was the world No 1 and defending champion again, sliding 2-0 down in the second set, but she’s now well on track for the third round and a possible blockbuster with Coco Gauff (if the 15-year-old wins in the night session later), leading Magda Linette 6-2, 4-3 with the break.Cripes. I go a get a quick drink and it’s 5-1 Konta. The British No 1 clearly doesn’t want to hang around having had to wait a day to start this match. And she soon has 15-40 on Gasparyan’s serve, two set points. And Gasparyan waves the white flag with a timid double fault! Konta charges through the first set 6-1. She’ll be keen to avoid a let-up in the second, having also whizzed through the opening set in the first round before being extended to three.There’s plenty going on elsewhere too. My head’s hurting trying to figure out where to look on the scoreboard. Frances Tiafoe has taken the second set against Alex Zverev – when does the sixth seed ever like to do it the easy way? – but Zverev has the advantage in the third, leading 6-3, 3-6, 4-1. Daniil Medvedev, who has overtaken Zverev in the rankings and appears the best placed of the Next Gen to challenge Djokovic, Nadal and Federer after his red-hot run on the American hard courts over the past few weeks, is 5-2 up on Bolivia’s Hugo Dellien, while Stan Wawrinka, the champion three years ago, leads France’s Jeremy Chardy 6-4, 2-2. Konta, meanwhile, is now under way against Russia’s Margarita Gasparyan, who’s only 24 but has already had three knee surgeries. It’s 1-1 in the opening set. Tom Hiddleston was watching as a guest in Konta’s box during the first round no sign yet of whether he’s back today. Though Kobe Bryant and Colin Kaepernick are currently in Naomi Osaka’s corner on Louis Armstrong, where the world No1 and defending champion may finally be playing like the world No1 and defending champion. She leads Poland’s Magda Linette by a set to love, 6-2.... five straight points for the Frenchman and it’s 5-3. Evans reduces his arrears to 5-4 but the breaker is on the racket of Pouille, who has two points on serve to finish it off. And here’s set point number four, to add to the three he had at 5-4. Pouille prevails and Evans, who should really be back in the locker room pondering how he is going to tackle Federer tomorrow, will have to regroup in a fourth set!A perfect start from Evans as he gets not one but two mini-breaks to sprint 3-0 ahead. A couple of points on serve here would give him a stranglehold over Pouille. But nothing in this set has been straightforward, Evans promptly loses both and they’re back on serve. Pouille then wins a quick point, as they change ends at 3-3 ...As one Brit starts, another will be hoping he is about to finish, with Evans edging ahead in this see-sawing third set, 6-5 on serve. He’s putting pressure on Pouille’s serve at 30-all, but Pouille holds firm to close the game out from there. It’s tie-break time! And given the way this set has gone, I don’t think anyone will want to predict what is about to happen.Alex de Minaur is roaring on Court 5, because the young Australian has conquered Chile’s 31st seed, Cristian Garin, 6-3, 7-5, 6-3 to reach the third round for the second consecutive year. Up next: the 2014 finalist Kei Nishikori. De Minaur’s victory means Britain’s Johanna Konta will be in action very shortly.That blast of cool air does the trick, though not immediately. Pouille quickly moves to 40-15, two set points. Evans saves both, the second with a smart return that just clips the line. Deuce becomes Pouille’s advantage, and this time Evans dispatches a winning volley to stay in the set, before managing to bring up his own advantage. Evans is being pegged well behind the baseline by Pouille’s hard hitting but the Frenchman then flaps into the net! Another wild swing in momentum. Having saved three set points, Evans is back on serve at 6-4, 6-3, 5-5.15-30 turns into 30-40, a break point that could leave Pouille serving for the third set. A rattled Evans surrenders. He should have been 5-2 up, instead he finds himself 5-4 down. Evans, clearly feeling the heat both literally and figuratively, cools himself down with the on-court air-conditioning unit – a new innovation this year – at the changeover.At 6-4, 6-3, 4-2, two more holds of serve will elevate Evans into the last 32. He moves to game point and has the whole of the court to aim into with a volley ... but misses! Perhaps he was too busy picturing that meeting with Federer, who he pushed in three tight sets at the Australian Open this year, impressing the GOAT so much that Evans was invited to Dubai to practice with Federer. But that match will have to wait, because Pouille makes the most of the unexpected reprieve to break, before holding for 4-4. And Evans is reeling at 15-30 on his serve ...Two results for you: Petra Martic, the 22nd seed, has beaten Ana Bogdan, who got the better of Britain’s Harriet Dart in round one. The score: 6-2, 6-4. And Qiang Wang, seeded 18th, has bettered Belgium’s Alison Van Uytvanck, 7-5, 6-4.Evans is also charging towards the finish line and that third-round meeting with Federer, because he leads 4-1 in a third set that has lasted a matter of minutes. It’s also a wrap on Grandstand, where Sofia Kenin, one of a group of hugely talented American women coming through (and one of 13 home hopes in action on day four), has recovered from a slow start to produce a quick finish, beating the German Laura Siegemund 7-6 (4), 6-0. A quick turnaround on Louis Armstrong, where Petkovic breaks back, holds and then has Kvitova on the canvas, two match points down at 4-6, 4-5, 15-40. Kvitova comes to the net and seems well in control, but Petkovic keeps on getting it back and Kvitova knocks herself out when she horribly hoiks wide! The world No 6 is out and is the first top-10 seed on the women’s side to exit.It’s a case of from the bad to the even worse for Pouille, who falls 0-15, 0-30, 0-40 down at 3-5. So that’s three set points for Evans. The British No 2 can’t direct his return into play on the first. He just about lands his second return, but it drops so short that it’s an easy put-away for Pouille. Evans’s third effort falls invitingly in the middle of the court for Pouille to bury. Deuce. Evans’s advantage. And Pouille – who’s hit 26 unforced errors in this second set – gives it away with a double fault! Evans leads 6-4, 6-3 and has never lost from two sets to love up. It may only be lunchtime in New York, but fans on Arthur Ashe may well be getting out the popcorn and enjoying some beers for what could be a cracking encounter between Alex Zverev and the 21-year-old talent Frances Tiafoe, who gave Federer a five-set fright under the lights here a couple of years ago. Zverev, who is looking to salvage his season after a hugely disappointing 2019, didn’t look too convincing in the first round, when he went the distance against Radu Albot. But he’s zoomed out of the blocks here and already leads by a set to love, 6-3.Goffin clearly likes a bit of symmetry. The 15th seed, a recent finalist in Cincinnati, wraps up that win, 6-2, 6-2, 6-2. Kvitova still has that break in the second set, leading Petkovic 4-3 but trailing in the match overall, having lost the first 6-4. Sofia Kenin, the 20-year-old Moscow-born American who recently broke the top 20, has edged the first set against Laura Siegemund, 7-4 in the tie-break. Another American, Denis Kudla, is 7-5 up on Serbia’s Dusan Lajovic, while David Goffin is serving for the match against Gregoire Barrere, leading 6-2, 6-2, 5-2.That 2016 run was Evans’s last visit to New York, what with the drug ban that followed. It really has been some effort from the 29-year-old to resurrect his career. He was unranked 18 months ago and is now near his best ever ranking, sitting just outside the top 50. With Pouille serving at 1-3, a double fault gifts Evans a chance for the double break. Evans blazes a backhand well wide. Deuce. Another break point. Evans lobs, Pouille produces a tweener ... and then a breathtaking backhand cross-court winner! If the Frenchman doesn’t get inspiration from that, nothing will rouse him into action. Deuce. Game Pouille. It’s Evans 6-4, 3-2.Goffin is ripping through the sets. The steady Belgian, who is Daveeed Ferrrrrrerrrrr like in his ability to get the most out of his talent, now leads 6-2, 6-2.Kvitova, meanwhile, is in a bit of trouble on Louis Armstrong. The two-times Wimbledon champion, who surprisingly hasn’t been beyond the quarter-finals at the US Open, has lost the first set 6-4 in a competitive, hard-hitting battle against Petkovic. Kvitova has been troubled by an arm injury since withdrawing from the French Open in May, so will have her work cut out to come through this. But she’s showing fight at the start of the second set, and has the break at 2-1.... Set point number three. And Evans eventually takes the set 6-4 when Pouille’s effort flies well long! Pouille promptly marmalises his racket.However just as Evans was broken straight after breaking early in the set, he’s in danger of conceding serve here. 0-30. Pouille gets a glimmer on a second-serve return but ks it into the net. Then it’s Evans’s turn to throw in the error. 15-40, two break-back points. Pouille tamely nets on the first. This won’t be a game that’ll live long in the memory. But perhaps it will be for Evans, as he recovers to deuce and then nudges ahead for his first set point. Evans produces a one-two punch, then has the chance to settle the point ... but miscues wide! He could come to regret that when Pouille promptly brings up a third break point, but another messy exchange and it’s deuce. Followed by a second set point. And deuce number four ...Which soon becomes advantage Evans, break point. The Brit is squinting into the sun as he jumps around waiting to receive. Evans chips the backhand return back, and seems to be slightly on the back foot, but the point turns around quickly. Evans sprints towards the net and strikes down the line to settle matters. It’s 5-4 Evans, who will serve for the set.Evans’s break, meanwhile, didn’t last long, with Pouille following up that serving game of errors with a receiving game of excellence, sealing the break with a lob that Evans can’t get back into play. And from two consecutive breaks to four consecutive holds. It’s 4-4 with Pouille serving at deuce.De Minaur gets his act together and wraps up the set 6-3. There’s little giving on Louis Armstrong where Kvitova and Germany’s Andrea Petkovic are locked at 4-4, while Kenin has clawed her way back from 3-0 down to trail 3-2 on serve against another German, Laura Siegemund, and the classy Kristina Mladenovic is surprisingly 5-2 down in the all-French face-off with Fiona Ferro.De Minaur is the closest to getting a set in the bag, leading 5-3 and 40-30 on serve against the Chilean 31st seed, Cristian Garin. But the 20-year-old can’t capitalise on the set point and is pegged back to deuce. And then falls break point down. Oh, Alex! So instead the honour falls to David Goffin, who wraps up the first set 6-2 against France’s Gregoire Barrere. Also among the early starters: the two-times Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova, the ascending American Sofia Kenin, the Aussie whippersnapper and scrapper Alex de Minaur, the conqueror of Angelique Kerber, Kristina Mladenovic, and Qiang Wang, one of the best players you may never have heard of. Plus David Goffin, Denis Kudla and Ana Bogdan, who put out Britain’s Harriet Dart on Monday. And there are even more besides. Phew.Evans is closing in on an early break. It’s 15-40 on Pouille’s serve. Evans hasn’t had to work too hard for the break points, it has to be said, with several early errors from his opponent’s racket. Evans rushes forward on the first break point and Pouille pings well long! Evans strikes first to lead 2-1.Evans and Pouille are now under way. After a hold apiece it’s 1-1. So what of Pouille? The stylish Frenchman, seeded 25th here but perhaps even more talented than his ranking suggests, reached his first grand slam semi-final this year at the Australian Open, but he has not quite kicked on from that in the way many expected he would. He’s coached by Amelie Mauresmo, the former Wimbledon champion who of course worked with Andy Murray a few years ago.Meanwhile in other extremely pressing Federer news:Perhaps we should be calling him “Danny” Evans from now on, because that’s what Federer, who awaits the winner of this match, called him yesterday. And if the GOAT has bestowed that name upon him, us mere mortals should surely follow.Dan Evans is weaving and winding his way through the grounds of the USTA Billie Jean National Tennis Center as he and Lucas Pouille make their way to Court 12. The British No 2 is looking fairly relaxed, it has to be said, far more relaxed than he was when he was snarling and sulking his way past Adrian Mannarino in the first round.Come to think of it won’t even be the last we hear of McNally this fortnight, because she’s partnering a certain Coco Gauff in the doubles.One of the coolest men in New York right now though is probably Novak Djokovic, who said after his injury-hit, 6-4, 7-6 (3), 6-1 win over Argentina’s Juan Ignacio Londero last night that he’d like to freeze his left shoulder for the next 48 hours. It was clearly causing him some pain, and it will give Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and the chasing pack behind tennis’s triumvirate (if those young pretenders can get their act together) hope that perhaps the defending champion, who has won four of the past five slams, is beatable.Djokovic’s was among eight singles matches to be completed on the show courts yesterday, with Federer, Serena Williams and Ashleigh Barty also afforded the luxury of a roof. Williams had the toughest time of it, pushed to three sets in an absorbing encounter by an opponent not even half her age, the American grand slam rookie Caty McNally. It certainly won’t be the last we hear of the 17-year-old.Hello and welcome to our coverage of day four of the US Open, where the scene looks less like this…And more like this …Which is just as well, given Wednesday’s washout on the roofless courts means there are an extra 23 singles matches to squeeze into today’s second-round schedule. Dan Evans will be among the first of those playing catch-up in just over 20 minutes’ time, as the British No 2 faces the French 25th seed, Lucas Pouille, on Court 12, where the prize (or possible punishment) for victory will be a meeting with Roger Federer. Johanna Konta, Britain’s other singles survivor, having made it on to court for her warm-up yesterday only to be rained on almost immediately, is now second on Court 5 against Russia’s Margarita Gasparyan, so is likely to play at around 1pm local time6pm BST.Elsewhere the names will be coming thick and fast. Alex Zverev? Check. Simona Halep? Check. Petra Kvitova? Check. Naomi Osaka? Check. Stan Wawrinka, Nick Kyrgios and the on-fire Daniil Medvedev? Check, check and check. And we haven’t even mentioned Rafael Nadal, Coco Gauff, Marin Cilic and Caroline Wozniacki, who play in the night session, or the shooting stars of Bianca Andreescu, Denis Shapovalov and Andrey Rublev, who accounted for Stefanos Tsitsipas in the first round.Play begins at: 11am in New York4pm BST. Strap yourself in. It’s going to be fast and frantic. And fairly sweaty too, with temperatures forecast to hit 30 degrees."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dec38e25b7a1e3c9d1ff0c3063dd6079ae7359fb/7_0_2985_1791/master/2985.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ed9ec5cdf47afdc3d1cc1ccad980a67","title":"apple apologises listen siri recordings","story":"Contractors graded accidental activations including recordings of users having sexApple has apologised for allowing contractors to listen to voice recordings of Siri users in order to grade them.The company made the announcement after it completed a review of the grading programme, which had been triggered by a  report revealing its existence.According to multiple former graders, accidental activations were regularly sent for review, having recorded confidential information, illegal acts, and even Siri users having sex.“As a result of our review, we realise we have not been fully living up to our high ideals, and for that we apologise,” Apple said in an unsigned statement posted to its website. “As we previously announced, we halted the Siri grading program.

While she prepares breakfast, and her husband Daniel plays with their daughters Brooke and Harper, her son Chase is engrossed in sending an email to his beloved stepgrandfather, “Pops”, his face a study in intense concentration.Nine-year-old Chase, who has the neurological condition cerebral palsy, cannot walk, talk, feed himself or pick up a pen. Yet, thanks to technology that’s widely available, he can communicate, learn and explore the online world from his family’s home in Northfleet, Kent.On his computer, “Chase uses the on-screen keyboard (OSK) tool, because he doesn’t have the fine motor skills to type on a keyboard,” says Nikki. Running on Windows 10, “it displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. Using a joystick that he can control with just his thumb, once he switches on the OSK, he can do everything from browse the internet to search for videos on YouTube and write emails. We introduced him to it when he was six and it really has been life-changing for him.“Because he can’t speak or type messages on a phone, being able to write emails to his friends and close family is so important to him – it helps him feel connected.“The keyboard also has a text prediction function, which suggests words for him as he types. It makes it quicker for him, and, because he has learning difficulties too, it helps him with his spelling.“When I see him on his computer, and how its technology empowers him, it fills me with confidence that as he grows up he’ll be able to lead a fulfilling, independent life. That is all I’ve ever wanted for him.”Nikki’s hopes for her son are mirrored by Microsoft’s mission to empower every person through building inclusivity into technology, such as the Windows 10 operating system, which supports the OSK and its Office 365 suite.After a normal, healthy pregnancy, Nikki says she was devastated when Chase was born with brain damage, having been deprived of oxygen during her labour.“The hardest part was the uncertainty. No one knew how severe his level of disability would be, and for the first few years of his life it felt like I was living in limbo watching and waiting to see what milestones he would reach, or not,” says Nikki.“He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was nine months old, but it wasn’t until he was around three that the full extent of his disability was clear. He’s never spoken, he can’t stand unaided, and he suffers from almost constant involuntary movements of his limbs. His reading ability is closer to that of a five-year-old. He’s also incredibly loving, with a wonderful sense of humour and a very determined personality.”While Chase uses an electric wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care, Nikki says technology gives him the independence he craves.“He’s well aware his siblings and other children don’t need the same help he does. But when he’s on his computer, he feels like any other nine-year-old, because he’s in control and he doesn’t need any assistance,” says Nikki. “That means so much to him and it’s vital for his self-confidence.“I see how he puffs up with pride when he shows his little sisters, who are five and three, something he’s discovered online – his current obsession is looking at locations around the world on Google Maps. It gives him the chance to be the big brother and take the lead.”A keen gamer too, Chase uses his Microsoft adaptive controller to access his Xbox console.“We all game together as a family. It can be stressful going out because of the challenges Chase can face with poor disability access and toilet facilities. Sometimes it’s just nice to stay at home and have a relaxed afternoon gaming and cuddling up on the sofa.”Summing up how much the technology means to her son, Nikki says: “It’s no exaggeration to say Chase’s computer is his window to the world. I can’t imagine his life without it and I’m thankful he was born at a time when technology like this exists.“It’s so important to him and, thanks to its emphasis on inclusivity, it’s the one part of his life in which he can be completely independent.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

It also involves nystagmus – uncontrolled eye movements, leading to reduced vision and depth perception.After university in Glasgow, Ralston went to work in Jersey on a graduate training scheme. “I was thrown in at the deep end,” she says. “Being a trainee auditor and visually impaired wasn’t easy. A lot of my work was going through papers with a red pen.” She had to pass some tough accountancy exams. “Things take me longer to read than they might for a person with 20-20 vision. Yes, things were sometimes tough. But not that bad,” she laughs.While she was working in Jersey, Ralston started yoga classes and immediately felt the impact on her stress levels and long-term anxiety. “I felt at home. As someone who grew up with a few physical ailments, I thought: ‘I can do this! I feel relaxed!’ I understand what the instructor is telling me and I can listen to my body.”Three years later, she was working in London as a senior-level accountant at a large corporation. After a painful relationship breakup, she travelled on her own to Thailand, where she practised yoga every day for a month. “From then on, I knew I was going to be a yoga teacher. I didn’t know when. I had a successful job in the City and had worked very hard. But I knew I would when the time was right.”That time came three years ago. Her father was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and she had an incident with her blood condition where she went into cardiac arrest. “That was when I made the decision. A couple of days later, I booked my teacher training,” she says.She qualified in October 2017 and left her full-time City job three months later. Ralston began teaching classes all over London, soon deciding the best plan was to be a contractor in the finance sector while she established her yoga business.Her corporate background is a good complement to her yoga business. “Yoga teachers don’t do it for the money – we do it because we love teaching. But I would like to find a way where I can teach and live a comfortable life. I think my knowledge of finance and business models will help me on that journey.”As soon as she starts a contract in a new office, Ralston sets up Ease of Access Center in Windows 10. “I tend to ‘lose’ the mouse cursor, and the larger the monitor, the more space there is to lose it in. I make the mouse cursor bigger so I can follow it,” she says. Ease of Access options also allow her to use the Narrator function, meaning that she can hear audio descriptions of elements on the screen, something she may need if her sight deteriorates.The Ease of Access Center enables Ralston to increase the size of, and contrast within, documents. Working with spreadsheets for her own business, or with financial modelling for clients, she uses Excel and changes the text to be white on a black background. She also finds the search function helpful, rather than having to look through documents for particular figures.Right now, she has yoga brunch events to organise, and technology can help with that. “When I am on the computer for a long time, I use the Magnifier tool because my eyes get tired, especially for things like proofreading,” she says. “It’s about independence. These things are here to help everyone.“I can accept my body as not perfect – but no one’s is,” she continues. “We all have our limitations and have things we can excel at. It’s about appreciating what you can do.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Sue George finds out howLike many teenagers, Ella Warren-Roberts, 14, is very creative. She makes slate jewellery, she does woodcutting, and paints in watercolours. “She always has more than one project on the go,” says her proud mother, Glenda Roberts. “And she always completes them.”“So I don’t get too stressed out on one thing, I can relax by doing another,” says Ella. This lively, cheerful teenager also really likes science but, until recently, she wasn’t able to shine at it. She struggled reading science questions and her work took too long. But now, she is third in her year at chemistry.Ella is a day pupil, and Glenda is a teacher, at St David’s college, an independent boarding and day school in north Wales for children aged nine to 19. The school prides itself on teaching mixed classes, where pupils with additional learning needs, and those with none, work together to reach their full potential. Many of the pupils, like Ella, have dyslexia, and teachers, such as Glenda, have been trained at Bangor University to work with dyslexic learners. Some teachers bring their dogs to work, which pupils – including Ella – find very calming. “I have anxiety, and animals really help me. They aren’t judgemental,” she says.Using a computer for her schoolwork has also played a part in reducing Ella’s anxiety – which came about because it took her longer than others to complete certain tasks. “It made me feel more stupid than anyone else,” she says firmly. But now she realises that she isn’t stupid and her past problems with reading and writing have eased greatly.The apps and programs available with Office 365 allow this to happen smoothly. For instance, the school has a OneNote account used by both pupils and teachers. OneNote is a collaborative digital notebook that can be typed into, drawn or written on, and visual or audio clips can be added to it. Teachers use it to compile worksheets pupils then work on them online.Glenda points to the Microsoft Edge immersive reader, part of Microsoft’s learning tools, and the assistance this tool can give learners across a range of programs, including OneNote and Word. For instance, it can highlight words or sentences, or split inidual words into their component syllables – something that can also help anyone learning in an additional language.Ella uses it to change the background colour on her screen: she finds it easier to read on a sepia tone, where there is no glare. Previously, she relied on teachers printing worksheets on coloured paper. Then there is the choice of fonts. She can immediately choose a font she finds legible. “I used to be behind everyone else, but now I’m on target,” she says.For Glenda, Microsoft programs have also been a big help. Last year, she was away from work for nine months after being diagnosed with endometrial cancer. “I was in dire straits,” she says. “They gave me three months to live.” She is currently on the anti-cancer drug Avastin and is still going to the Christie hospital in Manchester for treatment.OneNote helped her feel less isolated when she was off work, and even in hospital the apps on her phone helped her keep track of how her pupils were getting on. “I might be part-time, but I am invested,” she says confidently.Using the Microsoft Teams platform, she was able to see what they were learning and could make comments to help their teachers.Both Glenda and Ella are physically active, doing the Race for Life 5k together. They live in an area where outdoor activities are popular people come to the family’s Airbnb to enjoy the nearby mountaineering. Her school also gives Ella the opportunity to enjoy another of her hobbies: wakeboarding. This sport is similar to waterskiing, but with one board instead of two skis. Ella describes it as “like snowboarding, if the snow had melted”.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops, whatever your need.

These 10 examples have become part of everyone’s lives Much has been said about building inclusivity into technology, processes and all aspects of life. But what you might not realise is that helping people with disabilities drove development of some of our most impressive technology, now mainstream and widely used. As Esther McVey, the then-secretary of state for work and pensions, argued at Microsoft Future Decoded 2018: “When technology is designed to be assistive, it can become technology for everyone.”From Segways to wearables, here are 10 examples of accessibility tech that has gone on to change everyone’s lives.CeefaxIt has been seven years since the BBC switched off Ceefax. The teletext service was adored by millions and became the port of call for checking football scores on Saturday afternoons. But Ceefax actually came about 38 years earlier by complete accident.In 1974, engineers at the BBC were exploring ways to provide deaf people with subtitles and discovered that the unused part of the 625-line television signal could be used to send messages and information – and thus Ceefax, or “see facts”, was born.Gesture recognitionPinch-to-zoom and three-finger swipes to the right and left are just a couple of the trackpad gestures Windows 10 laptop users will be familiar with.The company arguably responsible for bringing gesture recognition devices to the mass market was Fingerworks. One of its lead engineers, Wayne Westerman, was inspired by a temporary disability – a bout of tendonitis. He found that using touch-sensitive technology helped to relieve his symptoms and believed it would do the same for others.Speech-to-textThanks to the proliferation of smartphone technology, dictation and speech-to-text capabilities have seen a broad uptake in use.But before speech-to-text became universally popular for dictation purposes, it was helping people who are quadriplegic or those with conditions such as multiple sclerosis to carry out tasks on their computers using voice commands. Helping a large set of users take advantage of the technology has been made possible because of companies such as Microsoft. The tech giant has been focused on bringing the software to a broad audience for years, having released its first speech API in 1995. Now its speech-recognition software, Dictation, will interpret users’ spoken words in eight languages, including English, Spanish and Japanese, and is widely available across the Office suite.Text-to-speechFinding your way around an unfamiliar city in a vehicle and receiving real-time traffic updates while on the road wouldn’t be possible if it weren’t for voice-guided navigation – or, more specifically, speech synthesis.Screen readers are a rudimentary form of speech synthesis technology and Windows-Eyes has been a software of choice for people who are blind or visually impaired since the mid-1990s. It enables computer users to access the various programs of a Windows operating system by converting text into speech. The technology is advancing to such a degree AI is now helping visually impaired people identify everything from friends and family to menu items. Microsoft’s Seeing AI app analyses pictures as well as text and describes them out loud. So it’s not just tech to stop you from taking a wrong turn.Keyboard usabilityThe layout of the qwerty keyboard is so familiar, you can probably type without looking – that’s no coincidence.Keyboard usability can be traced back to the early 19th century, when Italian inventor Pellegrino Turri created a mechanical typing machine and what’s thought to be the first typewriter. According to history books, a close friend of his was losing their sight and he wanted to find a way to keep in contact without having to dictate to a scribe. In order to use the machine, they had to rely on their sense of touch.SegwaysThese two-wheeled electric vehicles are a preferred mode of transport for many enthusiastic tourists looking to see the most Instagrammable sites across a host of European cities. They’ve been so popular with tourists that they’ve actually had to be banned in parts of Barcelona and Prague.The earliest incarnation of the Segway wasn’t intended for the helmet-wearing hordes, however. After witnessing a wheelchair user struggling to mount a kerb, Dean Kamen came up with iBot – a self-balancing mobility system that uses gyroscopic techniques to negotiate steps and uneven surfaces.Self-driving vehiclesOwning a driverless car may once have been like a storyline from The Jetsons, but rapid advances in technology have made it a tangible reality.In 2012, Steve Mahan, who is legally blind, became the first person to be taken for a ride in a driverless vehicle on a public road. This highlights how people with disabilities are likely to be key beneficiaries of driverless vehicles, even if the technology wasn’t explicitly designed for them.Eye-gazingThe ability to track the gaze of your eyes is becoming popular among gamers, who in some instances are now able to integrate this into their favourite game-play scenarios. It is allowing greater and easier interaction with the gaming environment, for example changing the direction of the camera so users can “peer around a corner” without their character moving.But eye-gazing has nobler origins it was initially used by people with conditions such as cerebral palsy and locked-in syndrome to communicate. By simply looking at a screen, users were able to select words and construct sentences. Former NFL player Steve Gleason was the inspiration for Microsoft’s eye-control tech in 2014, when he challenged the company to develop a solution for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It went so well that three years later built-in eye-tracking support was added to Windows 10.WearablesWearable technology is changing how you can interact with the world around you, and it is even augmenting reality.Approximately 15 years before smart glasses went on sale to the public, neuroscientist Paul Bach-y-Rita developed a device to enable those who are blind to “see” with their tongue. Today, the technology is sold as BrainPort: a pair of glasses with a small camera attached. A wire transmits visual input from the camera to a piece that users place on their tongue – light is converted into electrical impulses that then stimulate the tongue instead of the retina, creating a tactile image that the person wearing the device can use to navigate their surroundings.Brain recordingSome of the latest wearable technology on the market offers to measure your brain activity and alert you when your concentration drops.Back in 2006, brain-recording devices were being developed for home use for people unable to move or speak. A cap wired with electrodes recording signals from the brain enabled the person wearing it to select choices on a screen simply by thinking about them.Clearly when technology is built with accessibility in mind, it ends up being beneficial to all. The powerful message that these 10 pieces of tech, and countless others that you will be using every day, convey is that accessibility shouldn’t be an afterthought. In fact disability is often a lens for innovation. This is Microsoft’s view, which – along with resell partner John Lewis \u0026amp Partners – is operating with a vision to empower everyone with its accessibility updates on Office 365 and Windows 10.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

From 5.30pm, tiny quails rotated on a grill while their eggs were fried in a doughnut maker, pots and woks bubbled with Thai curries, and stir fries and bamboo sticks full of sticky rice were griddled. Whole salted fish, coils of round sausages and meat skewers were all being barbecued over hot coals. Other foods were ready to go: silkworms, dried shrimps and goong ten, or dancing shrimp (raw translucent shrimps eaten alive with chilli), while green papaya salad was pounded in huge pestles … with as many chillies as you dared.Helen JacksonFez market has to be the best. It’s car-free and donkey-full. The sights, smells and sounds are a wake-up call to all your senses. Our guide Mohammed’s first words were, “Do not lose me as you will never find your way out.” The narrow streets are full of vendors and craftsmen of ceramics, leather, weaving, mending, and food, both to eat there or to cook at home. The donkeys are shod with rubber recycled from tyres to prevent slipping on the cobbles. Handcarts rule – with shouts of “balak, balak” to warn all to move aside as they make their way through the narrow passages. Thankfully we didn’t lose Mohammed and came out the other end.Kate HendyEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

There’s no place quite like it, a real melting pot – especially on a Friday. I had my guy for potatoes, my guy for herbs, two lovely Persian Jewish brothers I bought pots and pans from and Samir, a Palestinian from East Jerusalem, who was my guy for veg. There’s something way more enjoyable about going to buy your dinner every night this way, and that something is the people you buy from. I don’t know why I like Samir so much: he’s just a really nice guy. Every time I go back to visit, I seek him out and go and say hello. Here’s to “The Shuk” keeping its fabulous food and wonderful people.• en.machne.co.ilKatie StobbsFor a taste of the colonial among the gleaming skyscrapers of Singapore, head to Lau Pa Sat. The inside of this ornate building has latticed cast-iron pillars, reminiscent of an old Victorian bandstand. Outside, it is at its best at night: when the satay stalls open, the air soon fills with the enticing aroma of sizzling meat. Tables and stools are quickly occupied, and “beer aunties” roam between the crowds selling jugs of ice-cold Tiger. And, as the main market is open all night, it is a jet-lagged traveller’s dream, albeit a hot, smoky and sweaty one!Joanna LawrenceThis market sells a bewildering and extensive variety of secondhand books, whose origins can only be guessed at. The booksellers sit on raised wooden stalls peering over randomly stacked towers of secondhand books. I had many friendly conversations with white-bearded vendors about politics, science, religion and literature. I loved watching mothers dragging reluctant first-year university students around trying to find all the textbooks on their reading lists for bargain prices. The Indian Coffee House on Bankim Chatterjee Street, a famous meeting spot for Kolkata’s intelligentsia, provides a welcome retreat, brilliant eavesdropping opportunities and sugary coffee.TessFrom June each year, Melbourne’s Victoria Market runs a Winter Night Market that is at once a cheap culinary adventure around the world and an opportunity to have moments of random conviviality with locals and travellers while you queue for your halloumi friesdumplingskimchipaellafroyo. It’s lively and cool but unpretentious it’s free to get in there’s often a band that you can listen to with your inventive margarita and people seem to come determined to have a good time in a particular make-your-own-fun Melbourne way. It’s good for friends, solo adventurers and families of some ages (it’s hard to get around with a pram, and toddlers may need carrying).• thenightmarket.auBridgetPike Place is the source of the area’s fresh fruit, fish and flowers. All of this produce is put to good use as Pike’s is home to several independent coffee shops and restaurants that overlook the Pugent Sound. If there is a more perfect way to spend the evening than drinking a craft beer and watching the sunset over Bainbridge Island, I am yet to find it. If you are a fan of grunge music, Pike Place is massively important as it’s opposite the legendary Showbox venue and was also one of the locations in the cult film Singles. Ironically for such an independent venue, it is also the birthplace of one of the world’s biggest brands – Starbucks first ever store is there.• pikeplacemarket.orgJenniferBerlin’s most charming flea market takes place next to the stunning Landwehrkanal every other Sunday. While tourists head to Mauerpark, this is where, to me, the real fun (and bargains) can be found. If you’ve ever wondered where Berliners pick up their unique clothes, answers can be found here. You can quickly assemble a new clubbing outfit from one of the many stalls where hungover Neuköllners are passing on half their wardrobe. There is also plenty of East German kitsch, straight from the attic, beautiful kids’ clothes and toys, and food from Japanese, French and Turkish stalls, which you can eat on the banks of the canal. Go late, like a local, coffee in hand.• tuerkenmarkt.deKatieThe beautiful market building with its statues and flowers was gorgeous, but more astounding were the displays of seafood, fruit and vegetables. The colour and variety of the produce blew my mind. When you realise that this market was threatened with extinction and was saved by a group of merchants, it becomes even more impressive. Fighting the invasion of junk food and big box stores, they formed a non-profit group and eventually were rewarded by the Canarian Government and the Santa Cruz City Hall for restoring the market as a hub for the community.• On FacebookKate HolbrookEl Mercado Central de Atarazanas is the indoor food market in the centre of Málaga, selling fresh local produce. The building is impressive, with a huge stained-glass window at one end, but of equal artistic merit are the displays of seasonal fruit and veg. We watched the fishmongers at work on the latest catch and were tempted by the charcutería and olive stalls. There are a couple of bars inside, opening out on to the street but we retired to an old sherry bar, only a five-minute walk away, to toast our purchases.• malagaturismoMoiraLooking for a holiday with a difference?

It’s hard to argue otherwise. ChuckleVision may have lacked the glamour of Miami 7, the melancholy of Greenclaws or the childhood-scarring terror of Alfonso Bonzo, but it had charm by the bucket-load.It helped that it ran and ran – ChuckleVision aired close to 300 episodes over two decades, which meant that it received votes from multiple generations of viewers – but the success of the series lay in the fact it was proudly old-fashioned. ChuckleVision was just two idiots failing at stuff over and over, but it was always executed flawlessly.This was largely because the Chuckle Brothers were old hands. They won Opportunity Knocks in the 60s and New Faces in the 70s. They ran with classic old-school entertainers, honing their craft alongside figures such as Ted Rogers, Lennie Bennett and Freddie Starr. They weren’t afraid of debasing themselves in the name of entertainment, either. Viewers old enough to remember the short-lived 80s series The Chuckle Hounds will marvel at the way they performed their act in great big dumb dog costumes, accompanied by witless swanee whistle sounds. Even so, their personas were already firmly in place. Watch an episode today and you can still tell which Chuckle Hound is Paul and which is Barry.But ChuckleVision is where the pair got to shine. Although we didn’t learn an awful lot about them as characters – why did they have a new job every week? Were they on the run? Did they kill someone? – we did get to watch a succession of pratfalls and catchphrases that were deployed with unbeatable skill. This is why people remember ChuckleVision not for the show, but for the chemistry between the brothers.The Chuckle Brothers were beloved, so much so that viewers have been able to look past their more unsavoury moments, such as when Barry was punched by the husband of a woman to whom he had been sending lewd emails, or when he shared a Britain First post on his Facebook page. To remain a national treasure after this is incredible. No wonder ChuckleVision topped the list."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95066f222ce73287d306118445ed657720e54baa/0_173_6000_3599/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51f2453db940d3f83740f3f64c99a7df","title":"canada salmon fraser river british columbia","story":"Helicopters, heavy machinery and nearly 200 workers are frantically working to free millions of salmon trapped by a landslide in western Canada.Government crews in the area have worked relentlessly along the banks of the Fraser River to clear debris after a rockslide, discovered in a late June, created an impassable 5m-high waterfall.Each year, several species of Pacific salmon – sockeye, chinook, pink and coho – travel up British Columbia’s Fraser River to reproduce. But the newly formed barrier has blocked the fish from accessing critical watersheds for egg laying.Weeks of excavation have shown success: already, 12,000 salmon have passed through carefully constructed channels. And 44,000 salmon – as many as 3,000 per day – have been transported by helicopter.“Nothing is off the table unless it’s determined as not being feasible. We are looking at any and all options,” Michael Crowe of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, told reporters on Wednesday. The team hopes to continue moving fish by truck, after the road was rebuilt, as well as developing a fish ladder.Emergency crews have leaned heavily on local Indigenous communities, and their knowledge of salmon spawning, to help gather tens of thousands of fish.“First Nations’ technical knowledge in fish capture – from beach-seining crews to a second fish wheel – underpins the operation,” said the government in a media release.Muddy, fast-moving water has made it difficult for officials to estimate the number of salmon trapped below the landslide site. In previous years, said Crowe, millions of salmon would be passing through this section of the Fraser River. A number of fish have been outfitted with radio tracking collars in order to give a clearer picture of how many have successfully moved upstream.The landslide, and the frantic effort to clear it, highlights the barriers – natural and human-made – that salmon face each year.In much of western North America, hydroelectric dams have blocked critical spawning routes. In recent years, the plight of displaced salmon has prompted increasingly dramatic attempts to move the fish, including the “salmon cannon” – footage of which recently went viral."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49e1f7de8265c75b4ff48b4216865c3706f9de56/0_56_3072_1844/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81134b0d84b021ef1805f8d416289475","title":"italy president gives giuseppe conte mandate form new government m5s pd","story":"PM to lead coalition of ruling Five Star Movement and opposition Democratic partyThe Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has said now is the time to “turn a crisis into an opportunity” after accepting a fresh mandate to try to form a new government that could mark a turning point in Italy’s fractured relations with the EU.President Sergio Mattarella has tasked Conte with securing a pact between the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the centre-left Democratic party (PD) in a move that would oust the far-right League from government and stave off early elections.“It’s a delicate period for the country and we need to exit the political uncertainty soon,” Conte said after a meeting with Mattarella on Thursday. “This will be a new season, a time for relaunch … it won’t be a government ‘against’, but one that is for the citizens and modernises the country.”He also said Italy, one of the founders of the EU, must return to being a “protagonist” in the bloc.This could be Conte’s second chance at leading Italy after he resigned last week, ending a turbulent alliance between M5S and the League. Conte, a law professor, has a few days to ensure M5S and the PD set aside their myriad differences to create a strong and lasting government.The two parties still need to draft a programme and pick a cabinet. One of the hurdles is the role of Luigi Di Maio, the M5S leader. The PD insisted he step down as deputy prime minister in return for them accepting Conte as prime minister.The other potential threat is the plan by M5S to ask its members to vote on any agreement with the PD on Rousseau, the online network it often uses to make policy decisions. It is unclear how many subscribers the site has or how votes are counted, but many M5S activists oppose the alliance.If they manage to form a government, the first challenges will be to draft Italy’s budget for 2020 and freeze a hike in VAT. The parties are poised to ask the EU for flexibility with the budget, the first draft of which must be ready by the end of September, in order to “reinforce social cohesion” in the country.“We need to get to work immediately to come up with a budget that avoids an increase in VAT,” Conte said.There were fierce clashes between Italy and the EU over this year’s budget and the country’s huge public debt. Conte, who has repeatedly said Italy would respect EU budgetary rules, has twice managed to avert threats of sanctions.Italy was plunged into chaos this month after Matteo Salvini withdrew his League party from its fractious alliance with M5S, as he sought to exploit his party’s popularity to bring about snap elections and become prime minister.The dramatic move threatened to create a fully far-right government. But Salvini, whose tactics have dented his popularity in recent weeks, had not banked on M5S teaming up with the PD. The pair are longstanding enemies but also the two largest parties in parliament.Salvini had also not expected Conte to emerge as his rival. Talks between the PD and M5S progressed after Nicola Zingaretti, the PD leader, succumbed to demands from Di Maio to reinstate Conte.Conte, who was repeatedly dismissed as a “puppet” when governing the M5S-League alliance, has come into his own in recent weeks.

Wherever you dig, there’s another one,” he added.The children’s remains were found in a position facing the sea. Some still had skin and hair and had been found with silver earrings.Huanchaco was a site where many child sacrifices took place during the time of the Chimú culture, whose apogee was between 1200 and 1400.Archaeologists first found children’s bodies at the dig site in the town’s Pampa la Cruz neighbourhood in June 2018, unearthing 56 skeletons.Pampa la Cruz is a short distance from Huanchaquito, where the remains of 140 sacrificed children and 200 llamas were found in April 2018.Excavation work at Huanchaquito started in 2011, but the findings were first published last year by National Geographic, which helped finance the investigation.Researchers there found footprints that had survived rain and erosion. The small footprints indicate the children were marched to their deaths from Chan Chan, an huge, ancient adobe city a mile from the burial site.The children’s skeletons contained lesions on their breastbones, which were probably made by a ceremonial knife. Dislocated ribcages suggest whoever was performing the sacrifices may have been trying to extract the children’s hearts.The Chimú civilisation extended along the Peruvian coast to Ecuador but disappeared in 1475 after it was conquered by the Inca empire, which in turn fell to the Spanish conquistadors.The region still suffers the devastating effects of El Niño.In March 2017, 67 people were killed and thousands more forced to evacuate by intense rains which damaged 115,000 homes and destroyed more than 100 bridges in Peru.In 1998, a “super” El Niño hit Peru, killing more than 300 people and causing billions of dollars of damage.AFP contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/262904f8ebd691a9c86bdd220ab66ce61bc0c9e0/0_0_5000_2999/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86a8828414575abdc27b63207c3b89dd","title":"redesigned russian space suit lucky pee ritual astronauts","story":"Astronauts will no longer be able to urinate on bus that picks them up for launchRussia has unveiled a new space suit but the design may have to be changed to continue a decades-old tradition – making a stop to pee on the way to the launch.The Sokol-M prototype suit was designed as a replacement for suits worn during launches to the International Space Station (ISS) on Soyuz spacecraft.The Soyuz, in use since the 1960s, is to be phased out and replaced in the next few years with a new Russian ship called the Federation.The maker of the suits, the aerospace firm Zvezda, says they will be made of new materials and adaptable to different body sizes.But the new design makes it impossible to carry out one particular ritual launched by the first man in space, Yuri Gagarin, who had to relieve himself on the back wheel of the bus that was taking him to the launch pad in 1961.The stop has been replicated at every launch from the Baikonur launch pad and, many male cosmonauts and astronauts pee on the tyre for good luck – something that would be impossible in the new suit, according to its maker.Female astronauts are not obligated to participate but some have brought vials of their urine to splash on the wheel instead.“I’m not sure how they will be able to (carry on the tradition), since we haven’t designed the fly,” said the Zvezda director, Sergei Pozdnyakov, quoted by Russian agencies. “We have the design specifications. They don’t state that it’s necessary to pee on the wheel. The design specifications would need to be adapted.”The orange Sokol-M suit has one diagonal zipper, rather than the currently used white Sokol-K, which has a V-shaped opening pointing to the crotch.The new suit is lighter due to the zipper and all seams are airtight, so there is no longer a need for the internal rubberised layer known as “the bladder”, which is difficult to get in and out of.All members of the ISS crew have to wear bespoke Sokol-K suits, since they must be worn on the Soyuz spacecraft that brings cosmonauts and astronauts to orbit.The suits are designed to be comfortable while reclining in the deep Soyuz chairs, but are heavy and contribute to a noticeable stoop when walking up to the rocket.Soyuz launches are full of rituals in which cosmonauts plant trees at Baikonur, get haircuts, watch the classic Soviet film White Sun of the Desert and have an Orthodox priest sprinkle holy water on them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a14214f576a018675eb995afaf3922816ce4d14e/0_146_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e7d3773418f248a5c56162d074aa82f","title":"why is china hiding its oil tankers from us trackers","story":"Signs Beijing may be importing Iranian oil as Trump’s two biggest foreign policy headaches convergeIn early June, a Chinese-owned supertanker abruptly went dark in the Indian Ocean, the tracking system signalling its course apparently deactivated.It was not the first ship to vanish from the monitors. The deactivation of transponders that generate a unique ID issued to ships by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has become increasingly familiar in recent weeks to the companies that track tankers.The Trump administration has stepped up its efforts to track tankers linked to China’s biggest state-run oil company in response to signs that the vessels are helping to transport Iranian crude in defiance of US sanctions against Tehran.“They are hiding their activity,” Samir Madani, the co-founder of TankerTrackers, told the New York Times in July. “They don’t want to broadcast the fact that they have been in Iran, evading sanctions. It’s that simple.”The case of the Pacific Bravo, which the US had flagged up as a suspected sanctions breaker, is doubly intriguing. After its unique tracker identifying number disappeared, it reappeared more than a month later attached to a ship listed with a different name, changed in an apparently clumsy effort to disguise it.Other Chinese-owned tankers, several of which are owned by the Bank of Kunlun according to media reports and evidence from tracking companies, have used different tactics. Some have been captured on satellite images interacting with Iranian ships.The events unfolding on the maritime trade routes point to a wider story, of the increasingly complex convergence of two of the Trump administration’s most pressing foreign policy concerns. While Washington seeks to block Iranian oil exports as part of a “maximum pressure” campaign to force Tehran to negotiate over its nuclear and security policies, China – which is locked in its own escalating trade war with the US – appears to be throwing Iran a significant lifeline.Iran for its part has encouraged China. The country’s first vice-president, Eshaq Jahangiri, told a visiting Chinese official recently that Tehran expected Beijing to be more active in buying Iranian oil.“I think the two issues have been converging for a while,” Ali Vaez, an Iran analyst with the thinktank Crisis Group said.. . “The main reason that China initially complied with the US … policy and significantly reduced oil imports from Iran was because it hoped it could be a card that bore some idends in the trade negotiations. As soon as those talks ran into dead lock, China turned around and resumed oil imports from Iran.”Efforts to evade the sanctions have so far been limited, Vaez and other analysts watching the issue closely say the messaging is clear: China “can make or break the US maximum pressure policy”.Vaez notes, however, that access to Iranian oil is not simply a question of leverage for China, but reflects its long-term strategic aim not to be complicit in US moves it fears may lead to regime change in Iran.“China has a complex calculation regarding Iran. It is the only oil-rich country where the US does not have a foothold. From the point of view of China’s energy needs, Iran is very important,” he said. “But on the other hand China has bigger fish to fry with the US with trade negotiations and it needs to balance relations with other oil-rich countries like Saudi Arabia.”Sanam Vakil, a senior researcher at Chatham House, believes the subterfuges currently involved reflect a desire by both China and Iran to avoid an overt confrontation over the issue, as Tehran becomes ever more “creative” about its oil exports.For Vakil, one of the key takeaways has been the Trump administration’s inability to manage the overlapping crises it has fuelled. “It’s unfortunate for US foreign policy that it has so many interconnected crises. It’s impossible for the US government to meet all of of its objectives,” he said.Vaez echoes the sentiment, adding that Chinese imports of Iranian oil may also have discreet support in European capitals still committed to keeping the Iran nuclear deal alive despite Washington’s unilateral withdrawal.“I’m not sure the Trump administration has the bandwidth or the strategic understanding to connect all these dots. That’s why its been own worst enemy. Too many of its main files, including North Korea and Iran, are dependent on how the Trump administration treats China.“In practice, however, this is an administration which, when offered the opportunity to fight too many fires at same time, will jump at it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/437483c11303d2e352a9f8edcc1e7802646c63f6/0_107_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe129db67ff6ff23aa8c4e4c8a496da2","title":"east timor indonesias invasion and the long road to independence","story":"The 1999 referendum came after 24 years of occupation by Indonesian forcesIn April 1974 a leftwing coup in Lisbon, the Carnation Revolution, led to Portugal setting its colonial outposts adrift. It withdrew its administrative and military personnel – including from Mozambique, Angola and what was then called Portuguese Timor.Local elections were held in East Timor and the two biggest parties – the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (Fretilin) and the Timorese Democratic Union (UDT) – formed a coalition, but it did not last long. Fighting broke out, there was an attempted coup by UDT, and then Fretilin unilaterally declared independence on 28 November 1975.Indonesian forces had already secretly begun attacks across the border from Indonesian West Timor (on the other side of the island) in October 1975, where five Australian journalists were killed in the town of Balibo. Jakarta feared a communist state on its doorstep and that a newly independent country in its sphere could destabilise the rest of the archipelago. It launched a full-scale invasion of Timor in December 1975.Portugal’s colonial influence meant the population was culturally very different from the rest of Indonesia. The vast majority of East Timorese are devout Catholics and speak their own language (Tetun).The Indonesian forces were brutal. As many as 200,000 people are thought to have perished in fighting, massacres and forced starvation. Fretilin and its armed wing, Falintil, retreated to the interior of the island with tens of thousands of civilians. It’s thought 100,000 died in the first few years, as the armed resistance was largely crushed and Indonesia held civilians in detention camps where many died in a famine. In July 1976 Indonesia’s parliament declared East Timor the country’s 27th province.Many countries, including Australia, effectively looked the other way, prepared to appease Indonesia because of its size and power in the region. In 1978 Australia’s prime minister, Malcolm Fraser, was the first to recognise Jakarta’s de facto annexation. But the UN condemned it and called for an act of self-determination.In 1992 the head of the resistance, Xanana Gusmão, was captured and imprisoned in Jakarta. It was an almighty blow. The year before, leaked footage of the massacre of 100 mourners at a funeral at Santa Cruz cemetery in Dili had emerged, reminding the world of the brutality of the occupation. In 1996 the country’s de facto foreign affairs minister, José Ramos-Horta, was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace prize with Bishop Carlos Belo, the head of the Catholic church in Timor.In 1998 a political earthquake brought change to Indonesia. The Asian financial crisis and massive pro-democracy protests led to the resignation of the country’s strongman, President Suharto, who had been in power for more than 30 years and had authorised the invasion of Timor. Suharto’s successor, President BJ Habibe, was more open to some form of autonomy for East Timor, and released Gusmão from prison in Jakarta, into house arrest. In March 1999 Habibe announced that if, in a “process of consultation”, the East Timorese favoured independence over autonomy under Indonesia, he would grant it.On 20 September 1999 an Australian-led international peacekeeping force, Interfet, arrived to restore order. But extensive damage had been done. Towns and villages were decimated and vital infrastructure was ruined. Gusmão and other exiled leaders returned soon afterwards and the UN ran a three-year administration in the lead-up to parliamentary and presidential elections. In May 2002 Gusmão was inducted as president of the newly named Timor-Leste."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Nearly 40 per cent of rough sleepers now living in tents \u0026ndash ICHH\u0026lsquoWhen the train stops I will step onto that platform with hope and no fear\u0026rsquoMinister tells conference stress, anxiety and depression have impact on Irish economyCall for health service to increase capacity to perform weight-loss surgeryNew \u0026lsquoBrits Not Out\u0026rsquo group of British expats to protest outside UK embassy next weekLiffey Meats becomes fifth processor to secure injunction against protesting farmersConal Gibbons laments \u0026lsquomore humane law\u0026rsquo in case of 17-year-old repeatedly breaking curfewAlice and Beatrice Grant say they have \u0026lsquoIrish blood\u0026rsquo in their family and are unfazed by social media criticismMan (35) ordered to stay away from woman he is accused of assaulting in his car last DecemberSix-hundred-year-old tree garners 42 per cent of public votePriest from Mount Merrion raised \u0026euro600,000 for motor neurone causes in a walk last yearMinister calls on Boris Johnson to put forward alternative to backstopApology comes day after 300 Irish employees had contracts ended in tech giant\u0026rsquos Cork facilityTony Broughan has gone to Dublin football matches dressed as Molly Malone since 1975Keep Ireland Open makes complaint to Wicklow Co Council over erection of new fencing at estate"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4001490.1567094192!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bye bye britain the dutch get ready for a brexit party","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA giant beach party is planned on October 31st in  Wijk aan Zee, a quiet seaside village west of Amsterdam facing across the North Sea, where a band will play We’ll Meet Again.  Photograph: VlietiStockIt’s undoubtedly going to be one of those “where were you?” moments. And already almost 10,000 people in the Netherlands have decided: on October 31st, irrespective of the weather, they’ll be at a giant beach party, facing across the North Sea, with a band playing We’ll Meet Again.The idea of a huge European “Bye, Bye Britain” party in Wijk aan Zee, a quiet seaside village west of Amsterdam best known for its annual chess tournament, started as a bit of a joke – until suddenly it went viral on Facebook. Now, says one of the organisers, film maker Ron Toekook, it’s caught the imagination. “Because so many Dutch people live in apartments, there’s a tradition here: you take your deck chair and a bottle of wine and go to the beach to watch the sun setting. Everyone does it. We love it.”The plan is for plenty of European food and drink – French wine, German beer, Dutch cheese, Belgian fries, Italian pasta, even Austrian strudel – to remind the Brits what they’re giving up, all to be consumed against a soundscape of nostalgic tunes from the previous Battle of Britain.“We’ll fall asleep to the sound of the waves,” says Toekook. “When we wake up, the UK will have cut itself off from the Continent, and we’ll be ready to go to the aid of the boats full of pro-Europeans.”If that seems a surprisingly unruffled way to mark a cross-channel parting that could hurt their economy badly – a no-deal Brexit could cost the Netherlands €34 billion up to 2030, or €164 a year per citizen, according to the research bureau SEO – that’s because the Dutch are even more uncertain about Brexit and its implications than the British and Irish are.Gains and lossesOn the one hand, they’re being told that Amsterdam, in particular, is “hoovering up” jobs – such as the 900 at the European Medicines Agency – at firms that are abandoning the UK and others that are opting not to go there. On the other, they’re being warned about the impact on the 200,000 Dutch jobs tied directly to trade with the UK.The problem is that both are true. As to the balance, the country is in “wait and see mode”, says deputy mayor of Amsterdam Udo Kock. And the figures? According to the Dutch foreign investment agency NFIA, 60 foreign companies and institutions brought about 2,500 Brexit-related jobs to the Netherlands in 2018, increasing the total number of Brexit-related companies Amsterdam has notched up so far to 98.Another 325 companies – “including some big names”, says the NFIA coyly – have made detailed inquiries that are being taken seriously.On the down side, the UK is the third biggest export destination for Dutch goods after Germany and Belgium, buying €40 billion worth every year, a huge 9.2 per cent of total overseas trade. A “hard” Brexit, with a reversion to WTO rules, would mean an increase of €628 million a year in administrative fees alone, say KPMG. At its starkest, according to the IMF, a no-deal Brexit would mean a drop of 0.7 per cent in Dutch GDP. Only Ireland with an eye-watering fall of four per cent would be worse affected.The biggest potential flashpoint will be Rotterdam, Europe’s largest port and the third-busiest in the world. It’s doing its best to plan. It has employed 300 more customs officers. It has cleared parking space for 200 trucks to minimise waiting time for new permits. Black boxBut while the terms of Britain’s departure remain in doubt, it’s impossible to model what will actually happen, only scenarios based on possible outcomes. “How things will work on the British side, in particular, is still a black box,” admits the port’s chief executive, Allard Castelein. In the end though, the figures are beside the point, says Dutch finance minister Wopke Hoekstra, formerly a consultant with McKinsey – and he’s right.“In principle, Brexit is bad for the Netherlands, it’s bad for Europe and – I am certain – it will turn out bad for the UK as well. In fact, the only countries who’ll see it as a good thing geopolitically are China and Russia, because it will lead to a weaker, more ided, Europe.”It’s a sign of the times that one wonders for a second why Hoekstra didn’t mention the US and Donald Trump in the same breath as China and Russia – before remembering that America is the Netherlands’ sixth-largest trading partner. To coin a phrase: It’s the economy stupid.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

But joining up has been expensive and complicated.Now it says the new scheme will allow more people to sign up, allowing the third-party shops that currently offer\u0026nbspout-of-warranty iPhone repairs to do so in a way that is encouraged by Apple.Shops that sign up will get the same parts, tools, training, repair manuals and diagnostic tools as those AASPs, and will still have the option to use third-party parts if they wish. But they will do so without having to pay, which the company hopes will encourage many more people to sign up.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

Apple hopes to roll it out to other regions soon.Both big and small companies took part in the trial, and the same is expected to happen as it rolls out more wideley.Apple releases strange new iPhone update“To better meet our customers’ needs, we’re making it easier for independent providers across the US to tap into the same resources as our Apple\u0026nbspAuthorized\u0026nbspService Provider network,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, in a statement.“When a repair is needed, a customer should have confidence the repair is done right. We believe the safest and most reliable repair is one handled by a trained technician using genuine parts that have been properly engineered and rigorously tested.”The new programme comes amid questions about the right to repair technology products made by companies like Apple. Activists argue that technology companies do not do enough to let people fix their own devices, but the new scheme will not offer any way for normal iPhone owners to do repairs on their own.Instead, Apple aims to make it easier for customers to have their out-of-warranty iPhone repairs done by verified people, which could allow phones to live on for longer.Companies will not pay to join the new independent repair program, and they will be able to buy the parts and tools used to fix the phone at the same cost as AASPs. Anyone who tries to join it will need to\u0026nbsphave a member of staff go through a 40-hour Apple training programme, which is also free, giving them certification.They will also have to commit to return the parts that are fixed to Apple. The company will then attempt to recycle them – and, if that isn\u0027t possible, will send them through the intensive process that allows Apple to pull out the re-usable materials from old parts.Apple will continue the run the AASP programme, and expects those companies that are currently a part of it to stay. Shops that are part of that older scheme will still get access to extra benefits, including the ability to do repairs that are part of a warranty, in addition to those that are outside of it.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It found multiple “suspicious offers” in all of them apart from Sainsbury’s.Among the “misleading” discounts it discovered was an offer at Iceland to buy two packs of Kellogg’s Crunchy Nut for £4, which works out as £2 each. However, the pack price was just £1.49 a week earlier.Morrisons promoted Cathedral City Mature Cheddar Cheese as “was £3.50 now £2” for a week in September, even though the product was available for £2 the month before.Meanwhile, Asda labelled Wall’s Carte D’Or Strawberry Ice Cream “was £3.50 now £2”. But the 1l tub was sold at £2 for longer, with the so-called special offer running only for 12 weeks.Created with Sketch.

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesAccording to the Which? High Street survey 201929 8. House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesFollowing a Which? complaint in 2015, the government published new guidance to make sure retailers’ pricing practices comply with consumer law. The rules state that information presented to consumers must be fair, must not waste time or cause disappointment, and should not lead buyers to overspend.“Four years on from our super-complaint on misleading pricing practices, many of the big supermarkets are clearly still in the wrong, with numerous examples of dodgy discounts and never-ending offers,” said Natalie Hitchins, head of home products and services at Which?.“These retailers must stop tricking shoppers with deceptive deals and spurious special offers.”Which? will report its findings to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), and Ms Hitchins urged the CMA to intervene if necessary.Only two of the supermarkets responded to Which? when presented with the findings. Iceland said it will review its promotional calendar, while Asda disagreed with the suggestion that its offers are misleading.“While most of the deals we monitored did represent good value, we spotted 65 instances across the year of supermarkets using misleading discounts that didn’t represent the bargains they claimed.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It included the words by innovation only and included all of the details about the event.But it was the image lurking behind the text that might offer the real clue about what\u0027s to come.The image is notably colourful: far more brightly coloured than Apple\u0027s usual invitation. It suggests, at the very least, that something particularly vibrant is on its way.But it might be a reference to something more specific.

That could further suggest that Apple is aiming for a nostalgic look in the new devices.Apple confirms when it will release new iPhoneThe different hues might also be a reference to the colours of the phones themselves. With the iPhone XR last year, Apple launched the new devices in a variety of different colours – and many of those colours are present in the image.There is, at the moment, no green iPhone. But, by coincidence, that colour has also been rumoured as the new one in Apple\u0027s upcoming line-up.Apple\u0027s event invitations are always picked through for clues about what is to come. Usually, they don\u0027t offer anything concrete – but can give an important indication of the kind of theme that Apple is aiming for in the new products or the event more generally.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Previous release schedules suggest the phones could arrive around 20 September – and, for the first time, Apple is expected to release all three of them at once.As well as the iPhones, Apple could also reveal new Apple Watches, MacBooks, iPads\u0026nbspand other products.

Yet, the actor deeply regretted playing the maid Aibileen Clark, saying her character’s voice is not heard enough in the final film. Have I ever done roles that I\u0027ve regretted? I have, and The Help is on that list, she told The New York Times. I want to know what it feels like to work for white people and to bring up children in 1963, I want to hear how you really feel about it. I never heard that in the course of the movie.”The Transformers franchise may have grossed billions of dollars at the box-office, but critics have never looked kindly upon the films. Neither has Megan Fox, who told Entertainment Weekly that “people are well aware that this is not a movie about acting”. She also previously took aim at director Michael Bay, saying: “He wants to be like Hitler on his sets, and he is, so he\u0027s a nightmare to work for.” Fox later retracted the comment, calling it “righteous anger” that should have not been made public. Knocked Up remains one of Katherine Heigl’s best-known roles, despite the actor having said she found the whole thing “a little sexist. It paints the women as shrews, as humourless and uptight, and it paints the men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys,” she told Vanity Fair. It exaggerated the characters, and I had a hard time with it, on some days.Few people knew who Idris Elba was before The Wire. Despite the acclaim that came from playing Stringer Bell on the hugely popular crime show, Elba has some regrets. We\u0027re all idolising Stringer Bell, but who are we really idolising? he asked David Lammy while appearing on James O’Brien’s podcast. Are we idolising a smart drug dealer or a dumb narcotics dealer? What are we saying here? Is it OK to pump a community full of heroin but because you\u0027re smart at it, that makes you cool? That was a problem for me.There are famously seven cuts of Blade Runner. One of those features Harrison Ford’s character, Rick Deckard, narrating scenes. Another – the one director Ridley Scott approves of – is bleaker and does not have Deckard explaining events. Ford does not care for either version. I didn\u0027t like the movie one way or the other, with or without,” he said in 2017, before the release of Blade Runner 2049. “I played a detective who did not have any detecting to do. In terms of how I related to the material, I found it very difficult. There was stuff that was going on that was really nuts.For a time, many people were not sure whether Daniel Craig would return as James Bond for the 25th film in the series. I\u0027d rather break this glass and slash my wrists,” he told Time Out of returning to the role. “No, not at the moment. Not at all. That\u0027s fine. I\u0027m over it at the moment. We\u0027re done. All I want to do is move on. Apparently a big enough pay cheque got him back in the tuxedo. I\u0027ll be honest, I f**king hate that movie,” Channing Tatum said of GI Joe. “I was pushed into doing it. The script wasn’t any good. And I didn’t want to do something that I – that I was a fan of since I was a kid and watched every morning growing up – and didn\u0027t want to do something that was, one, bad. And two, I just didn’t know if I wanted to be GI Joe.Most actors who regret taking on roles would wait a few years until publicly bemoaning their experience on set. Not Robert Pattinson. Before the final Twilight film was in cinemas, the actor said of playing the vampire heartthrob Edward Cullen: It’s weird kind of representing something you don\u0027t particularly like. A few weeks later, he added how he would have “mindlessly hated the series had he not appeared in it.While superhero movies may now be Oscar Best Picture contenders (Black Panther), there was a time when playing a dex-wearing vigilante was anything but prestigious. Jessica Alba was one of the first people to jump on the superhero boom of the mid-Noughties, playing Invisible Woman in Fantastic Four. The experience, though, left her wanting to quit acting altogether. I hated it. I really hated, she told Elle. I remember when I was dying in Silver Surfer. The director was like, \u0027It looks too real. It looks too painful. Can you be prettier when you cry? Cry pretty, Jessica\u0027.Ryan Reynolds has never watched Green Lantern all the way through. That has not stopped the actor being highly critical of the superhero role, going as far as having Deadpool – who he later played – shoot a fictional version of himself in the head for taking on the role. Ouch.Kate Winslet does not mind Titanic as a film. Her performance as Rose is a completely different matter. Every single scene, I\u0027m like \u0027really, really? You did it like that? Oh my God’. Even my American accent, I can\u0027t listen to it. It\u0027s awful, she told the . Hopefully it\u0027s so much better now. It sounds terribly self-indulgent but actors do tend to be very self-critical. I have a hard time watching any of my performances, but watching Titanic I was just like, \u0027Oh God, I want to do that again.\u0027“I hated that film with a vengeance and could not believe how bad it was,” Michelle Pfeiffer said of the sequel to Grease. At the time I was young and didn\u0027t know any better. Thankfully, Pfeiffer\u0027s nose for a good script improved rapidly, with her next film being Brian De Palma\u0027s cult classic Scarface. Halle Berry remains one of the few actors to accept her Golden Raspberry award in person. Thank you so much. I never in my life thought I would be up here,” she told the audience, before spoofing her own Oscar acceptance speech and thanking her manager. He loves me so much that he convinces me to do projects even when he knows that it is shit. Meeeeeow. 1434 Christopher Plummer – The Sound of MusicThe Sound of Music remains one of the most beloved films of all time. Christopher Plummer, though, hated playing Captain von Trapp. “I think the part in The Sound of Music was the toughest,” he told The Hollywood Reporter. “Because it was so awful and sentimental and gooey. You had to work terribly hard to try and infuse some miniscule bit of humour into it.”Another big-name actor who regrets taking on a mid-Noughties superhero role. Ben Affleck has remained an ardent Daredveil detractor. Daredevil didn\u0027t work at all, the actor told Entertainment Weekly in 2007. “If I wanted to go viral, I would be less polite. That was before people realised you could make these movies and make them well. There was a cynical sense of ‘put a red leather outfit on a guy, have him run around, hunt some bad guys, and cash the cheque’.”1634 Sylvester Stallone – Stop, or Mom Will ShootOne of Hollywood’s many iconic actors, Sylvester Stallone will always be remembered for both the Rocky and Rambo films. Less so Stop, or Mom Will Shoot, the 1992 buddy-cop comedy that teamed Stallone up with Estelle Getty. Speaking about the film in 2006, he called it “maybe one of the worst films in the entire solar system, including alien productions we’ve never seen.”1734 Sarah Jessica Parker – Sex and the City 2Although Sarah Jessica Parker will forever be best known for playing Carrie Bradshaw on Sex and the City, that does not mean she’s not open to criticising the second film. I can see where we fell short,” she told an audience at Vulture festival. “I understand, I actually get it. I will say, I also understand how much frickin’ money it made. I feel like that is forgotten in the discussion.” Paul Newman had high standards. So much so that, before the release of The Silver Chalice, the Oscar-winning actor took out adverts in the trade press urging people to not watch the television broadcast of the film. He later called it “the worst motion picture produced during the 1950s.Few actors are quite as straight talking as Colin Farrell, who said of the 2006 blockbuster Miami Vice: Miami Vice? I didn\u0027t like it so much. I thought it was style over substance and I accept a good bit of the responsibility.”There are many films Brad Pitt could arguably regret making (the awful 1992 flick Cool World comes to mind), but speaking to Newsweek in 1997, the actor decided to criticise The Devil’s Own. He called the film a disaster and the most irresponsible bit of filmmaking, if you can even call it that, that I\u0027ve ever seen.Following the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, Jim Carrey distanced himself from the violent Kick Ass sequel. “I did Kick Ass a month before Sandy Hook and now in all good conscience I cannot support that level of violence,” he wrote on Twitter. “My apologies”.Most people know Zac Efron as Troy Bolton from High School Musical. Zac Efron, though, wishes you knew him for something else. “I step back and look at myself and I still want to kick that guy’s ass sometimes, he told Men\u0027s Fitness. He’s done some kind of cool things with some cool people – he did that one thing that was funny – but, I mean, he’s still just that f***ing kid from High School Musical.2334 Shia LaBeouf – Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal SkullCharlize Theron may be one of the most acclaimed actors working today, but that does not mean she has not worked on bad films. One of those was Reindeer Games, co-starring Ben Affleck. “Reindeer Games. That was a bad, bad, bad movie,” she told Esquire in 2007. “But even though the movie might suck, I got to work with John Frankenheimer. I wasn’t lying to myself – that’s why I did it.”The Amazing Spider-Man series, starring Andrew Garfield as the eponymous web-slinger, was supposed to launch a cinematic universe to match the Avengers. There were even rumours of an Aunt May film entering production. Not that the actor who played Aunt May, Sally Field, would have been thrilled by that. “It’s really hard to find a three-dimensional character in it,” she told Howard Stern of playing the character, “and you work it as much as you can, but you can’t put 10 pounds of s**t in a five-pound bag.”Michael Keaton, Christian Bale, Adam West – some of Hollywood’s best actors have played the Caped Crusader on screen. However, only one wore a suit with Batnipples: George Clooney. “Let me just say that I’d actually thought I’d destroyed the franchise until somebody else brought it back years later and changed it,” he said of the role. “I thought at the time that this was going to be a very good career move. It wasn’t.”2734 Daniel Radcliffe – Harry Potter and the Half Blood PrinceDirector David Gordon Green, Danny McBride and James Franco struck gold with their stoner-comedy Pineapple Express. Unfortunately, their attempt to make another laugh-out-loud film, Your Highness, was a mess. Your Highness? That movie sucks, Franco told GQ. You can\u0027t get around that.Matt Damon’s original Bourne trilogy won plaudits from critics around the world, with the second instalment featuring on The Independent’s “Films to watch before you die” list. The actor, though, has spoken unkindly about the third film, The Bourne Ultimatum, saying the original script, written by director Tony Gilroy, was awful. It\u0027s really the studio\u0027s fault for putting themselves in that position, Damon told GQ. I don\u0027t blame Tony for taking a boatload of money and handing in what he handed in. It\u0027s just that it was unreadable. This is a career-ender. I mean, I could put this thing up on eBay and it would be game over for that dude. It\u0027s terrible. It\u0027s really embarrassing. He was having a go, basically, and he took his money and left.“It\u0027s the worst film I have ever made,” the former Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, said of the fantasy film Red Sonja. “When my kids get out of line, they\u0027re sent to their rooms and forced to watch Red Sonja 10 times. I never had too much trouble with them.3234 Alec Baldwin – Rock of AgesThere are some actors who know they’re making a disaster midway through production. “It was a complete disaster,” Alec Baldwin told The Wrap when asked about Rock of Ages. “A week in you go, ‘Oh God, what have I done?\u0027”Bill Murray only voiced the beloved cat Garfield because of a misunderstanding: he thought Joel Coen, of the Coen brothers fame, had written the script. In fact, Joel Cohen, whose filmography includes Cheaper by the Dozen, Toy Story, and Monster Mash: The Movie, had. I was exhausted, soaked with sweat, and the lines got worse and worse. And I said, \u0027Okay, you better show me the whole rest of the movie, so we can see what we\u0027re dealing with,\u0027 he told GQ. So I sat down and watched the whole thing, and I kept saying, \u0027Who the hell cut this thing? Who did this? What the f*** was Coen thinking?\u0027 And then they explained it to me: it wasn\u0027t written by that Joel Coen.Even for video-game adaptations, Super Mario Bros, released in 1993, was a particularly strange film. Asked by , What is the worst job you\u0027ve done? What has been your biggest disappointment? and If you could edit your past, what would you change? the actor had only one answer: Super Mario Brothers.Viola Davis was nominated for an Oscar for The Help. Yet, the actor deeply regretted playing the maid Aibileen Clark, saying her character’s voice is not heard enough in the final film. Have I ever done roles that I\u0027ve regretted? I have, and The Help is on that list, she told The New York Times. I want to know what it feels like to work for white people and to bring up children in 1963, I want to hear how you really feel about it. I never heard that in the course of the movie.”The Transformers franchise may have grossed billions of dollars at the box-office, but critics have never looked kindly upon the films. Neither has Megan Fox, who told Entertainment Weekly that “people are well aware that this is not a movie about acting”. She also previously took aim at director Michael Bay, saying: “He wants to be like Hitler on his sets, and he is, so he\u0027s a nightmare to work for.” Fox later retracted the comment, calling it “righteous anger” that should have not been made public. Knocked Up remains one of Katherine Heigl’s best-known roles, despite the actor having said she found the whole thing “a little sexist. It paints the women as shrews, as humourless and uptight, and it paints the men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys,” she told Vanity Fair. It exaggerated the characters, and I had a hard time with it, on some days.Few people knew who Idris Elba was before The Wire. Despite the acclaim that came from playing Stringer Bell on the hugely popular crime show, Elba has some regrets. We\u0027re all idolising Stringer Bell, but who are we really idolising? he asked David Lammy while appearing on James O’Brien’s podcast. Are we idolising a smart drug dealer or a dumb narcotics dealer? What are we saying here? Is it OK to pump a community full of heroin but because you\u0027re smart at it, that makes you cool? That was a problem for me.There are famously seven cuts of Blade Runner. One of those features Harrison Ford’s character, Rick Deckard, narrating scenes. Another – the one director Ridley Scott approves of – is bleaker and does not have Deckard explaining events. Ford does not care for either version. I didn\u0027t like the movie one way or the other, with or without,” he said in 2017, before the release of Blade Runner 2049. “I played a detective who did not have any detecting to do. In terms of how I related to the material, I found it very difficult. There was stuff that was going on that was really nuts.For a time, many people were not sure whether Daniel Craig would return as James Bond for the 25th film in the series. I\u0027d rather break this glass and slash my wrists,” he told Time Out of returning to the role. “No, not at the moment. Not at all. That\u0027s fine. I\u0027m over it at the moment. We\u0027re done. All I want to do is move on. Apparently a big enough pay cheque got him back in the tuxedo. I\u0027ll be honest, I f**king hate that movie,” Channing Tatum said of GI Joe. “I was pushed into doing it. The script wasn’t any good.

The funniest lines from the ‘seismically stupid’ SerenityMatthew McConaughey ‘furious’ after new film becomes his biggest flop Matthew McConaughey explains why he stopped making rom-coms“He has a passion for teaching, and for all things cinematic, that is palpable, even infectious,” said Noah Isenberg, chair of the Department of Radio-Television-Film.McConaughey previously graduated from the Film Studies programme at the University in 1993, the same year he made his star-making film debut in Richard Linklater’s Dazed and Confused.McConaughey’s first semester of classes will see him once again teach about the making of The Gentlemen, along with the making of his 2012 film Mud, with its director Jeff Nichols scheduled to visit for one seminar.

Once it arrives to Mars it will use its own onboard engines to navigate its way safely to the Martian surface. One of the biggest breakthroughs of the Starhopper and Starship is that they run on liquid methane and liquid oxygen, which can both be found and manufactured on Mars.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red.

What those people need is genuinely affordable social homes.”While the 20 per cent reduction was not included in the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government’s (MHCLG) statement, a spokesperson confirmed ministers were considering the proposals and said it would offer further details “in due course”.The proposals that were officially announced by the government on Wednesday morning were met with mixed reactions.More than 210,000 children homeless in England, finds reportCurrently, those using the shared ownership scheme can only purchase their home in increments of 10 per cent, which can be prohibitively expensive, costing up to £45,000 each.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailUnder new plans, pending consultation, people would be allowed to buy shares of\u0026nbsptheir house one per cent at a time.But critics warned administrative costs involved in purchasing further shares\u0026nbsp– such as legal, mortgage arrangement and\u0026nbspvaluation fees\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspcould render\u0026nbspthe proposal\u0026nbsp”unworkable”.The\u0026nbspMHCLG\u0026nbspsaid it wants to make buying smaller chunks a simple, quick process that bypasses the current costly and sometimes lengthy valuations system and will explore the best way to achieve this.Pedzai fears deportation back to Zimbabwe after almost five year waitMr Jenrick\u0027s department\u0026nbspalso announced it had closed a loophole allowing those using the Help to Buy scheme to take on a 35-year mortgage, which until ths week had been capped at 25 years.This would make mortgage payments more affordable but leave people with greater interest to pay off in the long run.Ms\u0026nbspNeate\u0026nbspinstead urged the government to “get building”.“Pinning his hopes on yet another complicated housing scheme is a worrying start for the new housing secretary,” she said.\u0026nbsp“The government must realise that unworkable schemes, laden down with admin costs, are the wrong priority at any time – and are woefully inadequate when this country is facing the current housing emergency.Homeless people denied access to basic healthcare, finds study“If the new government is serious about getting to grips with our housing crisis then it must follow through on its commitment to get building. That’s why we’re calling for 3 million more social homes over the next 20 years, to give more families the sort of step-up they actually need in life.”The MHCLG also plans to increase\u0026nbspthe number of homes sold at discounted prices to people trying to get onto the property ladder\u0026nbspand help\u0026nbspbuild local support for new developments, Wednesday’s statement said.But homeless\u0026nbspcharity\u0026nbspCentrepoint\u0026nbspsaid the proposed changes would “have little impact on the most vulnerable people in need of housing”.The number of people sleeping rough in England has\u0026nbspskyrocketed by 165 per cent in the last eight years, with a homeless person dying every 19 hours\u0026nbspin the UK, data from the Museum of Homelessness suggests.Centrepoint’s head of\u0026nbspmedia and\u0026nbsppublic\u0026nbspaffairs Paul Noblet said in light of increases in debt and the cost of rent, he welcomed any move by government to make home ownership more affordable.“However, for the homeless young people Centrepoint supports, home ownership is not always a realistic or practical option – so the proposed changes will have little impact on the most vulnerable people in need of housing,” he said.“To ensure that everyone can have a place to call home the government must ensure it focuses financial resources as much on increasing the supply of social housing as it does on home ownership.”Mr Jenrick, 37, described his first major policy announcement as “radical”, saying: “Building the houses this country needs is a central priority of this government.“We know that most people still want to own their own home, but for many the dream seems a remote one.\u0026nbspMy mission is to increase the number of homes that are being delivered and to get more young people and families onto the housing ladder, particularly those on lower incomes.“That’s why I am announcing radical changes to shared ownership so we can make it simpler and easier for tens of thousands trying to buy own their own home.”Homeless man dies and second fighting for life after ‘arson attack’Building more homes won’t solve UK housing crisis, new report arguesWhy has Brexit sparked a mini boom in the housing market? But Ms Neate suggested the government could learn from other countries to address the crisis.She referred to schemes in Norway, in which people pay into a housing cooperative rather than making payments on their inidual home to a housing association. This scheme negates some of the costs associated with purchasing new shares.The MHCLG proposals underline Mr\u0026nbspJohnson’s\u0026nbspdesire to shift from Theresa May’s focus on improving renters rights, to increase home ownership and give young people “a\u0026nbspstake in society, the ability to own at least a share of their home”.While Mr\u0026nbspJohnson has stated an intention to build 300,000 new homes a year and make use of brownfield sites – former industrial or commercial lots – none of Wednesday’s\u0026nbsppolicy proposals referred to the building of new\u0026nbsphouses.A spokesperson for Labour’s shadow minister for housing said if homes aren’t being built, it doesn’t matter how large\u0026nbspa proposed discount is.Shadow housing minister Sarah Jones said: “Tinkering with the details of shared ownership is meaningless when lack of investment from government means low cost homes for ownership simply aren’t getting built.\u0026nbspThe Tories have failed to deliver the low-cost homes we need to get people on the housing ladder.”Just one\u0026nbspper cent\u0026nbspof all homeowners have accessed shared ownership, while the number\u0026nbspof these and other low-cost homes being built each year has almost halved since its peak in 20078, when 200,000 new homes were built.However, director of policy and research at the National Housing Federation, Catherine Ryder, said: “We very much welcome the news that the government is looking at ways to make staircasing in shared ownership easier.\u0026nbsp“Shared ownership is the best route into home ownership for people who can’t afford to buy outright and housing associations, who built 14,000 shared ownership homes last year, are committed to working with the government to continue improving it.”The MHCLG has been contacted for comment.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Please help sort this out Priti Patel, before we end up with another Windrush scandal.This government has learned nothing from Windrush – ask any doctorWhat’s wrong with the Windrush compensation scheme? Almost everythingHome Office called ‘reckless’ in leaked review into Windrush scandalMinisters \u0027risk Windrush scandal repeat with EU settlement scheme\u0027In March 2016 ahead of the Brexit referendum Mr Hannan downplayed fears that leaving the EU could cause problems for citizens of other European countries.It\u0027s irresponsible to scare EU nationals in the UK by hinting that their status might change after Brexit. No one\u0027s suggesting such a thing, he said at the time.Campaigners have long warned that the scheme could go wrong. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said as early as January this year that it could result in tens of thousands of EU nationals becoming undocumented. In January the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee said too many people would be missed out by the scheme.Labour MEP Rory Palmer said anyone who had studied the scheme before it was rolled out would have seen it was blindingly obvious that it could go wrong.“It was clear from the outset that the Settled Status scheme had the makings of a scandal like Windrush, I’m sad and angry those predictions are proving to be the case, he told The Independent.“Many of us, MEPs and MPs in Westminster, have been raising concerns for months and months about the scheme and its chaotic implementation. No one who has taken more than a passing interest in this can be surprised by the deeply upsetting and distressing accounts from EU nationals who are been denied Settled Status.”Created with Sketch.An immigrant\u0027s tale: Leaving Britain to escape Brexit hostility Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 Maria, 31, holds her daughters, Elena, two, and baby Ioana, weeks old, in her London homeA few months after Britain voted to leave the European Union, Maria was told her to go back to her native Romania whilst in hospital by an elderly English woman. “You are a foreigner, your place is not here” recalls Maria, who was stunned220 Maria and her husband Adi, 37, take their daughters for a walk in Hampstead Heath near their homeThe couple are preparing to leave Britain later this year with their two children, fed up with what Maria says is xenophobia and the rising cost of living in LondonElena holds up British passports belonging to her and her sister.

It found multiple “suspicious offers” in all of them apart from Sainsbury’s.Among the “misleading” discounts it discovered was an offer at Iceland to buy two packs of Kellogg’s Crunchy Nut for £4, which works out as £2 each. However, the pack price was just £1.49 a week earlier.Morrisons promoted Cathedral City Mature Cheddar Cheese as “was £3.50 now £2” for a week in September, even though the product was available for £2 the month before.Meanwhile, Asda labelled Wall’s Carte D’Or Strawberry Ice Cream “was £3.50 now £2”.

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesFollowing a Which? complaint in 2015, the government published new guidance to make sure retailers’ pricing practices comply with consumer law. The rules state that information presented to consumers must be fair, must not waste time or cause disappointment, and should not lead buyers to overspend.“Four years on from our super-complaint on misleading pricing practices, many of the big supermarkets are clearly still in the wrong, with numerous examples of dodgy discounts and never-ending offers,” said Natalie Hitchins, head of home products and services at Which?.“These retailers must stop tricking shoppers with deceptive deals and spurious special offers.”Which? will report its findings to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), and Ms Hitchins urged the CMA to intervene if necessary.Only two of the supermarkets responded to Which? when presented with the findings. Iceland said it will review its promotional calendar, while Asda disagreed with the suggestion that its offers are misleading.“While most of the deals we monitored did represent good value, we spotted 65 instances across the year of supermarkets using misleading discounts that didn’t represent the bargains they claimed.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You guys have a real problem with terrorist attacks, rapes are very high, stabbings.Gretchen has no military background but reveals she decided to swap domesticity for le in the male-dominated and secretive arms industry after her brother, Alan, narrowly avoided death in the   terror attacks in .They were watching the attacks on the news when they realised that Alan could have been one of the planes that crashed into the Twin Towers, killing everyone on board.I didnt know where he was, and that was the worst thing, thats when it kicks in, says Gretchen. We didnt know how many were taken. We didnt know anything.“I’m frightened I can’t defend the people I love. I pray for the best and prepare for the worst.But it is absolute sheer defence. I want military to have quality weapons, and defend people like you.”Although she admits she is “frightened of guns”, Stacey is given a lesson in shooting a rle and Thor’s most prestigious gun, nicknamed Pandora.She says: “I feel really uneasy and awkward around guns” but Gretchen reassures her, saying: “You’re getting the same training sessions our kids go through. We are going to teach you right along with our children, with my daughter, she is .If the time comes you have to drop the camera and pick up a weapon you’ll know what to do with it.”Despite her initial reluctance, Stacey surprised herself with her “delighted” reaction when she hit the targets. She also concedes that she does feel safer when in dangerous places with people who carry guns.Stacey sees eight-year-old Richie, the son of the companys CEO fire a gun. He tells her it feels awesomeand that he wants to be a sniper when he grows up.Stacey also visits the manufacturers where she meets factory owner, Wade, who takes her through the process of producing weapons to meet Thor’s specic requirements.Wade explains the serial number of the gun means it can always be traced. If the gun is used for criminal activity, Thor will stop selling to that client.The company takes two weeks to produce  rles, which cost around £, each.To test them, each gun is fired  times as part of the companys “internal policy”, before it is wiped to remove fingerprints, packaged and sent to the client.Only three components are needed to make a bullet: the case, powder and projectile.Although making weapons is a vital part of their work the most important part is the paperwork, whichnot completed correctly could see Gretchen face serious consequences.She said: “We follow the rules. We can lose our licence or go to jail. It’s a federal offence. It could be  years per weaponpaperwork isn’t right.”During filming for the documentary, the terrorist attacks at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, which killed  people take place.Thor were in the midst of organising an order to a gun shop in New Zealand where the terrorists bought their firearms.Askedthe attack proves selling arms has dangerous repercussions, Payton says: “I don’t blame all car drivers for one drunk driver. You will find one [bad] person in every business, only we sell things that could cause massacres.”BBC Three’s Stacey Dooley: Face to Face with Arms Dealers is available online on BBC. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

From next June, only those over-s on pension credit will be eligible for free TV licences — just one in five people.That means .million pensioners, including more than , service veterans, will have to find £. a yearthey want to continue watching television.To add insult to injury, the BBC then disclosed how much money it is paying its stars.Anti-Brexit activist and Match Of The Day presenter Gary Lineker is on £,,, Graham Norton is on £, and Claudia Winkleman is on £,.Lineker’s salary alone would pay for more than , TV licences.Asthat wasn’t bad enough, earlier this month the Beeb said it intends to spend £million on an advertising campaign to attract young viewers and listeners.That’s more than the annual budget of Radio .It’s particularly high, given that the BBC can advertise on its own TV channels and radio stations for free. Apparently, the money is going to be spent on targeting young people on social media.Are we really supposed to believe that the BBC cannot afford to pay for pensioners’ TV licences, but can fritter away £million on Facebook adverts There’s almost nothing Auntie won’t stoop to in its desperate pursuit of the “yoof” audience.It has earmarked £million to promote its new Sounds app — including spending £, to transform the London Eye into the “London Ear” — and poured money into a series of increasingly tawdry podcasts, such as Gemma Collins talking about her le, a reality-show round-up called Reality Tea, and Unexpected Fluids, in which teenagers tell embarrassing ­stories about when sex goes wrong.It’s all a far cry from Lord Reith’s mission to explain.No doubt the BBC is concerned about how few young people it manages to attract — and this manests itself in other ways, too, such as its massive investment in apps and podcasts and its extensive online coverage of ITV’s Love Island.Last year, Ofcom revealed that  to -year-olds are spending an average of an hour and  minutes per day consuming BBC content, which is about half the amount for all age groups.Even more worrying for the Corporation, one in eight young Brits consumes no BBC content at all. Why should they fork out £. for the licence fee, particularly as many of them will already be paying for subscription TV services The fundamental problem the Beeb faces is that consumers are becomingly increasingly accustomed to paying for the TV content they want to watch and resent having to pay a mandatory flat tax to a single provider.The equivalent would beeveryone who owns a phone, tablet or laptop had to pay £. for an “internet licence” to fund Apple’s iTunes, regardless of whether or not they use the service.It’s time to do away with the licence fee — for everyone, not just the over-s.That would mean stripping down the state-funded parts of the BBC to its core news and current affairs output and funding that out of general taxation.It should sell off its profitable private isions — such as BBC Studios, which has annual revenues of more than £billion — and plough the money into creating its own subscription service.With its global brand recognition and unrivalled back catalogue, not to mention its reputation for high-quality drama, the BBC could easily compete with commercial providers such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.Promising to scrap the licence fee would surely be a vote-winner for Boris Johnson.What other election pledge would save nearly every British household £. a year No s, no buts. When it comes to renewing the BBC’s Royal Charter, it’s time to say: “No deal.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As Boris was arguing, the real barriers to trade are not practical ones — they are taxes and regulations.Remainers continually lecture us on the benefits of free trade with the EU — and they are right to do so. Hardly anyone really wants to leave without a deal. If we do have to take that route it will surely not be long before discussions on a free trade deal recommence.Yet those same Remainers bizarrely retreat in horror when anyone suggests we do a free trade deal with the US. “But we’ll have to eat chlorinated chicken,” they complain, as well as GM “Frankenstein” food.As shown by their failure yesterday to agree on a common course of action to thwart Brexit, Remainers are bumbling along in a state of confusion.But nothing demonstrates this better than their contradictory approach to free trade. They seem to think it a great benefit to the country when conducted with the EU, but a route to national disastercarried out with any other country.The charge that anyone will be forced to eat chlorinated chicken or GM foods is, needless to say, a far bigger porky pie than anything Boris has said on the subject.It is far from certain that a Johnson Government, when engaged in trade talks with the US, will make the concessions allowing these products into UK markets, butit does, then UK shoppers will continue to have a choice.They will still be able to buy chicken produced in Britain or the EU, or they will be able to choose to eat American chicken.I certainly have no fear of eating chicken which has been washed in chlorine. The idea that it is “dangerous” has been thoroughly debunked. Each of us ingests far more chlorine through drinking water than we ever would do through eating US-produced chicken.As for GM foods, we already eat them, vegans especially. The EU allows imports of GM soyafor simple practical reasons. Most of it is grown in the Americas and too many growers there use GM seed for non-GM soya to be sold as a separate product.If we want free trade we are not going to achieve it just by persuading other countries to open their markets to us. No, we will have to make the concession of opening our markets to them too. But there is no reason to be frightened.True, there are some products which need to be banned from sale for genuine health and safety reasons. But most of the EU’s food product standards are really just a form of protectionism in disguise, dreamed up to block competition for European farmers.If we do post-Brexit trade deals with the US and other countries — and in the process do away with the EU’s protectionist tarfs and product standards — some UK producers would suffer.But others would prosper as they enjoyed access to new export markets. Overall, as is almost always the case when trade barriers are taken down, we would benefit. Strong industries would grow and consumers would enjoy greater choice and lower prices.Boris’s vision of a global British pork pie industry shows the dference between him and the political opponents who spent much of yesterday scheming over how to stop him taking Britain out of the EU.While his glass is half full, theirs is half empty.They are driven by a pathological fear of le outside the EU.It is not that they have any great enthusiasm for the EU. After all, I haven’t heard one of them make a convincing case why the EU is an institution to be admired. It is just that they have a lack of ambition for Britain and so cling to EU membership.After meeting for several hours yesterday, what did the likes of Jeremy Corbyn, Keir Starmer and Jo Swinson come up with That they want to extend Article  yet further, to prolong yet again the endless drt which unsettled markets and put off investment.Thanks to the Remain lobby’s endless infighting and self-indulgent argument over who it would like as a caretaker Prime Minister, that is exactly what is overwhelmingly likely to happen on October . Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

a fraction of the £, it can cost to have a gastric bypass operation.While he was under, he was tricked into thinking he had had the op, where surgeons create a small pouch at the top of your stomach, and attach it to the small intestines to bypass the majority of the stomach.The surgery means it takes less food to make you feel hungry.Snack:  chocolate mini rollsLunch: Chip sandwich with tomato sauceDinner: Portion of chips with breadJamess diet after:Breakfast: BananaSnack: Fruit and lots of waterLunch: Chicken saladDinner: Chicken, mashed potatoes, vegBut for James, his therapy had the same effect.The hypnotism made me feel full and made my body realise it didnt need to eat anymore, he said.Suddenly I felt a lot more full and I didnt have to binge eat all of the time.I cant believe its worked and helped me to ditch the weight -

called titanium dioxide - is often mixed into brighter colours such as blue, green and red.But the new study, from the European Synchrotron Radiation Facilityin Grenoble, France, found that it can cause the needle to erode and so tiny metal particles can enter the skin.Those particles then travel to the lymph nodes, which are small glands that store white blood cells - responsible for killing invading organisms.The researchers claim that the identication of these metals inside the pigment could explain why some people suffer bad reactions to tattoos.In , a study by New York University found that  per cent of people had reported suffering an adverse reaction to a tattoo.But until quite recently, experts had thought it was to do with the inks.Previous research had shown that there were metal nanoparticles in the lymph nodes of tattooed people.They ranged from  nanometres long, or as small as DNA molecule, to two micrometres long, which is about the size of a bacterium cell.Nanoparticles are considered more hazardous than larger particles because they have surface area per volume, which can cause a higher release of toxic chemicals.The European Chemicals Agencywarned back in  that some tattoo inks could be toxic, and has called for the banning of the potentially-deadly substances.The organisations report claims that the toxic ink could cause long-lasting skin problems, as well as increasing the risk of cancer.Other side effects include serious allergic reactions to the suspect ink and painful itching which can last for years.Red inks were described as the most dangerous, but blue, green and black inks also came under fire.The agency said: “Many reports show concerns for public health stemming from the composition of inks used for tattooing.“The most severe concerns are allergies caused by the substances in the inks and possible carcinogenic, mutagenic or reproductive toxic effects.”The team at the ESRF wanted to establish whether there was a link between the metal nanoparticles found in the lymph nodes of tattooed people.ESRF scientist Ines Schreiver, who co-authored the research, said: We were following up on our previous study, by trying to find the link between iron, chromium and nickel and the colouring of the inks.After studying several human tissue samples and finding metallic components, we realised that there must be something .Then we thought of testing the needle and that was our eureka moment.They began studying ink sample under an intense X-ray and found that when tattoo ink contains titanium dioxide, the needle can erode.The research, published in the journal Particle and Fibre Toxicology, found that it doesnt happen with carbon black ink, which is softer.Co-author Hiram Castillo added: There is more to tattoos than meet the eye.It is not only about the cleanliness of the parlour, the sterilisation of the equipment or even about the pigments.Now we find that the needle wear also has an impact in your body.These are long-term effects which can only be assessed in long-term epidemiological studies that monitor the health of thousands of people over decades."},{"url":null,"title":"portsmouth university student bar shuts","story":"Undergraduates used to have a reputation for heavy drinking at the union bar.But The Waterhole Bar at the University of Portsmouth has seen a massive drop in alcohol sales and is to be turned into a “social space” with a coffee shop and microwaves.Alcohol sales are down  per cent year on year for the past four years and it has lost more than half its total sales.A study in September  by the National Union of Students found one in five university students don’t drink alcohol.Portsmouth Universitys Vice-Chancellor Graham Galbraith said: “We recognise that student tastes have changed in recent years and most students who want to drink alcohol would prefer to do so at other city venues.Only a minority of students have been using the Waterhole bar and we’re aware that many avoid it.Students’ Union President Helena Schofield added: “We are sad to see the bar go but we understand that it’s not financially viable to keep it open.”We’re excited to hear student ideas on what the new space should bring to the experience of students here in Portsmouth.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nahid in Farsi means Venus.The satellite, which had Irans first foldable solar , was supposed to be in a low orbit around the Earth for some two-and-a-half months.The semi-official Mehr news agency quoted Jahromi on Aug.  as saying that the Nahid- was ready to be delivered to Irans Defense Ministry, signalling a launch date for the satellite likely loomed.Irans National Week of Government, during which Tehran often inaugurates new projects, began August .Earlier today, Irans Defence Minister General Amir Hatami told the state-run IRNA news agency that the countrys satellite activities were being done in a transparent way, responding to AP and other foreign media reporting on activity at the space centre. Whenever activity and research bear successful results, we will announce the good news, Hatami said.Iran at times in the past hasnt acknowledged failed launches.The apparent attempt to launch the Nahid- comes after two failed satellite launches of the Payam and Doosti in January and February.A separate fire at the Imam Khomeini Space Centre in February also killed three researchers, authorities said at the time.I think it is certainly an image problem, said Michael Connell, an Iran analyst at the Arlington, Virginia-based nonprofit research organisation CNA.I think its going to embarrass the Iranian space agency. On the other hand though, getting a satellite into space ... takes time.Tehran also says it doesnt violate the UN as it only called upon Tehran not to conduct such tests.The tests have taken on new importance to the US amid the maximalist approach to Iran taken by President Donald Trumps administration.Tensions have been high between the countries since Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from Irans nuclear deal over a year ago and imposed sanctions, including on Irans oil industry.Iran recently has begun to break the accord itself while trying to push Europe to help it sell oil abroad.The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"remainer speaker john bercow blasted","story":"Jacob Rees-Mogg hit out at Bercow after he said the PM caused “constitutional outrage” for getting the Queen to approve his shutdown of Parliament.The Brexiteer MP said the most constitutionally improper thing that happened yesterday was the Speakers intervention.He fumed: I think the outrage is phoney and it is created by people who dont want us to leave the European Union and are trying very hard to overturn the referendum result and dont want the benefits of leaving the European Union.He added: Parliament wasnt going to be sitting for most of this time anyway.

The Prime Minister announced he was going to reboot Parliament in September, slashing the time MPs have to debate and block his Brexit plan.Number  say they want to hold a Queen’s Speech to set out their raft of domestic policies, and insist the timing has nothing to do with Brexit. But Johnson leads a minority government - and every sitting day increases the chances of his Brexit plan being defeated by opponents in Parliament. And today Number  said Defence Secretary Ben Wallace misspoke when he was filmed in an unguarded moment apparently admitting the move was about Brexit after all. Mr Wallace was seen speaking to French Defence Minister Florence Parly moments before a meeting of European counterparts in Helsinki, in footage broadcast by the BBC.    Ms Parly reportedly asked Mr Wallace about the plan to ‘prorogue’ Parliament. “Parliament has been very good at saying what it doesn’t want,” he said. “But it has been awful at saying what it does want, that’s the reality.” He went on: “So you know, eventually any leader has to, you know, try.” “I don’t know what the outcome of it…” he said, bursting into laughter. “You know…politics.”    He went on to explain that the real reason it was necessary to shut down Parliament to get a Brexit plan through was because Johnson doesn’t have the majority he needs to stop it being blocked. “Our system is a winner takes all system,” he said. “If you win a parliamentary majority you control everything. You control the timetable. There is no written separation. So it’s…you pretty much are in command of the whole thing. “And we’ve suddenly found ourselves with no majority and a coalition, and that’s not easy for our system.” A Number  source said: “The Defence secretary misspoke and was not involved in discussions about the Queen’s speech. The Queen’s speech will allow us to set out an ambitious legislative programme to deliver on our domestic priorities such as tackling violent crime, investing in our health service and tackling the cost of living.” But SNP MP Joanna Cherry, who is leading a legal challenge to the shutdown, said the clip backed up her teamaposs claim.  She tweeted: I’ve drawn this admission to the attention of our legal team. Defence Secretary backs up what we contend - that prorogation of Parliament is for an improper purpose  therefore unlawful. Labour MP Wes Streeting said: Telling the truth is a disciplinary offence under Boris Johnson’s regime. And Independent Group for Change MP Chris Leslie said: The shabby pretence that closing Parliament is anything other than a device to thwart majority of MPs makes this constitutional abuse more insulting.If they’re going to use authoritarian powers, at least be honest about why! But maybe it’s the cover-up that will trip them up.

According to reports, the Prime Minister and his team at Number  were determined to keep their plans a secret until everything was done and dusted - but things didnapost quite go as they hoped. Three of Johnsonaposs ministers - Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg , Lords Leader Baroness Natalie Evans and Chief Whip Mark Spencer - were sent to Balmoral to ask the Queen to suspend Parliament. However a leak, believed to have come from within Whitehall, meant word of their plans got out much earlier than planned.    According to the Times, this means Johnson had to bring his phone call with the Queen forward to tell her what he was planning so she didnapost read it in the news first.  The Times states: To the embarrassment of Downing Street, Boris Johnson had to bring forward a phone call to Her Majesty to ask her to prorogue Parliament so that she would know about it before the rest of the nation heard it on the news. However Number  has refused to confirm what time the phone call happened. The Monarch signed off the shock bid - which has prompted outrage among MPs and plunged Britain into a constitutional crisis - in the meeting at her summer retreat Balmoral.    It means Parliament will be suspended or aposproroguedapos for more than a month from September , sabotaging MPsapos efforts to block no-deal Brexit or vote no confidence in the government. According to Jacob Rees-Mogg , the Queen did not question Johnsonaposs request to shut down Parliament - and realistically would not have been able to. He said there was no chat, no debate after he flew to Balmoral to make the request, saying: The Queen says aposapprovedapos. That’s it. Some suggested the Queen should have blocked the aposprorogationapos, however she isnapost technically allowed to.  Royal expert Ingrid Seward, editor in chief of Majesty magazine, believes the Queen may not be happy about what she was forced to do , but knows she has to be above politics. She said: Her Majesty is in an uncomfortable position. As Head of State she acts for the Government of the day. That is her job. The constitution is working exactly as it should.  It is not a crisis as many people have said, but it is a very dficult chapter in the history of the constitution which was set by statue as a Bill of Rights in .  Having reigned for over  years, Her Majesty is sensitive to the wishes of her people and knows over this issue the nation is seriously ided.  She may not be happy and she may well be troubled by the latest turn of events. But she is above politics and always has been. Those close to Her Majesty say how much she dislikes being dragged into a potentially political minefield.  She has spent her time as Queen avoiding doing so.

Opposition peers are understood to be preparing for a fight after Boris Johnson gave them just seven days - or fewer - to sit before he shuts down Parliament.That will leave barely any time to rubber-stamp a law, expected to be tabled by MPs from next Tuesday, attempting to rule out a no-deal exit on October .Labour , Lib Dem and some Tory and Crossbench peers have repeatedly defeated the government in the House of Lords in recent years - especially over Brexit.In April they helped pass a law ruling out a no-deal Brexit despite sittings running late into the evening. But while Yvette Cooperaposs Bill got through despite filibustering, this time Lords sources fear delaying tactics will be directly sanctioned by the government. Weaposre in more unpredictable territory, a source said. I think weaposre heading for a couple of very long days and nights.    The Lords sees itself as the defender of the constitution. Given whataposs happened over the last few days, there may well be some people who decide this is their moment. One senior Lords source told ITV they were confident of getting a Bill through by Monday after next - with peers preparing for an emergency weekend sitting. If peers sit next Saturday itaposs thought it will be the first time since the Falklands War in . But another source told the Mirror that, while not impossible, it was unlikely. It comes after Boris Johnson announced Parliament will be suspended from September  - or even earlier - to October  despite the Brexit deadline. Despite the tight timetable, MPs bidding to thwart his no-deal Brexit are gearing up for a battle royale next week.    Labour confirmed it would stage an emergency debate as soon as the Commons s from the summer recess. The fast-tracked move, expected to be allowed by Speaker John Bercow, would pave the way for Parliament to try and pass a law blocking a no-deal Brexit. But they face a race against time to derail the Prime Minister’s bid to keep open the option of quitting the EU without an agreement. Shadow Trade Secretary Barry Gardiner admitted it would be “extremely dficult” to halt the Prime Minister’s attempt, following his decision to suspend Parliament from mid-September. He told the BBC: “It is going to be extremely dficult, that’s why the Government is disingenuous to say this is not about trying to stop us doing that. We will be seeking measures on Monday to try and have what is known as a Standing Order section  debate. We will seek to try and put through the appropriate legislation in this constrained timetable that the Government has now put before us.” Any Bill will have to be approved first by the Commons, then the Lords, then any dferences smoothed out in a process called ping pong. Normally that takes several months.    Tory former Chancellor Ken Clarke indicated he would back moves to stop Mr Johnson taking the UK out of the EU without an agreement. “I would do anything necessary to stop this country going through the childishly disastrous mistake of crashing out with no deal,” he vowed.But Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg blasted the “phoney” outrage over prorogation, saying: “Parliament wasn’t going to be sitting for most of this time anyway. This is completely constitutional and proper.There is going to be a lot of time to debate before October .”  Former Supreme Court judge Lord Sumption said that while it may be unconventional to prorogue Parliament as the Brexit deadline looms, the move was entirely legal. “I don’t think what the Prime Minister has said he is going to do is unlawful,” he added. Today James Graham - who wrote the hit play This House about Parliamentary shenanigans - claimed party leaders in the Lords could stop Parliament from being prorogued by refusing to doff their hats.

The Northern Ireland backstop. Youaposve probably heard a lot about this mysterious backstop. But do you know what it means  We donapost blame younot, as the whole thing has been testing our brains for months. In fact, itaposs astonishing that the whole of Brexit has come down to boring technical jargon about customs arrangements. But we are where we are, and with a possible general election round the corner, itaposs vital you know what the debate is about. Here is the issue explained.  The aposbackstopapos is an insurance clause in the UKaposs -page Brexit deal with Brussels, which was signed by Theresa May in November . If the deal is passed, EU rules continue in a transition period until  December . But after that, itaposs not known how we can avoid putting up checkpoints along the -mile border between Northern Irelandand the Republic . This situation - known as a hard border - would set Irish peace back decades and could trigger ato violence of the Troubles. It would reverse the Good Friday Agreement pact that allows anyone to cross the border with little more than a sign and a dferent-coloured road. So the backstop is designed to stop a hard border, no matter what.    Under the backstop, EU customs rules will be extended across the whole of the UK for a temporary period. This has infuriated Brexiteer MPs - who fear we will be a colony of Brussels, unable to sign trade deals around the world. It will kick in from  January no solution has been found for the Irish border. Britain has an alternative option, to trigger a one-off extension to the transition period for EU rules, instead of the backstop. Butit does kick in, it can only be ended by a joint committee - in other words, EU officials get a veto. And there is no time limit, meaningthe UK and EU canapost agree, we could be stuck in the backstop for a very long time. Why is it such a big problem  . It will stop the UK signing global trade deals    The UK cannot sign its own trade deals with other countries, like Australia and Japan,it is in a customs union with the EU. This is why Theresa May was adamant the UK must leave the EU customs union. The backstop, however, will keep us in that customs union in all but name.    Theresa May tried again and again to set a time limit on the backstop, but she was unsuccessful. First she wanted to set a firm end date of  December  - but the EU rejected it. . Then she wanted a mechanism for the UK to quit the backstop, no matter what Brussels says - but the EU rejected that too. Instead, there will be an independent committee to decidethe backstop can be terminated, with members from both the UK and EU. If this wasnapost bad enough it could be overseen by the European Court of Justice - the exact body Brexiteers are trying to leave. . It could treat Northern Ireland dferently  A backstop would force some checks on trade Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Boris Johnsonaposs DUP allies reject that - saying it breaks up the precious union of the UK. For all these reasons, Boris Johnson says we must get rid of the backstop entirely, rather than reshaping or editing it in a dferent form. Why canapost we just get rid of the backstop   Boris Johnson wants to replace the backstop with aposalternative arrangementsapos, to kick in at a later date, which ensure we donapostto a hard border. He has said these arrangements could include high-tech checks and apostrusted trader schemesapos to lessen bureaucracy. But critics say he has not been specic enough about what these arrangements actually are. And the delay to them kicking in would mean we had a period after Brexit with no insurance policy. Irish Premier Leo Varadkar has told Boris Johnson the backstop is necessary as a consequence of decisions taken by the UK government. And he said the EU was united in its view that the withdrawal agreement cannot be reopened. What did the EU offer before  In January , the House of Commons voted to send the backstop back to Brussels to be rewritten. Theresa May wanted to insert either a time limit a unilateral exit clause or mythical alternative arrangements. Now Boris Johnson wants to go further and scrap it completely, dealing with some of its issues later once Brexit has been assured. But the EU refused to scrap OR rewrite the backstop - because itaposs wrapped up in the -page Brexit deal. Instead, the EU offered to add assurances, like a legal codicil, and rewrite a much smaller political declaration on future trade. This stopped short of MPsapos demands to make legally binding changes to the backstop itself.

Ria Constable and partner Aaron Marks were over the moon when they finally discovered that they were expecting a new arrival. The young couple couldnapost wait to meet their baby boy and were excited to start a new chapter of their lives. But their world was turned upside down during the pregnancy after discovering their son was going to be born with an extremely rare condition. Doctors confirmed their first child had both hypoplastic left heart syndrome- a birth defect that affects normal blood flow through the heart - and intact arterial septum, a hole between the two small chambers of the heart.    Ria, , said: Everything was fine from the private -week scan and at the scan at  weeks we were told he was growing great. Then to be told that Leo had these conditions which were so rare we were just in shock. That day our world broke. It was hard to think that we werenapost going to be able to hold Leo when he was born. We just kept being positive and hoping everything would be fine. Requiring immediate surgery at birth, Leo was one of the only babies to be born at the Freeman Hospital via c-section on August  with a full team travelling from the Royal Victoria Infirmary to deliver him. It meant the Newbiggin Hall parents were unable to hold their baby before being whisked off for emergency treatment. It was like he wasnapost actually born, said Ria. It just didnapost feel right. We had to wait seven and a half hours before we got to see him. Despite the surgery being a success, just six days later doctors suspected Leoaposs condition was more uncommon than anticipated with him also believed to have had a lung condition called congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasia.    This, however, was not able to be confirmed due to a Leo not being strong enough for a biopsy to be taken. Ria said: This made Leoaposs case even rarer and our perfect little boy was one of  cases in the world from what we saw online. We read that both conditions are not usually compatible in le. It was on August  when they were told the devastating news that no parent wants to hear - that there was no more doctors could do to save their son. We didnapost speak much in the meeting because I donapost think we knew how to react, said Ria. It wasnapost until we were left alone when we broke down in tears. By that moment it hit us and we knew we werenapost going to be taking our baby boy home. This was heartbreaking news for us as parents and as people who had fought for so long through infertility and IVF to bring our boy into the world and to have to let him go so soon. Tesco workers Ria and Aaron spent the day making special memories with Leo, including holding him for the very first time, before saying their final goodbyes. Ria said: We washed him, dressed him and held him - the things you take for granted. It was the first time that we felt like parents. It was the best and the worst day at the same time.

We are all deeply saddened that the Duke has lost his battle with an illness he fought with great courage and determination, the family said in a statement. He really was a Corinthian figure who was a great sportsman, a passionate fisherman who made a huge contribution to fisheries management on the river Tweed and a successful businessman who modernised and turned Roxburghe Estates into the successful business it is today. He derived enormous success and enjoyment from racing and the thoroughbred stud at Floors - including breeding the first double Classicwinner Attraction in the early s. We know he will be missed by so many in dferent spheres in particular by those staff and farm tenants on the Roxburghe Estates.    The th Duke, owner-breeder of dual  Guineas winner Attraction, inherited the title on the death of his father in , and followed his interest in racing. His first winner False Witness whetted his appetite for the sport, and he gradually built up a nucleus of mares at Floors with a view to selling their offspring as yearlings. Guy Roxburghe soon made his mark as a serious commercial breeder thanks to purchasing Norfolk Light for , guineas in . He sold her for ,gns five years later - but not before she had produced a colt by Welsh Pageant that made ,gns. The horse was Welnor, who went on to win the Italian Derby. But it was with Attraction that he will be best remembered in racing. Rejected by Doncaster Bloodstock Sales because of her imperfect forelegs, she was sent to Mark Johnstonaposs stables in Middleham - where she set out on a brilliant racing career. Including her two Classics at Newmarket and the Curragh in , Attraction won five Group Ones in all - and  of her  races. Record-breaking trainer Johnston revealed, in a moving tribute, that the Duke played a big role in his career.  He told PA: We knew this day was coming, because we knew how ill heaposd become. Weaposve been in regular contact, and itaposs a shame we didnapost get the chance to see him. Although we knew it was coming, itaposs still very sad. Itaposs the end of an era for us - he played a huge part of my career. Iaposve always said Attraction was the horse I got most pleasure out of training, because there were many stages where we could have called it a day and retired her from racing.I often say the day she ran at Royal Ascot was the most pressure Iaposve ever felt, because I expected her to win. That was just pressure I put on myself, though - it never came from the Duke.Almost from the day she won the Hilary Needler, the Dukeaposs attitude when he was talking to the jockey before the race was aposgo out there and enjoy it as everything from now on is a bonusapos. She was a tremendous horse to be associated with, and the Duke being her owner was a big part of that.

Leo the dog scuffles across the floor, maybe wondering when the normal Tuesday evening bustle of cooking tea, and watching Love Island, will begin. It’ll be an hour or so. Dave Bush, we Sue, and daughter Jess, have suspended family le, as they do once or twice a week, to simultaneously chat, via text messages, to complete strangers. Beneath the hush, there’s a lot of noise – fraught words tumbling out in -character snippets strung together in anxious streams, which need every ounce of their attention. As we sit here drinking tea, two of those strangers texting Sue and Jess are revealing they are suicidal.  Sue is chatting to a school-age teenager. “They are struggling, they have been self-harming, they’ve mentioned bullying, and they’ve said they feel suicidal,” she relays, hurriedly looking up for a second as she waits for a reply. Sitting next to her, Jess explains: “My person’s introductory message said they were suicidal. They have a plan, they say they also have the means, but an idea of timeframe isn’t clear yet.” She’s waiting for a reply to tell herit’s tonight. They tell me this situation is far from rare. “It’s a reasonably common conversation to have,” Sue says. “Especially in the evening.” This is Shout, the UK’s first free   text service open to anyone in crisis, run by Mental Health Innovations, and launched in May by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as a means to tackle Britain’s mental health crisis. And crisis it is, according to the figures. In its pilot year, Shout, which has , UK volunteers answering texts, handled , conversations. Today, they’re fielding around  a day. Since its official launch in May, it has held more than ,. Of those, % have mentioned suicide, % depression and % self-harm.  While almost half of texters are aged -, disturbingly, % are aged -. Figures from the annual Good Childhood report this week revealed more children aged - saying they are unhappy than at any point in the last  years. The Bushes, from Cheddington, Bucks, are Shout’s only volunteer family. It helps that they can hold conversations side by side, because it’s heavy going. Sue and Dave joined up in December, and Jess in March, and when we meet, they have held over  conversations. I join them at pm on a weekday. Shout’s busiest time is between pm and am but even in this moment there are  conversations unfolding, plus a queue of four people waiting. When users first text, a complex algorithm assessesthey are high risk. Shout’s volunteers, who have undergone  to  hours of training, are monitored by remote supervisors. Sue, , who works in business development, plucks her school-age teen from the queue, but they take a while to respond to her.  Because they’ve mentioned suicide, she needs to risk assess them, and the wait for a reply is an anxious one. At the sound of a ping she snaps back to her screen. “We have the volume set loud,” she apologises. Meanwhile, Dave, , an actuary, has started chatting. His text is from a young woman struggling as counselling she has been having has ended. But it’s accountant Jess, , who’s found herself confronted with the most immediately challenging situation. Her texter has said they are suicidal right now. The risk assessment has stages, including discovering whether the texter has a plan for suicide, and the means, such as pills or razor blades, whether they have that means with them, and how soon they plan to act. They eventually reply they want to talk to someone about their feelings – a service Shout doesn’t provide. “I have suggested the Samaritans,” says Jess, now waiting anxiously to hearthe texter has called them. In this case, the scenario is made simpler because the texter knows what they need. Dave has experienced a couple where an “active rescue” was needed and emergency services were called. They account for % of conversations. For the first time, I see him become emotional. “They told me they could not keep themselves safe,” he says. “They were self-harming as well.

Daniel Williams was not a regular drinker and he usually the one helping others to find their way home whenthey had drunk a bit too much, the coroner heard. Tragically there was nobody to take the -year-old home on a night when he appeared like a zombie, having consumed two-and-half times the drink-drive limit at the University of Readingaposs student bar. Mr Williams, known to friends as Dan, attempted to make his way home alone through five inches of fresh snow in the early hours of January . He had become separated from his friends but in his drunken state he accidentally plunged into the icy waters of the Whiteknights lake in Reading, Berks, the coroner ruled.  He was found following an extensive police search, in which boat crews and dog units were sent out. Scores of officers struggled to break the thick ice on top of the lake, just hundreds of yards away from the student union block, so they could enter the chest-high water. The inquest heard that ironically, Daniel was a leguard. The temperature was -C when they waded through treacle-like silt, searching for the missing student. The search ended days later - on February  - when Danaposs body was found, face down with his lower body submerged in the water and his mobile phone and wallet still in his pockets, the inquest in Reading, Berks, heard.  Heidi Connor, Senior Coroner for Berkshire, told the inquest: It seems to me that the circumstances of Danaposs death are tragic but very clear. On the night of January , he went out with friends, doing what students do around the world: he was enjoying himself, drinking alcohol at the student club. He came late in le to alcohol. Drinking alcohol when you are not used to drinking alcohol can have a more dramatic effect, she said. The inquest heard evidence from William Collins, who was one of three other young men who lived with Daniel in their student lodgings near to the university. Mr Collins told the inquest how the four housemates had decided on a night out together on January  and had left their home at pm. He said Daniel, who was wearing a dark-coloured hooded top, had been with him in the Cheese Room, the main dance floor in the newly-refurbished sixty nightclub and bar during the weekly Wednesday Union night. Daniel had ordered four Jagerbombs, a mixture of Jagermeister and an energy drink, for himself, the inquest heard, before he disappeared.  Mr Collins said, in an interview given to police before Daniel was found: It is normal behaviour for Daniel to just go off and leave us during a night and he had done this several times before. We did not see him again. The second year computer sciences student, rom Sutton, Surrey, was later seen by another student, Rebecca Jones. She saw him standing near to the front of the dance floor in the Cheese Room and clinging onto a railing in front of the DJ. Ms Jones said: I saw he was very blank in his face, ashe was staring at us. It appeared ashe was a zombie andyou jumped at him he would not have moved. Nobody saw Daniel leave the student bar and by the evening of January , his housemates had become so concerned they contacted the police and reported him as missing. Detective Constable Andy Matheson, of Thames Valley Police, told the inquest police had upgraded Mr Williams to a high-risk missing person after failing to find him during an overnight search. He told the inquest police had established Mr Williams had left the student bar at .am, as his phone had disconnected from the unionaposs Wi-Fi network and his phone had stopped receiving any signal at .am.  Det. Con. Matheson said: I donapost think anything can be read into that as to when Dan entered the lake.The phone still ed when it came out of the lake. It is possible it [the phone] could still have been connected to the network while it was submerged in the water. Danielaposs parents organised a huge leaflet drop around the university area, appealing for any information about the whereabouts of the blond-haired, blue-eyed student. Volunteers from the local Lowland Search Team also took part in picking through bushes and undergrowth in the hope of finding Daniel and crews from the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service used their fire boat and waders to search in the lake, three times without success. Police Constable Al Mathieson, leading the search on the ground, said the conditions at the lake, which was not especially deep but was frozen solid and surrounded by a thick layer of silt, meant the focus of the search was on the bank of the lake. Mr Williams was found just shy of an island, which is about  metres from the bank of the lake and the inquest heard the joint investigations of the police and the coroneraposs office discovered there was no sign of any third party involvement, nor any indication that Daniel had been planning to take his own le.  Mrs Connor told his family, who attended the inquest, the young student had no drugs in his system but did have mg of alcohol per ml of blood, two-and-a-half times the drink-driving limit. The coroner said: He did have a relatively high blood alcohol level. In this line of work, I have seen worse than this, but it is undoubtedly high. A post mortem examination gave the cause of death as drowning while under the influence of alcohol and Mrs Connor suggested to the family Mr Williamsapos death should be ruled as an accident. In response, a woman believed to be Danielaposs mother, told the coroner: Contrary to the findings that he had the alcohol, ironically Dan wasnapost a drinker and I feel he was possibly rather naive. Two-and-a-half times the legal limit for driving is a lot, but as you say, there are people who drink a lot more. He did not drink at all until he was  years old. He was a wonderful son. He was genuine, principled, universally loved and liked by everyone who knew him.Ironically, he worked as a le guard. I feel it is tragic because I do not feel that his death should define him, because we are heartbroken.I just hope he did not suffer. Mrs Connor responded: I doubt there is one person in this room who has not been under the influence of alcohol at some point in their le. It certainly does not define Daniel in any way, shape or form.It is just so very sad that this was the outcome in Danaposs case.

Florida has declared a state of emergency as the le-threatening hurricane gains strength and picks up speed while churning through warm waters in the Atlantic. It could be a major Category  storm when it makes a direct hit late Sunday or early Monday and a powerful Category  hurricane when it passes through the Orlando area. Residents have been told to prepare for the worst and holidaymakersapos plans have been thrown into uncertainty, with Walt Disney World telling visitors to keep checking local weather reports.

Rachel de Rond, , from Haarlem, The Netherlands, was born with natural curls that lost their bounce over time as she became older. In her early twenties she would use shampoo every two days, but when the quality of her hair deteriorated, she dropped that to once a week. This improved her hair slightly, so in August  she discovered the aposno pooapos method, washing hair with a gentle alternative to shampoo, such as apple cider vinegar or water only. Since abandoning the shampoo and other synthetic hair products, she has noticed a considerable dference in the quality of her hair, which has become curlier and more volumized.    She now uses a solution made up of ground nuts and leaves from trees and plants called ayurvedic herbs which she leaves in her hair for  minutes, then rinses out with tap water.Four days later she refreshes her curls with rainwater, which she collects and adds a tiny bit of flaxseed gel on her wet curls. A year after discarding her shampoo bottles, her boyfriend Max van Kessel, , followed her lead hasnapost used shampoo or any product since either.He is now following the water only method.  Rachel says while she was initially worried she would be accused of being aposdirtyapos, she has received a positive response.Strangers love her new hair and they even questionshe has styled her hair with curlers. She said: My scalp didnapost like shampoo and was telling me to stop. Shampoo contains sulphates, which clean everythingand they are very strong and can dry out your skin and hair. I learned about the no-shampoo method because I read an article about a girl who didnapost wash her hair for six to eight weeks when she was on a holiday.  First her hair became quite greasy, but after a few weeks it normalised and in the end her hair was so soft and bouncy. It didnapost look greasy at all. If you saw her, you wouldnapost know that she didnapost washed her hair with shampoo.So, I started reading about the no-shampoo method and I talked about it with my colleague.    Following her advice I started with washing with Aleppo soap and rinsing with apple cider vinegar.My hair and scalp loved it. The dry white flakes disappeared, and my curls came back. I stopped using shampoo in August . After three weeks my hair was through the transition period.At that time, I washed with Aleppo soap. After a few weeks I tried the ayurvedic herbs, and I loved the results even more. Despite her new routine taking longer than when she washed her hair with shampoo, she insists that the results are worth it. She has even stopped rinsing her hair with tap water and regularly collects water from the rain due to its softer texture.  Rachel says that on a good washday her hair maintains its curls and she doesnapost have to style her hair for four days at a time. She has since encouraged her boyfriend to try the no shampoo method and he now loves his hair too. I wash my hair once a week with the ayurvedic herbs when I wash my hair, I take my time. I let the Ayurveda herbs settle on my hair for about thirty minutes, she said. After a good washday I donapost have to style my hair for about four days. Then I refresh my curls with rainwater, which I collect, and put a little flaxseed gel on my wet curls. Rainwater is much softer than tap water.

The group, who are all Malaysian, are locked in a bitter deposit dispute and the flat in Dublinaposs city centre. Dublin City Council have sent a rapid response team after being alerted to the spot which is hidden behind a small garage door, reports Dublin Live. The door, which is the only fire exit, is around ft high with tenants having to crouch down low for access.    The aposapartmentapos has no vents, oven, or fan, and a hole in the kitchen ceiling thataposs covered by plastic is the only source of natural light. The students, three women and one man, say they signed a contract made by a man posing as the landlord and paid a €deposit last May. The contract started on May  and they stayed in two small twin rooms until August . The students allege the man, who is from China, wouldnapost allow them to cook anything other than instant noodles and instructed them to throw their rubbish in a nearby hotelaposs bins.    Despite requesting mattresses, they say they were given yellow sponge mats to sleep on. The former tenants also said the man walked into their rooms on a number of occasions in the night to confront them over household issues such as lights being left on or water on the bathroom floor. Two of the women allege that he made physical threats against them. One said: We were always afraid of what was going to happen next. When we moved in he told us he wasnapost going to live there, but then he gradually just started staying.    We were allowed to cook at the start, but then as it went on he started telling us we could only make instant noodles. One night someone left a light on in the common area and he came into our rooms in the middle of the night. He confronted one of the girls and started saying he was keeping her deposit because of the light being left on. Heaposd then say things like aposI know lots of people with lots of connectionsapos. He knows where I work and recently came in and started shouting at me and staff had to keep him away. Two of the women went to gardai on separate occasions but say they were told it was a matter for the Residential Tenancies Board. A spokesman said: We cannot comment on, confirm or deny details of inidual cases.  Typically the RTB are the statutory agency responsible for investigating such disputes, our role is to prevent breaches of the peace. The RTB declined to take on a case due to the landlord occupying the unit. They said: The RTB cannot get involvedthe tenant and landlord live together in the one dwelling. This living arrangement is often referred to as aposrent a roomapos scheme. The four claim they paid €each a month for two twin rooms while the man who acted as landlord, who they say told them wouldnapost be living there, ended up also living in with his partner. They say heaposs now holding €of their €deposit and has been constantly ringing one of the women in a bid to get € which he claims is owed to him. The dispute over the €allegedly came after one student left early without paying their last monthaposs cut of the rent instead telling the man to use their part of the deposit to cover.  The man acting as landlord allegedly told the other three former tenants he will not be giving them their cash back unless the one who left early pays him € . Fianna Fail spokesman for Housing, Darragh OaposBrien, blasted the situation and said he disagreed with the RTBaposs decision to shun the students. He said This is horric. And unfortunately itaposs not the first of these slum-like conditions that weaposve seen. This is the reality for some people when it comes to renting in Dublin. Places are really scarce at the moment and you will get a small portion of iniduals who think itaposs okay to rent what looks like a container. We need to make sure accommodation that is rented is of a certain standard and this clearly isnapost. Unfortunately there are others living in conditions like this in a st century modern European city. Itaposs horric.

The hate for Thatcher was pure and the depth of feeling surged through concerts and rallies.He says with a chuckle: “Them were the days.“We thought it was bad then, but everything can get worse, as we see now. It’s a case of careful what you wish for.“I don’t get involved in politics now, like I say when didn’t anyone complain about politicians “Can you point me to a golden era where# everybody liked being ruled  F***ing never!“But there are some real creeps nowadays. But then again I expect the worst from any politician.”So what can fans in Dundee expect when John rolls into town for his show at the city’s Gardyne Theatre on Saturday October  Without missing a beat he fires back: “A right f****** good night!“And they can expect more of the same#and then some. There will be a few classics and there will maybe be a few extra poems.“Then I will add a bit of fun and I can guarantee – solid, copper-plated guarantee – that everybody is going to leave with a smile on their face.”John has fond memories of Dundee and spoke of savouring the atmosphere of a waterfront hotel and added: “I love coming to Scotland and Dundee. I’ve been many times and the reaction of the crowd is great.“I was here last year and saw the VA which is fabulous. I know of DC Thomson and the Sunday Post, the Beano and the Dandy plus Oor Wullie.“Maybe I will buy one of those sculptures.”Posh hotels and venues seem a world away from the clubs and student venues of the s with smoke-filled rooms and plastic tumblers full of warm beer.He used to travel to the shows on public transport and chuckles at the memory.John said: “Yeah, long time ago now, mate. Now I have a driver and I am too old for public transport.“But I still love doing live gigs. It’s smashing. Anywhere where there’s people is greatI’m doing my stuff.“I am working on my book of poems right now. It’s called ‘The Luckiest Man Alive’ and I’m also working on the memoirs. vw, px\"  “I am thinking of calling that ‘I Wanna Be Yours’ after the Arctic Monkeys. I just hope to live long enough to finish it.“But I am not finishing up any time soon. I have never even thought about that. I am not retiring, not yet and not in the foreseeable future.”John has the tour to contend with first and is also lining up some television work.And at the age of  there is definitely no holding him back.

They also make for an excellently contrasting pair.From Mendelssohn’s exuberant opening bars, we are swept through music that is complex yet captivatingly, joyously melodic throughout, while Enescu’s is moody, breathlessly dramatic and, in parts, simply volcanic.Guest directed by Marianne Thorsen, SE will explore the specic charm of seeing a small group of musicians performing live. With fewer instruments, the fabric of the music becomes more tangible, subtle shts in mood may have a new-found presence, and pieces you think you know well might offer surprising new colours when heard live. With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway’s Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry sportive well supported in sunshine","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Kilberry Loop Sportive saw around  cyclists take on a -mile route starting and finishing in Tarbert.All eyes were on the forecast for the non-competitive cycling event on Saturday August .

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead golf club junior championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowCongratulations to Lochgilphead Golf Club junior champion , Kern McKellar and Euan Gilmour, who was the Stableford winner."},{"url":null,"title":"lets get our mojo working","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStarting out in , Lost in Berlin is the creation of Ardrishaig-based wordsmith Russell Taylor.The name Lost in Berlin could be seen as an apt metaphor for society#s sometimes confused state.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"produce celebrated at tayvallich flower show","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowProduce and home industries were celebrated at Tayvallich Flower Show where tables groaned under the weight of fruit, flowers, vegetables, preserves and home baking.The natural bounty around Tayvallich Village Hall on Wednesday August  was complemented by walls adorned with photographs and artwork.

The means for  protection is the European Union PGIdesignation, to promote and protect names of quality agricultural products and foodstuffs.Ruth, an experienced journalist, explained: #I became concerned about two years ago when, during Japan EU Canadatrade talks, the UK government did not submit one PGI for protection.#Across Europe, , food names were protected. It worries me greatly.#She continued: #I am also concerned about how hard it is becoming to source local food and drink. I live in rural Angus, and the carrots grown down the road from me started le just as Angus carrots, but they went away for packaging and came back as Great British carrots. Technically that is correct, butwe believe in supporting local farmers and making clear choices about food miles and quality, this is ridiculous.#She stressed: #This is not a protectionist campaign. I welcome trade with any part of the world as long as the farm assured quality is there.##Keep Scotland the Brand is about valuing the integrity of our food and drink and recognising that Scotland is the brand. Across the world, people recognise Scotland as a quality brand.#One in five Scots is employed in the food and drink sector, so it is vitally important to keep our brand quality.#We trust the food on our shelves at the moment. Butthe trade deals being proposed go through we#ll end up with a multi-tiered system of quality. If the Americans get the trade deal they want, the high food standards we have are really only going to be accessible to those who can afford to pay.#It#s bad enough people having to go to food banks to survive, without people not knowing why their kids are getting ill.Ruth Watson is keen to emphasise that Keep Scotland the Brand is not a political campaign and it#s not about Brexit.#It is a campaign looking at the realities of what is before us,# she says. #I think that we have to look with some alarm at the trade deals that have been done. The UK government just has not protected our food brands.##I do this campaign on a voluntary basis from my kitchen table,# she went on. #Many people do not know what is coming. Food is treated as a commodity rather than something we should be grateful for every day, that is how successful our farmers have been.#I just believe thatfarming fails, my community is going under.##I#ve been talking to elected representatives, I go round shows. I#ll talk to anyone about this.#But what can ordinary people do Ruth is quite clear. #Get out there and talk to each other, spread the word on social media, speak to politicians.#But most of all support our local farmers.#"},{"url":null,"title":"get dancing get fit and have fun","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowBack in April, the Mid Argyll branch of the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society held a ‘Bring a Friend’ evening.The result was a super evening of dancing and laughter, not to mention some delicious home baking at half time, and the branch was delighted at the number of people who came along.Now the dancing season is starting again after the summer break and the members are hoping to welcome those friends – and others – to their regular Monday evening classes.Scottish Country Dancing is a really great way to stay physically and mentally fit while having a lot of fun and listening to some lovely music at the same time.

These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"ardbeg bullock winner at islay cattle sale","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowUnited Auctions held its annual show and sale of autumn-born suckled calves at Islay Auction Mart on Friday August .A good show of calves was presented to show judge J Taylor, Easter Octhtermuthil.Winners were: Bullock class:  Ardbeg,  Kilchiaran,  Ardbeg Heer class:  and  Ardbeg Champion calf: Ardbeg bullock which takes the William A Low Trophy Reserve champion: Kilchiaran bullock.Overall, the bullocks sold to an average of £ per head or .p per kilo while the heers levelled out at £ per head or p per kilo.Principal lots and prices: Bullocks: AAx: £ and £– Ballimartin.

coincide with a full council meeting, and waved flags, shouted slogans and played lsquoMoney Money Moneyrsquo by ABBA on a PA system.Speaking at the demonstration, Willie Thomson, a regional industrial organiser for Unite, said that the dispute could risk the regionrsquos winter maintenance programme.He said: ldquoThe reason why the men are taking action is basically a refusal from Scottish Borders Council to respect the terms and conditions of their employment.ldquoThey have had changes imposed on them that will cost them poundrsquos, and they are not willing to have that done to them.ldquoThe reason they are striking is to send a strong message that the council needs to get back round the table and reach an agreement with the workers.ldquoThe people of the Scottish Borders need to be aware that the council is risking their winter maintenance service.ldquoDuring the winter maintenance service members do a lot of extra hours to keep up with the extra demand.ldquoWersquore now in a position where members will be withdrawing that programme.ldquoThat work is done a voluntary basis and the good will that is required to do that is in short supply.Currently, summer standby for Scottish Borders Councilrsquos road workers is voluntary, but council chiefs are trying to make this mandatory, in line with other sections of the council.Earlier this year, Scottish Borders Council notied the unions that not enforcing the same terms and conditions across the whole council could leave the local authority open to gender pay discrimination claims, as the mainly male roads section of the council is not required to be on standby over the summer, whereas the mainly female care home staff are.Summer standby payment for roads workers is currently pound., albeit it on a voluntary basis, and Scottish Borders Council is offering to up this to pound as long as it becomes mandatory.The two main unions which represent road workers at Scottish Borders Council, Unite and Unison, have been in discussion with the council ever since it informed employees that the terms and conditions would change.However, the talks with Unite broke down, and .% of the unionrsquos members who voted in an industrial ballot voted for strike action. The turn out was %.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos chief executive Tracey Logan,said: ldquoThe council has not changed terms and conditions for this staff group, nor have we failed to consult the trade unions or the staff affected.ldquoIn fact, we discovered some months ago that a small number of staff in this section had been claiming a higher rate of overtime than they were entitled to under the agreed terms and conditions.ldquoThey were also claiming for time to travel to work when working weekend overtime, which again is not in line with the agreement in place.ldquoGiven that Unite agreed to these terms and conditions, I am surprised and disappointed that they now want some of their members to be given more favourable pay rates than others, and for this small group be able to claim additional allowances that their other members cannot.ldquoIt is a principle of fairness and equality for staff across the whole workforce and one which I would expect Unite as representatives of staff to uphold and commit to."},{"url":null,"title":"a pianist of distinction","story":"For her required performance, which lasted half an hour, Suen YeeSuen Yee started learning the piano with David McEwan when she was eight years old, working her way through the ABRSM gradesand finally the ARSM diploma.

There was a lot of spirit and a feeling that a number of towns in Scotland which have been forgotten, like Campbeltown, will not be left behind after independence.#He put the turnout at more than , and added: #The fact that the march extended theof Longrow gives a fair indication of the numbers who were there.He also told the Courier this week that he remained the #legal indentity# of the All Under One Banner group, despite a bitter public row among the hierarchy which looks like splitting the group in two.It was the biggest rally held in the town in recent years with marchers coming from as far afield as Aberdeen and Alloa and as well as Oban, Glasgow and Islay, with many travelling on the weekend ferry from Ardrossan.#It really exceeded expectations and made a big splash in the town, Ron Wilson of Yes Kintyre told The National.#There was a real buzz as people came early and most of the hotels were booked up. The pubs and cafes were busy so it was good for local businesses. Campbeltown is a Yes town and it was brilliant to have all these people come here. Local people were coming off the pavements and joining the procession so it created a good, positive vibe.Pro-Unionists opponents held their own counter demonstation. However, the march went off without any incident and there were no arrests, with only one warning which was drug related.A spit of rain earlier in the day failed to develop into poor weather as the marchers would round the town to hear speakers and listen to musicians at the rally at Kinloch Green.Mr Wilson said he was particuarly pleased at the turnout as there had been some confusion over whether the march would go ahead due to internal sions within the hierachcy of All Under One Banner, which has organised independence marches across the country.Following Mr Singh#s sacking, founder Neil Mackay resigned from his position on its national executive pending an internal investigation.Pro-UK Unionist group A Force For Good met the march on the shore front and say they filmed and counted the marchers, as they have at previous events, and afterwards claimed the turnout was just .Director, Alistair McConnachie, said: #All Under One Banner is basically the marching wing of the SNP. AUOB, and SNP MPs and MSPs, lie about the numbers which attend their marches, sometimes up to  or  times.#Unfortunately, they are not challenged by the Scottish media.

Ryan McConnachie opted to go straight down the middle and evaded the e of the Dunoon keeper.There was a moment of worry at the other end, though, when goalscorer Souden also committed a handball in the Pupils’ box, and referee Peter Laing pointed to the spot. Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"fun in the sun at first mokfest","story":"India enjoyed herself at this year#s Up The Close event, which included children#s entertainer Funky Chicken and ious fair attractions, and was made all the better by the glorious sunshine.India was joined by her mum Lynsey Mcshannon, who was able to get into the spirit of things this year having been heavily pregnant last year, and her dad Gary Anderson.This year#s Up The Close was a particular hit, with the welcome , after nearly a decade, of indie rockers a new hope "},{"url":null,"title":"more music in store for the wee toon","story":"On Wednesday, September  at .pm, well-known folksinger, entertainer and broadcaster Alastair McDonald will be in concert in Campbeltown Free Church.This will not be Alastair’s first visit to the Wee Toon.

I think for many parents who have childcare challenges,there can be a real sense of relief as the summer holidays end, and to some extent I feel that myself.The pressure to fill six weeks with entertainment and activities, and go on holiday, can be immense, especially on a tight budget. For some children too, the holidays can be a dficult time and school can offer them ato some familiar routine.However, I remember the impending dread I felt when I was a child in the final days of the summer holidays. I hated the back to school adverts on TV as they heralded the end of free days playing on the rocks at the Pans shore, and of loosely defined bedtimes.So I was glad that our youngest daughter Skye was looking forward to school as she enters P. She met friends she hadnrsquot seen in weeks this morning and smiled as she said hello to George the lollipop man.She seemed slightly anxious as she waited in line in a new place, but the friendly manner of her new teacher visibly lted her mood and she went in with a smile, unknowingly tracing my childhood footsteps and those of her big sister.But then as I walked home, I was suddenly overwhelmed with anxieties: money worries, work worries, deadlines, bills etc. It seemed asduring the holiday period I had consciously decided to put such thoughts aside, to just enjoy the family time. Now was the pay back, we had ed to lsquorealityrsquo.But then I suddenly remembered a tale a fellow storyteller had told me many years ago. It just popped into my head and it spoke to me as I wandered back. And the truth in the story was the antidote I needed in that moment. And so I will share it with you in case you may one day find you need it:There was once a weaver who was weighed down with worries. He had so many things to do, so many responsibilities he looked into the future with dread. His worries kept him awake at night, which of course made his worrying worse during the next day. It was a vicious cycle.Then one day, he was sitting at his loom working and his worries got in the way. He couldnrsquot concentrate and he made mistake after mistake. He cursed and this was heard by an auld guidewe who happened to be passing by his window.ldquoFir whit reason dae ye curse at yer loom son, is there nae joy in yer work  she asked.The weaver looked up, feeling ashamed: ldquoIrsquom sair sorry fir ma words. Itrsquos just that as I work I think aboot orsquo ma troubles.The old woman nodded in understanding. She knew about troubles herself.ldquoAye, she said with an understanding nod, ldquotroubles can fair get ye doon.Then she paused and thought for a moment. She could see in the weaverrsquos face that he was riddled with anxieties.ldquoCan I show ye something that will tak ye awa frae yer work fir only a few minutes The weaver was happy to have a break so he left his loom and came outside.ldquoDae ye hae a bucket  asked the guidewe.ldquoA bucket ldquoAye a bucket, tae put some water in, she explained.The weaver fetched his bucket, wondering what the old woman was going to do with it.She took it to the well and filled it with a little water.ldquoNoo son, I dinnae kenthis will be tae heavy fir ye tae hold up.The weaver laughed: ldquoOrsquo course itrsquos no too heavy, fir ye only put a wee drop orsquo water in it.So the woman asked him to prove this by holding up the bucket with arms outstretched. The weaver had strong arms because of his work and held the bucket before him without any effort.ldquoAh, said the guidewe, ldquosae itrsquos nae tae heavy.ldquoIt isnae heavy at arsquo, replied the weaver.The old woman smiled: ldquoIn that case, keep haudin it afore ye like that fir  minutes. He wondered why she was asking him to do this, andshe was just trying to make a fool of him. But he was also intrigued and knew her to be an honest old soul, and so he did as she asked.After a few minutes of holding the bucket in front of him, it began to feel much heavier. After five minutes, his arms began to ache and soon they began to shake. The pain began to spread to his back as he desperately tried to keep the bucket in position.ldquoIs  minutes no over yet  asked the weaver desperately.ldquoIf the bucket is now tae heavy fir ye, put it doon son.He was reluctant to admit that the bucket was now too heavy to hold and so put it down.ldquoThe water got heavier son, didnrsquot it ldquoThe water wasnae heavier, protested the weaver, ldquoye just made me hold the bucket for tae lang.ldquoSae the water did get heavier, no in itself, but for you!The weaver looked confused and the guidewe continued.ldquoWater can get heavierye haud it ower lang afore ye, evenitrsquos just a wee drop. Yer worries are like that water, son. I am sure that they are many but ye mak them much heavierye try tae haud them in yer thochts arsquo the time.She smiled at him: ldquoTry an put the bucket doon as often as ye can,ye ken whit I mean. Dinnae mak it heavier than needs be. When ye need tae, haud it, but no arsquo the time.ldquoIn fact, she added while raising a pointed finger, ldquohauding it arsquo the time gies ye pain and paralyses ye. Yersquoll hae nae ability left tae empty the bucket.And so the old woman wandered off, leaving her words with the weaver. He looked down at the bucket. He lted it again and held it in front of him. It wasnrsquot as heavy now as before, but still had the same amount of water in it. She was right, water can get heavieryou hold it for longer, even though itrsquos the same weight.He chuckled to himself and watched the woman as she waddled down the street.ldquoThank ye! he called out.He ed to his loom. This time he whistled and sang as he worked. He enjoyed his creation and made no mistakes, for he had put his bucket of worries down for a while.Later they would still be there, but they might seem lighter and easier to manage now that they had stopped paralysing him with anxiety.And so that was the story. And as I arrived home, I realised that although I needed to deal with lots of things, I wasnrsquot going to give my worries more weight by holding them constantly in my thoughts.Itrsquos really important to put your bucket down every now and then, and that can make it easier to empty as well."},{"url":null,"title":"letter-railway-isn-39-t-perfect-39-s-better-driving","story":"Sure, things

The procedure for iding matrimonial property, which is any money and other assets owned jointly or inidually is that it is to be ided fairly, which may not simply mean equally. If the situation has to be resolved in court that can result in a decision that is far from satisfactory to one ndashor both ndashof the partners.ldquoItrsquos important that we advise clients about the fact that Alternative Dispute Resolution is available. These situations emphatically donrsquot involve an inevitable progress to court ndashwhich should be regarded as very much the last resort, he says.In fact, some % or more of cases are now dealt with through negotiation rather than a court order that determines the ision of assets. People who proceed to court, says Ferry almost inevitably have an urgent issue such as suffering from a serious shortage of money or protection issues resulting from circumstances of domestic abuse.The alternative routes principally involve collaboration or mediation. Mediation, involves an independent mediator guiding the parties toward a solution. The mediator does not usually give them legal advice as to their entitlements though in assisted mediation both parties have their solicitors in the background .ldquoThat is an option that sometimes works out well ndash but many people are looking for veriable answers, and this can be achieved through the collaborative approach which I find is generally a better way to resolve disagreements.Ferry, a trained collaborative lawyer, believes this route is best to minimise conflict and secure financial choices ndashwhile also, importantly, ensuring the best future for the children. He explains that collaborative law involves the parties and their advisers in four-way meetings with discussions around the table, in private and without the delay of correspondence and court proceedings. And this, he says helps to avoid subsequent, and potentially costly, misunderstandings.The problem with pensionsPensions, for example, can become very contentious. ldquoIn our experience pensions are frequently overlooked by clients when considering orce settlements. However, the value of the pensions built up during the marriage or civil partnership is taken into account and can be substantial. Our clientsrsquo settlements often involve pension sharing agreements.ldquoHowever, pensions can be extremely complicated ndashnot only in terms of valuing them and iding them but itrsquos also important to get the best advice on which pensions should be shared and which should not. Some have more benefits attached to them than others. For example, there may be spousersquos benefits attached to them which may be very valuable.In addition, he adds, there are ious types of pensions such as Self Invested Personal Pensionswhich can be convoluted when dealing with them in orce cases as sometimes these can involve multiple underlying property and other assets contained in the pension which may need to be valued too.ldquoYou need to take advice not only about its value at the date of separation but also its type of pension and current value. A failure to identy pension interests or to correctly apportion the value of a pension may have dramatic long-term implications for either spouse and there is a strict timescale involved after orce for implementing the pension share.Business assetsFerry says that clients also need advice about business assets and shareholdings, as to what constitutes matrimonial property as these can, inadvertently, be converted into matrimonial property in the course of, for example, restructuring a company that was founded or bought before marriage.ldquoShareholdings that may be worth several millions can be transferred into the joint matrimonial pot and that possibility is not often considered by the accountant or tax advisor involved, he says.These are just a few of the issues to be considered but despite the obvious vexations that separation and orce involve, Ferry believes in confronting them in a positive, proactive way. The Family LawAct of  was well thought out and is quite flexible, providing for the needs of inidual cases, he says.Divorce, he adds, need not end up in long, drawn out court proceedings. ldquoWhether via a pre-nuptial agreement or a collaborative resolution, with good legal advice parties can deal with separation and orce in way that achieves the solution that works best for them both.Noel specialises in all areas of family law but is particularly noted for acting in high value cases for high net worth iniduals, for example, celebrities, sports personalities, entrepreneurs, business owners, directors, professionals and executives.

His missionary work took him all over Scotland, including the coastline of the Forth. It is said his arrival at this small natural harbour gave the place its name.Last weekend, artist Andrew Crummy, who lives in the village, organised three lsquosunset eveningsrsquo at the Boat Shore. Local musicians, singers, artists and actors gathered on the beach with an audience of fellow locals to share the sunset.I sadly couldnrsquot attend the first two but was able to make the last evening with some of my children. It was a wonderful mix of music and song, with a very funny short drama, and a setting sun as the backdrop.It was a poignant evening for myself, and I know for some others too a moment of reflection as well as coming together. I had planned to tell a tale about St Kenneth, but I changed my mind just before the event.Instead, I told a tale of a friendship between a tortoise and a butterfly and what sunsets meant to them. In story, anything is possible, and I made this tale to help ease someonersquos sadness in experiencing an ending.I was later askedI could share it, and so here is the story:There was once a tortoise who became friends with a butterfly. On the first day of their friendship, the tortoise invited the butterfly to sit with him on his favourite rock, to watch the sunset.However, Butterfly had no idea what a sunset was, and so when she saw the sun fall gradually from the sky she became concerned.ldquoWhatrsquos happening to the sun  she asked in a worried tone.ldquoItrsquos the sunset, said Tortoise, ldquoitrsquos when the sun goes down and ends the day.ldquoWhat, already! Thatrsquos it  asked Butterfly, horried. ldquoThis is just my first day being a butterfly and my days are over Tortoise smiled: ldquoNo my wee friend, itrsquos not all over. The sun will come back and there will be another day.But Butterfly remained anxious: ldquoHow can you be sure the sun will come back ldquoTrust me, I know. Irsquove seen many sunsets, said Tortoise. ldquoThe sun always comes back. Sometimes it takes longer than others, sometimes you canrsquot see the sun because of clouds, but it always s and makes another day.Butterfly was now reassured and so settled down to watch, as the sun dipped lower, painting the sky. She expected the sun to sizzle and the sea to steam when they touched each other, but of course that didnrsquot happen. The sun slid quietly below the horizon, leaving a trail of bright red and orange.ldquoThat was beautul, wasnrsquot it  Tortoise said.But Butterflyrsquos reply was unexpected: ldquoI think I donrsquot like sunsets very much.Tortoise curled up the wrinkles on his old face in surprise: ldquoWhy not, donrsquot you think it was spectacular, the way it painted the sky ldquoSuppose, but it was sad, really sad, said Butterfly.ldquoSad ldquoYes, because the sunset ends the day and thatrsquos sad. Endings are sad.Tortoise nodded in a way tortoises do when theyrsquore thinking: ldquoYes thatrsquos true, endings can be sad. But everything ends sooner or later. Nothing lasts forever.ldquoBut thatrsquos what I mean Tortoise, itrsquos so sad. I donrsquot want to sit and celebrate the end of something.Tortoise thought for a moment: ldquoAlthough endings can be sad, they also give meaning and value to our time. Without sunsets we would not treasure our days. Our le would become one long blah of sameness.ldquoA blah of sameness ldquoYes, my expression, smiled Tortoise proudly.ldquoBut thatrsquos easy for you to say, Tortoise, because you have more time than me, you will have more days.ldquoPerhaps, but that means your time is more precious than mine. And your sunsets are greater celebrations of your days.Butterfly thought about this. ldquoYou seem quite wise, Tortoise, she said, looking at her friend.ldquoYes, he replied immodestly, ldquoI do have that reputation. I suppose I have a lot of time to think, sitting on this rock.It began to get dark and colder.ldquoNow itrsquos time for our dreams. Soon there will be the sunrise, said Tortoise.ldquoSunrise  Is that when the sun s Tortoise nodded: ldquoYes, you see you donrsquot get a sunrise without a sunset. Although endings can be sad, they open the door to new beginnings. At the other side of a sunset there is a sunrise.Tortoise was indeed wise and Butterfly felt reassured by his wisdom.That summer, the two friends watched many sunsets together. They would share stories about their day as the sun went down. Then one evening, as flocks of geese were flying overhead, Butterfly spoke sadly.ldquoTortoise, I need to go. Itrsquos getting cold. Irsquom off to Africa. Do you think there are sunsets there ldquoIrsquom sure of it, replied Tortoise.ldquoI love sunsets now, said Butterfly. ldquoThey have shown me to treasure and celebrate my days. But I am sad this is our last one together.ldquoMe too, said Tortoise.The two friends sat together on their rock as the sunset commemorated their summer with a blaze of colour. Then they said goodbye.A new dawn now lay ahead for them both, for the end of one story is the beginning of another.And at the other side of a goodbye, there is a

The world is a much better place as a result but, unlike with family, the bonds and obligations of friendship are less clear-cut. Sometimes ties wither naturally, at others, rash or destructive relationships have actively to be severed. This is an unpleasant fact of le and one that Prince Andrew is discovering belatedly to his cost.For some time now, speculation has been mounting after the publication of a photo showing the Prince walking in a New York park with his friend, the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was recently found dead in a prison cell, where he awaited trial on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to engage in sex-trafficking.The headlines must have made the Palace shudder, their insinuations all too clear. After details of a US lawsuit mentioning him were released, a terse statement was issued distancing the Prince from historic accusations made against Epstein, and claiming that ldquoAny suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.:Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at BalmoralClose observers of Buckingham Palace might have noticed a cloud of dust around the flagpole as the house was shaken to its foundations. When the Daily Mail published footage recently showing the Duke of York ushering a young woman out of Epsteinrsquos Manhattan apartment in , a further statement was issued. The Duke, it said, ldquodeplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.Poor Prince Andrew. He is discovering what every child in the playground knows: that you are tarred and feathered with the same brush as those with whom you mix. If one of your gang throws a brick through a window, you are deemed guilty too, evenyou did nothing wrong.In the case of His Royal Highness, letrsquos put aside for a moment the suspicions his closeness to Epstein, following his release from prison, arouse. Bad enough that Andrewrsquos personal contacts are so dodgy they raise serious questions about his judgement, let alone his behaviour.If nothing , these images suggest one of two things: that the Prince was a loyal chum who stuck by Epstein, despite his ruined reputation and the risk it posed to his own. Or that, living as he did in a gilded cage, removed from real le and the consequences of any stupid decisions he made, he was utterly unconcerned about the effect their friendship might have on his prospects. When you are cocooned from birth in a cradle of privilege when you are feted, indulged, and pandered to by sycophants and liggers from the minute you can shake a rattle, it must be easy to believe you are above the normal rules and standards by which society works.Meeting in the park with Epstein was, at best, decidedly odd for someone in Prince Andrewrsquos position. Going to his apartment, however, where a stone satyr presides over the front door, was simply crazy. According to police who raided the property, they seized photos of underage girls. These and the fetishist decor would have led most ordinary visitors to make a swt exit.These images of the Duke of York date from the period when he was acting as British ldquoSpecial Representative for Trade and Investment. A bespoke role for an aimless aristocrat, it gave him licence to roam the globe, meeting fat cats in rich countries and opportunistic states in the hope that some of their wealth would find its way into Britainrsquos Treasury.:In Pictures: Commonwealth leaders gather for state dinnerDuring his deployment as an envoy, Prince Andrew made ious embarrassing ldquomissteps, among them some politically unwise associations. Nothing, however, could compare with being identied as one of Epsteinrsquos cronies, after which revelation he relinquished the post.As the grapevine quivers with anticipation over other high-profile names likely to be found in Epsteinrsquos fat address book, the Dukersquos predicament is increasingly grave. He can hide behind the Palace gates and hope the storm will pass, but this is a story that has been brewing for years. Until certain questions are satisfactorily answered, as far as hersquos concerned it is far from over.Doubtless, it will go against every royal instinct, but would he not be wiser to face the cameras, do an in-depth interview, and silence ndash perhaps even charm ndash his critics  In a situation like this, where unfettered gossip is fuelling supposition, Prince Andrew surely needs to explain his connection with Epstein and help suffocate the scandal. It would, of course, be a historic move. No member of the royal dynasty has ever voluntarily gone on record to put their side of a wildfire story, with the exception of Princess Diana. In her unforgettable, kohl-eyed interview with Martin Bashir, she was more focused on scoring points against Prince Charles than in illuminating her own often dubious actions.Sticklers for Palace protocol might feel sick at the thought of Prince Andrew going public. Even in the hands of the most measured journalist ndash Kirsty Wark, say, or Fiona Bruce ndash it would be viewed as stepping into the lionrsquos den, a suicidally reckless act. Added to which, the Windsors do not explain. They take a long view, recognising that the passage of time usually allows even the most unsavoury episodes to fade into oblivion.In this instance, however, that seems unlikely. So what is worse  Staying schtum, and waiting for more seedy revelations to be added to the blaze, or allowing the Duke to get ahead of the story, and give his version of events By remaining aloof, the Palacersquos response suggests it hopes to avoid further fallout. The implication of this is all too plain: royals might not be above the law, but its arm would have to be very long indeed to winkle one of them out of the front door and into a Black Maria. Inviting a Windsor to a police interview, let alone into a courtroom, would require Herculean effort, and a mountain of cast-iron evidence. By contrast,Andrew were willing to face, refute and defuse the rumours, it would be an act of bravery to restore family pride."},{"url":null,"title":"archbishop-justin-welby-financiers-39-moral-duty-39-consider-climate-change-making-investment-decisions","story":"The Most Reverend Justin Welby, recorded a video to appeal directly to fund managers and other investors to help avert the climate crisis ahead of a global summit on ethical finance.He said they could all do something to make a dference.Archbishop Welby said he was concerned that the investment community has lsquonot sufficiently stepped up to the platersquo, and insisted it was within their power to help avert the disastrous consequencesrsquo of failing to achieve the Paris climate change goals.He recorded a video address for the Global Ethical Finance Initiativebefore bringing his message to Scotland at this autumnrsquos world summit on ethical finance in Edinburgh which will see global leaders in business, politics, banking and investment gather to shape a fairer finance system.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Archbishop Justin Welby\",\"description\": \"video by Herald and Times group\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer thumbs nIPmonj-.jpg\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests nIPmonj.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": The summit on October th and th is supported by the Scottish Government, and bodies represented will include the United Nations, the Bank of England, the Financial Conduct Authority, RBS, Baillie Gford and HSBC.

Formally, prorogation is a matter for the Queen but she iniably acts on the advice of her Prime Minister and it would have been unprecedented in modern times for the monarch to decline the Prime Ministerrsquos request. The consequence is that Parliament has no constitutional authority, during the prorogation, to make laws or to hold debates.As with everything Brexit-related, context is all. While prorogation is ordinarily uncontroversial, this suspension of Parliament signicantly reduces the number of parliamentary sitting days available prior to  October, limiting the potential for parliamentary action against a no-deal Brexit. It remains to be seen how MPs respond during next weekrsquos sitting of Parliament, including whether that response includes a vote of no confidence in the Government. It also remains to be seen whether the Court of Session judicial review being pursued by a number of MPs in an attempt to prevent prorogation will now go ahead on  September as planned, whether it will be expedited or indeed, abandoned.House of Commons Speaker John Bercow called the Governmentrsquos plans a ldquoconstitutional outrage and there has been talk of forming an lsquoalternative parliamentrsquo in the case of prorogation.

A total of nearly  people have accessed the service.Launching a national advertising campaign to raise awareness of the Money Talk Team, Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell said:“The Money Talk Team is making a huge dference to the thousands of families that have already taken advantage of this free service.“The friendly, experienced advisers talk callers through the options available, letting them know exactly what they are entitled to and helping them save money.“But there are still too many families out there not getting what they should be.“If you’re a parent struggling to pay the bills at the end of the month, you’re not alone.

We went over my current benefits and discussed ious options. “I had been thinking about claiming Universal Credits but we worked out that I’d be five pounds worse off each weekI did. So it was reassuring to hear that I was doing the right thing. “We also ran through my loan repayments which were taking a third of my benefits each week.“Just by making a couple of calls I’ve managed to get an extra £ a week in my pocket which is more than enough to cover my monthly TV, broadband and mobile costs. “The team are friendly, helpful and the adviser properly listened. “I’ve now told both my sisters to call as I think it could really help them too.”Advice is available from the Money Talk Team on    and at local Citizens Advice Bureau.

The aim is for all recycling centres to reach % by .Up to  new staff are due to be in place by mid-September and will provide advice and assistance to householders about what can be recycled. The additional roles are part of package of improvements agreed by councillors in January.However, a new permit scheme is also being introduced to move business waste away from recycling centres to create more space for new recyclable materials to improve services to householders.While most businesses pay the necessary fees to dispose of their waste and recycling responsibly, the current open access to recycling centres means some business waste is being presented as household waste so that it can be processed free of charge.To tackle this, a new permit scheme is one of the measures being introduced next year to prevent such abuse. Under the new scheme householders using commercial type vehicles - vans, pick-ups, minibuses or trailers - to take materials to recycling centres will require a permit to do so.The permits will be free of charge and can be used at any of the  recycling centres operated by the council.Households will be able to apply for the free permits in advance and a yearrsquos supplywill be issued at one time to minimise inconvenience.Permits can be applied for online or by post at any time of the year and will be valid for  months.Aberdeenshire Council does not expect the new scheme to have an impact on most householders as permits will not be required for cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs or xs, unless they tow a trailer or a horse box.Permits can be obtained for trailers up to  x  ft in size.Certain types of vehicle typically used by businesses will not be permitted at HRCs, specically those over . tonnes gross weight, tippers, tractors, large trailersand vehicles with twin wheels or more than four wheels.Aberdeenshire Councilrsquos Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: ldquoThe approval of the new permit system is very good news as it will allow us to make space for more recyclable materials at recycling centres and improve services for householders.ldquoMost households will not be affected by the permit system at all as cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs and xs will continue to have unlimited access to recycling centres.ldquoWe are keen to minimise inconvenience to those householders who use commercial type vehicles or trailers to take materials to recycling centres.\"Only one application is required to get a yearrsquos supply of permits and we have also increased the number of permits to  per year to make sure householders have enough permits to cover the grass cutting season.ldquoWe will be communicating the details of the new permit scheme over the coming months, so there will be plenty of time to apply for the permits before the new scheme starts.ldquoBusinesses will be provided an alternative service at waste transfer stations, and with a lower price for recycling, will be encouraged to segregate and recycle as much of their waste as possible.ldquoWe will be monitoring closely how the new schemes settle in and can tweak them in future based on feedback received.More information about the new recycling permit scheme is available on www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk recyclingcentrepermitsdata-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

The devices were first introduced in Tayside in June this year and they were subsequently introduced in the North East in July.The mobiles will provide apps enabling officers carry out checks and file crime reports. Officers will also be able to type statements directly to the device through the use of its digital notebookPronto which will obtain an electronic signature from victims and witnesses.Chief Superintendent George Macdonald, Highland and Islands isional commander, said: #The introduction of mobile technology is a major milestone which will positively enhance the operational policing approach in the Highland and Islands.#Over the last two years, we have seen a signicant investment and upgrade in our IT systems to enable us to take advantage of technology.#Given the geography of the area, officers do incur signicant travel time between calls and their stations, the mobile device will allow officers to be more visible in the community, spend more time on patrol and hopefully be more accessible within the areas they serve.#Members of the public will see police officers operating their mobile device in public areas. It is important they understand they are not using their personal telephone and that they are working, but be reassured they will always be available to offer help, advice or assistanceneeded.#Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Humza Yousaf  is pleased that the Scottish Government has been able to help Police Scotland invest in new mobile technology, which he believes will enable officers to work in the heart of Scotland’s communities, providing reassurance and increasing their visibility.“This technology is enabling officers to become even more agile and responsive, ensuring the service is better-equipped to meet the modern-day demands upon it,# he said.#Being able to access information at their fingertips will improve the ability of officers in the Highlands and Islands to react promptly to a range of issues they encounter, enhancing the amount of time available to spend in the heart of their communities and keeping people safe.”Susan Deacon, Chair of the Scottish Police Authorityfeels that this is an important and much needed step forward.#The introduction of mobile working will bring real benefits to the police and the public and will make the police service more responsive, visible and efficient,# she explained.#Continued investment in technology is vital to ensure that policing in Scotland keeps pace with changing needs and demands. Communities across Scotland will be better protected as a result of these changes.#The £million Mobile Working Project which was part funded by the Scottish Government’s capital budget allocation will see approximately , of Police Scotland’s unormed officers issued with mobile devices by spring .The devices will be further enhanced over time with the addition of future policing applications, including national systems as they become available.Last year, Police Scotland produced a business case for a major investment in digital, data and ICT over  years to modernise the service. The proposed investment would also generate savings and public service improvements for the wider criminal justice system justice system.David Wallace, BT’s public sector director in Scotland and chair of the BT board in Scotland, said: “We’re pleased to be leading this project, bringing in our EE mobile network – the largest G network in the UK – and our unrivalled resources to help Police Scotland transform the way they work.“By helping our customers take advantage of BT’s investments in innovations and networking, including our launch of G in Scotland, we’ll see opportunities we couldn’t imagine ten years ago come into our lives.”Norman Dixon, Motorola Solutions# Account Director for Scotland added: “The Pronto mobile application replaces the paper notebook and modernises police workflows by giving them access to databases and tools on their mobile device on the beat. It is a world-leading mobile solution for policing. It was developed here in Scotland in partnership with the police service, so it is fantastic to see that it will become available to , Police Scotland officers.“We look forward to working with Police Scotland and are proud to be part of this major milestone in mobile police technology.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Craig Clouston and Callan Jessiman were tasked with anchoring the midfield for Hotspurs, while Rovers lined up in a --, spearheaded by Steven Tulloch and Zack Singh.The opening stages were cagey, as the two teams felt each out. The big talking point of the opening half hour was an agricultural challenge by Scott Drever in the Rovers midfield. He went over the top of the ball on Jordan Low in the middle of the park, an offence referee Mike Cursiter saw fit to issue a caution to the midfielder, with Hotspurs looking for a red.Aiden Drever saw a free-kick go narrowly wide of Davy Leonard#s post after  minutes, while Tulloch might have done better with a half chance just before the half-time whistle. A driven ball from Graeme Horne on the left was nodded on by Singh, but the veteran Rovers striker couldn#t direct his header on target, with Hotspurs appealing for an offside flag.The match remained goalless at the break, with neither team having really got going.The match was soon to kick into le in the second half. After  minutes, Rovers ‘keeper Liam Valentine made a hash of a clearance, booting the ball against Spurs striker Jerry McBeth. With the goal gaping, the Hotspurs striker was just about to pull the trigger when he was tripped by Valentine.Cursiter awarded the free-kick, and after a long consultation with his linesman, deemed the challenge worthy of a yellow card only, despite the protestations of the away side. Joe Wilson#s effort from the set piece was tipped wide by the ‘keeper.Just before the hour mark, Rovers saw their best chance come and go. A long ball found Connan Rendall on the right, who controlled it wonderfully before shuffling inside to the edge of the box. His drilled effort looked every inch a goal until Leonard flung himself down to his left to tip it round the post.Moments later, the breakthrough was to come at the other end, as the match swung from end-to-end.Aiden Drever was penalised for a foul on Logan Peace wide on Hotspurs left. The free-kick was flighted in but cleared out to Joe Wilson. His cross back in found Hotspurs legend Wayne Monkman at the back post, whose header floated over the stranded Valentine for the opening goal. Could Monkman#s goal be the fairytale ending for the defender on his final Hotspurs appearance Rovers now needed to score twice in the last  minutes to win the title, but in truth they found a well-marshalled away defence dficult to break down. Hotspurs had the bit between their teeth, with a first ‘A’ League title since  now tantalisingly close.The hosts# task was made even more challenging when Aiden Drever was sent off for two bookings in quick succession with  minutes to go. From there, Hotspurs saw out the game relatively comfortably.In the th minute, Valentine got caught underneath a high ball into the box, dropping it at the feet of substitute Jack Paterson. As the sub tried to get a shot away, he was impeded by the Rovers goalie, who saw his second yellow card of the evening to ensure his side would finish with nine men.Seventeen-year-old midfielder Jessiman stepped up to coolly slot away the resultant penalty, ensuring Hotspurs would win the  ‘A’ League, and sparking scenes of delight amongst their support on the sidelines.OAFA president Colin MacLeod paid tribute to both sides for a hard-fought league campaign after the match, and invited up Hotspurs skipper Keith Harcus to receive the Brough Cup for his side.Harcus — standing in for the injured Owen Rendall — paid tribute to his centre-back partner Monkman who is set to bow out of domestic football as an ‘A’ League champion and urged his teammates not to go another  years before landing the biggest prize in domestic football.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Climate change is speeding up sea level rise and the increasing regularity of violent storm events means the coastal archaeology is also rapidly vanishing.#Please help us record the sites and the stories of everyday maritime Shetland before it is too late.”Moder Dy is run entirely voluntarily with the non-financial support of Shetland Amenity Trust, Archaeology Shetland and Scotland’s Coastal Heritage at Risk . It also has the support of Burra History Group for the Burra Noost Project and is partnering with Bressay History Group to support their recording of Bressay noosts this summer.Costs such as the website, room hire, resources for free school visits and insurance have so far been financed by the directors. Money is slowly trickling in via donations, sponsorship, and profits from workshop ticket sales. The next workshop is being held in Unst on Saturday st June.The first step of applying to the National Lottery Heritage Fund has been successful, allowing Moder Dy – named after the dialect phrase for the mother wave – to apply for a pot of £, to run the Burra Noost Project.However, at least £, needs to be raised to match this grant funding. Donations and business sponsorshipwould help make the Burra Noost Project a reality and enable Moder Dy to record the ordinary lives of Shetland folk from the days when the four-oared boat was the equivalent to the family car today..."},{"url":null,"title":"dozen young sailors to join tall ships races ","story":"Sail Training Shetland sail trainees and sponsors on board the Faroese sailing smack Westward Ho at Victoria Pier.

He is being represented by Conservative MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston.BBC Radio Shetland#s John Johnston is hosting the event, with all eight candidates being given a minute to introduce themselves and their policies before moving on to audience questions.Independent candidate Ian Scott provided an impassioned speech, saying that he has #stood specically steadfastly against the cuts, the Tories, the Liberal Democrats” before. He also reacted angrily to the news that Mr Goodlad could not be in attendance, shaking his head as Mr Halcro Johnston explained his absence.SNP candidate Tom Wills began by saying that #Shetland is ready for a change# and asked for  months to show what he can achieve in Holyrood, while Lib Dem competitor Beatrice Wishart opened her speech with a defiant message: #If you want an MSP who will speak up for Shetland, I’m your woman#.The first question of the night revolved around transport, with Ms Wishart and Mr Wills clashing immediately, interrupting each other#s answers as Mr Johnston appealed for both candidates to let the other finish.Mr Halcro Johnston responded to Mr Wills# five-point transport plan by saying that #Tom Wills has a load of great ideas but they won’t be delivered#, while independent candidate Ryan Thomson added that #nothing gets done” because “Shetland is the pawn” in mainland politics.Councillor George Smith directed a question at Mr Wills, asking him how he expected the SIC to afford one of his election pledges, free foot passengers on inter-island ferries.Mr Wills responded to say that this could be paid for #, and when# the Scottish government provided additional funding to the council.Mr Thomson criticised the NorthLink ferries in response to a question about increased capacity on the ferries. He focused his attack on the much-maligned sleeping pods, not for the first time, saying that we had been #lumbered# with these pods and said he was reticent to even call them pods, instead saying #it#s a chair#.#Bigger ships# and #daytime sailings# were potential solutions that Mr Thomson suggested as alternatives.On the subject of Brexit, only Conservative representative Mr Halcro Johnston said that he was in favour of Brexit, although he admitted that he voted to remain in the EU.Mr Scott and Mr Wills attacked the coalition of the Tories and the Lib Dems, with Mr Scott saying that the #Tories and Liberals approved austerity and that they had #turned to the racists and the fascists# which garnered wide applause.Mr Halcro Johnston responded to say it was #always very amusing listening to Ian but I’m afraid he’s wrong#, which was met negatively by the audience.Mr Wills said that the SNP #could stop Brexit#, and added thatthey were pulled out of the EU by Westminster then a vote for independence could put Scotland back into the European Union.He expanded on Mr Scott#s point by saying the #reason why people voted for Brexit is because of the coalition of Lib Dems and Tories which approved austerity# to a rapturous reception. Ms Wishart responded to the issue of Brexit to say that it was #time for a peoples vote and time for people to work together across parties# to stop Brexit.Scottish independence was the next topic up for debate, and understandably provoked perhaps the most isive reactions of the night.Mr Scott, Mr Wills and the Green Party#s Debra Nicolson all came out in favour of an independent Scotland, while Mr Halcro Johnston, Ms Wishart and independent Peter Tait were against it. Both independent candidates, Michael Stout and Ryan Thomson, said they would wait to see what benefit Shetland could get from Scotland becoming independent before deciding how to vote, should another referendum come up.Mr Scott#s positive attitude towards independence was because, he said, # nothing  we#ll get rid of these damned Tories#.Ms Wishart wanted the audience to #imagine the chaos#Scotland tried to break up the union, citing Brexit as an example. She said the vote was supposed to be #once in a letime# and that there were better priorities for funding, such as healthcare.Mr Wills responded to this point: #which has been cut by the Tory Liberal coalition#, to audience applause.Conservative representative Mr Halcro Johnston said that #I think SNP talk about independence because its easier than talking about their failings#, and added that nobody would be surprised to find that he was against independence.I#m sorry, Tom Wills is havering. Independence will not keep Scots in, or bring us back into, the EU. EvenBritain stays in, Scotland will leave, automatically, with #No Deal#, on Independence Day and will have to reapply to join. The EU has confirmed this, in writing.Also,nothing changes, our starting budget deficit will be £. billion per annumversus the EU#s limit of about £ billion . The UK will stop paying funding that.We shall have to cut spending raise taxes by some £ billion p.a. on an annual budget of about £ billion, to satisfy the EU#s economic conditions for joining.That means we shall face years of withering austerity, just when we need to spend more to stimulate the economy.We also need to set up our own independent central bank which the nationalist think tank #The Common Weal# says will take nine years from an Indy Yes vote. So we shall be out of the EU, with #No Deal#, for at least, seven years from Independence Day.Scots are canny folk. They will not vote for such an independence prospectus.John, your oft repeated notion that an independent Scotland will start with a budget deficit of £. billionis an entire fancy. Whatdebt an independent Scotland may have to take on as a share of the current UK#s debt, in the event of Scotland becoming independent, will be a matter for negotiation and agreement . Similarly, matters such as whether, and for what fees , the rest of the former UK might be permitted to retain its weapons of mass destruction on Scottish soil will be for negotiation agreement in the event of Scotland becoming independent.I would not hold my breath waiting for their answer.Ian Scott and Tom Wills have very selective memories. The austerity cuts introduced by the last Conservative  Lib Dem coalition were in response to the mess Brown and Blair made of the British economy. The outcome of this prudent handling of the deficit was obviously popular with the British people because David Cameron’s government won an overall majority in the subsequent election. David Cameron also delivered on another election pledge to have an in out referendum on Europe. How can the SNP criticise any party for that they have never delivered on an election pledge in their le. Finally, the only racism and fascism that has come out of this by-election has been promoted by the SNP anti-English racism. The SNP are Tartan Fascists.Had it not been for the global economic crisis, and Blair#s US led wars, Brown#s finances could have seen him becoming PM. This shows the harm in getting too friendly with the US, not that there will be much of a choice for the remnants of the UK after Brexit. I won#t digny John M Scott#s final comment with a response other than to note that it is Trump and Farage that have been too close to white supremacists. Happily neither seem that popular north of the boarder. The SNP promote an inclusive civic nationalism which can#t seriously be compared to that of the far right.##and the peril of getting too friendly with the EU is being dictated to and bled dry by a Union of Socialist Republics ruled by a Germanic Franco dictator, aided an abetted by a random collection of Belgians.Best off going it alone and not being shackled up to some #superpower#, either actual or wannabe.John M Scott#s remark reminds me of something a reviewer wrote in the Shetland News in : #The depths of ignorance are surely plumbed here#.It#s like I wasnt even there.No mention of Labours position on Brexit or Independence. Thanks guysYou#ll have to listen tonight folks, there isnt even any mention of VE which was discussedLabour has a position on Brexit!Where did you find out about this Johan @Brian Hill, It is you who fantasise, not I. I did not mention #national debt#. So let#s set aside the #smoke and mirrors#. I am talking about the £. billion gap between Scottish tax revenue raised last year and money received from Westminster. We have been running similar, sometimes larger deficits for many years. Unless something changes this will become our annual budget deficit on obtaining independence as Westminster will no longer fund the shortfall.Don#t take it from me. A couple of years back, the SNP#s own Sustainable Growth Commission conceded that we would start independence with a budget deficit of .% of our GDP, around £. billion per year, and proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to less than %, which just happens to be the EU#s maximum permissible limit. @Brian Hill, Ok,we are to be pernickety:The UK funds the dference between our tax revenues and what Holyrood receives from the Exchequer so we are talking about a so-called #notional deficit# that has been ongoing for many years.This is recognised by the SNP#s Sustainable Growth Commission.UK funding will cease on Independence Day and the notional deficit will become , our budget deficit.The current UK funding of £. billion equates to around £ per head of population, per year. With independence that money will have to be found where # borrowing or tax hikes # or cut from public services.#John, as Scotland is not yet independent then it cant have been running a deficit for any#, what utter nonsense. Since when did you have to be independent to go broke  Try telling that one to your bank manager. Dr Craig Dalzell! who  wings over Scotland! still based in England, hard to make it up but you manage it Brian.John, I#m sorryit appeared pernickety, but my fundamental point was that you cant predict the future finances of any putative future independent Scotland based on the notionalaccounts of a devolved Scotland within the current UK state. No amount of repetition of thosefigures alters the arguments.Brian,You#re putting words in my mouth. I#m not attempting to predict future finances. Merely, observing that we would start from a very bad place, losing the £. billion annual UK funding.But please, don#t take it from me.The SNP#s Sustainable Growth Commission propose a multi-year programme of deficit reduction and Oxford University Professor Gallacher has studied the most recent figures. He concludes: #Any more realistic look……. starting from Scotland’s actual fiscal position, swtly shows…….would quickly amass unsustainable levels of debt, and the cost of servicing it would require large cuts in public services. #….today’s relatively high spending is supported by large UK fiscal transfers, and to avoid cutting it large borrowing would be needed. #That swtly adds up to very large debt, which cannot be afforded. #All this strategy would achieve is to delay the inevitable big cuts in spending until Scotland is heavily indebted and so has to make even more cuts.#Paraphrasing your own words, Brian, #No amount of SNP preication can alter the facts.#I#m no economist by any stretch of the imagination. But could we not use the £bn+ that Westminster uses in defence, HS , bribing the DUP , or building a #national# stadiumon our behalf, to subsidise the #deficit# Those are the more optimistic contentions which I take from the Commission#s report, as to what can be done when an independent Scotland takes full control of its own resourcesAye, Brian, as you say, #those are the more optimistic contentions#from the Commission’s report,…#Here is the summary of the Growth Commission#s analysis for kicking off Indy:Also, they recognise the need for a multi-year deficit reduction plan .#Creating a credible and sustainable fiscal framework  policy:. Target a deficit value of below  per cent within  to  years.#Just like I said, deficit reduction from .% to % i.e. about £ billion per annum.So much in a name, #The SNP’s Sustainable Growth Commission#!

This would be completed over the next two or three months, he said.On the issue of smell, the two sources are from the -metre chimney and from the hatches of the fish meal boats.

It is responsible for protecting, improving and expanding forests and woodland in England. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland look after their own woodlands.The Forestry Commission was founded on  September . Its job was to reforest the UK for timber after World War One had devastated huge areas of land for the war effort. Philip Parker from the Royal Mail said about the new stamps: On the Forestry Commissions centenary these striking new stamps celebrate the beauty and tranquillity of our public woodlands, and the inspiring range of environments which receive hundreds of millions of visits each year.Other forests featured on the new stamps are Glen Affric in Inverness-shire, Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire, Westonbirt in the National Arboretum in Gloucestershire, Coed y Brenin in Gwynedd, and Kielder Forest in Northumberland "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2094571.jpg--.jpg?1566380525000\n","title":"prevention programme aimed at stopping diabetes surge","story":"A programme to tackle the increasing prevalence of type  diabetes by PHA is operational across the Ballymena area.Approximately , people are living with diabetes in Northern Ireland, a startling .% increase since [].Type  diabetes accounts for % of all cases of diabetes and is a serious and progressive condition. The disease can lead to early loss of le, cause preventable sight loss in working age people, and is a major contributor to kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and even amputation, yet the illness is often preventable by adopting healthier lestyle changes.The new Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.Cullybackey patient Thelma Shanks from Cullybackey was referred onto the programme this year. She said: “There is a history of hypertension and diabetes in my family. “Several of my paternal aunts sadly passed away due to complications that came with the disease, and my mum was found to be diabetic following admission to hospital for routine tests. “I was born in London, but grew up in my parent country, Jamaica. I ed to the UK for good in , and my husband and I moved to Northern Ireland, where all my children were born, in . “As a nation, we from the Caribbean tend to be a bit more susceptible to diabetes than others, so it wasn’t a complete surprise to be told I was at risk of developing the disease. “I am also a trained doctor so despite having given up my profession when I had children, I have knowledge of the medical risk.“I have a wonderful busy family le. I have four children, all of which I home schooled, and of course, their needs always came before mine. “When you’re running a busy house and looking after everyone  it’s easy to forget to look after yourself. However, in  when I heard that a health fair was coming to the area I decided to go along. For a small fee they carried out multiple tests which showed I had hypertension or high blood pressure. “I decided to make an appointment with my GP who put me on a number of drugs, first Irbesartan, then Amlodipine and finally a diuretic to bring my blood pressure under control.“I realised I needed to be more careful with my diet and tried to be a bit healthier but I admit it was a bit half-hearted. TESTS“My blood sugar levels were border-line they weren’t going down but they weren’t going up either, so I thought everything was all right. I was having routine check-ups with my nurse at this stage so I was on her radar and having blood tests taken intermittently. In April  I had my regular tests done and then hopped on a plane to London. “It was my daughter’s birthday and I had decided to treat her by going away for the week. We had just made it to the hotel when I received a phone call from my nurse. “She said tests showed my sugar levels were up and I was actually diabetic, which was the wake-up call I needed. Let’s just say it wasn’t quite the luxury week that I had planned! My daughter certainly ate well, but no sugar passed my lips that trip. “Needless to say, I had the blood tests repeated soon after our , and was delighted to learn that due to my dietary sacrices, my blood sugar levels had again receded into the ‘pre-diabetic’ band.“Prior to our trip away, my doctor had called me. She said there was a new Diabetes Prevention Programme starting soon in my area being run by the Public Health Agency. She askedI would be interested and of course I agreed.“The class has  others in it and we meet on Wednesday afternoons. There are eight women and two men, and together we re-learn what we should be eating, what to avoid, and how to step up our exercise routines. “I’ve found it really helpful because everyone is in the same boat and we can share our experiences and encourage one another. “Each week we build on the goals of the previous weeks, paying attention to diet and exercise and gaining strength from each other.“I used to believe that running after a busy family was exercise enough but now I’m walking every other day, trying to increase my pace and my distance. My daughter and I often walk together and I try to keep up with her. LONG TERM“One day I managed , steps in one walk and  of those miles were uphill. I’m trying to make long term changes and make sure these become habits I’ll stick to for the rest of my le. So far I’ve lost  kg, and my exercise levels have increased signicantly too. My blood sugar levels have decreased, but more importantly I feel better physically and psychologically. “The Diabetes Prevention Programme and the team who deliver it have been amazing. I’m looking forward to seeing a new me at the end of the nine and a half month course.”Thelma was referred onto the Diabetes Prevention Programme by her GP Dr Jean McCaughern, Maine Medical Practice, CullybackeyThe practice serves around , patients that live within a six mile radius of the surgery. Dr Jean McCaughern joined the surgery around  years ago and was placed in charge of the practice’s diabetes clinic.At first she managed this alone, today she heads up this specialist clinic with the help of two practice nurses. She does this alongside her normal GP responsibilities.She said: “When I first started the clinic around % of our patients were diabetic and that included those who had both type  and type  diabetes. Today that figure has more than doubled. In  we have a prevalence rate of .%. That’s how quickly the disease is on the rise. “Often patients don’t realise just how serious the illness is. I have overheard patients saying ‘I just have a touch of diabetes’ or ‘I only have diabetes’, but it’s a serious illness which can cause deterioration of vision, contribute to heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, and vascular problems which at their worst can lead to amputation.“Patients of mine have had all these problems and more. The reality is dferent to the perception and it’s only when dficulties start that people begin to understand what living with diabetes can mean. The longer you have the disease, the more likely you are to have any one of those complications.“Having diabetes presents practical problems too. In some cases the DVLA can revoke people’s drivers licensestheythey believe there is poor management of diabetes. This can include raised sugars, but more importantly sugar levels dropping and causing confusion in patients as is would be unsafe to drive.“For some people having diabetes is out of their control. Those with Type  diabetes have no choice but to manage it using medication. “For others who spot heightened blood sugar levels early, termed pre-diabetic, they have a window of opportunity to reverse or delay a diagnosis of Type  diabetes through healthy eating and exercise. That’s who the Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at and who it can help.“Once higher sugar levels are discovered, the earlier people can make changes and the higher the chance they have of reversing the outcome. Sometimes, it’s not about changing the diagnosis but delaying it by a decade or so. “The longer you can hold it off the longer you can hold off the complications that come with it. “It’s not all bad news though, having diabetes, whether Type  or Type , is largely manageable either by medication, treatment or diet. “Insulin, used primarily for treating type  diabetes, lowers blood sugar levels when diet and exercise alone aren’t sufficient, but the effectiveness of these medications depends on how early the disease is diagnosed and the size of the dose.“I was happy to get involved in the Programme. Having an interest in diabetes I was approached by the Public Health Agency at the operational stage to look at the programme’s viability in my area. I’m a big supporter. “So far I’ve referred around  people from the practice onto the programme which educates and empowers people of the contents of foods, the need to exercise and develop better eating patterns. “Often I’ve heard people say once they have to go on a special diabetes diet but that’s not the case, it’s just healthy eating, it’s the way we should all be eating.“As far as the success of the programme goes, it’s a little early to tell. The first cohort of people started on the programme in May and early results are positive. Certainly weight loss as a group has occurred and people have more knowledge of food, portion control and exercise.“So, there are benefits for all and for some the course is working really well.

You could see smoke and a small bit of flames coming out of the car, I knew the engine was on fire.“Sean and I were straight over to him and told him he needed to get out of the car. He had no idea what was going on. “We got him out of the car and pushed it off the road. We got his stuff out of the car and popped the hood. “I phoned the fire brigade and Sean and I redirected traffic to keep them away from the car until they came.“The fire started to escalate, within I’d say about  seconds of popping the hood the engine was fully on fire.“Thankfully the fire brigade got there before the petrol tank went up.”Joshua guessed the man, whom they helped back to his house in the village with the items they helped rescue from the car, was in his fties or sixties. A video has been circulated on social media of part of the incident and praise has been heaped on Sean and Joshua for their brave actions.Joshua commented: “It happened so quickly, natural instincts took over. You couldn’t stand by and watch that. He needed help. He didn’t have a clue that his engine was on fire. If we hadn’t done anything he could have died.”Both Joshua and Sean play rugby at Banbridge RFC and are former students at Newbridge Integrated College.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

There are huge opportunities for those who are early movers and this is something that will be beneficial to the country for the long term and for our international competitiveness.”Minister Humphreys said: “What we are doing through Future Jobs Ireland is future proofing our economy, and one of the pillars is how we can transition companies to a low carbon and businesses to a low carbon economy.“Today we have looked at dferent options. Of course there are challenges but I believe there are many opportunities there.“In the bio-economy, Ireland has been leading in that space so we will work with industry through transition teams, through the regional enterprise plans, our dferent funds, whether it’s the disruptive technologies fund, or it’s the regional enterprise development fund, again working with all the stakeholders so that we can see and grasp the opportunities that are there.”Meanwhile, the ministers faced questions about the controversial EU-Mercosur deal.Whats really exciting about the Mercosur deal is that it puts obligations on Brazil and these countries to meet their climate responsibilitiesRichard BrutonMr Bruton told the audience that the “exciting” deal will put Brazil and other countries under pressure to meet their climate responsibilities.“We can’t always look at your trading partner and say – for example you could look at Poland and say ‘they still have all sorts of coal-mining going on – we shouldn’t allow Polish goods into Ireland’,” he said.“There’s a limit in what you can do or you effectively dismantle a trade arrangement.“But what’s really exciting about the Mercosur deal in my view is that it puts obligations on Brazil and these countries to meet their climate responsibilities.“So it is a new form of trade agreement and it’s forcing countries who get involved to take their climate responsibilities seriously.“This deal has to be evaluated and Ireland will make a decision in due course. But it’s absolutely wrong to say it’s not part of this agenda.”The proposed agreement between the EU and a group of countries including Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay was reached at the end of June after  years of talks.It could mean an extra , tonnes of beef, , tonnes of poultry and  tonnes of pork is imported from South America.The deal has been heavily criticised by environmental groups and beef farmers, who believe it will lead to poorer quality beef flooding the EU market at the expense of Irish farmers.Ms Humphreys said thatcountries do not adhere to the Paris Agreement then the Irish government will not be doing business with them.“For the first time ever there’s a big chapter in this agreement on sustainability,” she added.“There’s a huge focus and again these people have to bring up their standards otherwise we won’t be doing business with them and that’s very clear.”"},{"url":null,"title":"minister to consider findings of scathing broadband report","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That’s their intention, that’s their aim, that is unconstitutional and this court should stop it.”He said the Prime Minister’s claim there would be plenty of time for Parliament to debate Brexit despite prorogation is “wrong”, adding: “He knows he’s wrong and he says it anyway. One might call that a lie.”Mr O’Neill said Mr Johnson’s letter to MPs outlining prorogation reasons has “got it wrong on the law” as it assumes the Government can allow a no-deal Brexit without the authorisation of primary legislation.He said the reasons for prorogation “stand up to very little proper scrutiny”.Using prorogation to cut the time to debate a no-deal Brexit by claiming to be “answerable to the people not to Parliament, that’s not a democracy as we know it. That’s mob rule”, Mr O’Neill added.He said the suggestion prorogation is needed for the political conference season is “nonsense” and that Parliament should be askedMPs want to attend conferences as normal or “actually want to decide on the future of this country”.He said the Queen should be obliged to recall the prorogation orderit turned out to be based on an error of law, as she is “not above the law”, and said prorogation could be subject to review in the courts.Roddy Dunlop QC, representing the UK Government, said Judge Lord Doherty should reject the petitioners’ requests, arguing they had no case as prorogation has already been agreed and is protected from court action.If Parliament has a problem with this, its for Parliament to sort it outRoddy Dunlop, QCHe said the petitioners are asking the judge to take actions which are “wholly unprecedented and go beyond any interference which the courts have ever been permitted”.“It is this sort of approach… that would be unconstitutional,” he added.“It is either not justiciable because it is reserved for Her Majesty and is such a matter with which the courts will not interfere or it is a matter which involves such questions of policy that the courts should not intrude because they are ill-equipped to do so.”He said it does not become a matter for the courts either due to theof suspension or because Mr O’Neill claims it is “borne of political motives which he seeks to impugn”.The advice given to the Queen and the motivation behind are “plainly covered by parliamentary privilege”, he said.“They cannot be inquired into anywhere other than Parliament. If Parliament has a problem with this, it’s for Parliament to sort it out.”He said it is “entirely normal” for Parliament to be prorogued, and the Parliament has “never had any say” on this.He said Mr O’Neill is “wrong” that primary legislation would be needed before a no-deal Brexit, saying “ there is no deal ratied or there is no deal at all then a simple matter of law the UK will leave”.He claimed any case the petitioners do have is “extremely weak” and there is “no reason” not to hear the full case at the hearing originally set on September , instead of making an interim order.Lord Doherty said he would make decision in the case on Friday morning.Campaigner Gina Miller has meanwhile made an urgent application for a judicial review at the High Court in London.Ms Miller previously won a landmark ruling that MPs would have to vote before the Government could invoke Article  to formally start the UK’s exit process from the EU.A judiciary spokeswoman said on Thursday that the application was being considered.At Belfast High Court, campaigner Raymond McCord also launched a legal bid to issue an injunction against the move by Mr Johnson.Mr McCord, whose emergency injunction application was adjourned for  hours, was already pursing legal proceedings against the potential proroguing of Parliament.Northern Ireland’s Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan, who sat for the short hearing on Thursday, agreed to give the legal parties a further day to prepare for a substantive hearing on Friday morning."},{"url":null,"title":"baby monkey born at london zoo named after astronaut buzz aldrin","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Amongst the pupils at the house which was called Tanus, was a young Samuel Beckett who attended there between the age of five and nine.The school was located on the Leopardstown Road between Foxrock and Stillorgan and in his later years literally giant still recalled that the place had a big lawn where, between classes, he and his brother Frank would play with the other children.Also, whilst they were attending the school, the Beckett’s father acted as a surveyor for a new building that the Elsner’s had constructed at the end of their garden to act as a gymnasium.Having obviously inherited her father’s undoubted musical talent, Alex attended the Royal College of Music in London where she honed her contralto voice and on herto Ireland in  and took part in concerts with many of Dublin’s musical societies and remained an extremely popular choice for private recitals in the fashionable houses of the capital.Later in the s Alexandrina Elsner was travelling north to sing in Belfast and the North West as well. Amongst her first memorable appearances in Derry was a performance as a soloist at a St Columb’s Choral Union concert in February  and at another concert in October  at the city’s new Opera House on Carlisle Road.The stature of the appearance of Miss Elsner at Derry’s Opera House, which had opened in , should not be underestimated since there were very few venues of this stature in Ireland at the time that attracted only the top acts of the time. In fact, the Derry newspapers - the Standard, Derry Journal and Londonderry Sentinel lauded her as one of the most favoured performers of the local audiences.Renowned Italian opera companies regularly visited Derry to perform and such was the popularity of the city’s Opera House that late night train services for audiences were often laid on from Inishowen and in the city late evening tram services allowed audiences to travel more easily to the shows.When she married Abraham Stewart on June ,  Alex Elsner moved to Derry where she wasted no time in throwing herself into the cultural le of a city esteemed for not only for its love of music but its wealth of talent as well.Just two years after her arrival in her new home, Alexandrina had established the Londonderry Philharmonic Society and Londonderry Feis. The Feis, beginning as a single day event on April ,  eventually bloomed into a week-long festival of music and singing by the s and she herself took lead roles in the bi-annual performances of the Philharmonic Society.The budding impresario wisely took counsel from the organisers of the Feis Ceoilin her native city of Dublin and invited a representative to Derry to advise on how to establish a local version. As a result, Derry became the second place in Ireland to establish such a festival, beating Sligoand Belfastto the punch.Initially, there were just a few competitions – for church choirs, factory choirs, school choirs, drum and flute bands, brass bands and for solo singers as well as special medals for songs sung in Gaelic awarded by the Derry branch of the Gaelic League. The interest of budding competitors was immediately taken as the workers of the famed city shirt factories quickly scrambled to form choirs specically for the Feis.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshIn advance of the first year of competition, by February of  three of the factories established four choirs. Welch Margetson  Co and Hogg  Mitchell both entered a choir each, whilst the much larger workforce at Tillie  Henderson entered two choral groups.With the passing decades the Feis gained more and more competitors and its repertoire of competitions expanded as a result not just from all over Ireland but from Scotland and England as well. As its prestige also increased, many of Derry’s businesses were glad to be associated with its success and donated beautul gold and silver cups and medals. Bursary schemes for those intent in pursuing a professional le in music and singing also began.In , just a year after partition, another woman Mrs Edward HenryO’Doherty founded Feis Doire Colmcille along with Fr Joseph McGettigan. The Derry Feis centred more upon Irish music, dancing and singing but despite the obvious cultural dferences, competitors from the Catholic and Protestant communities competed in both feiseanna without exception.Alexandrina Stewarts devotion to the Londonderry Philharmonic Society was equal to her commitment to the feis. Apart from featuring her own distinguished performances, the concerts also featured many distinguished musical names from both London and Dublin.In an era long before manufactured television vehicles, the twice-yearly Derry concerts also attracted talent scouts from far and near seeking bookings for their concert halls and opera houses.And, a major talent was spotted as the result of the Philharmonic Society’s concert in Derry on March , . James Johnston, a native of Belfast was well-known as an amateur singer in his younger days but was practically untrained at the highest level. Instead he concentrated as a career in butchery in his father’s shop and supplemented his income as a semi-professional singer at venues around Ireland.It was after his performance in Derry that he was snapped up by the Dublin Grand Opera Society and so began a huge career as an opera singer. It was after highly memorable performances in Rigoletto in Ireland’s capital in , the globally renowned theatrical director Tyrone Guthrie offered him a contract at Sadler’s Wells where he became principal tenor for well in excess of a decade.During his career Johnston played a wide range of roles which included his Covent Garden debut in La Traviata in  and also appeared with Maria Callas and Joan Sutherland. Johnston retired at the height of his fame in  and simply ed to working in the family butcher’s business in Belfast’s Sandy Row where he lived out the remainder of his le until he died aged  in .Johnston’s success however was entirely based on being spotted in Derry and to the efforts of Alex Stewart’s in establishing the city’s Philharmonic Society. It too sprang from relatively humble beginnings, with having just over  in the chorus and nineteen strong orchestra in . By the s the society accounted for  voices and a  strong orchestra that drew its membership from all classes across Derry.The pinnacle of Alex’s own musical career had perhaps come in March  when she was soloist for the celebrated Halle Orchestra at St Columb’s Hall. The orchestra had been founded in  in Manchester by Sir Charles Halle to perform at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition in January . The orchestra exists to this day and has been in residence at the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester since .Abraham Stewart died suddenly in  and as a result, Alexandrina ed home to her family in Dublin, but ed to Derry every year without fail during feis week. The Feis Committee awarded her the honorary title of administrator and offered to pay the fare for herjourney for le.On May ,  Alex McCausland Elsner Stewart died at a nursing home in Dublin and her remains were brought to Derry and buried beside those of her husband in the city cemetery. The couple had two sons and a daughter. Her daughter, also called Alexandrina, had been killed just a few weeks previously whilst on active service in Burma during World War II.Abraham and Alexandrina had lived at the prestigious Crawford Square in Derry and it was there on April ,  that the Ulster History Circle unveiled a blue plaque marking her le and contribution to the cultural le of her adopted city.Commenting on the unveiling of the blue plaque, Chris Spurr from the Ulster History Circle said: “When Alexandrina Stewart embraced Ireland’s city of music, the result was a harmonious partnership founding the first Londonderry Philharmonic Society and the Derry Feis Ceoil.”CAPTION: The Londonderry Philharmonic Society on stage at the Guildhall."},{"url":null,"title":"nerve visual gallery close doors ebrington","story":"The Nerve Visual Gallery at Ebrington is set to close at the beginning of next month, the Derry News has learned.The announcement will come as a great disappointment to art lovers in the city who have frequented the gallery over the past number of years and will be a loss to the Ebrington site.When it first opened in  it was lauded as a “major new venue for visual arts in the Northern Ireland”.However, at the weekend a spokesperson for The Executive Officeconfirmed: “The Nerve Centre has operated a gallery in a section of the Creative Hub Building   on the Ebrington Site for three years and gave notice that they intend to close the gallery on  September .“The Executive Office is currently considering options for the section occupied by Nerve Gallery.”Located in the former army barracks at Ebrington, the Nerve Centre developed a series of major visual arts commissions with partners including - Now, National Museums NI, The Fondation Gilles Caron, Gallery of Photography Dublin, Ultra Lab Madrid and Matts Gallery London.Exhibitions have shone a light on pivotal moments in Northern Ireland’s history such as the Civil Rights movement and the Troubles.The Lost Moment exhibition looked anew at the Civil Rights movement fty years on from the marches and peaceful protests that immediately preceded the Troubles.

Work to widen Fountain Street to provide on-street parking and traffic calming measures has already been completed, while a pound, project at Collinsrsquo Corner is currently underway.Roads officials have previously suggested the introduction of a one-way system but little or nor progress appears to have been made on this particular scheme.While pleased with the work in Fountain Street and Collinsrsquo Corner, Cllr Curran believes they will not have a positive impact on town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with senior roads engineers. He is also concerned that no progress is being made to tackle a congestion and road safety issue at Edward Street in the town.His call for talks to discuss solutions to town centre congestion came ahead of a special meeting between councillors and roads officials last night when the Department of Infrastructure presented its annual report which details work that has already been completed on ious schemes and what projects are in the pipeline.Cllr Curran said the annual report contained no ldquoconcrete proposals for addressing town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with engineers.ldquoA proposed road between Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue has been shelved due to the cost involved and the minimal impact it would have on tackling congestion, he said. ldquoThat is why we need to get round the table and look at all options moving forward.ldquoCan lessons be learned from other towns which experienced similar problems or what about changing the sequencing of traffic lights  he asked.ldquoIt has been said many times that there is no quick fix solution to Downpatrickrsquos congestion problem and while the layout of the town may pose problems for engineers, surely it is time for some innovative thinking ldquoAll the key players need to get together as years of inaction has exacerbated the congestion nightmare faced by residents, businesses and visitors.Cllr Curran says the time has come to ldquograsp the congestion nettle with the onus on roads officials to finally deliver by taking a critical look at the problems.ldquoWe need to take a critical look at the problem and come up with ideas on the way forward. I suspect that the congestion issue that we have in Downpatrick would not be allowed to go unaddressed in any other major town in the country. We have had numerous reports on the way forward but what people, in particular those in the business community what to see, is action, he continued.ldquoDownpatrick councillors need to join forces and sit down with roads engineers to look at what can be done. Apart from the development of the Saul Way link road, there has been no major traffic development in Downpatrick town centre for decades.ldquoThe congestion problem is getting worse andthe ambitious plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station base and adjoining buildings are to be a success and attract new commercial and private development, we need to solve the traffic problem.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThe congestion is driving shoppers out of the town and we need to arrest this decline. To achieve this, I believe that we need a brainstorming sessions to come up with a new blueprint on the way forward. There must be an end to a congestion problem blighting the local economy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C August 28%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A young Ballynahinch familyrsquos seven-month ordeal ended yesterday mdash only hours after the Down Recorder took up their case.Thatrsquos how long the McGrory family have been waiting for a new fireplace in the living room of their Housing Executive house at Windmill Gardens.After such a long wait, workmen finally arrived out yesterday afternoon, less than  hours after the Recorder had contacted Housing Executive headquarters about the situation.The problems for the family started three years ago when their fireplace broke up. Housing Executive workmen carried out repairs, but seven months ago the fireplace again broke up. Since then repeated calls to the Executive met with little or no response.ldquoWith winter fast coming we needed this fireplace fixed, said Mr Terry McGrory. ldquoDuring the summer months we managed to make do, but therersquos no way we could face cold nights without a fire in our living room.ldquoSince February wersquove had to do without a fire and it was beginning to look like it wouldnrsquot be fixed at all.

He wanted to knowplanning permission covered the size of explosives used in the quarry.He was told that  conditions were attached to the planning permission, covering such issues as the size of explosive charges and the permitted distance from the nearest dwellings.KILLYLEAGH mdash Work on a major housing redevelopment programme in Killyleagh is in danger of grinding to a halt. Speculation is mounting that the main contractors are getting ready to pull out because of unpaid bills by the Housing Executive.Ten houses which have been virtually complete for six months are still lying idle because minor sub-contract work has not been started. Ten families, who were told last December that new homes would be ready by February, are still waiting and the situation is fast becoming a deadlock.The poundm redevelopment scheme at Irish Street was to have been a Housing Executive showpiece. Work began on building  new homes in two phases in . The scheme had been designed to ldquoretain the character and charm of Killyleagh, transforming the old houses into modern housing for some  people.The Housing Executive have flatly refused to comment on the latest developments at the site and they will not go into the many complaints, except to admit that there are problems at the site.Three weeks ago a major row erupted all over the province when a dispute in the Executiversquos finance department caused a backlog of payments to dozens of small construction firms.DOWNPATRICK mdash A group of residents in the Flying Horse housing estate in Downpatrick are campaigning for proper dustbins to be provided.At present residents are supplied with paper bags which they say are too small and do not hold any great weight of refuse.

Often dogs tear the bags apart with the same results, he said.ldquoThe Flying Horse residents are at a loss to know why Model Farm, a much more recent estate, is supplied with proper metal dustbins while they must do with a totally inadequate paper bag system.STRANGFORD mdash The first ever Strangford Festival went down a smash hit success and the town vibrated with fun and laughter over four days.The festival kicked off on Friday evening with a band parade and carried over the whole bank holiday weekend, culminating with a dance on Monday.

Boris Johnson to reverse plans to suspend parliament before Brexit has commenced at the High Court in Belfast.Victims campaigner Raymond McCord is seeking an urgent injunction aimed at forcing the Prime Minister to change his advice to the Queen to prorogue the House of Commons.Mr McCord’s lawyers claim he received assurances that no such suspension would take place ahead of the October  deadline for the UK to leave the EU.They argued that the Government’s move to put parliament on hold for up to five weeks represents an unlawful attempt to thwart MPs from debating a potential no-deal Brexit..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default

.desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Ronan Lavery QC told the Court today: “My client watched the events which took place yesterday on television with some dismay.“There had been a response from the Prime Minister’s solicitors saying there’s no basis for an undertaking to be given... in relation to his request that parliament not be prorogued in advance of EU Brexit day.“Then yesterday happened, which seemed to be at odds with not an undertaking, but an assurance there was nothing to worry about.”Mr McCord, whose son Raymond Jr was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries in , is mounting a wider legal challenge against any withdrawal from the EU without an agreement.The Belfast man claims a departure on those terms would breach the Good Friday Agreement.According to his legal team the use of prorogation is also unconstitutional, with the policy posing a threat to the Northern Ireland peace process.With the Prime Minister pledging the UK will leave the EU on October  “do or die”, the judicial review challenge is listed for hearing next month.However, the application for an injunction was lodged after Mr Johnson announced plans to suspend parliament.“It’s an unprecedented prorogation,” Mr Lavery contended.Stolen car involved in Kettering crash Coremetrics  Coremetrics

the power, counsel alleged an ulterior purpose.“It’s to impede the amount of parliamentary time that is available to debate,” he said.Adjourning the application until Friday, Sir Declan requested amendments to the papers.Outside court Mr McCord claimed a no deal Brexit could have dire consequences.“This could wreck the peace process,” he predicted.“I want the court to clearly state this is unlawful, and that what Boris Johnson is doing isn’t for the good of the country, it’s for his own agenda and to try and sideline parliament.”His solicitor, Ciaran O’Hare of McIvor Farrell, added: “As has been predicted by police, politicians and commentators, such a policy is likely to lead to economic turmoil,not long term recession, and medicine and food shortages. “Indeed, the likelihood of civil unrest in the circumstances must be high, as well as a raising of sectarian tensions between groups in Northern Ireland. “The delicate constitutional balance which has thus far been achieved, will be destroyed.”try catch  TrendingWoman whose body was found in NI town has been identiedMan arrested on suspicion of child cruelty after baby found deadDean Harrison ruled out of Classic TT after

You could see smoke and a small bit of flames coming out of the car, I knew the engine was on fire.“Sean and I were straight over to him and told him he needed to get out of the car.

We got his stuff out of the car and popped the hood. “I phoned the fire brigade and Sean and I redirected traffic to keep them away from the car until they came.“The fire started to escalate, within I’d say about  seconds of popping the hood the engine was fully on fire.“Thankfully the fire brigade got there before the petrol tank went up.”Joshua guessed the man, whom they helped back to his house in the village with the items they helped rescue from the car, was in his fties or sixties. A video has been circulated on social media of part of the incident and praise has been heaped on Sean and Joshua for their brave actions.Joshua commented: “It happened so quickly, natural instincts took over. You couldn’t stand by and watch that. He needed help. He didn’t have a clue that his engine was on fire. If we hadn’t done anything he could have died.”Both Joshua and Sean play rugby at Banbridge RFC and are former students at Newbridge Integrated College. The boys will start Banbridge Tech next month.Sean’s mother Lisa commented: “They were very brave and I’m very proud of them, but it could’ve went terribly wrong just as quickly.The Mid Sussex streets

The portraits were removed and the offended party, a Mr Lee Hegarty, was consulted on what should replace them.”Lord Maginnis said that the settlement “was signed off by the then secretary of state, Theresa Villiers MP, on the recommendation, I am informed, of her permanent secretary Jonathan Stephens”.Sir Jonathan remains as the NIO’s permanent secretary, its most senior official.A month ago the News Letter revealed that all images of the Queen – even one of her shaking hands with Martin McGuinness – were then banned from the walls of Stormont House. NIO minister Lord Duncan said at the time that the department “takes steps to ensure no such images are displayed in Stormont House”.Reacting to widespread criticism of the move, new Secretary of State Julian Smith then tweeted a small image of the Queen on the mantel piece of his private office within the building, but the NIO declined to say whether it had only been placed there in response to criticism of the initial decision.Mr Smith ordered a civil service review of the initial decisions. Despite having begun at the height of the holiday season, that review has now been completed in an unusually brisk time frame for the slow-turning wheels of bureaucracy.The News Letter understands that a photo of the Queen on her own has been placed in the main entrance corridor of Stormont House - the first place where guests go when visiting the property - along with another image of the Queen with Irish President Michael D Higgins and an image of Prince Charles in a church with the Anglican and Roman Catholic Archbishops of Armagh.The images are part of a wider series of photos, one of which is of commemorations at the Ulster Tower for the fallen at the Somme. Officials believe the images as a whole represent a balanced range.A source close to Secretary of State Julian Smith said: “The Secretary of State was clear that the Head of State’s image should be on display in Stormont House.” pictured outside the High Court in Belfast where he was seeking an emergency injunction stopping Boris Johnson from suspending Parliament.

At the time of Lord Maginnis’s remarks, all that the NIO would say was: “We will not comment on inidual personnel matters.”The NIO said: “A portrait of the Queen – our head of state – is on display in the public area of Stormont House alongside a balanced set of images celebrating and reflecting the work of the Northern Ireland Office.”try catch  TrendingWoman whose body was found in NI town has

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong. We can do what we want when we work hard.Whatrsquos a girl to do  will be distributed to schools across the area and copies from the initial print run, funded by Tarmac Cement and Lime, can be requested by emailing kara.bennett@tarmac article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We canrsquot afford to push action further down the road all the time or expect others to be the ones to sort out this mess.ldquoWe want to see the Wales Pension Partnership, the Welsh Assembly, the Welsh Government and all other public body pension funds ditch fossil fuel investments and we will be keeping the pressure up until they do the right thing, both for the planet and for future generations here in Wales and around the world.Previous research by Friends of the Earth found that the eight local authority pension funds in Wales invested over poundbn between them in fossil fuel companies.Last year Monmouthshire Council was the first in Wales to vote to est its pension fund from fossil fuel companies. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Ltd is second most profitable with pre tax figures of £m against a turnover of £.m .

Tangible net worth Tangible net worth is most commonly a calculation of the net worth of a company that excludes any value derived from intangible assets such as s, patents, goodwill and intellectual property.

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
