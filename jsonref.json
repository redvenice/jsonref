This was previously covered by an Interrail ticket.The move was met with criticism yesterday, with fears raised that tourism in cities outside of London will be affected. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said the RDG had been ‘deeply irresponsible’ over the situation.Britain has been part of Interrail since its launch in 1972 and began a trial selling Eurail passes in January.                  Britain has been part of Interrail since its launch in 1972 and began a trial selling Eurail passes in January. Pictured are tweets criticising the move Unlike Interrail, which allows travel across as many as 31 countries for European citizens, Eurail is for tourists from the rest of the world.But following the trial, the RDG favoured its own ‘Britrail’ pass for those travelling to the UK from outside Europe, which includes two-for-one deals on attractions across the country.The Eurail Group subsequently ended Britain’s association with its Interrail and Eurail schemes as it intends to merge the passes.Eurostar trains will not be affected by the move, which comes into force from January next year.This means that tourists on an Interrail pass will be able to travel to London from Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam and vice versa.Rail expert Mark Smith, founder of Seat61.com, said the decision is ‘a backwards step’ as it would put visitors off from going to destinations such as Edinburgh, York and Bath.         A map showing some of the interrail routes around Europe, which are regularly used by backpackers ‘They’ll be encouraged to see London and go back and enjoy their free travel elsewhere,’ he said.‘So it’s bad news for the regions.’ Labour’s Mr McDonald added: ‘We are in the middle of a climate crisis and have just 11 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid catastrophe. We should be making it easier for people to travel between countries by rail, not encouraging flying by making rail travel more expensive and difficult.’For almost 50 years the Interrail scheme has been used as a ‘rite of passage’ by teenagers and young people, allowing them to travel freely across the continent on a single ticket.RDG director of nations and regions Robert Nisbet said: ‘The rail industry boosts British tourism and working together, rail companies are offering the best option for tourists with BritRail, which is recommended by Visit Britain, offers two for one deals on 200 attractions across the country and includes the convenience of mobile tickets.‘Although the Eurail Group has ended our decades-long membership of Interrail since we stopped trialling Eurail passes, British people will feel no difference - they can still buy an Interrail pass, get the Eurostar and travel by train across Europe.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Penguin nervously sidesteps away territorial duck","story":"Share this article Brigitte, from Grathem, Netherlands, said: \u0027I haven\u0027t seen this kind of penguin behavior before.\u0027I was surprised a penguin showed this \u0027human\u0027 behavior - there were more ducks on the beach but with this one, he stood motionless for quite some time before shuffling by. \u0027It looked so funny.

It looks like the wizard has been up to his old tricks, conjuring a gossamer-thin bridge that effortlessly s the chasm, reconnecting the mainland to the ancient ruins of Tintagel Castle for the first time in centuries.The modern-day Merlins take the form of Laurent Ney, a Belgian architect and engineer, and William Matthews, lead designer under Renzo Piano of the Shard skyscraper in London. The pair teamed up to summon this £5m footbridge into being for English Heritage. “We had no magic spells to help us,” says Ney, whose firm has built around 100 bridges across the world, but none in such a challenging location. “It was the first time in my life that I had to design a bridge in a site that was totally inaccessible – and which was expected to disappear into the landscape.”The rugged promontory provided the perfect place for the Cornish kings to build their fortified stronghold in the fifth and sixth centuries, when the headland was connected by a narrow isthmus that has since crumbled into the sea. The end-of-the-earth feeling also helped to fuel all the legends that have swirled around the site since the middle ages, when it was named as the place of King Arthur’s conception, prompting Richard Earl of Cornwall to build his castle there in the 13th century. This made it a tricky place to bring 50 tonnes of steel and 40,000 slate tiles – all of which had to be delivered by helicopter in five-tonne prefabricated chunks and assembled by a crane on a cable stretching right across the gulch.The result is a miraculously slight structure, with polished steel balustrades and diagonal braces that, from a distance, make it shimmer like a spider’s web in the dew. As you get closer, it reveals itself to be two separate structures, each cantilevered out from the cliffs – like a pair of opposing ing boards, not quite meeting in the middle. The gap, say the architects, represents “the transition between present and the past, the known and the unknown, reality and legend” – to be experienced as visitors cross from the mainland to the mysterious ruins.In truth, it was a practical necessity, in order to avoid excessive forces meeting at the centre of the double-arched structure, but it makes for a poetic sight. Daredevils hoping for a risky leap across the ravine will be disappointed, though: the gap is only 4cm wide and the two decks are actually connected by steel cables at either side, somewhat destroying the illusion.There has been a need for a bridge here for a long time. Ever since the 12th-century chronicler Geoffrey of Monmouth spun his seductive Arthurian tales, Tintagel has been inundated with visitors seeking a taste of the magic. Accessibility has never been its strong point. The original land bridge to the island was so slight, wrote Geoffrey, that “three men shall be able to defend against the whole power of the kingdom”. When the poet John Leland visited in 1540, he observed that the only way on to the island was “by longe elme trees layde for a bryge”, while a 1604 map labels “a draw bridge decaid” and shows a man in a red tunic struggling to scale the “verie steepe and craggie” cliffs.He was lucky there was no one with a buggy and screaming toddlers trying to come down in the other direction. As one of English Heritage’s top five attractions, Tintagel Castle sees almost 250,000 visitors a year, with up to 3,000 people a day at the height of summer. Before the new bridge, the only way to the ruins was via steep staircases cut into the cliffs, connected by a small wooden bridge at the bottom.“It was always a nightmare getting people on and off the island,” says Georgia Butters, English Heritage’s head of historic properties in Cornwall. At peak times, there were waits of up to 45 minutes at either side, with school groups and pensioners regularly stranded on the protected promontory with no loos in sight. She says around a third of visitors to the small village of Tintagel didn’t even bother visiting the castle, put off by the long queues and 148 steps.Now, with timed tickets in hand, tourists will be able to flow across the bridge’s elegant 70 metre deck of local slate tiles, which have been packed together on their sides without mortar, creating the effect of walking across a box of After Eight mints. There is a slight rattle as you traverse this mineral mat, and a subtle bounce created by fellow walkers, both of which add a frisson to crossing the 2.5-metre-wide deck 60 metres above the sea. There are nice details – thin slices of quartz embedded in the slate as well as raw oak handrails – giving it a hand-crafted quality in tune with the historic setting, and making it unlike most modern technocratic footbridges.The polished steel balustrade can look a bit too bling as it glints in the sun, and the arrival of this shiny new structure hasn’t been to everyone’s liking. To some, it smacks of the “Disneyfication” of the site in the hands of English Heritage, which has been accused of turning the location into a “cash cow theme park” by campaign group Kernow Matters To Us (Kernow is Cornish for Cornwall). Hackles were raised in 2016 when an 8ft high bronze statue of a cloaked figure with a sword was unveiled on the island, shortly after a relief of Merlin’s face was sculpted into the cliffs below – an unthinkable act in the eyes of some critics, akin to carving the face of a druid into Stonehenge.“The bridge is just the latest English Heritage vanity project,” says Cornish archaeologist and historian Craig Weatherhill. “It continues the cheap and nasty theme park approach, ruining the ambience of the site.” Weatherhill and his fellow campaigners think the focus on Arthurian legend is a distraction from the real history of Tintagel, the seat of the kings of Dumnonia, a powerful empire that stretched across Cornwall and Devon from the 5th to the 7th centuries. The number of amphora fragments found at the site, indicating vast quantities of wine and olive oil brought from across the Mediterranean, far exceeds the number found at sites across the rest of Britain combined, while excavations suggest Tintagel was larger than London in the same period. “What really rankles Cornish people,” adds Weatherhill, “is the fact they’re marketing the site as ‘English’ Heritage, when the English have had nothing to do with it.”Butters defends the accusations of commercialisation, which have been more vocally levelled at English Heritage since it became an independent charity in 2014 and forced to cover its own costs (the bridge was part-funded by a £2.5m donation from Tetra Pak billionaires Hans and Julia Rausing). A family ticket to Tintagel now costs £33.80, while the gift shop sells a Sword in the Stone letter-opener for £40 and a model of the Knights of the Round Table for £120.“We need to make money to look after our heritage,” says Butters. “And it’s very important that we’re not snobbish and elitist about it. We must spark the interest of the next generation in these sites, because if people don’t care about them, they won’t be preserved.”You could argue that there has been a slightly tacky side to Tintagel ever since Tennyson fuelled the Arthurian hype with his Idylls of the King, and the railway arrived at nearby Camelford, spawning such heady visions as the Victorian pile of the Camelot Castle Hotel and the 1930s fantasy of King Arthur’s Great Halls. Amid the surrounding jamboree of legends, the sleek new bridge is a carefully judged arrival."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/341085f9d8ec257dced80f0902f1b8cff3c75e71/0_581_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36323f07568f76c9f3538b9271186805","title":"mark mawston best photograph yoko ono","story":"‘She came on stage with a black silk bag over her head and walked straight into the mic stand. It didn’t ruin anything though. The crowd were in rapturesI took this shot of Yoko Ono 14 years ago, in 2005 at Patti Smith’s Meltdown, the London festival curated by a different musical icon each year. I’ve always been fascinated by Yoko Ono because of the mythos that surrounds her. She’s often referred to as the woman who split up the Beatles, but there’s so much more to her than that.When I saw her on the lineup I was surprised – she seemed an odd choice. But she is indisputably one of the strongest women in the music industry, she has such a unique sound. When I saw her name, I had to go.That festival was one of the best Meltdowns there has ever been, and Ono’s performance was electrifying. I was perched right in front of centre stage and the anticipation was palpable. The audience was full of different people: lifelong fans, Beatles obsessives, a newer avant garde crowd and a load of celebrities too. As we waited I felt like I was in church – the reverence the crowd had for her was overwhelming.The lights went down and a short film was projected on to a silk screen hanging across the stage. It was transfixing. In one scene, a person walks towards the camera, getting closer and closer, and then at a certain point, the figure in the film became real, on stage, in front of us. Yoko had a slit made in the screen which she came through at the very moment that the figure in the projection was the right size, so it looked like art made life. Everyone was completely taken aback.At the time, she was still interested in bagism – a practice she and Lennon engaged in as a way to deinidualise speakers and emphasise their message by wearing a nondescript bag over their heads. So she came out with this black silk bag obscuring her vision, and walked straight into the mic stand. It didn’t ruin anything though. The crowd were in raptures.In a split second when I managed to take my eyes off her, I realised that Sean Lennon, her and John’s son, was standing in the background bathed in red light. It was utterly spooky. He was the absolute spit of his father, wearing the same glasses with long hair – it was like a vision on stage.I was so transfixed that I almost missed this shot. Only when I took my eyes off Sean did I see Yoko directly above me, leaning over the stage with the power and energy you can see in the photo. I had one chance, and I managed to get the shot.The photo made an impact: it was the photograph that got me working with the Rock Archives, countless people have messaged me about it, and I believe Yoko herself bought a copy. But it’s funny, because I don’t necessarily rate it as one of my best. I think that’s a quirk of photographers: the work they really rate isn’t often the one that resonates with people the most.But I think the image speaks to her power. At the time of this performance, she was around 71, and she’s small. But she should never be underestimated: when she speaks, people listen. When she performs, people watch. You can feel her presence. I think it’s what makes her such an icon.Influences: ‘William Claxton, Linda McCartney, Mick Rock, Annie Leibovitz. The first images that made me want to pick up a camera though were shots of reflections in a glass building that my grandfather took in Newcastle.’ High point: ‘Being one of the first music photographers to give a talk at the O2’s British Music Experience along with Jill Furmanovskyand Phillip “Mr Sixties” Townsend. ’Low point: ‘Meeting an out-of-sorts Sean Connery. However, I did walk away with a wonderful piece of advice: “If you’re gonna be schmaartt, be shmaarrttaa” and he’s still a hero of mine.’Top tip: ‘Even if you’re in a crowd in the pit in front of stage, try and do something different. Do what you’re not supposed to and enjoy every moment.’• Nile Rodgers’ Meltdown festival is at the Southbank Centre, London, until 11 August."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f74c714c1051a082c4aa983a5ea097aeb90e4fa/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=78fb84508522a7c3dda3ff0e193e2ca7","title":"life for sale yukio mishima review","story":"“Human life is quite meaningless, and people are just puppets anyway,” says Hanio Yamada, as he sits in a warehouse with three men who want him dead. “What’s the big deal?” The big deal is the first English translation of a piece of engaging pulp fiction, first published in 1968 in Japanese Playboy, by one of the country’s literary greats.Outwardly, Hanio’s life seems enviable: he’s young and handsome, with a cushy copywriting job. But, overwhelmed by visions, he attempts suicide and wakes in a hospital ward to see “a wonderfully free and empty world ahead of him”. He puts an advert in a tabloid offering his life for sale: “Use me as you wish. Discretion guaranteed. Will cause no bother at all.”Interested parties are soon pounding on his door, asking him to sleep with a man’s wife, drink scarab beetle juice, feed a vampire and solve a diplomatic mystery. Classic genre drama ensues: exotic foreigners appear, secret organisations are uncovered, men point guns at Hanio and women leap gratefully into his arms.Mishima was a nationalist who killed himself after his 1970 coup to restore the emperor’s power failed, and here he stares unimpressed at a 1960s Tokyo awash with money and adverts, where manicured streets are overlooked by bland offices and self-indulgent hippies roam. It may be only a footnote in his career, but this surreal tale offers a trenchant critique of a city that has misplaced its soul.• Life for Sale by Yukio Mishima, translated by Stephen Dodd, is published by Penguin Classics (£12.99).

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.“It’s Mark Twain these days,” says voicefrombelgrade, “I’m rereading his short story collection”:Every time I read The Experience Of The McWilliamses With Membranous Croup, Extracts from Adam’s Diary, Eve’s Diary, The Stolen White Elephant... I just love them. Also, I pilfered Tom Sawyer from my late father’s library (all right, I’ll take it back, my mom won’t even know that I took it...) – it’s a masterful Serbian translation from the 1949 (the author is Stanislav Vinaver). It’s relatively rare to find a translation that’s as good as the original, but this one really is, and I just have to revisit it every so often.BaddHamster is “finishing up” The House Of Sleep by Jonathan Coe:Warm, funny, breezily paced (as always with him) and a few interesting thoughts on the nature of sleep. Basically, if you like Coe, you’ll probably enjoy it. I do and I am.And CharlieBing “just finished” Judith Schalansky’s Pocket Atlas of Remote Islands:As a cartographer by training and a sometime graphic artist by trade, I just loved almost every bit of this beautifully designed book ... a minor quibble with the occasional use of yellow text on white pages, but the typography is exquisite, the whole conceit just wonderful.Michael, a retired headmaster grieving for his wife, the victim of a terrorist attack, asks himself the question of who is really responsible for what happened, not the bombers themselves, not the bomb makers, but the ‘bomb-triggerers’ – the politician enriching himself from his time in office. There’s much more to this story than vengeance though the narration soon reveals darker aspects of Michael’s character as he recalls his career. Good’s skill is in the narrator considering himself as a realist struggling with difficult pupils, but coming over to the reader as anything but that, and a cruel authoritarian.As an ex-teacher of 31 years, this is an admirably accurate portrayal of some headteacher’s traits I have seen all too frequently.Reading Isabel Allende’s Daughter Of Fortune has been “an exquisite pleasure” for PatLux:Such a rich historical novel in which I, like one of the main protagonists Tao Chi’en, learned lots. I loved the lyrical evocative prose which stimulated all my senses. One of those books that makes you feel you are on a delightful journey with the characters and evokes laughter and sadness. And it stays with you in the intervals between when you put it down and pick it up again. I will definitely be reading more Allende.MachenBach recommends Augustus Carp, Esq., By Himself: Being the Autobiography of a Really Good Man:A satirical mock-autobiography, published anonymously by Sir Henry Howarth Bashford in 1924. Anthony Burgess singled it out as one of the 20th century’s funniest books, but I would say that it’s consistently amusing, rather than LOL funny. Still, that’s rare enough to be noteworthy. Carp is possessed of a Pooterishly inflated sense of his own (and his father’s) importance, and almost total blindness to his own limitations and motivations. He’s a hilariously sanctimonious self-professed Christian (or “Xtian”), who frequently goes out into the streets to lecture smokers, drinkers and music hall artistes on the evils of their ways, but who seems hypocritically blind to his own acts of bullying, blackmail, and greed. Like a monstrous cross between Pooter and Ignatius J Reilly, his voice is impressively realised, and the irony well sustained. I’m not sure how much real satirical bite it had at the time – it seems rather more 1890s than 1920s in many ways, and the joke does wear a little thin long before he gets his comeuppance, but it’s very well-written (in a pretentiously archaic register) and generally good fun.Finally, Dennis89 suggests we give “serious thought” to reading An Armenian Sketchbook by Vasily Grossman:A 200-page account detailing the writer’s reflections, thoughts and wanderings during his visit to Armenia at the twilight of his life. Justification for the journey is provided by the task of editing a Russian translation of a local Armenian novel though the trip allows Grossman to explore and delve far more deeply into this marginalised and often overlooked country.Faith, patriotism, oppression, comradeship and other such topics are beautifully mused upon in this life-affirming gem of a book.Sounds fantastic. (That’s also an excellent excuse to link to Linda Grant’s fine article on reading Grossman: “It took me three weeks to read it and three weeks to recover from the experience.”)If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

As a fan, I’m waryStephen King fans, gather ye here: our lord and master has written a new ending to The Stand, his story of a post-apocalyptic world decimated by a superflu that he has called a “long tale of dark Christianity”.King wrote the “new coda that won’t be found in the book” for the forthcoming TV adaptation starring James Marsden and Amber Heard CBS’s Julie McNamara told Deadline that “for fans of the book who have wondered what became of the survivors of The Stand, this episode will contain a story that takes us beyond the book to answer those questions.”King himself has tweeted that his script for the final episode is already written, and that it “has been in my mind for 30 years”.But The Stand, in which the scant American survivors of the superflu are drawn towards the saintly Mother Abagail if they’re good, and towards the evil Randall Flagg if they’re bad, already has two endings. The first appeared in the original, 800-page version published in 1978. Set in the 1980s, that version ends as two survivors, Stu and Fran, contemplate the future of humanity.“Do you think … do you think people ever learn anything?” She opened her mouth to speak, hesitated, fell silent. The kerosene lamp flickered. Her eyes seemed very blue. “I don’t know,” she said at last. She seemed unpleased with her answer she struggled to say something more to illuminate her first response and could only say it again: “I don’t know.”It is bleak, but honest. King says in On Writing: “I searched my mind and heart for something else Stu could say, some clarifying statement. I wanted to find it because at that moment, if at no other, Stu was speaking for me. In the end, however, Stu simply repeats what he has already said: I don’t know. It was the best I could do. Sometimes the book gives you answers, but not always, and I didn’t want to leave the readers who had followed me through hundreds of pages with nothing but some empty platitude I didn’t believe myself.”But that version of the novel was missing 400-odd pages, cut because King’s publisher at the time couldn’t physically print such a large manuscript. By 1991, King was with another publisher who could, so an uncut, 1,200-page version set in the 1990s was released, with a new and more ominous coda. This time, Flagg has survived the “hand of God”nuclear explosion, and been transported to an island peopled by a “primitive simple unlettered” people. He starts again.I’ll be honest – I’m wary of whatever happens here. I watched but didn’t love the 1994 mini-series of The Stand, and while I still count King as one of my favourite writers, I haven’t genuinely loved anything he’s written since 2008’s Duma Key. And I wonder how much will change in the journey from book to television. Five years ago, a draft script reportedly had Stu and Flagg engage in a magical, “Akira-like battle on the Las Vegas Strip”. Please Mother Abagail, no.In his introduction to the 1991 version of The Stand, King wrote that “it’s perhaps best for Stu, Larry, Glen, Frannie, Ralph, Tom Cullen, Lloyd and that dark fellow to belong to the reader, who will visualise them through the lens of imagination in a vivid and constantly changing way no camera can duplicate. Films, even the best of them, freeze fiction. That is not necessarily bad … but it is limiting.”For this third new ending, perhaps King has now found the answers he was looking for 30 years ago when wondering what Stu might say. Or maybe CBS will simply spool out the stories of Stu and Fran into the future, revealing whether humanity has one after all – I’d watch that for sure, particularly if Mr M-O-O-N makes an appearance.In the meantime, a reread of The Stand is definitely in order, before this novel – a masterpiece, in my opinion – is frozen, in King’s words, by its adaptation. Who’s with me?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bc8defc2003414dce70c8da580c0856d645d6d4/18_852_5903_3542/master/5903.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5144bcbf96fce80a878a491f32f55d8","title":"british airways it glitch causes disruption for passengers delays","story":"More than 500 flights cancelled or delayed by IT glitch affecting London airports British Airways was facing passenger anger on Wednesday as more than 500 flights were cancelled or delayed as a result of a systems failure.In the latest in a series of operational problems to hit the airline, and the travel plans of tens of thousands with holiday and business plans, London’s Heathrow, Gatwick and City were the airports most affected by the computer failure. BA refused to reveal the number of flights affected but according to Flightstats, which tracks arrivals and departures, by 5.30pm the airline had cancelled 140 flights and a further 370 had been delayed.BA said its latest systems failures affected only the London airports, but the disruption had knock-on effects elsewhere, including at Edinburgh, Glasgow and Belfast and in many European destinations when incoming flights failed to arrive.Customers experienced difficulties checking in online, and queues formed in airport departure areas as the airline moved to manual systems to keep flights operating.Some social media users reported that, on flights that did take off, the food and drink service was affected. Air travel experts said BA may be liable to pay compensation to affected passengers, on top of refunding them the ticket price. Under EU law, some passengers whose flights are cancelled or delayed by two hours or more can be given compensation.The airline said it was offering customers the chance to move bookings to another travel day between 8 and 13 August.When an airline starts cancelling or delaying flights for more than three hours, passengers are entitled to compensation of €250-€600 under EU rules.The cause of the problem has to be under the airline’s control and not an “extraordinary circumstance”. Lack of planesstaff, flight overbooking, a strike by the airline’s staff or an IT failure are all considered to be within the airline’s control – so compensation is payable.Passengers on cancelled short-haul flights – up to 1,500km – are entitled to €250 or £230. For flights of 1,500km-3,500km duration, passengers are entitled to €400 (£370) or €600 (£555) for the longest flights (more than 3,500km).Compensation is also payable in the event that the plane is delayed. The payments are the same but only kick in when the plane has been delayed three hours for short flights or four hours for the longer trips. The delay is calculated against the time the plane was due to arrive.Passengers are also entitled to “assistance” under the EU rules. Short-haul passengers should receive food and water after two hours. Mid-distance passengers get help after three hours, while long-haul passengers receive it after they have been held in the terminal for four hours. If the delay is overnight, passengers should be provided with hotel accommodation but this often does not happen. This assistance should be provided irrespective of whether the delay is the airline’s fault.The airlines have fought these compensation rules since they were introduced and passengers have had to go to court to get their money. The airlines frequently blame delays on events outside their control. Freak weather events, or a last- minute strike by air traffic controllers are deemed to be outside their control. A lack of planes or staff is not.The rules only apply to EU-based airlines or all flights that start in the EU on non-EU based carriers. What will happen post-Brexit is not yet clear.\u0026nbspMiles BrignallAbout half of the BA flights scheduled to depart from Heathrow’s Terminal 5 between 9.30am and midday were cancelled or delayed, according to the airport’s website.It was not until 4pm that BA said it had resolved its computer problems. In a statement, the airline said: “We apologise to all our customers caught up in the disruption, and appreciate how frustrating their experience has been. Our teams have been working tirelessly to get the vast majority of customers on their way, with most of our flights departing.”It added: “Our flights are returning to normal. However, there may be some knock-on operational disruption.” The airline was still advising passengers to check for flight information on its website before travelling to the airport.The computer failure is the latest in a series of operational problems to hit the airline in the busy holiday season.Earlier this week, BA flights were among a total of 177 flights cancelled and then reinstated because of threatened industrial action by Heathrow staff.The strikes, originally due to be begin at midnight on Monday, were suspended to allow for further talks between union and airport officials.If BA pilots go ahead with strikes, the likely disruption could coincide with five days of walkouts announced late on Wednesday by Ryanair pilots who are members of the Balpa union.Balpa said that “decades of Ryanair refusing to deal with unions” had led to members voting for a 48-hour strike beginning on 22 August and a 72-hour strike from 2 September.“No pilot wants to spoil the public’s travel plans but at the moment it seems we have no choice,” said Balpa’s general secretary, Brian Strutton.A third strike action, by Heathrow ground staff, could still go ahead on 22 and 23 August unless talks result in a compromise.BA had other problems this week after 200 people had to be evacuated from a British Airways flight after smoke poured into the cabin minutes before it was due to land in Valencia. The crew used oxygen masks as they helped passengers on to the evacuation chutes.BA has previously been hit by severe computer system failures that have left passengers stranded around the world.In 2017, over a May bank holiday weekend, 75,000 passengers were stranded when the airline was forced to cancel more than 700 flights over three days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27f3b1f6cabced82f340841cf6f543dc823ea9e6/0_306_4585_2751/master/4585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ba572e05c1491b41eef9f4c2a411101","title":"polite society why are british cities banning swearing pspo","story":"Councils say bans help tackle anti-social behaviour. But critics argue restrictions are a heavy-handed curb on freedom of expressionWhen Salford ditched its ban on swearing last week, Mark Thomas’s reaction was apt. “Hoo fucking ray” the comedian tweeted, shortly followed by a “Whoo- fucking -hooo”.Introduced by the city council in 2016, the public spaces protection order (PSPO) outlawed “foul and abusive” language in Salford Quays, the former site of the Manchester Docks that has now been transformed by upscale developments. Offenders faced an on-the-spot fine, which could increase to £1,000.The order immediately alarmed critics and free speech campaigners. What, after all, constituted foul language? Would a “bloody hell” get you into trouble? Could you be fined for a “damn”?Thomas was due to perform at the Lowry theatre when the order came down in 2016, and has been known to “drag audiences through the streets” on post-gig demos. “In the interests of remaining within the law, I sent Salford City Council a list of words I’m considering using, and asking which are permissible and which are not,” he wrote at the time. “The list runs to 425 words, in alphabetical order, starting with ‘arse’, ending with ‘winnit’ and including the term ‘cat twinky’. I have no idea what that last one means but thought we should check nonetheless.”Though Salford’s citizens are now free once again to turn the air blue, many cities, towns and villages across England now fine cursing. A freedom of information request by the Manifesto Club, a campaigning group that “challenges the hyper-regulation of public spaces”, revealed that between August 2017 and January 2019, 15 councils banned swearing or foul language.Previous FOIs by the Manifesto Club, for the period November 2014 and June 2017, list other local authorities that have introduced orders banning swearing – some of which have now expired.The PSPOs were introduced by the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 to tackle anti-social behaviour in public places. The civil rights organisation Liberty argues they are being used as a heavy-handed curb on freedom of expression.“PSPOs are dangerously broad powers that local councils are systematically misusing,” said Lara ten Caten, a lawyer at Liberty. “Whether to criminalise rough sleepers or to restrict free speech, these blunt powers are being used with little accountability, often against vulnerable people.“We have even heard from people with mental health issues who are particularly distressed at the prospect that they might inadvertently breach a swearing ban in their area, and feel that large parts of their local communities are closed to them because these bans are so vague that they make it impossible to know whether you might be punished just for speaking.”Some councils argue that crackdowns on iniduals who swear and thereby cause a nuisance are supported by the public, particularly if those iniduals are persistently making life a misery for residents. The orders often state foul language is prohibited when it causes “harassment, alarm or distress”.“This group are regularly visited by the council and offered help in relation to substance dependency and other issues and the council also uses other tools including warning letters and the use of community protection legislation to support safety and wellbeing in the wider community.”Still, “causing annoyance” arguably sets the bar pretty low, and in theory gives enforcement officers broad powers to police language.

I had a big one last Saturday at the cricket at Edgbaston, but I’ll come to that shortly. But first, here’s the kind of thing I mean. When I was about 17, there was standing room only on the local train into Birmingham. A woman said to her little boy: “Stand up, so this man can sit down.”Never mind whatever I’d done at school, or hadn’t done with girls, or anything my family or friends had said to me: this was the instant I knew I was no longer a boy I was a man.At that age, mainly because I was desperate to get served in pubs, I always wanted to look older. It was just awful to be taken for a 15-year-old when you were knocking on the door of the legal drinking age. Then, suddenly, it’s the other way round. I was 32 and about to become a father when another prospective father I was chatting to in the hospital took me for 25. I was thrilled, but knew then that the want-to-look-older phase of my life was gone, never to return.More shockingly, when I was in my 20s, my whole family was at a schoolfriend’s wedding in Brighton. I was chatting to the new girlfriend of a mate of ours called Marcus. She didn’t know many people there. Slightly running out of conversation, I asked her where Marcus was. “He’s over there, chatting to some old guy,” she said. I looked over and there was Marcus talking to my dad. My blood ran cold Dad was indeed an old guy. I’d never noticed before.And at this very moment, as I write this, my blood is running cold again, because I’ve just worked out that my dad then was the same age that I am now. Ergo, I am an old guy. Another ghastly rubicon crossed there thanks for being with me at this traumatic moment.Oh yes, I nearly forgot – a man who I think looked not much younger than me stood up for me on the tube the other day. Nice gesture from the chap I really wish he hadn’t made it.And so on to last Saturday’s kick in the Niagaras at the cricket. The first time I heard another real horror word in the advancing-years lexicon was seven years ago, when I was 45. I was consulting London’s leading foot surgeon about a problem I had with my achilles tendon. He hailed from Swansea. When I told him how much I love that part of the world, he said: “Oh, are you going to retire there?” Huh? It wasn’t just my achilles throbbing when I left his office.And so to Edgbaston, where I was with several medics, one of whom I’ve known man and boy since we started primary school in 1971. Rhey spent the day tossing the R-word around as casually as fielders returning the ball to the bowler. I implored them to stop it was distressing. Panicking now, I worked out I may have only 15 Ashes series left in my life. Mind you, the way this Test turned out, that might be no bad thing.• Adrian Chiles is a writer, broadcaster and  columnist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0de8d4cf9e6d50e81f661ab0959b20ec4c691a2/0_0_1062_637/master/1062.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a1723b78c85dde5f10996d077378628","title":"sequins and stardom the fashion legacy of the supremes","story":"From homemade dresses to glittering gowns, Motown’s most successful act became well known for their iconic stage attire.

Can Mauricio Pochettino’s side finally make the breakthrough? writers’ predicted position: 3rd (NB: this is not necessarily Ed Aarons’ prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 16-1Even the most optimistic of Tottenham supporters would have struggled to predict the events of last season this time last year. Mauricio Pochettino’s side went into the campaign as the first club not to make a summer signing since the introduction of the transfer window 16 years ago but with the mouthwatering prospect of playing in front of more than 62,000 fans at their brand king new home.That they had to wait until the meeting with Crystal Palace in April to experience the £850m Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, having already played 15 of their 19 home matches in the Premier League at Wembley, underlines the achievement of maintaining a run of finishing in the top four that now stretches back to 2016. Yet the real drama last season was, of course, reserved for the Champions League and the miraculous run to the final in Madrid that featured the astonishing comeback victory over Ajax in the away leg in Amsterdam.Pochettino has admitted he has struggled to come to terms with their defeat against Liverpool, having spent the first week following the final in his house in Barcelona not wanting to go outside. “I tried to play golf after a few days — not to play, to swing,” he said last week. “I was focused with my son to try to hit the ball perfectly but it was impossible. My family tried to lift me but they were in the same situation as me. Then I started to move on.”The healing process was no doubt aided by the purchase of the France midfielder Tanguy Ndombele from Lyon for a club record £55m plus add-ons at the start of July, when it seemed that the chairman, Daniel Levy, had finally relented to his manager’s constant requests for quality additions to his playing staff, having also eschewed the opportunity to do so in the January window. But while the Leeds winger Jack Clarke will stay with the Championship club on loan this season after being purchased from them for £11m, Pochettino’s recent jibe that the club should consider changing his job title back to head coach - a position the Argentinian has not held since being upgraded in 2016 - after admitting he was “not in charge” hinted at his burning frustration.Top of the list has been finding a buyer for Christian Eriksen to enable the purchase of Giovani Lo Celso of Real Betis or Sporting’s Bruno Fernandes in a revamped midfield with Ndombele. The Dane has made no secret of his desire to seek “a new challenge” but, with Levy having in effect scared off interested clubs with a price-tag in excess of £80m for a player now with less than 11 months left on his contract, both parties have been left in limbo.Lo Celso looks as if he may now be on his way after the club agreed a £55m fee, with the attempt to sign Paulo Dybala a clear indication of Pochettino’s ambition. The expected arrival of Fulham’s Ryan Sessegnon will also go some way to helping to replace the two full-backs who started the Champions League final two months ago. Kieran Trippier was sold to Atlético Madrid but Danny Rose is back in the picture having previously been left at home for their trip to Asia to “explore prospective opportunities with other clubs”.With only Serge Aurier, Kyle Walker-Peters and Juan Foyth - carried off against Bayern - competing for the right-back berth, their manager may attempt to play with a more solid back four next season rather than buccaneering full-backs à la Liverpool and Manchester City. It would be a risky tactic given the success he has had alternating between 3-4-3 and 4-3-3 over the last 18 months, although it is representative of the faith he has in his potentially dynamic midfield. With Ndombele providing the line breaks and incisive passing that have been missing since Mousa Dembélé departed for China in January and Harry Winks always a calming presence on the ball, the addition of the elegant Lo Celso would certainly be worth watching.Having somehow persuaded the Mexican club Monterrey to pay around £6m for the Dutch misfit Vincent Janssen and should Fernando Llorente rejoin on reduced terms, then Spurs will feel they have ample cover in attack, with a fit-again Erik Lamela keen to make an impact after missing much of last season through injury. Finding a regular spot for the hat-trick hero of Amsterdam will be a concern for Pochettino, who admitted it was a “painful” decision to leave Lucas Moura out of the starting lineup against Liverpool because Harry Kane was back from injury.With England’s captain, Moura and the effervescent Son Heung-min providing the goals, Tottenham look well equipped at least to match their achievements of the last four seasons. But are they capable of finally winning something? Prioritising the Premier League and Champions League over the domestic Cup competitions is Pochettino’s prerogative but, if he can resolve some of the issues with the squad, then there is every chance he could hit the jackpot soon.Playing at home for a whole season in such a spectacular stadium should certainly be an advantage – Spurs won 17 of their 19 matches in the last season at White Hart Lane in 2016-17, drawing the other two – as could the experience of coming so close to glory. Liverpool’s players harnessed the disappointment of their Champions League defeat in 2018 to go one better 12 months later and Pochettino will hoping that that experience can have the same galvanising effect on his players.Shoring up a defence that conceded 39 goals, 13 more than they managed finishing second in 2016-17, will be crucial to their Premier League ambitions. Spurs also lost 13 games last season, although seven of those occurred once the Champions League knockout stages were underway and their attention was perhaps elsewhere. But with their rivals for the title currently streets ahead in terms of consistency and squad size, it is hard to see Tottenham sustaining a title challenge to the very end unless they have a significant rub of the green.A dazzling end to the transfer window followed by a strong start may change all that, with the biggest trophy of them all certainly not out of the question either after last season’s exploits in the Champions League. But ensuring he can retain the services of Pochettino for the long term should remain Levy’s highest priority."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb2d27886a1c1f2e04a91a7f6da2d772971bec3b/0_13_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc8f12e3020d0da3400f8b87c0587fac","title":"guardian broke even last year parent company confirms","story":"Growing digital revenues and reader contributions help  News \u0026amp Media to operational profit of £800,000’s parent company has confirmed it hit its financial break-even target, as revenue rose to £224.5m in the last financial year, aided by growth in digital revenues and increased contributions from readers. Media Group confirmed preliminary figures showing that its main  News \u0026amp Media subsidiary recorded an operational profit of £800,000 for the first time in many years. Media Group is owned by the not-for-profit Scott Trust, which has an endowment of £1bn built up over many years through past investments in companies such as AutoTrader. The return on this investment allows  Media Group to subsidise its news operations by up to £30m a year and remain sustainable while guaranteeing its independence.Although income from the ’s print operations remains a very significant part of the business, largely due to the cover price paid by readers, the majority of the company’s income now comes from its digital operations. Media Group’s chief executive, David Pemsel, said: “Achieving a third successive year of revenue growth and meeting our break-even target for GNM is a tribute to everyone within our organisation. GNM has been transformed in the last three years into a more reader-funded, more digital and more international business.”In order to hit its financial targets and reduce costs, the accounts show  Media Group paid out £4.3m in redundancy payments to staff in the last financial year. This was aided by a voluntary redundancy scheme under which the total headcount fell from 1,475 to 1,437 across editorial, sales, and support isions.Last year  Media Group took a financial hit relating to the closure of its own printing sites as part of the decision to switch to a tabloid format and outsource production of the physical paper, enabling it to reduce costs in the long term."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3886c13a6f8f71e355678510e467aabd5bf77369/0_11_2024_1214/master/2024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02b9f8fb30671c5d0ead7142376ae555","title":"labour prefers election to unity government to stop hard brexit","story":"Shadow chancellor sees Corbyn-led government or general election as pathways to stop hard BrexitJohn McDonnell has doubled down on his pledge that Labour would reject a government of national unity and instead would push for Jeremy Corbyn to form a government or for a general election, in a move that appeared to stymie plans being prepared by Tory rebels.McDonnell told audience at an Edinburgh festival fringe event that it would be unsustainable for Boris Johnson to remain as prime minister if he no longer had a Commons majority.McDonnell said he expected Labour to win that confidence vote, and said Labour would try to force Johnson out by attempting to form a caretaker government with the support of other opposition parties and rebel Conservative MPs.Ruling out any deals with the Liberal Democrats or the Scottish National party, McDonnell said the only guarantee to other opposition parties would be to block a no-deal Brexit and organise a fresh EU referendum.McDonnell also rejected claims over the weekend by Johnson’s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, that it was solely in the prime minister’s gift to decide whether and when to hold a general election. Johnson’s allies have suggested he would delay that election until after he had forced through a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.“We then have two weeks in which the existing prime minister or anybody else can determine whether they can secure a majority in parliament for a government,” McDonnell said.“That’s when we’ll be saying Labour can form a majority government and we expect others to come behind us to do that, so it becomes a caretaker government. And part of that will be to say: yes, we will block a no deal and go back to the country in a referendum.“So that’s the choice that other parties and other MPs will have. Will they support Labour going into government under Jeremy Corbyn to prevent a no deal. I think there will be a majority government.”If Johnson refused to quit and Labour was unable to form that caretaker government, there could then be a second no confidence motion 14 days after the first where Labour would try to force a general election, McDonnell added.“Then if necessary there’s a second no-confidence motion if we have to use it. Cummings got it wrong, and other commentators have made it clear, actually that second no-confidence motion will be the one which if necessary we will use to force a general election. No prime minister can sustain themselves in office when they no longer have a majority in the House of Commons.”Both McDonnell, and the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said on Tuesday night they would reject any opportunity to form a cross-party unity government led by anyone other than Corbyn.Long-Bailey told Channel 4 News the party “wouldn’t countenance a national government of unity” to deal with Brexit.“What we don’t want is a national unity government that gives Boris some sort of get out of jail free card,” she said.Several Labour MPs made clear overnight they would be prepared to join cross-party efforts to stop a no-deal Brexit. “The damage caused by this reckless hard Brexit will be felt for generations, it goes beyond party politics,” the Cardiff North MP, Anna McMorrin, tweeted. “I will work with any MP from any party to stop no deal, bring about a public vote and campaign for remain.”McDonnell also caused friction with Scottish Labour on Tuesday during his interview in Edinburgh by appearing to cautiously back the prospect of a second independence referendum, comments that have fuelled speculation Labour would hope to broker a pact with the SNP.Asked about a future referendum, McDonnell said: “We would not block something like that. We would let the Scottish people decide. That’s democracy.”McDonnell admitted Labour was split on the issue, but implied the UK leadership agreed. “There are other views within the party, but that’s our view,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c5c450bf2f52695598b2a456397c7b6860e0df8/232_114_2433_1461/master/2433.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4dccadcda955ec469c9686547f9c065f","title":"the ashes five things england bounce back","story":"Joe Root’s England have made a habit of losing one Test in a series. In his collection of home results Root has a 4-1, a 3-1, a 2-1, a 1-1 and now a 0-1. The only visiting team not to get a Test off him are Ireland, who came close. The good news for the England fan, forever fretful, is that each of these home defeats has been followed by a victory.England just need to do what they did last year, after losing the first Test of the summer to Pakistan: make three changes, bowl well, bat solidly, win comfortably. Now, as then, the second Test is one they cannot afford to lose. The difference is the extra pressure that comes with the Ashes – but England’s World Cup stars have already played four must-win matches this summer, under immense pressure, and won the lot.Three months in, Jofra Archer is already having a very interesting international career. He started the World Cup as a novice and ended it as England’s spearhead with 20 wickets. He then became perhaps the first England cricketer ever to be rested from a Test before he had played one. At Edgbaston Root and Trevor Bayliss erred on the side of caution by leaving Archer out when he was considered fit by Jason Gillespie, his coach at Sussex and fellow member of the fast bowlers’ union. Asked to prove his fitness by playing for Sussex 2nds, Archer promptly turned into Superman, taking six wickets and making a hundred in the same day.He is now a near-certainty for Lord’s, where he needs to treat the Australians not as he did when he last faced them there (one for 56), but as he did when they met again at Edgbaston in the World Cup semi-final (two for 32). Ideally he will do to them what Steve Harmison famously did at Lord’s in 2005 and leave a few dents in their helmets, not to mention their self-esteem.Ed Smith, England’s chief selector, sees it as his job to give the captain and coach options for the final XI. At Edgbaston he may have given them too many: a squad of 14, containing seven seamers. Root and Bayliss were like children in an ice-cream parlour, spurning all the sharp flavours – Archer’s polished pace, Olly Stone’s raw power, Sam Curran’s left-arm swing – in favour of vanilla, mid-80s right-armers. The seam attack of Jimmy Anderson, Stuart Broad, Chris Woakes and Ben Stokes had lost their previous two home Tests as a unit (against India at Trent Bridge last year and West Indies at Headingley 2017) and duly added a third, though they could not be blamed for Anderson’s injury.Smith may well decide to get tough, drop Moeen Ali and Joe Denly, and hand Root and Bayliss a squad of only 12. The first XI almost pick themselves: Burns, Roy, Root, Stokes (bowling less because batting at four), Buttler, Bairstow, Curran, Woakes, Archer, Broad, Leach. With Stone pulling up lame, the spare seamer can be Toby Roland-Jones, who knows the Lord’s slope, made a sparkling start to his Test career in 2017 and is now taking five-fors again after a serious injury.One minute Jos Buttler was England’s man for all seasons the next he was demoted to allow Stokes to resume the Test vice-captaincy. This was baffling, as Buttler had done nothing wrong and Stokes, for all his strengths, had unmistakably let the team down with the Bristol incident. If the argument was that Stokes had shown leadership in the World Cup final, well, Buttler had too. Root compounded the error at Edgbaston by shifting Buttler to short-leg, so that England’s best cricket brain, after Eoin Morgan, was no longer part of the conversation in the slips. It surely makes more sense to stick Rory Burns at boot hill and get Buttler back into the engine room.For his part Buttler has to make some runs. He managed 5 and 1 in the first Test, joining Bairstow and Moeen in the melancholy club of gifted strokemakers who have yet to reach double figures in a Test this summer. Between them, they’ve batted ten times and made 33 all out. Buttler, since his recall in May 2018, remains second only to Root for Test runs and top of the class for Test fifties (nine, to Root’s six), and he recovered from an equally poor start last year. But if he and Bairstow flop again, one of them will surely give way to Ben Foakes, who brings more glue.After the Lord’s Test against Ireland Root complained about the pitch being “substandard”. It was certainly a green top and Root was right to feel that the game “wasn’t even close to a fair contest” between bat and ball. Saying so in public seemed hard on the MCC’s new groundsman, Karl McDermott, and also uncharacteristic of Root – who may now be kicking himself, as a piece of green unpleasant land is exactly what he could do with to see off Steve Smith.On a flat pitch Smith is Bradman revisited but, on something more spicy, he is as wobbly as the next man. At Edgbaston and Trent Bridge in 2015 he made 7, 8, 6 and 5, falling to Steven Finn (twice) and Broad (also twice), thanks to three nicks and a slice. There is a Barmy Army chant in there somewhere."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81be6ffad944df1fa2a9c898725f379609c7daea/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=898fbbc56906b3dc8fcbdac32380b053","title":"parakeet review punk eco musical roundabout summerhall edinburgh","story":"Roundabout @ Summerhall, EdinburghBrigitte Aphrodite and Quiet Boy’s colourful show follows a trio of teens in Margate who form a punk band and campaign to save a treePlanting saplings has been proposed as part of a DIY solution to the climate crisis, for those of us who can’t approve legislation (about a trillion new trees should do it). So what direct action can be taken when councils lop down precious trees? That’s one of the questions posed by Parakeet, an eco-musical of small scale but mighty power, which finds a perfect home in Paines Plough’s intimate Roundabout venue.Written by Brigitte Aphrodite with music by Gaz Tomlinson, AKA Quiet Boy, it’s as colourful in its approach to complex material as their 2015 show about depression, My Beautiful Black Dog. Parakeet also asks how theatre can play a role in sustainability. And, in a show fizzing with youth, one other question stands out: if 16-year-olds can legally become company directors and have sex, why on earth can’t they vote?Michelle Tiwo is immediately compelling as Girl, an otherwise unnamed teenager uprooted from London to Margate, where the landscapes show a “sky that can’t be denied”. As Girl struggles with coming out to her mother, and deals with her mum’s new geezer boyfriend, the only comfort she finds is in spotting the rose-ringed parakeets that appear as magically and mysteriously in Thanet as they do in the capital. One theory, posed in the show, is that they represent the spirit of Jimi Hendrix, who released a pair in London. (Others credit Shepperton Studios’ 1951 production of The African Queen with the south-east’s parakeet population.)When Girl meets Dust (Isabel Oliver), who was raised in Margate, and Tam (Lula Mebrahtu), an Eritrean refugee, the trio form a punk group. But these punks are about empathy as much as anarchy and they rally to save a tree that is home to nesting parakeets and due to be felled.The play’s exotic-bird metaphors stand out like the bright green hair of Aphrodite and Quiet Boy, who share the stage with the three actors. The parakeets are vilified, we’re told, for drowning out the voices of native British birds. This tale of fitting in and speaking up treads familiar ground and lacks depth of characterisation, but Laura Keefe’s production and Aphrodite’s script have an appealingly raggedy quality that matches punk’s DIY spirit. It also complements Alex Noble’s patchwork, birdlike costumes, made using materials sourced from a charity that collects unwanted clothing. And when these punks sing, the show soars with an energy you could only dream of harnessing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd45fbfafecdf9c0289444b1ea9b57d73c7be951/0_154_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b8f5831b5c1d09cddf3dcf69de525d1","title":"amazon kindle oasis 2019 review most paper like reader frontlight","story":"Luxury model has colour-changing frontlight that gets warmer as the sun setsAmazon’s most expensive, luxury e-reader, the Kindle Oasis, has taken a leaf out of the modern smartphone’s book for 2019 with a colour adjustable light that gets warmer as the sun sets.It’s a small thing that makes quite a difference to the reading experience, which is just as well as the rest of the £230 Oasis is basically the same as it was two years ago.That’s not a bad thing, of course, as the 2017 Kindle Oasis provided the indulgent experience required for a luxury single-use product. As such, the new Kindle Oasis has the same aluminium body, asymmetrical design, flush screen and page turn buttons as the previous version. It’s actually 6g lighter than the old model, and 0.1mm thicker, not that you’d notice.The buttons are just as responsive, and for many they will be the reason to buy it, as page-turn buttons are simply better than just a touchscreen when reading. The screen is also as good and responsive as e-ink displays currently get. The 7in display, about the size of a small paperback, is crisp and a delight to read. The 25-LED frontlight is even across the whole page with auto-brightness or manual control.The warm light function moves from brilliant white to a warm yellow over 24 gradations. It’s very similar to the white ambience smart bulbs available from Hue and others that shift in tone of white for less clinical lighting when needed.Like a smartphone you can set it to gradually shift to a warmer white as the sun sets removing blue light to aid with sleep. But some might prefer to have a warmer light all the time. Set to between 12 and 19 on the sliding scale, it matched the colour of a traditional paperback page, which is a game-changer for those looking to replicate the feeling of reading paper as much as possible. A yellow-tinted page appears slightly friendlier than clinical white.The new Oasis is water resistant to IPX8 standards, which means it’ll survive up to 60 minutes at depths of 2m in water. Accidental dunks in the bath or pool should be fine.Despite it being 2019, the Oasis still has a microUSB charging socket (the one typically used on older, cheaper smartphones). Given smartphones, laptops, tablets and Apple are standardising around USB-C charging, having a microUSB socket means you might have to carry a dedicated Kindle cable in the future.Luckily the battery life is excellent. Amazon rates it for six weeks of 30 minutes of reading a day at brightness level 13 set to airplane mode, which works out at 15 hours of reading. In reality, the Oasis lasted long enough for me to get through the equivalent of two 300-page books at a fairly slow reading pace with a mixture of brightness levels and 4G on and off to sync progress.Charging took the best part of three hours with a 5W USB charger, or slightly faster with something more powerful.While the Oasis is well made, with no overly sharp edges and a solid-feeling aluminium frame, the flush screen feels vulnerable. You’ll need some sort of case for it, which is where Amazon has made a backwards step.The 2017 Oasis had magnets on the back allowing a case to snap into place against the thin part, slotting into the groove of the aluminium body. It would then close over the screen, turning on or off the screen as you open it like a book, but also being able to be easily removed. This meant you could easily read the Oasis in its best, balanced and ergonomic state: naked.While Amazon sells cases that do something similar, they cover the entire of the back, clipping in around the edges, which makes them slightly harder to remove for the best reading experience. They are at least attractive, with the premium leather case providing the supple and sumptuous finish of a really expensive notebook - something that was a key selling point for the first generation Kindle Oasis from 2016.Amazon’s Kindle software still nails the mechanics of actually reading a book. There are plenty of customisation options for formatting, including nine fonts, a sliding scale of font size, differing levels of boldness, page spacing, margins and alignment adjustment and new themes, which roll all the settings together into one-tap options. You can even create your own themes and change the size of font on the fly with a pinch-to-zoom on the screen.Amazon’s dictionary, Wikipedia and X-Ray look-up system continues to be excellent for figuring out unfamiliar words, concepts or characters. The quick setting panel makes getting to brightness controls easy, while integrated Goodreads, Audible for audio books and the Kindle store make finding and downloading your next book easy. Syncing locations between audiobooks and ebooks is remarkably good if you have both.The only weakness is the organisation of your library on the home screen, which makes if difficult to find the next in a series of books if you’ve bought a lot. There doesn’t seem to be a way to list something like Ian Rankin’s Rebus series by book order. Still, the search works well enough if you know what you’re looking after.Amazon hasn’t changed much for the latest edition of the Kindle Oasis. Side-by-side they are identical on the outside. But what looks to be a small change – the ability to shift the colour of the frontlight from cold to warm white – makes a surprising amount of difference to the reading experience.The warmer tones of white can match the colour of paper novels, not just the brilliant white of printer paper, and ease strain on your eyes as the sun sinks below the horizon. This is the best e-ink screen going, in the most sumptuous of e-readers.But not every change is good. The loss of the magnetic cases means it’s more difficult to use the Oasis in its purest, most balanced form without anything attached to it. Amazon’s premium leather case is particularly nice, but given I’d want a case just to protect the screen I’d be more inclined to find a slip case or similar.It’s also still difficult to justify spending twice as much on an e-reader over the excellent £120 Kindle Paperwhite, or even the great new £70 basic Kindle. And £230 is really not that far away from the cost of an iPad.But in the era of constant distractions by notifications and the hubbub of modern life, the Oasis is the luxury antidote to overload. It only does one thing, but it does it better than anything else.Pros: long battery life, light, easy to hold, excellent screen, auto-brightness and colour frontlight, great page-turn buttons, luxurious feel, Audible integration, water resistantCons: expensive, cover not included, no magnetic covers, no support for third-party audiobooks, no headphones socket, microUSB This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

What can she do?My external USB hard drive, with 11,000 photos from Windows 7, isn’t recognised by Windows 10. How do I transfer them to Windows 10 for future safekeeping? JakiThe Universal Serial Bus (USB) connects billions of keyboards, mice, joysticks, printers, external hard drives and other peripherals to roughly 1.5bn personal computers, and more than 3bn mobile phones use the smaller Micro USB and newer USB-C versions. It generally works pretty well but most people have probably suffered from a USB device failing or not being recognised.Lots of things can go wrong. The port, the connecting cable, the power supply and the external hard drive (EHD) can all suffer from physical andor electrical faults.Some external hard drives draw their power from the USB port and they may not get enough. This can be a problem if the PC’s motherboard does not supply enough power to the USB port you are using or if the drive is plugged into a non-powered hub. EHDs that have their own power supplies tend to work more reliably.USB cables can fail after prolonged use, though this is more likely to happen to the Micro USB cables used with mobile phones. External hard drive cables rarely fail unless they get the same sort of abuse. However, if you have two devices that use the same type of cable, you can swap them over to see if that solves the problem.Alternatively, it could be a software problem. For example, it could be the lack of a suitable driver, a corrupted driver or a conflict with another USB device.If you do not have a backup and cannot get the drive to work, it may be worth rolling back to Windows 7 and making a backup before reinstalling Windows 10 – or enlisting the help of a friend who is still running Windows 7.You should never lose data because an external USB hard drive fails. Ideally, you should have at least three copies of your photos stored on different media and at least one should be kept in a different place. Schofield’s Second Law of Computing states that data doesn’t really exist unless you have at least two copies of it.You can back up your photos to thumb drives, SD cards, optical discs (CD, DVD, Blu-ray), external hard drives, a local network server or an online service. These include Amazon Photos, Apple’s iCloud, Microsoft OneDrive, Google One and third-party services such as pCloud and Mega.NZ. See my recent answer to “Where’s the cheapest place to store 500GB of data online?”The major hard drive manufacturers have the most experience in debugging hard drive problems and some have free software to help. The leading examples include WD’s Data Lifeguard Diagnostics and Seagate’s SeaTools for Windows. You may already have one installed. If not, check your EHD manufacturer’s website for a tool that could find and fix your missing drive.Most USB failures are glitches. Often, if a device is not recognised by one port, it will work when plugged into a different port or a different PC. If not, the traditional approach – basically, turning your PC off and on again – often works.First, unplug the EHD, unplug it from the mains and unplug and straighten the data cable. Second, restart your PC and wait for two minutes (because Windows 10 keeps loading things in the background even after it claims to be ready for use). Third, plug the connecting cable into the EHD, making sure it is firmly seated. Finally, plug the EHD back into the mains, turn it on (if it has a manual switch) and plug the USB cable back into the PC. With luck, either the PC will recognise the external drive or discover it as a new device and install it with a suitable driver.Turning a PC off and on does not work as well as it used to because of Windows 10’s Fast Startup system. Ideally, we want the PC to forget everything and make a fresh start. With Fast Startup, Windows 10 stores core parts of memory, including the drivers, in a hidden file called hiberfil.sys and just reloads this file when you turn it back on. You could temporarily disable Fast Startup but I’d just move on to the next step.If a reboot doesn’t make Windows renew its USB drivers, you can do it manually. With the EHD plugged in, go to the Start menu and type or paste the words “Device Manager” into the search box, then run the app that comes up. Next, click the arrow (\u0026gt) next to “Disk drives” in the Device Manager program to see a list of the drives that your PC knows about. Look for the drive that is not being recognised. It should be obvious from its name, which might be something like “WD Ext HDD 1021 USB Device” or “WD MyBook” or “Seagate Expansion Desk”, or whatever.Right-click on your EHD and select “Uninstall device” from the pop-up menu. When that has finished, unplug the USB cable.Wait a minute, then plug the USB cable back in. Windows should see the drive and install a driver. Your EHD should then appear in the “This PC” section of Windows 10’s File Explorer.If this doesn’t work, use the Settings app to run Windows Update, restart your PC and try again. Windows Update delivers new drivers and software patches when they become available.Some – usually obscure – USB peripherals use special drivers that you can only download from the manufacturer’s website. If Windows hasn’t found the best driver, it might be worth looking for one. If you find one, follow the same procedure but select “Update driver” from the menu.In passing, users who have no problems with external drives can still use Device Manager. The default setting for USB drives allows their quick removal. This reduces the risk of data corruption when users unplug drives without thinking. Select “Properties” from the pop-up menu, go to the “Policies” tab and change the default to enable write caching in Windows. This improves performance but you must use the “Safely Remove Hardware” option before unplugging devices.USB ports are handled by USB host controllers. To see them, click the arrow next to “Universal Serial Bus controllers”, which will be at or near the bottom of the alphabetical list in Device Manager. As before, right-click each host controller and select Uninstall. Once you have finished, restart your PC. Windows will automatically reinstall the USB host controllers with clean, fresh versions.Beyond this, there is not much you can do. If a PC has serious problems, you could always reinstall the BIOS firmware and update the motherboard’s chipset drivers. The latest versions should be available from the PC or motherboard manufacturer’s website. However, non-technical users should never have to do this type of thing unless prompted.For example, you may have done a firmware update last year because most big PC suppliers rolled out fixes for the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities covered in an earlier answer. But it shouldn’t be necessary for a simple problem like a USB drive not being recognised.All hard drives fail, typically after five or more years but sometimes after a few months. This is why we need backups. Sometimes EHDs fail but the drive still works. If you don’t have a backup and cannot afford a professional data recovery service, this is a last resort.Research your EHD online to find out how big the drive is (2.5 inch or 3.5 inch) and the type of drive (usually SATA), so you can buy the correct enclosure. Plastic enclosures are cheap and mostly good enough. Metal enclosures with built-in fans are better for cooling a hard drive that is in constant use and making it last longer.Have you got a question?

Insiders warn that modelling can leave minors vulnerable to physical abuse, 12-hour-days and unrelenting pressureby Greg BakerAFPGetty Images. Co-written by Xin Liu and Pak YiuThe children’s apparel market is growing faster than any other clothing sector in China and was worth more than $40.5bn (£33bn) in 2018, according to Euromonitor. This, combined with the rise of “kidfluencers” sponsored by brands to promote products on social media, is spurring greater demand for young models across the country – but experts warn of the heavy cost of pursuing such deals.“If children don’t listen to the parents, then I think hitting them is quite standard,” Lee Ku, the founder of Le Show Stars modelling school, told AFP. A video of a mother kicking her three-year-old daughter in fury at her failure to comply during a modelling job went viral earlier this year, causing outrage online. And footage emerged in early August online of a young boy modelling thick winter clothes outside as temperatures soared to 37C, also drawing heavy online criticism.But in an industry where minors can earn 10,000 yuan (£1,200) a session, Lee says the clip is the tip of the iceberg and, from his experience, such violent behaviour from parents is not unusual on shoots. Child models sometimes go through more than 100 outfit changes in a session, often working from morning till night. But mental health experts warn it is not just physical exhaustion they have to contend with – there may be long-term emotional implications.“Children from the age of zero to six are mentally developing, they need a lot of exploration and freedom,” explained child psychologist Gong Xueping. “At work, the child model will deliberately show a lot of different expressions ... but this is contrary to the child’s own feelings of the moment. This limits the development of both emotional abilities and more complex psychological abilities for children, so I think it’s a very bad choice,” Gong added.But there remains no shortage of parents interested in pushing their children into the profession. Founded three years ago, Le Show Stars was one of the first modelling schools in Beijing, where customers pay up to £95 for a private one-on-one lesson.Four-year-old twins Yumi and Yuki Xiao are not yet professional models, but for nearly two years they have been taking classes teaching them how to pose and pace the catwalk, in the hopes that they can break into the industry.“For some catwalking competitions, they have to be in the makeup room by 6am,” their father, Xiao Liang, said. “The real competition starts at 2pm, and they finish around 3pm or 4. So the whole thing takes a whole day. From 6am to 6pm – 12 hours is pretty standard.” Their parents invest in taking them around the country to compete in hundreds of national child modelling competitions.“It’s a lot of fun, I like being on stage,” insisted Yumi.Like many other parents, Xiao says he initially enrolled the two in child modelling to build their self-confidence, but after Yumi and Yuki showed interest they started to invest more time and money into building a possible child modelling career path for them. Occasionally the twins are paid to model seasonal fashion lines for big brands. “I think they are one of a kind – firstly, they’re twins, and they’re also boy-girl twins,” Xiao says. “They also like it, which is why we are giving them this opportunity. I think they have a natural advantage over other kids,” he added.China’s child labour laws are complicated and parents of underage models are sometimes paid in secret to sidestep the red tape required to employ them. Responding to the kicking video, the authorities in Hangzhou, where the incident took place, introduced regulations to limit the hours children work and ban children under 10 from being brand spokespeople. But many feel that authorities are doing too little to protect children from exploitation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82d6d3403ca98eebb423f4f06bbb13e54c750ddf/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc4046ede1995fe4eb8eb88237ff9a1f","title":"kashmir communications blackout is draconian says un envoy","story":"Indian-administered territory faces fourth day in lockdown after special status revokedThe unprecedented communications blackout imposed on Indian-administered Kashmir could signal a new departure in the way democratic states clamp down on information in contentious areas, the UN’s special rapporteur on freedom of expression has said.The territory faces its fourth day in lockdown, imposed hours before the Indian government revoked Kashmir’s special status on Monday – stripping away the autonomy it was granted in exchange for joining the Indian union after independence in 1947. It also said it would ide the state of Jammu and Kashmir in two.Ahead of the announcement, thousands of extra troops were deployed to Kashmir, where the government is likely to face major opposition. An insurgency against Indian rule has been ongoing for decades, and tens of thousands of people have been killed in the conflict.Despite a heavy security presence and strict curfew, protests have occurred.Communications are often blocked in Indian-administered Kashmir, but the most recent clampdown is unprecedented in a time of relative peace. Unlike previous instances, landline phones and cable TV have been cut off. A strict curfew also means people are unable to leave their homes during the day, while only limited movement has been allowed at night.The region in the foothills of the Himalayas has been under dispute since\u0026nbspIndia\u0026nbspand Pakistan came into being in 1947.Both claim it in full, but each controls a section of the territory, separated by one of the world\u0027s most heavily militarised borders: the \u0027line of control\u0027 based on a ceasefire border established after a 1947-48 war. China controls another part in the east.India and Pakistan have gone to war three times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.After the partition of colonial India 71 years ago, small, semi-autonomous \u0027princely states\u0027 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join,\u0026nbsp until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join, or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections, and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.Kashmir’s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian Union, has been in place since May 14, 1954. Under Article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.\u0026nbspAn additional provision, Article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state, and its way of life.The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu-nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.On Monday 5 August 2019, the government issued a presidential order to abolish Kashmir\u0027s special status. The government argued that the provision was only intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan - which quickly called India’s actions illegal - and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerillas fought a war replete with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with\u0026nbspextreme force\u0026nbspin 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.For Indians, control of Kashmir – part of the country’s only Muslim-majority state – has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. Michael Safi and Rebecca RatcliffeThe restrictions have prevented people from calling for ambulances, accessing information or checking on family members. On Thursday, an opposition activist filed a petition in India’s top court challenging the security lockdown and communications block.On Wednesday, one man arriving at Delhi airport from Srinagar, Kashmir’s biggest city, described the state as being “like a prison”. Soayib Qureshi, a Delhi-based lawyer, who arrived on the same day, said he had been given a handwritten boarding pass to take the flight because systems were down.Globally, communication blackouts tend to be focused on internet or mobile phone coverage, said Kaye, who pointed to the suspension of internet access during the school exam period in countries such as Iraq, Ethiopia and Uganda, which governments said were an effort to stop cheating.The UN rapporteur for freedom of expression added: “I can’t say this hasn’t happened before – but I can’t recall a situation were there has been a total blackout of not only the two-way multi point communication systems that we are familiar with now – anything on the internet, WhatsApp etc – but also the one direction-communications like TV.“That’s pretty extensive and one of my concerns would be – in part because this is happening in a democratic state – it could be seen as a new departure for many states that are thinking about how to clamp down on the flow of information.”He said It was very hard to identify a set of circumstances where a country shutting down access to the internet, especially for an extensive period of time, was legal under international law.A spokesperson for the UN office for human rights added: “We are deeply concerned that the latest restrictions in Indian-administered Kashmir will exacerbate the human rights situation in the region.”The US senator Bob Menendez and the US representative Eliot Engel, repesenting the US foreign affairs committee, said that “transparency and political participation are the cornerstones of democracy”, and that it hoped the Indian government abided by these principles. It also warned Pakistan against retaliatory aggression, after fierce rhetoric from the Pakistani prime minister, Imran Khan, over the revocation of Indian-administered Kashmir’s special status.On Wednesday, Pakistan announced it would expel the Indian ambassador and suspend trade. It came after remarks by Khan suggested India could carry out ethnic cleansing in Kashmir. He said: “They will try to remove the local people and bring in others and make them a majority, so that the locals become nothing but slaves.”Indian-administered Kashmir has had special status since 1954, giving it a degree of autonomy including its own constitution, as well as rules that prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believe this is crucial to protecting the demography and traditions of India’s only Muslim-majority state.New Delhi has insisted the ending of autonomy for the region is an internal matter.Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f2a261aea8cad88342eddf6d0df9f96823e29ba/0_454_4364_2619/master/4364.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab53da771db1d42e5a8e4a24c6c6c733","title":"syria safe zone plan may just be wishful thinking","story":"Lack of detail and strong opposition from Kurds means plan is unlikely to provide solution to region’s problemsThe announcement by Turkey and the US that they will set up a safe zone in Kurdish-run north-eastern Syria allays fears of an imminent Turkish incursion into the country, but will strain Washington’s ties with a force that helped defeat Islamic State.The announcement came as Ankara was finalising a troop buildup along its southern border, which it shares with Syrian Kurds. On Sunday, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, had threatened to invade within the next fortnight, creating a conundrum for Washington, which views both the Turks and the Kurds as allies and has increasingly struggled to keep them from conflict.Though light on detail, the agreement suggests that a safe zone inside the Kurdish north-east would be jointly run by Turkish and US forces. No specifics were offered on the route that such a corridor might take or how deep it would extend into Syria. The lack of clarity led some observers to claim the US was buying time and was not committed to a plan that could seriously test its already faltering ties with the region’s Kurds.“It’s basically an agreement to continue talking,” said a former US official. “That’s a net good. But with Trump having no commitment to Syria, and our forces now cut to the bone, there is little we can really do to support a safe zone. So it’s a lot of wishful thinking.”Turkey suggested it would use the newly established zone to return Syrian refugees inside its borders whom officials have started rounding up and returning to Syria in recent weeks. Senior Kurdish officials said such moves would amount to demographically reshaping a border that is dominated by Kurds and which Ankara wants to transform into an Arab stronghold.“We are aware of the Turkish government’s intention, which is to change the demography of Syria just as the Ba’ath regime did in the 60s by building the Arab belt,” said Jihad Omar, the co-chair of the Office of Diplomatic Relations in the Syrian Democratic Council. “It is something we stand against because it is a genocide against the Kurds.The announcement also failed to shed light on any implications for two large detention camps and two prisons which hold more than 130,000 suspected Isis members or supporters – the remnants of the collapsed so-called “caliphate” which regarded north-east Syria as a centre of gravity until its battlefield defeat this year.The fate of the facilities had been of deep concern to regional and western states during the Turkish buildup, and senior diplomatic sources suggested the bilateral deal may have been struck to temper such fears.Though Isis no longer controls territory, there are strong and growing concerns that the organisation is using the camps to regroup and regenerate. Senior western officials had worried that Isis members could attempt an organised breakout, if Kurdish forces guarding them had been distracted by a war with the Turks.For much of the Syrian war, Turkey had been a full-throated supporter of the anti-Assad opposition, arming some insurgent groups and offering shelter to up to 4 million Syrians who had fled the fighting. However, over the past 18 months, its interests have narrowed and it now aims to shape the dying phase of the eight-year conflict along nationalist lines.Ankara’s first priority is to try to ensure that Kurdish groups, which are allied to the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), with which it continues to fight a four-decade-long insurgency inside its borders, do not emerge emboldened.Turkey insists Kurdish leaders with whom the US allied to fight Isis, under the banner of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), are ideologically and militarily allied to the PKK.“The fundamental issue is that the US supports the SDF, a group that Turkey views as a terrorist organisation,” said Aaron Stein, director of the Middle East programme at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. “The statement does not reconcile this fundamental issue, nor does it address a core ergence over how deep any zone would be. These remain to be resolved and, quite frankly, I don’t see how to do that.”A second issue for Ankara is Syrian refugees, whose fate has become a lightning rod for leaders on both sides of a ided political spectrum. “The refugee issue is fast nearing a tip-over in Turkey,” said Soner Cagaptay, the director of the Turkish programme at the Washington Institute. He said the impact of refugees on Turkish society could not be overestimated, adding: “It’s the most significant demographic shift since the GreekTurkish exchange of the 1920s.“Erdoğan is therefore very eager to have this issue go away. He’s pressing hard for the safe zone, not just to undermine the YPG and the establishment of a PKK-allied state there but also to relocate a large number of refugees back to Syria. The statement out of the US embassy is significant: it shows that both sides have consensus on that.”Stein suggested “potential violations of international law could hinder implementation” of any forced refugee returns. The Syrian Democratic Council’s Omar said any influx of Arab Syrians would not be tolerated.“Our position has been very clear from the first day: any advance of Turkish forces and its allied armed groups into Syria is unacceptable. The recent agreement between the US and Turkey to build a new safe zone won’t change our position.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3979981.1565217290!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cervicalcheck sends letter with incorrect test results to 400 women","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf Brian MacCraith: his report urged the HSE to move quickly to ensure CervicalCheck becomes a well-structured, strongly-led organisation. Photograph: Nick BradshawApproximately 400 women whose cervical smear test results were delayed for months in the latest cancer screening controversy, have this week received a letter with incorrect information about those results.This latest mistake has emerged in the wake of the publication of the MacCraith report on the 4,088 women affected by an IT failure and human error.The report by DCU president Prof Brian MacCraith found that in the case of 873 women who had a repeat HPV test, no results were sent to them or to their GP for over six months and, in the remaining cases, GPs were informed but not the women concerned.The HSE on Wednesday confirmed that almost half of the 873 women received a letter in the last week from CervicalCheck that “contained an inaccuracy”.The newest error in the ongoing cancer saga emerged after a woman contacted The  following publication of the MacCraith report.Preferring to identify herself only as Ms Scullion, she said she was one of the 873 women who had not received any results of a repeat test for HPV, the virus that can cause cancer.She received a letter on August 6th, but dated August 1st which told her: “Please be assured that as expected your HPV re-test result is unchanged from your original smear test of the above date (July 2018) and remains HPV negative.”Ms Scullion said she is HPV positive, known from a previous testing and investigation.‘Mail merge’She said the letter appeared to be a “mail merge”, an automated letter to multiple recipients, and “looks like an administrative error”.She contacted CervicalCheck who “apologised profusely” and confirmed it as an administrative error. Ms Scullion said she will attend for her next test at the end of the year.But she expressed concern that “a letter that is meant to put your mind at rest, makes you worry even more” and said this new error might be illustrative of what Prof MacCraith found, that “too few people within CervicalCheck are managing too many projects”.Ms Scullion said that “I just couldn’t believe it. It’s just embarrassing that there is yet another mistake and you start wondering what else will happen.”The MacCraith report urged the HSE to move quickly to ensure CervicalCheck becomes a well-structured, strongly-led organisation with good management practice and an active culture of risk management.In a statement, the HSE said in the letters sent out, “we also confirmed that the result of these women’s HPV re-test was unchanged ‘and remains HPV negative’. However, for some women, this should have read ‘and remains HPV positive’. This was an error on our part and we are very sorry for any confusion it may have caused.”Further testingThe HSE stressed that at the time of the original HPV-positive result, the women’s GPs would have recommended further testing.“We are nonetheless again very sorry for any confusion or distress this error may have caused. We will be writing to women involved, as a matter of priority, to correct this error. We have already communicated directly with a small number of women who have contacted CervicalCheck on this issue.”The revelation came as Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Health Simon Harris met cervical cancer campaigners about a formal State apology to the women and families affected by the ongoing controversy.Mr Varadkar is expected to make a formal apology in the Dáil when it resumes in the autumn. Lorraine Walsh, whose test results were misdiagnosed, and Stephen Teap, whose wife Irene Teap died of cervical cancer, represent the 221-plus patient group and discussed all aspects of the State’s role in the CervicalCheck controversy with Mr Varadkar and Mr Harris.The HSE has said any woman with concerns could contact clientservices@cervicalcheck.ie or phone 01-8659392."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Blustery, rainy conditions, showers and possible spot flooding expected at weekendExpenses claimed since 2015 yet Senator\u0026rsquos site \u0026lsquonews section\u0026rsquo last updated two years agoAcademics say use of electronic devices is difficult to police in crowded exam hallsHis insights and equations are fundamental to weather forecasting, climate modelling etcDocuments shows public displeasure at jailing of Sutton GP Dr Bassam Naser for tax evasionPatients waiting six months told they are HPV negative when actually HPV positiveMajority of messages received by department seek harsher punishment of criminalsNBCI investigating claims inspector worked as security consultant for Coolmore StudRight-wing conservative youth group says Foley-Walsh was at the conference in a \u0026lsquopersonal capacity\u0026rsquoOireachtas committee report raises concerns about multibillion-euro roll-outFormer garda says he sees correspondence from commissioner as a vindicationHuman rights panel in Belfast hears calls for appointment of covert policing commissionerHSE data shows \u0026euro200m wasted yearly over lack of step-down care, says Sinn F\u0026eacutein TDForensic mental health occupational therapist among the contestants this yearFamily of John Boreland, shot dead in north Belfast in 2016, say \u0026lsquobroken lives will never be healed\u0026rsquoPeople who work with horses close to the Border say their industry has been \u0026lsquoabandoned\u0026rsquoMichael D\u0026rsquoArcy says countries such as Ireland may require pan-EU financial supportMore than 540 patients admitted to hospitals across State are without bed"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3979891.1565207172!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"keith byrne to invoke john lennon in us deportation case","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKeith Byrne was arrested by Ice (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) officials last month and spent two weeks in prison, under a Trump-ordered crackdown on illegal immigration.Lawyers for Irishman Keith Byrne, threatened with deportation from the US over a charge for possessing cannabis in Ireland 14 years ago, plan to invoke John Lennon before federal courts in an attempt to secure his residency. Joe Hohenstein, one of the Corkman’s legal team, said the ex-Beatle’s threatened deportation in the 1970s was over “exactly the same charge” which has hampered Mr Byrne’s struggle for a green card.In 1972, US president Richard Nixon’s White House ordered Lennon – who had been living in New York with his wife Yoko Ono for a year at the time – out of the country. It was an election year, and the famous couple were outspoken in their protest against the Vietnam War, urging people to give peace a chance by voting Nixon out of office. Lennon’s charge for cannabis possession in London in 1968 was cited by the Nixon administration as reason for his being improperly allowed into the US. After a three-year fight against deportation proceedings, a three-judge federal panel ruled his conviction in Britain didn’t meet American standards of justice.A year later, he won permission to remain on as a permanent resident. Embarrassment“The British version of marijuana possession is identical to the Irish version,” said Mr Hohenstein. “That is – even under the current US immigration law – not something that should make someone what we call inadmissible. “That is one of the main things we will be trying to bring home when we file these papers in court.”Mr Byrne said the minor cannabis charge 14 years ago in his hometown of Fermoy, Co Cork, was the “big issue”. “We have been trying to correct it and find the right person to hear our argument,” he told RTÉ’s Drivetime. “I’m embarrassed for the government of Ireland and the government of the United States for something like that to ruin my life, my wife’s life, my children’s lives. “People are out there doing serious crimes and they can go wherever they please. It is horrendous . . . Why should that ruin my future?”Mr Byrne (37), who lives in Philadelphia, was arrested by Ice (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) officials last month and spent two weeks in prison, under a Trump-ordered crackdown on illegal immigration. The father-of-three overstayed his ESTA visa waiver when he entered the country in 2007 and married his American wife Keren two years later. His attempts to regularise his residency ever since were complicated by the cannabis possession charge.Two applicationsMr Hohenstein said he would be filing two different court applications in the ongoing battle against deportation: one to a federal appeals court, on the removal of his deportation order another in a lower federal court, appealing the decision to deny Mr Byrne his green card. The lawyer said Mr Byrne had put his wife Keren through nursing school, helped her build a career as a registered nurse and that their family connections in the US are “extremely strong”. The US immigration system deals very “severe and harsh consequences for minor incidents” which have a “really disproportionate impact on inidual persons and their US citizen families”, he said. But he believes the deportation efforts are the result of a “misunderstanding” and that Mr Byrne’s “interaction with the authorities in Ireland do not make him inadmissible in the US.”Mr Byrne said he was “giving no energy” to the thought of having to leave the US. “I don’t want to think about something that may never happen,” he said. “I will think of that when I’m on a plane. Right now, I’m thinking of how I can stay here and continue.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3979943.1565253542!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"david norris has spent nearly 70 000 since 2015 on website design and online services says sipo","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSenator David Norris: claimed €29,459 for “website, design and online” services last year.

Photograph: AP PhotoNeil Armstrong, NASALast month marked the 50th anniversary of Neil Armstrong’s walk on the moon. The sciences of the 20th century allowed humans unprecedented access to a celestial object that has fascinated humankind for as long as we have written records. Armstrong trod on a surface that many before him had speculated about. If you are curious about the moon landing of Apollo 11, I encourage you to look at NASA’s excellent website about the mission (nasa.gov).The anniversary also provides an opportunity to reflect on past understandings of the moon’s surface before any human imagined it might be possible to walk on it.As Armstrong stretched his moon boot towards the lunar surface he was not surprised to find it solid and irregular. Satellites orbiting earth had photographed the surface of the moon, and scientists had named some of the most significant craters. Only a few centuries before Galileo had risked ridicule when, based on telescopic observations, he suggested that the moon’s surface was not smooth.Galileo’s drawings of craters on the moon were revolutionary because of the persistence of ideas about celestial objects. During the middle ages and the Renaissance, most people who considered the nature of the moon assumed that it was a perfect sphere with a smooth surface. Because the moon existed in the heavenly realm, above the earthly one, most people (astronomers included) believed that it must be perfect. This belief was based on the writings of Aristotle, who had also established the geocentric view of the universe. Aristotle’s perfect celestial bodies and earth-centered cosmos had also become key components of the Christian understanding of the universe. The moon was thought to be unlike earth in its perfection, existing in the realm of a perfect God.Nonetheless Galileo did not see perfection when he looked through his telescope at the moon in the early 17th century. He saw instead a surface that reminded him of earth. Others had explained the appearance of light and dark patches, or even the “man in the moon”, as the consequence of how the perfect crystalline substance of the moon reflected light. Galileo, however, saw mountains and valleys that looked terrestrial and not celestial. He noted how the shadows cast on the moon’s surface changed over the course of hours just as the shadows cast by mountains changed on the earth’s surface.PerfectionGalileo’s ideas soon appeared in artistic form. Only a year after the publication of Sidereus nuncius, the artist Lodovico Cigoli, in his commission for the Sancta Maria Maggiore chapel in Rome, chose to depict Mary standing upon a moon with Galileo’s pitted and pocked surface. This was significant for a number of reasons. Mary’s perfection and virginity had been associated with the pristine moon in religious commentary and in religious art. Further, Galileo would soon clash with the Church over his astronomical views and we might have expected objections to this new understanding of the lunar surface. Finally, Cigoli seems to have observed the moon’s surface himself through a telescope indicating the spread of Galileo’s ideas and practices of observation among some Italian elites.The moons drawn by Galileo in Sidereus nuncius would have appeared somewhat familiar to those astronauts embarking on the Apollo 11 mission. Although not drawn with perfect accuracy, Galileo’s large craters match up with those captured by lunar photography centuries later. He did not create a map of the moon’s surface and the moon was simply one of a number of examples of the possibilities for astronomical observation enabled by the telescope that he described in his book.Even before Galileo, two English astronomers had also begun to map the surface of the moon. Thomas Harriot’s observations of the lunar surface with a telescope had commenced in 1609, at least a year before Galileo’s. Harriot was less interested in the three-dimensional surface and more interested in sketching the boundaries of apparent land and oceans. Like Galileo, Harriot saw the moon as earth-like. William Gilbert also created a lunar surface map during the early 17th century.Harriot, Gilbert and Galileo had all expected that if the moon had a surface like the earth it would contain life like the earth. Such an expectation had disappeared by the time Neil Armstrong stepped out on to the moon but I wonder if the possibility might have crossed his mind, even for a second as he stepped out into the known unknown.Dr Juliana Adelman lectures in history at Dublin City University"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Kyrgyzstan in crisis after special forces taken hostage by former president after botched raidRemainer MPs hatch fresh plan to cancel party conference season to give them more time to block a no-deal BrexitWhy Germany wants Brexit talks but blackmail won’t bring Angela Merkel to the tableHundreds of Kashmiri politicians detained to quell protests over statusNumber of women carrying knives jumps 73 per cent as women courier weapons for male gang membersMalaysian police use mother\u0026#39s voice recording in search for missing London teenKashmir crisis: Will nuclear-armed Pakistan go to war with India again?Police officer \u0026#39seriously injured\u0026#39 after machete attack in Leyton, east LondonNew North Korean propaganda series fails to rally viewersUK weather: Warnings issued as Britain braces for heavy rain and high windsComment: The BBC\u0026#39s Brexit coverage is fatally devoid of context and balance\tComment: British Airways has gone from national treasure to national humiliation\tComment: To survive the new global Dark Age, Britain must leave the tyrannical EUNHS to receive £250m boost for AI developmentCocaine haul worth £1.6 million found washed up on New Zealand beachA third of millennials want martial law and 66 per cent prefer strong leader over parliament, poll findsReducing air pollution could cut 44,000 cases of asthma in childrenPublic put at risk by release of young offenders without a suitable place to live, say prison inspectorsJohn McDonnell threatens to march on palace and tell Queen: \u0026#39We\u0026#39re taking over\u0026#39 if Boris Johnson loses no confidence voteWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"best telegraph audio inside fortnite world cup future fast food","story":"Every Friday the  will bring you a selection of our best articles, comment pieces and features in audio form to be listened to at your convenience.Following the new Prime Minister\u0027s visits to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, Philip Johnston writes that a radical new plan might be required to keep the Union together.Kyle Giersdorf might not be a name many people know, but the 16-year-old gamer recently became £2.4m richer after becoming the Fortnite world champion.

It’s wrong and I\u0027ve seen it done before all around the world. It\u0027s wrong.Another shopper, who herself wears a hijab and abaya, wrote on Twitter: “If she’s Muslim or not she’s giving us Muslim women a bad light and if she is Muslim then may Allah guide her.”Another Twitter user, named only as Abdul, wrote: These people aren’t Muslim they’re those people who live in and around east London and have exploited the fact that it’s predominantly Muslims around here and to be honest Muslims are very generous people in giving towards charity and these frauds know this. Be aware everyone.”Security staff surround the two women at the Dagenham AsdaA senior Muslim community leader, who asked not to be named, told The : “It’s highly unlikely religious Muslim women would do this, but different Muslims do different things. If these women were Muslim and were attempting to shoplift they certainly should not be doing so. Both these acts, shoplifting and lifting up their dresses, go against what Muslims should be doing in the first place.”Asda staff did not immediately report the incident to the police, waiting until yesterday to do so, and the whereabouts of the two women are currently unknown.A spokesperson for Asda said: “We do not tolerate any form of shoplifting and work hard to deter shoplifters from our stores. “All cases of attempted theft are taken seriously and we always work closely with the local police force in the communities we serve. “We are in contact with Dagenham Police about this incident and would like to thank colleagues at our Dagenham store for their quick intervention and response in this case.”The politan Police said its officers were investigating the incident but had made no arrests at this stage.A Scotland Yard spokesman said: “We are aware of footage circulating on social media of two females having been stopped by staff members at a commercial premises at Merrilands Crescent, Dagenham on suspicion of theft. “The incident occurred on Sunday, 4 August between 19:30hrs and 19:45hrs. The two suspects are suspected of having attempted to steal infant formula. The incident was reported to police at 13:22hrs on Wednesday, 7 August.

Instead, the card\u0027s number is stored on a secure chip inside the iPhone, which generates virtual numbers for online or over-the-phone purchases requiring a number.Apple has focused on privacy, saying that purchase information is stored on the user\u0027s iPhone and that it cannot see the information. Goldman will not be allowed to use data for marketing purposes, even for selling other Goldman products.But at Apple\u0027s size - $265.6 billion in sales for fiscal 2018 - the revenue matters less than the effect on keeping Apple customers tied to its brand, analysts said, said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies.If it works, it\u0027s one more thing that causes you to stay deeply loyal and entrenched in the Apple ecosystem, even if something better comes along, he said.Additional reporting by ReutersBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Whether your passion is in science or the arts, it’s a way to express yourself.”So, the company’s latest initiative, in conjunction with the Mayor of London, may not be surprising. Apple’s daily collection of free events in its stores, called Today at Apple, is going on the road to community organisations with a series called Made in LDN.The Mayor’s involvement makes clear the need for bigger investment in youth services and activities for young Londoners to get involved in across the capital, which will provide the key skills they need to reach their full potential.\u0026nbsp“I am determined to do everything I can to provide positive opportunities for young people this summer and that’s why I am pleased to be working with Apple on a series of programmes to help young people develop the skills they need to get the jobs of tomorrow, while also ensuring they have something constructive and safe to do during the summer holidays, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said.Massive Government cuts have decimated youth services in our city over the last nine years, but through my Young Londoners Fund I’m committed to providing young people with the activities and skills they need to make the most of their potential.”Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chief engineer of LIFT aircraft Balazs Kerulo demonstrates the company\u0027s Hexa personal drone craft in Lago Vista, Texas on June 3 2019225 Project Scarlett to succeed Xbox OneMicrosoft announced Project Scarlett, the successor to the Xbox One, at E3 2019.

This is a production preview of the Jaguar I-PACE, which will be revealed next year and on the road in 2018One of the first events was at Shapeways.io, a technology hub for young people to learn digital skills such as coding, Adobe Photoshop and more. But, as Obed Yeboah from the organisation explains, the idea is to harness these technological elements (Apple brings its hardware and software to the events for participants to use) and match them to other skills. Yeboah ides these into soft skills such as expressing yourself confidently and hard skills like being able to code a website.“A lot of organisations talk to young people about how to communicate, which doesn’t work for this generation. You have to embed it into something that they would actually do, which, in most cases is around tech, because they use it every single day, Yeboah said.We attach the soft skill, the interpersonal skills development, to a hard skill because it’s very difficult to actually measure soft skills. I mean, the young person can tell you, yeah, I’m confident, but for us to know that they’re confident, we\u0026nbspput them in a scenario where you’re talking about a project with a client, or you’re teaching young people the skills that you’ve learned.”But do some skills lend themselves better than others? After all, coding can be quite a solitary pursuit that may not seem suitable for team building.“With coding, well, if you get a project then you’re not working by yourself. Because you need a group of designers, you need a group of coders and, if the client needs a video, you’re working with videographers as well. It gives you that teamwork element.”Yeboah is frank about how they are able to address issues young people are facing.“A lot of kids come in because they want communication skills. Communication is one of the biggest reasons why a lot of young people don’t speak to anyone about how they are feeling and don’t end up making decisions based on how they feel, Yeboah said.\u0026nbspThey end up doing things that you wouldn’t want a young person to be associating themselves with. If they’re involved in gang culture, or something like that, you realise that is purely based on the fact that they feel misunderstood... The challenge is, how do we build a team of young people to harness what they already love, what they already engage with, such as tech, even if they might be doing something that goes against the rules in other parts of their lives. Once you put them in the same room together, then they’re tackling real issues through learning a skill. So now, when you leave Shapeways.io, you don’t only know how to express your feelings but you also have a hard skill that you can use if, say, you want to go into further education.”Molly Aldridge, 18, went to Shapeways.io after a work experience placement. She had no experience of coding but after taking the HTML and CSS courses at Shapeways.io, is now proficient enough that she teaches coding to primary school children. “I felt that it was easy to learn how to teach coding because it allowed me to further my skills by talking aloud to other people. We talked to each other about how to teach. So, we were able to tell each other if we had something wrong. Which then gave us more confidence for when we would actually teach children.”She was at the first Apple Made in LDN session. “It was a workshop where we learned how make an app, designing what it looked like and adding functionality, she said.\u0026nbspIt was completely new to me. I’ll need some more classes to really get to grips with it. I do more web-based design. So, it opened up another area of coding that I haven’t really looked at or considered before. I had believed that app development was something really complicated, and you needed different software to make it possible. But the workshop showed me that all it really took was this one app that I could use to not only handle the design aspects of it but also use to test out the functionality and how the app would actually work on a device such as an iPhone.”Rohan Coleman, 19, used Procreate, a magnificent creative drawing and painting app, at his Made in LDN session. He said:\u0026nbsp“I’ve never had an outlet to express the ideas I get in my head like that. I feel like I’ve gained the opportunity to explore designing myself – instead of having to rely on someone else to realise my ideas.”Yeboah is emphatic about the benefits.“With Apple Made In LDN, we bring in 40 young people to learn coding and design using Apple’s technology.\u0026nbsp Apple is going into different London boroughs to engage young people with this technology and give them another way into society, which I think is amazing. If we go into a community centre, to run a workshop, it can be difficult to pull in a lot of young people. Our brand isn’t on the same level as Apple.\u0026nbsp And for the young people in south London, or east London, them doing anything with Apple is almost a dream. Nobody in the streets or, you know, nobody in gang culture dreams as far as working with Apple or being trained by Apple. It’s almost like it made them feel, ‘Wow, I’m actually being trained by Apple, I’m in that same environment as them. There’s an opportunity for me to change my life.’ ”Finally, the sessions themselves aren’t the last part of the jigsaw, as Yeboah explains: “A lot of young people are out on the streets or doing bad things purely because there isn’t a choice, there isn’t an alternative: education is not working for them.

It soon bounced back and by mid-July it was back trading at around $13,000.\u0026nbspBut even heavier losses were to come, as bitcoin once again fell towards $9,000 at\u0026nbspthe end of July. A week of positive price movement may well be proceeded by another nosee, however some market analysts believe that this time there may be more gains to come.One reason for this is bitcoin gaining a reputation as a safe haven asset, allowing\u0026nbspinvestors can theoretically pile money into the cryptocurrency when traditional markets are looking shaky. With rising trade tensions between the US and China, as well as growing uncertainty surrounding Brexit, bitcoin could see an influx in investments over the coming weeks and months.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearOne cryptocurrency expert predicts that the bitcoin price “could hit $15,000 within weeks”, to take it to its highest level since January 2018, and within just $5,000 of its all-time high.“Bitcoin is becoming a flight-to-safety asset during times of market uncertainty,” Nigel Green, chief executive of financial consultancy firm deVere Group, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.“Bitcoin is currently realising its reputation as a form of digital gold. Up to now, gold has been known as the ultimate safe-haven asset, but bitcoin – which shares its key characteristics of being a store of value and scarcity – could potentially dethrone gold in the future as the world becomes increasingly digitised.CoinMarketCap)This analysis appears to be reaffirmed by recent data analysis by Bloomberg, which found that bitcoin’s price correlation to gold has almost doubled over the last three months.Jeremy Allaire, CEO of one of the largest cryptocurrency payment firms Circle, also pointed to geopolitical events when justifying bitcoin’s latest price rise. In a recent interview with\u0026nbspCNBC, Mr Allaire pointed to two of bitcoin’s key characteristics – a finite supply, and decentralised infrastructure- that make it such an attractive investment.“You can very clearly see some macro correlation there,” he said. “Rising nationalism, rising amounts of currency conflict, trade wars, these all obviously are supportive of a non-sovereign, highly secure digital store of value.”Can Norwegian waterfalls stop bitcoin from destroying the planet?Other analysts suggest that bitcoin\u0027s volatility can also be attractive to investors who want to ersify their portfolio by adding a risky asset that could provide huge gains.This is the view of Marcus Swanepoel, CEO at cryptocurrency firm Luno, who said this tactic had been successfully adopted by a number of private and institutional traders in recent months.It is now clear that investors put money into cryptocurrency when the main markets are falling, Mr Swanepoel told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspThe strategy of using gold or the yen as a safe-haven asset and at the same time buying digital assets to potentially produce a high return, is gaining momentum.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Competition law prohibits such cooperation.\u0026nbsp“We asked for these reassurances at the end of last year and, despite support from Defra, we’re still waiting,” Mr Rycroft said.Speaking to BBC Radio 4 on Wednesday, he said shortages would affect “random” products, depending on “which trucks get through”, and that supplies would be disrupted for weeks or months after the Brexit date.\u0026nbspLord Haskins, former chair\u0026nbspof Northern Foods, agreed\u0026nbspfood shortages are likely if Britain crashes out of the EU, and warned of potential panic-buying which would exacerbate them.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Beer enthusiasts taste beer and ale during The Great British Beer Festival at Kensington Olympia in west London.

Competition law prohibits such cooperation.\u0026nbsp“We asked for these reassurances at the end of last year and, despite support from Defra, we’re still waiting,” Mr Rycroft said.Speaking to BBC Radio 4 on Wednesday, he said shortages would affect “random” products, depending on “which trucks get through”, and that supplies would be disrupted for weeks or months after the Brexit date.\u0026nbspLord Haskins, former chair\u0026nbspof Northern Foods, agreed\u0026nbspfood shortages are likely if Britain crashes out of the EU, and warned of potential panic-buying which would exacerbate them.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Beer enthusiasts taste beer and ale during The Great British Beer Festival at Kensington Olympia in west London.

to decide where to prioritise shipments - they will have to provide cast-iron written reassurances that competition law will not be strictly applied to those discussions,” FDF\u0027s chief operating officer Tim Rycroft told the BBC.\u0026nbspIn the markets, Asian stocks were down on Wednesday while European bourses gained in morning trading.\u0026nbspDominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has\u0026nbsppraised Donald Trump and his deputy Mike Pence for their warmth and enthusiasm for the UK-US relationship.\u0026nbspRaab says he was delighted to meet the pair on his three-day trip to the US in hope of paving the way for a post-Brexit trade deal.The UK looks forward to working with our American friends to reach a free trade deal that is good for both countries, and co-operating on the common security challenges we face.\u0026nbspE.On is the latest “Big Six” energy supplier to blame the government’s price cap for plummeting profits.The cap, which will be reduced this winter, is supposed to stop firms ripping off loyal customers.The German utility’s earnings from UK retail customers crashed 78 per cent in the latest quarter.Customer numbers fell by around 200,000 to 6.4 million in the three months to March.Bad news for E.On today but good news for about 15 million households who will see their energy bills fall this winter.\u0026nbspAnnual energy bills will go down by £75 on average for 11 million households on standard tariffs and by £25 for customers who pay for their gas and electricity upfront.\u0026nbspOfgem, the energy regulator for England, Wales and Scotland, is lowering the price caps for the October to March period due to lower wholesale energy prices.Full story here from Olesya Dmitracova:Energy bills to fall for 15 million households this winter as Ofgem lowers price capsExecutives at Hargreaves Lansdown will give up their bonuses after the Woodford fund fiasco, Reuters\u0026nbspis reporting.\u0026nbspAccording to the nes agency\u0027s source, Hargreaves\u0027 chief executive Chris Hill, Chief financial officer Philip Johnson, chief investment officer Lee Gardhouse and research director Mark Dampier, will take no bonus for 2019.\u0026nbspHargreaves plugged Woodford\u0027s fund through its best buy list and received fees for referring customers.\u0026nbspHundreds of thousands of Hargreaves Lansdown customers who ploughed their savings into Woodford\u0027s flagship fund have had their money frozen since June and it will likely stay there until at least December as the once highly regarded stock picker tries to sort out the mess he is in.\u0026nbspWoodford invested in riskier unlisted stocks which he couldn\u0027t get rid of fast enough when a long run of poor performance prompted people to demands their cash back.House prices have fallen for the second successive month, Halifax says.The average UK house price was down 2 per cent in July to\u0026nbsp£236,120 following a 0.4 per cent monthly decline in June.However, the lender said prices were still up 4.1 per cent in the year to July.Brexit uncertainty will weigh on the UK housing market over the next few months according to analysts at the EY ITEM Club.\u0026nbspConsumers may well be particularly cautious about committing to buying a house, especially as house prices are relatively expensive relative to incomes, says Howard Archer.\u0026nbspHouse prices are still far higher compared to earnings than the average over the last 35 years.\u0026nbspAccording to the Halifax, the house price to earnings ratio was still as high as 5.59 in July after spiking to 5.72 in February (the highest level since November 2017) from 5.39 in January this is well above the long-term (1983-2019) average of 4.29.\u0026nbspAnd it is questionable whether recent growth in jobs numbers and earnings can be sustained months as companies tailor their behaviour to a lacklustre domestic economy, prolonged Brexit uncertainties and a challenging global environment.\u0026nbspTherefore Archer forecats\u0026nbspthat house prices will rise by no more than 1.5 per cent in 2019.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTesla is in a spot of bother in the US.\u0026nbspBloomberg\u0026nbspreports that Elon Musk\u0027s firm has been scrutinised over safety claims on its Model 3 the car intended to take electric vehicles truly into the mainstream.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspUS\u0026nbspNational Highway Traffic Administration reportedly sent a cease and desist letter last year, taking issue with Tesla\u0027s\u0026nbspclaim that the Model 3 had achieved the lowest probability of injury of any vehicle the agency ever tested.So, what exactly is Britain\u0027s food industry saying it needs the government to do to prevent food shortages after Brexit?\u0026nbspIt\u0027s trade body wants firms\u0026nbspto be allowed\u0026nbspco-ordinate and direct supplies with each other if Britain crashes out of the EU on 31 October.\u0026nbspThey cant do that under current rules which prevent them colluding. Those\u0026nbspmeasures are designed to ensure adequate competition and result in the best outcome for consumers.The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) said: “We asked for these reassurances at the end of last year, but we\u0027re still waiting.”\u0026nbspThe industry says that an October Brexit would be disastrous for food supplies because warehouses are already full in the run-up to Christmas.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOne retailer told the BBC that 31 October\u0026nbsp“is about the worst day you can pick”, as warehouse capacity is at 105 per cent\u0026nbspin November, versus 75 per cent - 80 per cent\u0026nbspin March.The government isn\u0027t being entirely up-front about the potentially dire consequences of no-deal Brexit for fresh food and drink supplies, according to a leading academic on the topic.\u0026nbspTim Lang, professor of food policy at City University, warned earlier this week that the UK’s food supply faces levels of disruption “unprecedented” in peacetime.\u0026nbspWhat does that mean?\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\tThe government estimates that half of lorries entering the country will be unable to cross the border smoothly\tThe flow of trucks could drop by a third within a day of a no-deal Brexit\tFood prices predicted to rise by more than 10 per cent as costs rise and supplies fall.Professor Lang warns\u0026nbspthat Britons, particularly those on lower incomes, already under-consume fresh fruit and vegetables, and food banks are not fully prepared for shortages, which could have a negative impact on diets and public health.\u0026nbspFull story here:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBrexit food shortages: Government being secretive over public health risks of no dealThousands of holidaymakers have had their flights cancelled due to more technology failures at British Airways.\u0026nbspSimon Calder has counted\u0026nbsp86 cancellations to and from Heathrow so far today, including one round-trip to New York and dozens of flights to Mediterranean resorts.

Unfortunately, even the food industry, which has tested a range of options to mitigate the effect of massive disruption at Dover, doesn\u0027t really know.\u0026nbspFood and Drink Federation boss Tim Rycroft tells the BBC:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThere will be selective shortages and they will to some extent be random because it depends on which trucks get through and which don\u0027t. We think there will be some serious disruption and it will go on for weeks or months after our exit.The government is unlikely to grant the food industry\u0027s wish for\u0026nbsprelaxed rules to alleviate food supply problems, says Mark Jones, partner at law firm Gordons. Big supermarkets\u0026nbspprobably won\u0027t\u0026nbspbe on board either.Jones says: “The ‘big four’ control almost 70 per cent\u0026nbspof the market and if any of them have a supply chain advantage post-Brexit, it offers them an opportunity to gain market share, says Jones.\u0026nbspI cannot see them wanting to help their competitors. They will want to help their own customers.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“As to suppliers, if they can sell the stock they have, they will, and they may well be able to make a better profit if supply is tight. \u0026nbspIf they cannot sell or use their raw materials, there is nothing stopping them picking up the phone to their competitors and selling raw materials now. \u0026nbspRelaxing rules on anti-competitive behaviour is, in my view, unlikely to help shortages and I cannot see the Government going for it.”\u0026nbspThe pound is a quarter of a per cent lower against the dollar so far today at $1.2137, not far off the 31-month low of $1.2080 it hit last week.\u0026nbspAgainst the euro, sterling is down 0.1 of a cent, leaving it slightly above the 23-month low reached yesterday.\u0026nbspWith little to look out for on the economic calendar, Connor Cambell, financial analyst at Spreadex, predicts markets will remain incredibly susceptible to the minutiae of the trade war and comments from Donald Trump.Twitter has revealed it may have used some people\u0027s personal data to target them with advertising without their permission because of issues within the platform\u0027s settings, the\u0026nbspPress Association\u0026nbspreports.The social media giant said it had recently discovered issues in its website where settings choices may not have worked as intended, resulting in some gathered data being used to personalise advertising.Twitter said it fixed the issues on 5 August.In a blog post discussing the problems, Twitter detailed how, in one case, data may have been shared with advertisers despite not receiving user permission to do so.Donald Trump\u0027s trade war with China has pushed oil prices to a new seven-month low as the outlook for the global economy looks increasingly bleak.\u0026nbspBrent crude is down 0.6\u0026nbspper cent to $58.31.\u0026nbspThe US president attacked Beijing this week for allegedly manipulating its currency to make Chinese exports more competitive.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe UK government is yet to respond to a request by the food industry to waive parts of competition law so that companies can cooperate after a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspto mitigate\u0026nbspfood shortages.\u0026nbspFull story from business and economics editor Olesya Dmitracova here:\u0026nbspBrexit: UK food industry asks for rule waiver to tackle food shortages after no-dealOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Savings would fail to provide an ample buffer as consumers have already dissaved significantly since the EU referendum. In fact, the saving rate is running close to its record low levels.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBusiness investment may also slow further as a falling pound with potential for further depreciation could spook investors. Furthermore, the benefit of rising exports usually associated with a weaker currency has not yet been felt by UK businesses, which suggests we may see little boost to exports from a weak pound.\u0026nbspLooking beyond pound v dollar, things are even worse for the pound.\u0026nbspAgainst a trade-weighted basket of major currencies, sterling hit a 33-month low on 30 July\u0026nbspSterling’s recent tumble suggests that a no-deal Brexit could take the pound into uncharted territory, says\u0026nbspSilvia Dall’Angelo, Senior Economist at Hermes Investment Management.\u0026nbspAgainst the dollar, that could mean $1.05 to $1.10 but, Given the tendency for financial markets to overshoot, no-deal Brexit could easily push the pound to parity with the dollar which has never happened before.\u0026nbspShe adds:\u0026nbspGoing forward, there is scope for wider ranges of value for the pound, including the possibility of an increase if MPs are able to successfully block a no-deal Brexit in Parliament, but realistically, the next few months don’t hold much promise for the currency. \u0026nbspSeptember and October could be wildly volatile months for sterling.\u0026nbspGood morning and welcome to The Independent\u0027s live coverage of business and economics events around the world.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAnalysts are predicting that the pound, already battered by Boris Johnson\u0027s premiership, is set to fall further in the coming weeks.\u0026nbspHouse prices are also suffering in the Brexit gloom, according to a poll of surveyors.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

to decide where to prioritise shipments - they will have to provide cast-iron written reassurances that competition law will not be strictly applied to those discussions,” FDF\u0027s chief operating officer Tim Rycroft told the BBC.\u0026nbspIn the markets, Asian stocks were down on Wednesday while European bourses gained in morning trading.\u0026nbspDominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has\u0026nbsppraised Donald Trump and his deputy Mike Pence for their warmth and enthusiasm for the UK-US relationship.\u0026nbspRaab says he was delighted to meet the pair on his three-day trip to the US in hope of paving the way for a post-Brexit trade deal.The UK looks forward to working with our American friends to reach a free trade deal that is good for both countries, and co-operating on the common security challenges we face.\u0026nbspE.On is the latest “Big Six” energy supplier to blame the government’s price cap for plummeting profits.The cap, which will be reduced this winter, is supposed to stop firms ripping off loyal customers.The German utility’s earnings from UK retail customers crashed 78 per cent in the latest quarter.Customer numbers fell by around 200,000 to 6.4 million in the three months to March.Bad news for E.On today but good news for about 15 million households who will see their energy bills fall this winter.\u0026nbspAnnual energy bills will go down by £75 on average for 11 million households on standard tariffs and by £25 for customers who pay for their gas and electricity upfront.\u0026nbspOfgem, the energy regulator for England, Wales and Scotland, is lowering the price caps for the October to March period due to lower wholesale energy prices.Full story here from Olesya Dmitracova:Energy bills to fall for 15 million households this winter as Ofgem lowers price capsExecutives at Hargreaves Lansdown will give up their bonuses after the Woodford fund fiasco, Reuters\u0026nbspis reporting.\u0026nbspAccording to the nes agency\u0027s source, Hargreaves\u0027 chief executive Chris Hill, Chief financial officer Philip Johnson, chief investment officer Lee Gardhouse and research director Mark Dampier, will take no bonus for 2019.\u0026nbspHargreaves plugged Woodford\u0027s fund through its best buy list and received fees for referring customers.\u0026nbspHundreds of thousands of Hargreaves Lansdown customers who ploughed their savings into Woodford\u0027s flagship fund have had their money frozen since June and it will likely stay there until at least December as the once highly regarded stock picker tries to sort out the mess he is in.\u0026nbspWoodford invested in riskier unlisted stocks which he couldn\u0027t get rid of fast enough when a long run of poor performance prompted people to demands their cash back.House prices have fallen for the second successive month, Halifax says.The average UK house price was down 2 per cent in July to\u0026nbsp£236,120 following a 0.4 per cent monthly decline in June.However, the lender said prices were still up 4.1 per cent in the year to July.Brexit uncertainty will weigh on the UK housing market over the next few months according to analysts at the EY ITEM Club.\u0026nbspConsumers may well be particularly cautious about committing to buying a house, especially as house prices are relatively expensive relative to incomes, says Howard Archer.\u0026nbspHouse prices are still far higher compared to earnings than the average over the last 35 years.\u0026nbspAccording to the Halifax, the house price to earnings ratio was still as high as 5.59 in July after spiking to 5.72 in February (the highest level since November 2017) from 5.39 in January this is well above the long-term (1983-2019) average of 4.29.\u0026nbspAnd it is questionable whether recent growth in jobs numbers and earnings can be sustained months as companies tailor their behaviour to a lacklustre domestic economy, prolonged Brexit uncertainties and a challenging global environment.\u0026nbspTherefore Archer forecats\u0026nbspthat house prices will rise by no more than 1.5 per cent in 2019.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTesla is in a spot of bother in the US.\u0026nbspBloomberg\u0026nbspreports that Elon Musk\u0027s firm has been scrutinised over safety claims on its Model 3 the car intended to take electric vehicles truly into the mainstream.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspUS\u0026nbspNational Highway Traffic Administration reportedly sent a cease and desist letter last year, taking issue with Tesla\u0027s\u0026nbspclaim that the Model 3 had achieved the lowest probability of injury of any vehicle the agency ever tested.So, what exactly is Britain\u0027s food industry saying it needs the government to do to prevent food shortages after Brexit?\u0026nbspIt\u0027s trade body wants firms\u0026nbspto be allowed\u0026nbspco-ordinate and direct supplies with each other if Britain crashes out of the EU on 31 October.\u0026nbspThey cant do that under current rules which prevent them colluding. Those\u0026nbspmeasures are designed to ensure adequate competition and result in the best outcome for consumers.The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) said: “We asked for these reassurances at the end of last year, but we\u0027re still waiting.”\u0026nbspThe industry says that an October Brexit would be disastrous for food supplies because warehouses are already full in the run-up to Christmas.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOne retailer told the BBC that 31 October\u0026nbsp“is about the worst day you can pick”, as warehouse capacity is at 105 per cent\u0026nbspin November, versus 75 per cent - 80 per cent\u0026nbspin March.The government isn\u0027t being entirely up-front about the potentially dire consequences of no-deal Brexit for fresh food and drink supplies, according to a leading academic on the topic.\u0026nbspTim Lang, professor of food policy at City University, warned earlier this week that the UK’s food supply faces levels of disruption “unprecedented” in peacetime.\u0026nbspWhat does that mean?\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\tThe government estimates that half of lorries entering the country will be unable to cross the border smoothly\tThe flow of trucks could drop by a third within a day of a no-deal Brexit\tFood prices predicted to rise by more than 10 per cent as costs rise and supplies fall.Professor Lang warns\u0026nbspthat Britons, particularly those on lower incomes, already under-consume fresh fruit and vegetables, and food banks are not fully prepared for shortages, which could have a negative impact on diets and public health.\u0026nbspFull story here:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBrexit food shortages: Government being secretive over public health risks of no dealThousands of holidaymakers have had their flights cancelled due to more technology failures at British Airways.\u0026nbspSimon Calder has counted\u0026nbsp86 cancellations to and from Heathrow so far today, including one round-trip to New York and dozens of flights to Mediterranean resorts.

Unfortunately, even the food industry, which has tested a range of options to mitigate the effect of massive disruption at Dover, doesn\u0027t really know.\u0026nbspFood and Drink Federation boss Tim Rycroft tells the BBC:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThere will be selective shortages and they will to some extent be random because it depends on which trucks get through and which don\u0027t. We think there will be some serious disruption and it will go on for weeks or months after our exit.The government is unlikely to grant the food industry\u0027s wish for\u0026nbsprelaxed rules to alleviate food supply problems, says Mark Jones, partner at law firm Gordons. Big supermarkets\u0026nbspprobably won\u0027t\u0026nbspbe on board either.Jones says: “The ‘big four’ control almost 70 per cent\u0026nbspof the market and if any of them have a supply chain advantage post-Brexit, it offers them an opportunity to gain market share, says Jones.\u0026nbspI cannot see them wanting to help their competitors.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

Since culture has always been a source of inspiration for necessary change, we look forward to inspiring and being part of the future of our society.Reading and Leeds are keeping themselves on the wrong side of historyEdinburgh Festival excludes black artists like me, so I created my ownKate Nash claims the music industry has \u0027killed a lot of people\u0027Further details will be revealed at the Reeperbahn Festival on September 18 during a panel with Keychange ambassador Kate Nash, Barbara Gessler from the European Commission and Alexander Schulz, Keychange co-founder and chief executive of the Reeperbahn Festival.Nash said: Pop culture feels so far ahead but the reality of how a lot of people live every day is way behind that. So it does make sense that we are dealing with these problems because the archaic structures are so hard to knock down and it changes so much of the way the world is run, so it is like a slow burn really.It is like in the movie Shawshank Redemption when he like scratches his way out of that prison and it takes years, because it is just scratch by scratch. I think I would like to be one of the scratches, so eventually someone will burst into the tunnel. But at the moment, it\u0027s about being a scratch. Because without each of those scratches, we will never get there.Additional reporting by Press AssociationThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is a production preview of the Jaguar I-PACE, which will be revealed next year and on the road in 2018These 5G capabilities appear to be confirmed in the official invite to the Unpacked event, in which Samsung describes the Note 10 and Note 10+ as new devices designed to take the Galaxy ecosystem\u0027s connectivity to the next level.Several leaks have revealed an Infinity-O design for its screen, as well as a powerful Snapdragon 855 processor. Other specs include a 3,500mAh battery, 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage space for the Note 10, and a 4,300mAh\u0026nbspbattery, 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage space for the Note 10+.A major update to the S-Pen stylus is also expected.One of the few things that remains a mystery is the price of the Note 10 and Note 10+, though a leak from Russia suggests the Note 10 will cost around £900. This would make it £100 more expensive than the Galaxy Note 9, which cost £799 at launch.Other rumours hint that the Note 10 and Note 10+ release date will be on 21 August, though pre-orders will likely open shortly after the official unveiling on Wednesday.Inside Samsung’s pivotal struggle to deliver Galaxy FoldSamsung is not the only major smartphone maker to be plagued by leaks, with major launches from Apple, Google and Huawei often softened by months of rumours and leaks in the build up to the official unveiling.In an apparent attempt to take back control from the leakers, Google recently revealed some of the most central details of its new Pixel 4 phone, months ahead of its anticipated release date.Today we\u0027re giving you an early look at the technology behind two new features coming to Pixel 4 that make your phone more helpful and represent a next step in our vision for ambient computing, the technology giant stated.The unorthodox move may also serve to undermine its rivals, with Samsung also anticipated to unveil some form of motion control with its new Galaxy Note devices.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We can and should do something about it.”Ella Kissi-Debrah, who lived near the South Circular Road in Lewisham, southeast London, died in 2013 after having an asthma attack.The nine-year-old\u0027s death will be re-examined at an inquest, to determine whether it was linked to air pollution.Dr Samantha Walker, director of policy and research at Asthma UK, said: “It is outrageous that children across the UK are breathing in toxic air that is causing them to develop asthma, a serious and debilitating medical condition that leaves them struggling to breathe and at risk of a life-threatening asthma attack.“Poisonous air is also a trigger for asthma attacks and we estimate that it could affect the asthma of more than half a million children in the UK.“This research is yet another reminder that the government needs to tackle air pollution as an urgent priority and commit to meeting air-quality standards from the World Health Organisation in its upcoming environment bill.“No child should face the risk of getting asthma or having a life-threatening asthma attack because of filthy air.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The summer before last, this plot would have been filled with the sound of 70 laying hens clucking as they roamed about, scratching at the weeds around the raspberries.As part of this hen-and-berry experiment, some canes had been fenced off. The chickens, like tiny bio-tractors, went about delivering nutrient-rich manure to the land around the other plants. The hens benefited from freedom and green space. And the raspberry canes they visited? They grew quicker and fruited earlier than the ones beyond the fence boundary. Even now, after nearly two years without chickens, they are still much better plants.Alas, this story doesn’t end quite so well for the hens. Their merry outdoor tramping proved too tempting for kites, buzzards and kestrels, and several were plucked right out of raspberry paradise and eaten up.Nevertheless, this experiment was worthwhile – it is an example of the mixed style of farming that could help our crops, farm animals and soils thrive.There is a word for this method and it’s buzzing across Britain’s fields: agroforestry. If you listen to The Archers, you’re probably thinking that you’ve heard about it on there. If you don’t, you’re probably thinking about how unbearable The Archers is.For the anti-Ambridge brigade, agroforestry is when farmers plant trees (or shrubs and bushes like raspberries) in their fields – and it can help solve many of the problems facing our farmers.Created with Sketch.Agroforestry at Eastbrook Farm Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Eastbrook Farm in Wiltshire has dozens of organic pigs. The farm is interested in moving them to rootle around under trees instead of fields, but they have to be among older, resilient trees whose roots are well established. The farm\u0027s Ben Raskin points to the pigs in Spanish and Portugese dehesa systems that are mixed in with cork and oak trees, feeding on the acorns. Cows enjoy the shade and shelter of trees – and munching on their leaves. The energy they save has been shown to increase the efficiency of dairy farming. The Soil Association says agroforestry increases milk production by 17 per cent, and reduces lamb mortality by 50 per cent. A neat row of almond trees at Eastbrook, in their fourth year of growth. As long as there is not a late frost, the blossom and nuts will do well. A climate-conscious diet may see Britons turn away from factory-farmed meat and towards plant protein – could homegrown almonds become a British staple? A moth sits on thistles that grow between the young trees. Agroforestry is great for wildlife – from the littlest critters to the birds and bees. Blackcurrants growing on the farm are used at the adjoining pub. Trees and shrubs can ersify farmers’ income streams. It may be more awkward to have to sell a variety of produce to different places, rather than only growing one crop for a supermarket, but if that one crop fails they could be more financially vulnerable. A ginkgo tree with a tag for monitoring and measuring growth and health. Gingkos have been found in fossils that are 270 million years old – meaning they evolved with the dinosaurs – and it is believed to be the oldest tree species. Gingko leaves and nuts are used herbal teas and medicines. It’s also interesting in that it has no tree species relatives. However, Ben says it isn’t particularly enjoying life on the farm… What looks like a jumble of weeds and grasses in fact tells a wonderful tale. These are young raspberry canes, which 70 chickens were allowed to peck around for several months. The birds tramped around on woodchip, stopping weeds germinating, and adding nutrients via manure. The canes developed noticeably more happily than the nearby ones that the chickens were penned off from – they grew quicker and fruited earlier than those without, and even now two years later are still the much better plants. However, some of the chickens were eaten by kites, buzzards and kestrels, so the system hasn’t quite proven itself just yet. A perry company is buying pears from Eastbrook. Apples and pear trees are trusted by farmers, whereas almonds and peaches are more exotic, with more unknowns. In a grassy 45-acre field, a large area has been fenced off. You can’t quite see the young willows that have been planted, for timber, but far in the distance, a few have excitedly shot up after a pile of woodchip was stored on them. Ben was not expecting this – but says the retained soil moisture and weedkilling properties must be responsible. Ben, who is encouraging farmers to branch out with their tree species, checks out the tag on a golden glow apricot tree. He says: “As a horticulturalist, I am of course excited to be pushing the boundaries a little and planting things like almonds and apricots in a location and system that probably hasn’t been tried before. However what really drives me is to explore the potential of the whole system. Will the timber trees do better with a coppiced alder next to them? Will our soil health improve? Can we demonstrate improved productivity of the whole farm as many agroforestry systems do?” Eastbrook Farm in Wiltshire has dozens of organic pigs.

Can we demonstrate improved productivity of the whole farm as many agroforestry systems do?” Soil erosion is one of the most concerning. This happens when soil is washed and blown away by rain and wind. Some 3 million tons of topsoil are lost in the UK each year, according to the Campaign to Protect Rural England. And British soils may have only 100 harvests left, warn scientists from the University of Sheffield.\u0026nbspBut trees protect soil: their roots provide stabilising infrastructure, creating channels where water is held, while their bodies act\u0026nbspas wind-blockers. These factors will come in even more useful with the increasingly violent floods and storms caused by climate change. In a few decades’ time, we may be relying on agroforestry techniques just to ensure we can still feed ourselves.\u0026nbspThe roots of trees also dig deeper than crops, allowing them to bring up more nutrients\u0026nbsp – mainly nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium – from below. The nutrients spread to the leaves, which then fall on the soil and feed crops, if they are being grown alongside. This is nature’s fertiliser and could help farmers cut their pesticide costs as well as revitalise tired, one-crop fields.\u0026nbspEastbrook Farm in Wiltshire lets its organic pigs\u0026nbsprootle around under trees instead of fields\u0026nbsp(Emily Clark)Trees also provide habitats for wildlife down in the earth’s crust and above it – giving home to the birds, critters and insects that are in alarming decline in Britain, whose existence we depend upon for our ecosystem.And crucially, trees suck up carbon, which is why planting them is key to the government’s climate strategy. More and more, trees are hitting headlines as solutions to our climate crisis. The government advisers at the Committee on Climate Change say 30,000 hectares of woodland should be planted every year until 2050 to meet the UK’s goal of net zero carbon at that point. That’s 1.5 billion trees in total.Farmers have come to see trees as a problem rather than something of value. If you’ve got a big oak tree in the middle of your field, you don’t think, ‘It’s great to have a habitat for all the stuff around oak trees’, you think, ‘I’ve got to bloody drive round that in my plough’The committee, made up of science and business experts, adds that the 30,000 hectare figure may have to be revised up to 50,000 if other climate promises aren’t met.\u0026nbspLast year, England was 7 million trees short of the target for just 5,000 hectares, so there will have to be huge changes to keep us on track – putting agroforestry in the spotlight. It’s likely that the benefits of tree planting will align with the environment-focused farming subsidies that replace the EU payments after Brexit.There are still more benefits from farm trees – animals allowed to graze among them are given shade and shelter. This means they need less feed to keep warm or cool, and gives them a wider diet. The fruit, nuts, fuel logs or timber from trees and bushes then create another income stream for farmers.\u0026nbspWith all this, you would think farmers would be keen on agroforestry. But modern farming, which has crept up on us since the industrial revolution and inspired today’s chemical-soaked monocrops, has seen farmers become reluctant to keep hedges, bushes and trees.\u0026nbspMany tore these wilder spaces up so they could profit from crops instead – every inch of field matters when margins are tight. In our mad farming subsidy matrix, which encourages farming with yield-boosting pesticides, who could blame them? (Tearing out long farm hedgerows did become illegal in 1997.)Our version of capitalism has also created incentive to farm lots of one thing – high street chains and supermarkets want to make life easy for themselves by having fewer suppliers who can deliver bulk orders. But eventually, the huge monocrop fields that are fuelled on chemicals will become infertile, and what then?The good news is that, if done carefully, planting trees can boost productivity by up to a third, according to the Soil Association (SA). It can be done in an environmentally sustainable way that also makes financial sense.When cows munch on tree leaves, their\u0026nbspdiet is improved and tree growth is stimulated –\u0026nbspmulberry leaves are high in protein and willow bark has painkilling properties. Or when chickens trample down the weeds around young trees, they are stifling the competition. As with the hens and raspberries, animal manure then fertilises the soil – helping trees or crops grow.\u0026nbspFarmers were being paid to rip out hedges so that fields got bigger. As a result we’ve now got lots of really big fields, with nothing but one crop in it, which is actually quite a vulnerable, fragile position to be inBut before taking the risk of buying trees and rethinking their farm systems, farmers need sound advice to know what’s best for their animals or crops. There are a million agroforestry variations, and a million factors – soil type, tree species, choice of animal, grazing time, fencing, market demands, wind direction, labour costs, stubborn landowners… pass the paracetamol.\u0026nbspThis is a long game, and the financial stakes are high – it can take 10 to 15 years to establish a raspberry cane, and growing oak for timber can take 100 years.But there is advice out there. Ben Raskin, head of horticulture at the SA, is in his third year of testing out more than 20 tree species at Eastbrook Farm in Wiltshire – belonging to SA chief executive Helen Browning. He oversaw the raspberry and chicken combination, just one example of his many devious schemes.\u0026nbspHe’s particularly excited about growing almonds and apricots (now feasible thanks to global warming) in a location that hasn’t been tried before… in other words, California dreamin’. Raskin has now put together a handbook for farmers explaining how to move into agroforestry, produced by the SA and the Farm Woodland Forum.\u0026nbspHe says at least one farmer a week comes over to ask about his agroforestry experiments – four came the week before I visited, with 1,000 acres between them, and officials from Defra were booked in the following week.\u0026nbspRaskin\u0026nbspis encouraging farmers to branch out with the tree species they\u0026nbspchoose to plant\u0026nbsp(Emily Clark)Before showing me his neat rows of young trees including peach, pear, cherry and damson, he explains why this type of farming is blossoming in Britain – after 150 years of decline.\u0026nbsp“Long, long ago, farmers would have made quite a lot of use of trees, and hedgerows would have been quite productive,” he says. “They would have had fruit and nuts and they would have coppiced them for fuel.”As industrialisation took hold, and farmers began to specialise, the story changed. “We were getting bigger tractors and becoming more efficient at farming,” Raskin says, “so farmers were being paid to rip out hedges so that fields got bigger. As a result we’ve now got lots of really big fields, with nothing but one crop in it, which is actually quite a vulnerable, fragile position to be in.How small farms are leading the way towards sustainable agricultureFarming chief calls for ‘net zero’ agriculture emissions in UK by 2040‘Super crops’ could revolutionise agriculture in Africa, expert claims“Farmers have come to see trees as a problem rather than something of value, something that’s worth spending time on. If you’ve got a big oak tree in the middle of your field, you don’t think, ‘It’s great to have a habitat for all the stuff around oak trees’, you think, ‘I’ve got to bloody drive round that in my plough’. However, trees do bring a whole massive range of benefits to a farm.”\u0026nbspA lot of countries are way ahead of us on this, he says, including France, China, America\u0026nbspand tropical countries that never lost the art. In Spain and Portugal’s dehesa systems, pigs are mixed in with cork and oak trees, feeding on the acorns.\u0026nbspRaskin points to a few agroforestry operations in the UK – the Pontbren lamb project in Wales involving 10 farmers is one that has been a particular success. They realised during the Nineties that they were spending too much on feed and housing costs for their lambs. To keep the lambs outside for longer, they knew the animals would need more shelter – so they began planting thousands of trees.\u0026nbspTheir plans worked. But the farmers also realised that the woodland absorbed 60 times more water than pasture fields just 10 metres away. The trees they had planted in the wettest parts of Wales were a brilliant defence against flooding in other parts of the country.\u0026nbspThere were also fewer chemicals running into waterways from compacted soils on intensive farms. And better shelter is\u0026nbspknown to\u0026nbspreduce flock health issues, such as lameness or even death of the youngest lambs.But Raskin says there are still very few examples of agroforestry in the UK – and we’ve got to up our game.\u0026nbspWith the barrage of difficulties faced by our farmers, especially as Brexit uproots the subsidy system, they’re going to need all the help they can get. Trees might be the perfect way to branch out.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He and his organisation loaded the Beresheet lander up with a library that could serve as a summary of life on Earth: 30 million pages of information, samples of human DNA, and the tardigrades.Tardigrades were first discovered in the 18th century, and have fascinated scientists ever since. They are tiny, measuring just half a milimetre long, and are found all around Earth.Much of the reason for the fascination is just how able they are to withstand extreme environments and survive. They have shown the ability to be exposed to very high and low temperatures, intense pressure, as well as being deprived of air, food and water, as well as already demonstrating that they can live after being put in outer space.They do that party by going into a very strange hibernation, where they can switch off a variety of biological processes and then restart them again when they wake back up. They could be doing that on the Moon, scientists warn, ready to be revived when conditions are right.As such, scientists don\u0027t think that the tardigrades will be thriving on the Moon. But they could be waiting there ready to be picked up and revived, they say, and could stay in that state for years.On other planets that could potentially be home to life, Nasa and other space agencies are very careful about contaminating the surface with life from the Earth. But the Moon is considered dead and so restrictions are much less – with Apollo astronauts leaving bacteria there in the fecal matter they dropped on the surface.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Savings would fail to provide an ample buffer as consumers have already dissaved significantly since the EU referendum. In fact, the saving rate is running close to its record low levels.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBusiness investment may also slow further as a falling pound with potential for further depreciation could spook investors. Furthermore, the benefit of rising exports usually associated with a weaker currency has not yet been felt by UK businesses, which suggests we may see little boost to exports from a weak pound.\u0026nbspLooking beyond pound v dollar, things are even worse for the pound.\u0026nbspAgainst a trade-weighted basket of major currencies, sterling hit a 33-month low on 30 July\u0026nbspSterling’s recent tumble suggests that a no-deal Brexit could take the pound into uncharted territory, says\u0026nbspSilvia Dall’Angelo, Senior Economist at Hermes Investment Management.\u0026nbspAgainst the dollar, that could mean $1.05 to $1.10 but, Given the tendency for financial markets to overshoot, no-deal Brexit could easily push the pound to parity with the dollar which has never happened before.\u0026nbspShe adds:\u0026nbspGoing forward, there is scope for wider ranges of value for the pound, including the possibility of an increase if MPs are able to successfully block a no-deal Brexit in Parliament, but realistically, the next few months don’t hold much promise for the currency. \u0026nbspSeptember and October could be wildly volatile months for sterling.\u0026nbspGood morning and welcome to The Independent\u0027s live coverage of business and economics events around the world.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAnalysts are predicting that the pound, already battered by Boris Johnson\u0027s premiership, is set to fall further in the coming weeks.\u0026nbspHouse prices are also suffering in the Brexit gloom, according to a poll of surveyors.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However some details remained a mystery right up until the launch.Inside Samsung’s pivotal struggle to deliver Galaxy FoldThe Note 10 devices come with an improved camera setup, which allows new augmented reality functions, as well as 3D scanning of objects.It also comes with an updated S-Pen that\u0026nbspfeatures new motion-tracking technology that allow users to control their phone remotely.The Galaxy Note 10 starts at $950, while the Galaxy Note 10+ starts at $1,100, making them more expensive than their predecessor.

Morgan hit 17 sixes and set a new record in one-day international cricket, which saw his side win by 150 runsWhile Mr McDonnell, one of Jeremy Corbyn’s closest allies, insisted the party would campaign against having a referendum, he added on Wednesday: “I’ve reinforced the view that a referendum isn’t the solution to the problems in this country.\u0026nbsp“But I don’t want to use parliamentary devices to block it. I’m\u0026nbspnot in favour of blocking, I’ve said it time and time again in interviews.”Mr Leonard confirmed\u0026nbsphe had met with Mr McDonnell after his remarks\u0026nbspand “made clear to him” that a second independence referendum “is unwanted by the people of Scotland and it is unnecessary”.“The 2014 referendum was a once-in-a-generation vote,” he said.The Tories can’t discredit the allure of a Labour-SNP pact this timeIn an interview at the Edinburgh Festival\u0026nbspwith LBC journalist Iain Dale on Tuesday, Mr McDonnell provoked anger as he said that any decision on holding a vote would be down to the Scottish parliament.“It will be for the Scottish parliament and the Scottish people to decide that,” he said. “We would not block something like that. We would let the Scottish people decide.”“They will take a view about whether they will want another referendum. Nicola Sturgeon said by late next year or the beginning of 2021.”Reacting to the comments, the Scottish Labour MP Ian Murray\u0026nbsptold the BBC: “Why John McDonnell has cross the border to go to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe to change a massive constitutional policy on the hoof is completely beyond me.”Venting his frustration, he continued: “We’ve had no explanation from John McDonnell, apart from him doubling down again today, of why he would even consider an off the cuff remark on this policy. Even if he wants to change policy, we are supposed to be a democratic party.\u0026nbsp“Where is the Scottish Labour Party members’ input into this massive constitutional change in policy?\u0026nbsp“He has a lot to explain, but firstly I think he should apologise to Richard Leonard, because Richard Leonard is right. The policy is no to a second independence referendum.”Labour’s manifesto at the 2017 general election claimed independence in Scotland would “lead to turbocharged austerity for Scottish families”.“Labour opposes a second Scottish independence referendum. It is unwanted and unnecessary, and we will campaign tirelessly to ensure Scotland remains part of the UK.”Nicola Sturgeon, a new Scottish referendum will be worse than BrexitBrexit paves way for Scottish independence, Sturgeon saysRees Mogg says Scotland not due independence referendum for 20 yearsSturgeon says second independence referendum will hinge on BrexitIntervening in the row, Labour MP Stella Creasy added: “Nationalism is antithesis of socialism – to prioritise passports over principles isn’t progressive.“Egalitarian devolution isn’t about separation but how by working together as nations within the UK each stronger and more successful. Labour abandons such commitment at our peril.”And seizing on the comments, the Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said Mr McDonnell’s remarks were met with “complete dismay” by Labour voters in Scotland.\u0026nbspEchoing attack lines used by the Tories at the 2015 general election against the then-leader Ed Miliband, Ms Davidson said the shadow chancellor’s comments signalled Labour’s intention to propose a pact with the SNP to “parachute Jeremy Corbyn into No 10”.\u0026nbsp“The fact is this – Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell would happily sell Scotland down the river if they thought it could give them a sniff of power,” she added.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Morgan hit 17 sixes and set a new record in one-day international cricket, which saw his side win by 150 runsBut why is\u0026nbspScottish independence in the headlines again?The short answer is because of Boris Johnson’s arrival in Downing Street, shifting the government’s Brexit stance towards a no-deal departure.Mr Johnson has tried to put the preservation of\u0026nbspthe UK at the heart of his premiership, by visiting the devolved governments early and by describing himself as “minister for the union”.However, his visit to Edinburgh, where he was booed and jeered by protesters, seems to have done more harm than good.A shock\u0026nbsppoll, conducted in the wake of his trip, put backing for\u0026nbspScottish independence\u0026nbspat 46 per cent, with 43 per cent of voters against.Support for independence rose to 52 per cent, with 48 per cent against, when those who said they did not know how they would vote or said they would not vote were removed.The poll by Lord Ashcroft –\u0026nbspthe first to show a lead for Scottish independence since 2017 – had a major impact.Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, said it delivered a “phenomenal” boost for the independence movement, as Scotland was “dragged towards a no-deal Brexit”.While it is only one poll, the Ashcroft findings illustrate the growing threat to the union from a no-deal Brexit.By law, Scotland must seek the UK government’s approval to hold another referendum, as matters relating to the union of the United Kingdom are referred to Westminster.Majority of Scots back independence in shock poll after Johnson visitAfter the 2014 vote, Sturgeon\u0026nbspkept her troops at the top of the hill for some time.She eventually requested consent from Theresa May in March 2017, the day before the then-prime minister fired the starting gun on the Brexit process.May blocked the move, saying it was “not the time” for more constitutional upheaval. Sturgeon tried again in April 2019 but the request was again denied.In May, the Scottish government published a bill laying out the framework for a second independence referendum once it has been granted powers by Westminster.Using a similar framework to previous referendums, the bill would allow a new vote quickly as Holyrood would not need to pass another law. The question and the date would need parliamentary approval under the plan.If the referendum question were the same as in the 2014 poll,\u0026nbspthere would be no need for further testing by the Electoral Commission.There is a small majority for independence in the Scottish parliament, as the\u0026nbspScottish Greens would join the SNP to form a 68-strong bloc in the 129-seat parliament.All of the remaining Holyrood\u0026nbspparties are opposed to Scotland leaving the UK.The problem for Sturgeon is all her preparations hinge on getting the nod from Westminster – and that remains an unlikely prospect.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If Boris Johnson is running, then people deserve a serious candidate too... #LarryForPM #YesWeCatAt the same time he put out an ad for a new butler tweeting: WANTED: New Butler. Ability to sort out Brexit desirable, but generosity with cat treats, combed hair and reluctance to use first name essential... Applications to L T Cat,  Downing Street, London.Unfortunately his name was missed off the ballot papers and Larry failed to be elected - but he still has the most important job of keeping the current PM in order.Larry is not the only Cabinet cat - there are four others with vital roles.From bitter rival Palmerston to the only female, Evie, heres more about the highly-ranked pusses.Palmerston works at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in Whitehall.In  it was reported he had killed  mice since arriving from Battersea Dogs and Cats Home in  - beating Larrys haul of around .In July , his profile took a e after he slaughtered a defenceless duckling.He is also known to scrap with No cat Larry - often coming out on top.Palmerston can be followed on Twitter @DiploMog.Gladstone was put in charge of the Treasury in .The black tom, who likes to wear a bow tie, is a former stray adopted from Battersea Cats and Dogs Home.He runs #GladdersYoga from his Twitter account @TreasuryMog every Wednesday.He caused a frenzy in Whitehall in September  after going missing - but the black moggy was soon back in his rightful place.Evie was rehomed from the Celia Hammond Trust with her son Ossie and lives in the Cabinet Office.She is the only female feline among the Whitehall mogs.Evie is named after Dame Evelyn Sharp - the first ever female Civil Service Permanent Secretary.In April , Evie was promoted to the face of the Governments Equalities Unit.Ossie is Evies son and was rescued, along with his mum, from the Celia Hammond Trust.Ossie is named after Sir Edward Osmotherly - author of the rules followed by civil servants in giving evidence to select committees.His job is to keep the four floors of the Cabinet Office in Whitehall rodent free.A Cabinet Office insider told The Sun the mother and son pair had been specically chosen to avoid fights with the Whitehall tomcats.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He also adds that: “I prefer a quiet le away from the day job.” And the band played Believe It If You Like.To recap: Paul is a master baker who caught a lucky break after being booked to appear on what became TV juggernaut The Great British Bake Off.Back then he was happily married to we Alex and, outside of an occasional media interview to plug the show, his home le never made the headlines.A bit of work and no play made Paul a dull boy when it came to clickbait. Then he had a fling with fellow TV chef Marcela Valladolid and all hell broke loose.Sex sells. It always has. So does scandal, and cheating on your we with a younger woman fits firmly into both categories.When the fling ended, the admirably forgiving Alex took Paul back, but the marriage faltered again and he took up with a -year-old barmaid with a fondness for miniskirts and crop tops.What’s not to love for the hundreds of “paparazzo”who make a living from how many times their photo gets viewed online It’s not rocket science, is it  Earlier this year I spotted Judi Dench out supermarket shopping.Yes, that Judi Dench. Dame of the British Empire. Oscar winner. Recipient of more awards than Mr Hollywood’s had hot buns.And favoured guest of chatshow host Graham Norton. But there she was, browsing the aisles and totally unbothered by anyone.Why  Well, firstly, she wasn’t wilfully drawing attention to herself by radiating self-importance. And secondly, while she’s paid to be dramatic on screen, her le outside of it is anything but.Meaning that, in everyday le, her showbiz currency — the aforementioned “clickbait” — is, depending on how you view such things, blissfully low.But , say, she decided to dump her conservationist partner David Mills for a young barman from her local pub, a photo of her low-key shopping trip would be front-page news. Simple really.Aside from the marvellous Ms Dench, there are oodles of A- listers who live non-famous lives, popping to the supermarket or going for a low-key dinner — for example, not The Ivy et al — with loved ones.Occasionally, they might be spotted and photographed, but they just keep their head down and ignore it, accepting that it’s a small price to pay for the myriad other benefits fame brings.NDAsare now commonly used by celebrities to ensure the silence of, say, a nanny who will be privy to what happens behind closed doors — and that’s perhaps understandable.But asking a lover to sign on the dotted line when you’ve already been together two years is saying, in so many words: “I don’t trust you, but I want to carry on sleeping with you.”Who can blame Summer for telling him to stick it where the sun don’t shine Famous US basketball coach and mentor, John Wooden , once said: “Talent is God given Be humble. Fame is man-given Be grateful. Conceit is self-given Be careful.”Wise words that Mr Hollywoodwould do well to heed.WHATEVER you think of Boris Johnson’s politics, it can’t be denied that he’s working his King Ashurbanipal socks offas our new PM.Hospitals, factories, flood-hit towns – you name it, he’s popping up there to put a smile on everyone’s face and reassure them that everything is under control.He’s the frontman while the rest of the bandare putting in the hours at the studio, hopefully producing the hits. Time will tell.But suffice to say, he’s already shaping up to be the UK’s cheerleader – a feat the more reserved and aloof Theresa May never quite managed.WHEN asked about children, Prince Harry replied that he and we Meghan might have “two, maximum”.Fair enough, I thought. After all, she’s  now and,she’s lucky, Mother Nature might let her conceive one more before her womb shuts shop.But no, it seems the royal couple’s decision is to do with population growth, despite experts saying that, globally, the birthrate is shrinking and the real issue is how long we’re all living.So unless he’s planning to pack Granny off to Dignitas, there’s not much he can do about it. But I digress.Regarding royal babies and, in particular, Harry and Meghan’s sensitivity around their firstborn’s privacy, perhaps they should copy his cousin Zara.She and husband Mike Tindall have two daughters, Mia, five, and Lena, one. There’s no showboating or churlishness, they just give their daughters as normal a le as possible via picnics, getting muddy, painting faces and rough and tumble – as seen in thisdelightful photo of mischievous Mia hitching a ride on Dad’s back.They occasionally get photographed, but clearly accept that it’s just one of those things and don’t let it bother them. A parenting template to be admired, whoever you are.THE author Alex Elle once said: “I am very cautious of people whose actions don’t match their words.”In which case, let’s hope she wasn’t invited to the recent Google Camp party in Sicily which,you’re one of the self-regarding A-listers in attendance, was a high-minded gathering to discuss the issue of climate change.Or to the rest of us – a boondoggle for entitled fools. How  to describe an event attended by  of some of the world’s richest people who arrived on eco-unfriendly private jets and luxury yachts Oh, the unacknowledged irony. Meanwhile, Leona Lewis and ious other celebrities, who advocate gun control, happily took a shilling or three to attend the Austria-based party of Gaston Glock – one of the world’s most famous gun makers.But back to Google Camp where – and I can’t quite believe I’m writing this – residents and hotel guests near the archaeological site of Selinunte were told by police to avoid looking out of their windows to protect the privacy of the invited A-listers dining al fresco.The same slebs, one assumes, who regularly virtue signal their moral credentials by advocating a world without borders, where everyone should be treated the same . . . yada yada. If hypocrisy was a movie, they’d all be winning Oscars.SCHOOLBOY Jay Hughes, , was talking to a friend outside a chicken shop in South London when a van pulled up and three men armed with machetes jumped out.His friend ran off and escaped but Jay stood in the shop doorway, where -year-old Nyron Jean-Baptiste stabbed him before boasting, “I got one”, and leaving the scene.Jean-Baptiste has now been jailed for “le” – whatever that means these days – while poor Jay’s distraught mother Cindy has been condemned to a letime of painful loss.Another devastated mother, Linda Burke-Monerville, spoke last month about sending her remaining children back to Nigeria for safety after losing three of her sons to violent crime in the UK.What on earth is happening to this country  Entire communities feel they have been abandoned by the police while criminal gangs rule by fear – and no one in power seems to know what to do about it.New Home Secretary Priti Patel said this week that she is resolutely focused on restoring law and order to our streets via extra police officers with greater powers.Talk is cheap – particularly when uttered by the majority of politicians. Action is what we need. And fast. Let’s hope she delivers before too many more young lives are snuffed out so brutally.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He tells us what he discovered . . .It’s a Friday night and we are trying to hand in a machete and a samurai sword at a police station — but we are turned away.I’ve joined campaigner Faron Paul, who runs a one-man kne amnesty, offering shopping vouchers to peoplethey hand in their weapons to him.Faron, , came up with his unique way to try to reduce kne crime on the streets of North London, where he lives, after he was stabbed himself.People contact him on social media and arrange to drop off the blades. He collects up to  knives a day before handing them over to police.Faron, who dubs himself a “Daddy by day and a vigilante by night”, was given the two blades that day. Yet when we arrive at South Harrow police station, there’s a problem.There are no police officers there. And while the station did have a kne amnesty bin, it was rather unhelpfully taped shut. Evenit hadn’t been, the blades we had were far too big to fit.A duty public access officer we spoke to wasn’t in a position to take the weapons and told Faron to take them to Wembley police station.For me, this was a ludicrous suggestion.This was a Friday night and anything could have happened.It wasn’t until I stepped in and pointed out it would be safer for him to take the knives than for us to drive around with them that he was convinced.And it was the third police station we’d tried that evening. The first, Ilford, had a two-hour wait. The second, Pinner, was shut.Faron was a promising athlete — but as a teen his dream of becoming an Olympic medallist was snatched away from him after he was viciously stabbed in two separate attacks.He told me he contemplated revenge and only changed his mind because of the impact it would have had on his family.He should be commended for what he does. And while I wouldn’t recommend others to follow suit, I know he’s not the only person who feels compelled to take matters into their own hands in the face of the kne crime epidemic that is gripping the UK.Because for three years now our politicians have been so obsessed with Brexit and debating our future they have failed to spot that our future is happening now.Kne crime has surged to the highest levels since records began in .In England and Wales,  people lost their lives by a kne or sharp instrument in the year leading up to March , according to official figures.There has been a  per cent increase in the number of victims aged  to . That’s a massive hike in young people getting stabbed on our streets. And every day last year around three people aged ten to  were admitted to AE with kne wounds.Despite what people might think, it’s not just a problem in London. Kne crime is growing fastest outside the capital.We need to start getting the message across that it’s not just affecting inner-city kids in London, as tonight’s programme shows with a look at the problems in the North.These chilling statistics are what led me to investigate the UK’s kne crime epidemic for the penultimate episode of my latest ITV documentary series — because whatever is being done is not working. And we have to look at the reasons why our young people pick up a kne.During filming I spoke to one young man who viewed the side holster for his machete in the same way as a new pair of trainers — a fashion accessory.Gang members I spoke to all have one thing in common, revealing they were all excluded from mainstream school before having a chance to finish full-time education. They were all sent to pupil referral units.It’s been suggested that, because schools are under so much pressure from Ofsted to be high-achieving, they push out the troublesome children who could bring down the rest of the class.One of the young gang members said to me: “You tell meit makes sense to put a bunch of bad kids from one area that already have problems into an environment with other bad kids from another area. That doesn’t make sense.”Of course it doesn’t. It’s obvious when you think about it, isn’t it And while some of these pupil referral units succeed, many are seen as training academies for crime gangs.When our new Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to hire up to , police officers by this time next year, it was given a warm welcome.The recruitment drive begins next month, with the ambitious aim of having , officers in place within three years.It’s a good thing, don’t get me wrong. But how long will it take to train these officers And how long, once in place, will it take them to build trust in the community The young men I met told me the same thing time and time again: “Show me a better way.” Faron is a great example of how social media can be used for good. But I’ve seen first-hand how it plays a negative part in the rise of kne crime in this country and how easily name-calling online can result in the death of a young person.Not only has it taken away a le and has an impact on the victim’s family, it also has a massive impact on the perpetrator and their family.It’s cancelling out lives, essentially over name-calling on social media.During filming, most of the people I met felt like they were facing or fighting kne crime alone — from the young person carrying a kne for protection to someone in the local community having to take matters into their own hands because they feel there is no other option.Yesterday, counter terror chief Neil Basu said improved social mobility in the UK could do more to stop extremism than “policing and state security” combined.He added that policies which go towards better social mobility and more education are much more likely to drive down violence.And what he says about terrorism could just as well apply to kne crime.There is certainly no quick fix to this problem. We need to stop young people picking up knives, and this will involve giving them options rather than just excluding them. We need to look at the part played by social media in the escalation of violence.We need to look at the connection between poverty levels and kne crime and to send the message that carrying a kne is not cool or fashionable.And, of course, we need more police officers who have the trust of the communities they police.And, more importantly, government needs to convince the people living on the front line of kne crime that there is genuine help out there. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But things aren’t quite working out that way.While the UK economy is far from booming, it is holding up much better than those in the Eurozone. Figures released yesterday show Germany’s manufacturing sector contracted by . per cent in July and is now a shocking . per cent smaller than it was a year ago.Given the importance of manufacturing to the German economy, it is likely the whole economy is now heading for recession — a fate the country only narrowly avoided at the end of last year.In Italy, too, economic growth has ground to a halt again — after the country only just hauled itself out of last year’s recession. In France, growth in the past three months fell to . per cent.By contrast, our economy looks relatively perky, with growth of . per cent in the three months to May. Figures released on Monday showed a rebound in confidence in the dominant services sector.Of the large Eurozone countries, only Spain is currently outgrowing us — but Spain is still recovering after a very deep recession from which it emerged in .

What we don’t hear is that manufacturing industries, especially cars and steel, are suffering the same problems across Europe.Germany’s car industry is still reeling from the scandal of Volkswagen cheating in emissions tests by installing software to detect when a car was in test mode.On top of that comes the proposed switch from petrol and diesel to electric cars. Many motorists — myself included — have put off buying new vehicles because we don’t know what to get.We have been told new petrol and diesel cars will be banned from  and worry they might be taxed out of existence well before then. Yet electric cars are still prohibitively expensive and can’t travel nearly far enough between charges.As for the steel industry, all across Europe it is struggling to compete with cheap competition from China — especially since the trade war with the US forced Chinese exporters to search for new markets away from America.Of course,we end up with a No-Deal Brexit and tarfs are imposed on imports and exports between Britain and the EU, it will cause some disruption to trade. But it is wrong to assume Britain will come off worse. In truth, EU exporters have more to lose. Britain runs a huge trade deficit with the EU.In  we exported £billion worth of goods and services to other EU countries and imported £billion from them — a trade gap of £billion. Moreover, EU exports to Britain are concentrated in products that attract relatively high tarfs.Cars, for example, attract an EU import tarf of ten per cent. If Britain chooses to impose that levy in reverse after Brexit, it will cause further mayhem in the German car industry.We also have a high deficit in food — which under EU rules attracts average tarfs of  per cent. For dairy products, the average EU import tarf is  per cent. If our Government decides to impose this on imports from the EU, it will mean the end of quite a few French cheese producers.Of course, the EU can avoid damaging these export industries by agreeing to a trade deal with the UK — one that doesn’t include the hated Irish backstop.Nearly half of Irish food exports go to the UK. Irish exports to other EU countries would be deeply affected as so many rely on UK roads. If there are delays at ports, traffic between Ireland and the Continent will suffer twice over — once crossing the Irish Sea then crossing the English Channel.EU leaders want to punish Britain for voting to leave their sacred project. They fear thatBritain is seen to do well, other countries will want to leave. But playing hardball with Britain will do deep harm to their own export industries.Does German chancellor Angela Merkel want to suffer the wrath of her country’s car makers  Does French president Emmanuel Macron wish to anger winemakers already struggling with an economic downturn at home A hard Brexit could cost Denmark as much as one per cent in lost gross domestic product. Their former economy minister Simon Emil Ammitzboll calls Brexit “the most visible threat to the Danish economy”.Holland and Belgium calculate similar falls will hit their economies, with the Dutch losing ten billion euros by . In Spain, wages for unskilled youths are lower than they were in the late s. Youth unemployment is a huge problem. Even qualied youths face a lower annual salary than their counterparts a decade ago.The alternative to all this is for the EU to swallow a bit of pride and agree to keep free trade flowing, perhaps via a temporary deal while long-term arrangements are negotiated.It won’t take much. Just remove the backstop — really just an underhand way of trying to keep Britain in the straitjacket of EU regulations and trade barriers — and some kind of withdrawal agreement would almost certainly make it through the Commons.If not, then yes, British industry will suffer in some ways from No Deal. But the Eurozone economies already lagging behind will take the bigger hit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

With Theresa May, it never was. Brussels knew she didn’t even want to leave, never mind with No Deal.And whenever No Deal was threatened there would always be some helpful soul in her Cabinet to say . . . “That will never happen.”  People such as the treacherous Philip Hammond.Not any more. Second, he’s shaking up the civil service a bit.  It was civil servants who did most of the negotiating — and they are all wildly pro Remain.But with Boris’s adviser Dominic Cummings wielding the stick they might just be a little more amenable than before.Third — he’s realised that the bloody Northern Ireland backstop was never anywhere near so serious an impediment as the Remainersclaimed.And fourth, and maybe most importantly, he’s leading the country with a sense of optimism and chutzpah.Of course it’s Boris, so he may well do something totally bonkers and wreck the process. But so far he’s got everything right.He hasn’t got long to sort out a deal, the days are counting down. But my guess is that he WILL get one.The EU likes to talk a hard game but it usually budges in the end. It is desperate to avoid No Deal.Andit doesn’t budge — fine. A bumpy road for a few weeks and we’ll be OK, better off than ever. And free. The big threat to Brexit is not the EU — it’s our Parliament, once again.The Labour Party has ditched all semblance of principle and is now for a second referendum.Worse, Boris has a majority of only one. That’s not his fault — blame Theresa May for calling an election two years ago.It looks to me thatMagic Grandpa Jeremy Corbyn calls a vote of no confidence, he will probably win.Labour is already cosying up to the Scottish Nationalists and saying they wouldn’t mind a second referendum on independence.There is now nothing Labour wouldn’t do to gain power. Destroy the union and scupper Brexit — Magic Grandpa doesn’t care.Butthis whole thing ends with Labour des- troying Brexit, the party will never be trusted again.Oh sure, it will still get the votes from the metropolitan, middle-class lefties. But its working-class base will desert it, for good.So the message for Magic Grandpa is very clear. Win your vote of confidence, lose your voters. He’s not the brightest of men, but I do hope he grasps this.And Boris  Keep straight ahead. Play as hardball as possible with Brussels, knowing they want a deal. Strike as many deals with the likes of the USA and Canada as possible.And remind Brussels thatwe walk away without a deal, they don’t get a single penny from us. That should help to concentrate their minds for a while.This has been revealed in a new report by researchers with too much time on their hands. What these men want, I think, is the best of both worlds.I used to have a girlfriend who spent all day long sitting on the roof of the shed. Then she’d dart out into the road after a thrush. She was great.Had a little bell around her neck. And did her business in a small tray by the back door.A WOMAN in East London said nasty things to someone taking part in a gay Pride march. She was wearing a niqab, so the lefties didn’t get too cross.Still, it is at last beginning to dawn on the woke liberals that the more fervently Muslim a person may be, the less likely it is that he or she will take kindly to people who have a knack for interior design and enjoy watching Mamma Mia!.This has put them in a bit of a quandary. Much as have those largely Muslim protests outside schools in the Midlands which insist on teaching kids how wonderful gay relationships might be.The same sort of quandary that affects feminists, who are not entirely convinced that a ft chap with a todger and a beard who wishes to be called “Loretta” in the name of gender freedom actually is a woman.This is the thing with identity politics, protected characteristics and so on.

government","story":"But Labour are still lumbered with their dismal, discredited chief.Even as Jeremy Corbyn sinks deeper in the mire of unpopularity, his party makes no real attempt to dump him.Instead of taking action, Corbyn’s detractors just carp and criticise from the sidelines.Last week’s poor result in the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, where the Labour candidate gained just five per cent of the vote, led to a new wave of condemnation.Former Northern Ireland Secretary Lord Hain said that Labours performance at Brecon had been truly dreadful, yet our current leadership carries on regardless towards disaster.Even more savage was another former Cabinet Minister Alan Johnson, one of the most respected Labour moderates, who said that practically anyone would be better in the job.Jeremy Corbyn is not just pious and sanctimonious, he’s useless at leading, which is why he has people around him to do his shoelaces and pull his strings, claimed Johnson.As a former Labour activist who spent a decade working alongside Corbyn in his Islington North constituency, I agree with everything Johnson says.Having observed him at close quarters during the years when he was a backbench rebel, I now find the idea of Corbyn as Prime Minister both laughable and terrying.Profoundly unfit for the highest office, he is a toxic ideological extremist without a clue about how to govern Britain.Having poisoned his own party, he would wreck our country toohe came near to power.But what makes me despair is the timidity of sensible Labour folk, who regard Corbyn with contempt yet are still willing to march under his banner.They proclaim that they think he is a disaster, but they allow him to remain in place.This pathetic ineffectuality was captured by Yvette Cooper, widely regarded as possible alternative leader, who bleated to the BBC at the weekend that there is a real concern we don’t look like enough of a broad church at the moment.What a gross understatement.In fact, the Labour Party is in the grip of hardline, quasi-Marxist, anti-Semitic personality cult.But apart from wringing their hands, the likes of Ms Cooper do nothing about it.If Labour is to have a future, the moderates have to get off their knees and start to challenge Corbyn properly.They should be inspired by the words of the great former leader Hugh Gaitskell, a passionate centrist, who famously told the  conference — where the left had prevailed — that he would fight, fight and fight again to bring back sanity and honesty and dignity to the party I love.The moderates need that kind of resolution today, but they show precious little sign of it.They are not only cowardly, but also hypocritical.They send their angry tweets and whine to the broadcasters, but, by campaigning for Labour, they are still working for Corbyn to be Prime Minister.If, as appears likely, a General Election is called soon, the so-called moderates will all be out canvassing in their constituencies for theof a Corbyn-led Government.That reality makes all their denunciations of him completely meaningless.Effectively, the moderates are Corbyn enablers and agents of his extremism.Rather than serve as doormats, they should take a lesson from the Tories, who have long been ruthless about dumping their leaders.Neville Chamberlain, Anthony Eden, Ted Heath, Iain Duncan-Smith, and even Margaret Thatcher were all clinically dispatched once they were deemed to be ineffective or unpopular.The same ruthlessness with personnel could be seen in the way Boris Johnson reconstructed his Cabinet last month as he sacked  ministers in his night of the blond knives, including even the Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt.In contrast, Labour has always been pathetically soft about butchery.In the whole of the party’s -year history, only one leader has ever been forced out against his will and that, ironically, was Tony Blair, by far Labour’s greatest election winner.All the rest chose when to go, even the poor ones like Neil Kinnock, Michael Foot and the s pacist George Lansbury.Today, there are plenty of steps that the moderates could take to crank up the pressure on Corbyn.They could push for another vote of no confidence in him. They could resign the Labour whip in the Commons. They could boycott his appearances at Prime Ministers Questions and other statements.But, as Labour slides towards catastrophe, they have done none of this.What explains their inaction  Part of the answer is fear of the Corbyn machine, especially his supporters’ powerful pressure group Momentum, which is notorious for its intolerance.In fact, though there has been a recent decline in Labour membership, Corbyn backers still make the majority of activists.Any Labour MP who speaks out against Corbyn therefore risks deselection. For the sake of their Parliamentary careers, most of them keep quiet.But there are also deeper factors at work.One is mainstream Labour’s horror at any supposed betrayal of the socialist cause.This is partly because Labour is such a tribal movement, as shown in the ferocious anger generated in  by Ramsay MacDonald’s decision to break with the party by forming a National Government with the despised Tories.Since then treachery is regarded as the greatest sin, far worse than incompetence or unpopularity.This trait particularly insulates Corbyn, who, for all his spectacular failings, is still regarded by the majority of the membership as an authentic socialist.There is also a deep streak of sentimentality in Labour, which stems from the party’s origins in the trade union movement.In this mindset of supposed compassion, sacking people is what the bosses do, not the workers.When the nondescript Clement Attlee was surprisingly elected Labour leader in , supporters of his rival Herbert Morrison tried to comfort him by saying Attlee’s spell at the top would be short-lived.Morrison was having none of it.The party, he said, was sentimental and having once made a man leader, would stick to him.He was right. Attlee was still in post  years later.Sentimentality explains why so many anti-leadership plots are botched.I saw this for myself working as a Labour researcher at Westminster in the late s and early s, when there were hidden manoeuvres against Kinnock.But they all came to nothing because the plotters lacked the determination to finish the job.The same was true during Gordon Brown’s woeful premiership, when conspirators abandoned the battle when the moment came to strike.More interested in dogma than office, the Labour party lacks the unsparing instinct for power that infuses the Tories, which helps to explain why the Conservatives have been in Government for twice as long. Since  , the Tories have been in office for  years and Labour for just .The absence of hard ambition means that socialists are willing to put up with a dud like Corbyn, while they mouth their slogans and wave the red flag.The wilderness is their ideological comfort zone – and Corbyn will ensure they remain there."},{"url":null,"title":"brussels chiefs want showdown with boris but order him to keep the backstop first if he wants better deal before october 31","story":"The European Commission said the Withdrawal Agreement was “not up for negotiation” in a statement today.Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva told a news briefing in Brussels: “So far it...remains unchanged - this position that the Withdrawal Agreement is not up for negotiation but we are open to talk about the political declaration.“And of course we are willing to talk and engage with Prime Minister Johnson.”The PM has so far refused to hold talks with EU chiefs and will not compromise on his stance against Theresa May’s hated deal.He has previously warned thatthe EU dont budge on getting rid of the backstop, it will be their choice to push Britain out of the bloc without an agreement by October .The backstop, which would come into playa future trading arrangement falls short of keeping the border open, has been the main stumbling block on Brexit negotiations.However, Andreeva said it was not the Commission’s “business” to play a “blame game”.MOST READ IN NEWS\" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   Tm-comp-Teacher-Mc-Devvo-New-v.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" ExclusiveBAD RAP Primary teacher sacked after being outed as foul-mouthed YouTube rapper MC Devvo \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CRUISE-SHIP-BYE-GIF.g stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CRUISE YOU LOSE Cruise ship crewman waves giant hand as late passengers watch it sail off \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AD-COMPOSITE-Jordan-Lindsey.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" TORN APART Woman mauled by sharks tried to swim with one arm - before leg was torn off too \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   KH-COMPOSITE-LEYTON.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" ExclusiveMACHETE HORROR Moment machete suspect is arrested after stabbing cop in HEAD after chase \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   Tm-comp-Hellish-Death.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" HELLISH DEATH Baby dies with  injuries on st birthday after ‘sexual torture by mum’ \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AD-COMPOSITE-Carolann-Davis.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" hols SCARE Brit mum-of-six who vanished in Turkey in a bad condition after being found She added: “Our business is to prepare for a no deal.“Both sides negotiated with the very best intentions and the very best efforts.

And as No Deal nears, and the government and the EU donapost resume meaningful negotiations, it now looks like Britain could crash out with on October . It means Britain would immediately leave the EU, including the single market and customs union, without a transition agreement or settlement for how the next stage of negotiations would go. Experts have warned that the dangers to food supplies, the economy and peace in Northern Ireland could be dramatic. So a lot of MPs have pledged to stop it happening. But can they  This is everything you need to know about Parliament stopping No Deal.    Can No Deal Brexit be stopped  While in theory it is possible, the reality is probably notthe Government is determined to see it delivered.The timetable is such that the only way Parliament could really stop a No Deal Brexit is to beat the government in a vote of No Confidence and then quickly cobble together another government.But this isnapost likely to happen. Boris Johnson doesnapost need to do anything - because leaving on October  is enshrined in law, he just has to let it happen.For Parliament to stop it,  they need to show a level of coordination and unity of purpose not seen in politics since...well, ever. Politicians from opposition parties would need to agree on an agenda, and vote to deliver it, in a way which would likely punish most of the major participants at the ballot box. Why canapost Parliament just vote to reject leaving without a deal  Well theoretically it can, but it just wonapost do anything unless they use a very particular mechanism. MPs could try to take control of the timetable in the House of Commons and try and pass a law which would force the Government to block no deal. They have done this before - repealing standing order  which gives the Government business priority in the house - but requires a lot of effort and wrestling for the agenda for the House of Commons.  Procedurally this makes the Speaker John Bercow potentially a key figure - a decision on allowing MPs to vote on seizing the agenda would be his to make. But Boris Johnson hasnapost ruled out proroguing Parliament - basically suspending it - so that it couldnapost do something like this evenMPs have muddied the water by voting to make Parliament sit some days in October. One option under consideration is for them to vote to delete or amend the date in the Withdrawal Act - but they would need to granted the time to do this.Couldnapost Parliament vote down Boris Johnsonaposs government Yes - but the timetable for stopping a No Deal Brexit on October  is incredibly tight without some dramatic activity. The No Confidence vote could be put down on September  by Jeremy Corbyn - but he hasnapost committed to it yet. If he did, Labour would need Tory backbenchers, like ex-Chancellor Philip Hammond, who have sworn to block No Deal to vote with them.This in itself would be a political feat, as convincing Conservative MPs to back a Labour motion of No Confidence would involve convincing them they werenapost just handing Mr Corbyn the keys to No.    But, evenJeremy Corbyn won his vote it doesnapost automatically lead to a general election.If nobody wins a confidence vote within two weeks, an election is automatically called, with Mr Johnson staying as caretaker PM and deciding on the date. Boris Johnson has  days to prove he holds the confidence of Parliament by winning another vote. In this time another MP could come forward and demonstrate that they had the confidence of MPs, and be invited to form a government of national unity. They then could delay leaving the EU again so that Britain could hold an election or referendum. But that level of cooperation would require MPs to work together in a way that hasnapost happened since WWII. It would also involve Jeremy Corbyn backing another person to be PM ahead of him, evenonly temporarily, as the Lib Dems - not to mention the Tory defectors - have said they wonapost put him in No. The party has already said it wonapost do this. Even more bizarrely there have been reports that Downing Street sources have suggested that the government could refuse to give up power anyway until after October  - crashing the UK into another constitutional crisis. How could The Queen be dragged into it  WellMr Johnson refused to quit then one Tory has said it could drag the Queen into the middle of the constitutional battle. Former attorney-general Dominic Grieve, a leading rebel, said the monarch could then be left with little choice but to sack himhe lost the confidence of Parliament but for whatever reason refused to go.  “The Queen is not a decorative extra... at the end of the day there are residual powers and responsibilities which lie with her. She might have to dispense with his services herself,” he said. Other constitutional experts have said The Queen would do everything possible to avoid becoming involved in any political battle the country finds itself in. So will we have an election before October   Unlikely but not impossible. This is the outcome Boris Johnsonaposs government is most determined to avoid. They want to make sure that any vote, which almost everybody said is going to happen, isn only held after we leave the EU.

Emily Padfield and Les Baker are two of many UK visitors having souvenir pictures taken of them with their prizes, parts of which they can bring home. And a UK former gamekeeper is cashing in on the lust for blood by offering trips to slaughter threatened big game, under the “conservation” label. Derek Stocker’s ProStalk specialises in trophy hunts to South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe. They include killing baboons, monkeys, elephants, giraffes, and zebras on “adventures of a letime”.  And wealthy customers have bragged about their cruel exploits during the trips, which start at £, for five days. Hunters can add more animals to kill from a list of  species, including £, extra to shoot a giraffe, £, for a hippo or just £ for monkeys. Experts believe ProStalk is the last remaining major UK company ­organising big game hunts in Africa. Ms Padfield told how the trip was “truly the stuff dreams are made of”. But the Campaign to Ban Trophy ­Hunting’s Eduardo Goncalve branded the safaris “a festival of cruelty”.  He said of shooting monkeys: “Many of these animals live in close proximity to humans and are used to people. “It makes it even easier to shoot them. This is as cowardly as it is disgusting.” Eduardo added: “ProStalk boasts about the ‘thrill’ of killing animals. It may be a ‘holiday of a letime’ for a hunter, but it’s hell for the animal killed to satisfy their sick bloodlust. “Trophy hunting isn’t an ‘adventure’, it’s an abomination, and it needs to be abolished. The Government should implement an immediate moratorium on all hunting trophy hunting imports. “This is the last remaining major UK company organising big game hunts in Africa. It’s a stain on our country’s ­reputation as a nation of animal lovers. “It also has almost every iconic African animal on its hunting ‘menu’ including elephants, giraffes and zebras. All are listed as vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.  “Britain has some of the laxest laws on trophy hunting. We allow hunters to kill and bring home the heads and body parts of practically any animal, including some of the most endangered wildle. “Trophy hunting is a horror show, where cheap ­bounties are placed on the heads of animals for fun. Britain needs to show it plans to lead the way in ­abolishing this abomination by acting now before it’s too late.” The Mirror is calling for a ban on trophy hunting. ProStalk insists it plays a “pivotal role” in ­conservation. It says: “Hunting is such a controversial issue and ­unfortunately the ­uninformed public and animal rights activists are unaware of how much it contributes to conservation.” It also argues the growth of hunting since the s has placed a value on wildle and created a direct incentive to own, purchase, protect and conserve it. The firm says the ­establishment of private game ranches has helped some species recover in South Africa.

Zoe Sargent, then , began bleeding heavily and was rushed to hospital after suffering fatigue for weeks. The former barmaid, from Beverley, East Yorkshire, was diagnosed with the cancer and had to undergo three months of treatment. I had some light bleeding for a couple of months and some pains, but I didn’t think anything of it and thought they were normal pains women sometimes get, Zoe, now , told Hull Live .I was working in a pub over Christmas and I put it down to being tired and losing weight to the stress of the job.    I booked into see my GP after slight bleeding, and they had booked me in for a scan to seeit was cysts or polyps, but before that could happen I was rushed to hospital. I could never have believed they would have told me I had stage three cancer. But Zoe didnapost have smear tests prior to this because of her lestyle as a dancer. The woman, who lives with her fiancé, Jimmy Hargreaves, said: I was travelling around holiday parks and I wasn’t registered to a GP, and to be honest I never thought it was something I needed to do.    Looking back it’s something I should have done. It’s not something I was scared of, but I just felt it was something I didnapost need to do yet. It sounds stupid saying it now, but I was only  and I was never in one place to go and have the test. Doctors also told Zoe her kidneys had failed. Now she must undergo an operation every six months to make sure the stents are working to avoid a catheter or colostomy bag having to be fitted. However, she was told recently she had reacted brilliantly to the treatment and her tumour was no longer visible on any scans. I have to go and see my consultant in September to make sure the cancer has gone, but all of the radiotherapy and treatments have ended now,” she said. Approximately , cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in the UK. Regular cervical screeningare important to detect pre-cancerous cell changes in the cervix, whichdetected early and removed can prevent cervical cancer from developing. All women aged  and above registered with a GP in the UK are invited for cervical screening - a test which analysis the health of cells in the cervix. If abnormal cells are detected they can be treated and removed before they have time to develop into cancer.Women aged  to  are invited for a cervical smear through the NHS every three years, women aged  -  are invited for a test every five years. Those aged  and above are only invited for testingthey have not been screened since they were  orthey recently had abnormal tests. Although early-stage cervical cancer can be symptomless, common symptoms of the illness include: · Vaginal bleeding between periods · Vaginal bleeding after sex · Vaginal bleeding after the menopause . Other symptoms include: · A smelly vaginal discharge · Discomfort during sex · Pain in the pelvic area Women are advised to attend regular screening and to noty your GPyou develop any of these symptoms between smear tests.

For the past seven or eight months my le and my family’s lives have changed completely. From being rushed into hospital and not knowing what was going to happen to me, to being told I had reacted brilliantly to the treatment, it’s hard to grasp that it’s all over. How do you get back to le after getting over something like cancer  You can’t just switch back to what you used to do. It’s been so hard but the staff in ward  helped me so much.

The -year-old, from near Edinburgh, booked the room for August  having already enjoyed a number of pleasant stays at the hotel, Hull Live reports . But Mr Fuller is adamant he found silverfish in the bathroom of his executive room at the hotel and, a day later, was left disgusted after allegedly seeing a rat from his hotel room. The hotel says the rat was not on its property and housekeeping teams say they found no bugs in Mr Fuller’s room but his experience prompted him to cut short his two-night stay, with the family eventually booking into another hotel in Leeds.    Mr Fuller said: “I’ve stayed in this hotel five times before and it really has gone downhill. The silverfish were in the bathroom on the floor and on the windowsill and this was in an executive room. “You pay a premium price and it’s supposed to be more luxurious. This is the fourth time in  months I’ve stayed here and it’s never been bad but it has really deteriorated.    “We didn’t get there until .pm on Monday night and by the time we’d changed rooms from executive to standard it had gone midnight.” Mr Fuller was happy to move rooms and was later convinced to stay another night at the hotel on Tuesday, August . However, after allegedly seeing a rat from the window of his room he decided to leave over concerns for the safety of his partner and their young child.    “We won’t come back after this,” Mr Fuller said. “We were debating all afternoon whether or not to stay and I wanted to go but the rat was the last straw for us. “My partner is pregnant and my daughter was sleeping in a travel cot and because there were rats running around I decided we would find somewhere  to stay. “Holiday Inn is brilliant but this hotel really let us down.” Mr Fuller has since posted a negative review of his experience at the hotel on the Holiday Inn Hull Marina Facebook page. In it he details the bugs and rats he allegedly found and criticises hotel staff for “pressuring” him over an £ payment he needed to make.

Plank practitioners have to maintain this position for a period of time, with the stance becoming more painful the longer it is held. A source told Mail Online: There are three elements, the basic plank, the side plank and the prone sky e, all of which are positions Kate can hold for  seconds or longer and repeat at least ten times each. The side plank requires you to balance on your side, holding your body straight with feet together and one arm flexed directly under your shoulder. Meanwhile, the prone sky e plank is slightly less excruciating, as you have to lie on your tummy and gently raise your chest off the floor until your tummy muscles beg for mercy.

But tiny Maxime Lasserre has defied the odds to survive his first six months despite multiple threats to his health. His parents Samantha and Bruno today spoke of their joy at the remarkable story.I thought he was going to be dead, Samantha told Surrey Live .I thought he was going to be stillborn. I think, in my mind, I resigned myself to the fact that he would be dead and that anything more than that is a bonus. I just thought he was going to pass away and I tried to focus on a funeral, I thought that might bring me some peace. I looked at baby coffins.    The Sainsburyaposs sht manager went into labour in January but medics at Kingston Hospital, south-west London, decided she must give birth at St George’s Hospital in Tooting,  minutes away. Samantha said: They saidI delivered there, then Maxime would almost certainly die. They said they could resuscitate him, but they could not keep him there, so they would have to transport him. They didn’t want to transport me because,I am in the ambulance and I deliver the baby, he certainly won’t survive in there because they can’t even resuscitate him. I said thathe is going to die here [Kingston], then we might as well take the shot and go. Managing to secure a bed at St George’s was a small victory in itself, but Samantha and Bruno had already prepared themselves for the worst possible news.    Samantha said: The best thing about our marriage is that we were going through a hard time, but we still tried to make the best of that  hours. Maxime was determined throughout this whole journey and in wanting to be here. Bruno and I tried to make the best of it. Maxime was born little more than the size of an adult hand. He was put straight into an incubator and it would be another three weeks until Samantha and Bruno were able to touch him. We weren’t allowed to touch him because he was see-through, said Samantha. We were really lucky because he came out head first, so he didn’t get stuck or need to be pulled. About , babies, or one in every , are born prematurelyin the UK every year, according to the charity Bliss. The earlier they are born, the more vulnerable they are because they havenapost fully developed in the womb Some may suffer from conditions such as behavioural dficulties, long term health problems or cerebral palsy as they develop into children and adults. Some research has found that the earlier a baby is born the higher their risk of having special educational needs at school, the charity said. It added: It is important to remember that every baby is dferent and will develop dferently. If you are worried about your baby’s development please speak to a health professional.   They were doing it all in the room where we were, so I was on the bed and could see everything. I was still delivering the placenta so it I guess I was a bit busy and wasn’t keeping an eye on the clock. For Bruno it was worse because he was just watching what they were doing to Maxime. They only found  cases of babies in the world that had been written about it at this gestation. Eight of them were dead and only two had survived.In the months that followed, Maxime would have to overcome other hurdles, such as a perforated bowel, periods of sepsis , milk curds and having to come through le-saving surgery.Samantha continued: His bowel perforated when he was five days old, so they took him into emergency surgery and I remember having to sign a disclaimer saying possible consequences of this are death in bold letters. We were just in floods of tears and we watched him go down into theatre. When he came back, they said he was very lucky as he only lost cm worth of bowel, which for him is amazing as some babies lose all of their bowel. When he came out of theatre he had a stoma bag, so they had made his bowel and put it on the outside to his tummy and gave him a little bag. That was the first medical milestone he had to overcome. But now Maxime breathes freely without oxygen, something that some premature babies cannot do for their first three years.

She was aposboughtapos for just £ to a middle-aged man in a notorious area of Blackpool as her drug addict mum watched. Tyne lts the sordid lid on how she was sucked into a le of child grooming, depravity and sleaze as part of a Channel  documentary looking into the disappearance of school girl, Charlene Downes. The now -year-old charts her own journey as she went off the rails - despite her middle-class background. Tyne said: “I went from being a kid looking for excitement to being passed around groups of men for sex.    As I got older, turned my back on my family, I got hooked on drugs and arrested countless times. I ended up a street prostitute, just like my mum. “It all started with bunking off school and hanging around in the town centre, just like Charlene Downes and a lot of other young girls. “It torments me knowing that I probably know her killers. “We were doing the same things with the same people at the same time. “When I look into the eyes of some of the men that prowl the streets preying on vulnerable young girls, I can’t help but wonderone of them was the last face that she ever saw.    “Something horrible happened to her and it could easily have been me.” The Murder of Charlene Downes is a three-part documentary, starting on Channel  tomorrow. It has unprecedented access to family, friends, suspects as well as police and legal experts. It tells the full story of Charlene’s disappearance and one of the biggest investigations in police history. Charlene vanished in November , aged .    Two local takeaway workers stood trial for Charlene’s murder in May  but were not convicted. The prosecution claimed that Charlene’s body had been cut up and minced into kebabs, her bones crushed into tile grouting. After a planned retrial was abandoned in , her parents began to give up hope of ever finding the truth. Tyne, a friend of Charlene’s, tells how she was marched down the notorious back alley just yards from the world-famous Golden Mile and in the shadow of Blackpool tower where her world changed forever. She said: “My mum was dferent to most of the other mums. She was a heroin addict and a working girl.    She really struggled with le but she was exciting to be around. It felt dangerous. I looked up to her. She was my mum and I loved her. “Then one day a man approached us in the street and asked her for sex. He said he wanted me and not her and that he’d pay a lot extra. I remember being led down the alley way by mum. “I still had my school unorm on and my bag. She told me everything would be ok, and it was all just part of le. I believed her.” Speaking from her one bedroomed tiny bedsit in Blackpool, Tyne wipes away the tears as she recounts the moment that changed her le forever.    She said: “Afterwards, she gave me my cut. A ten-pound note. I felt rich. It all seems so sad and pathetic. Bur that’s what happened to me.” “Not long after that, I met Charlene Downes.” The two schoolgirls came from very dferent backgrounds. Charlene was from a poor working-class family who had moved to the ‘Las Vegas’ of the north in search of a better le. Tyne tells how the two girls quickly became friends and would meet up and trawl around the takeaway and arcades looking for adventure but ended up selling themselves for fast food and pocket money. She said: “Charlene was fun, she was my friend. She was a year or so older than me, but not very streetwise.  I started to pass on to her all the tricks that my mum had shown me. She had a very dferent background to mine, but we had so much in common. “We had a regular route through the town that we would take, calling in at certain take away shops and arcades. She liked to dance for the drunks outside pubs. The Carousel Bar on the North Pier was a favourite place to steal drinks from the tables.” “When I heard that she had gone missing, I wasn’t too concerned at first.    She was wild and anything was possible. I honestly thought she would turn up sooner or later but the days turned into weeks then months and, here we are: sixteen years on and there’s still no sign of her. “I have had police swoop on me thinking I was Charlene a few times. We are the same height and build and look similar, I suppose. It’s hard to take in that she has gone.

Itaposs an unbelievably high figure, but itaposs an easy mistake to make. The size of our boobs can change for a number of reasons, includingwe lose or gain any weight, but lots of us of guilty of getting measured and sticking to that size for years. So how do you knowyouaposre wearing the right bra  And how often should you buy a new one  Marks and Spenceraposs bra fit expert and technical manager Julia Mercer has spoken to theto answer these important questions.  How do I knowIaposm wearing the right bra  There are a few tell-tale signs that youaposre not wearing the right size bra. Under-boob This is when it looks like your boob is coming out under the cup. Itaposs caused when the underband is too big and the cup is too small. Julia says: A good fitting underband should fit firmly but not too tight. The best way to check that a bra is fitting correctly is to lt the arms up and twist the body, the bra shouldnapost move and stay in place at all times. Side-boob This is when the boobs spill out of the side. Itaposs caused by the cup being too small. It can be very painful. To check the cup fits correctly, make sure it is fully encasing ALL the breast tissue. Tight straps  You should adjust your straps so you can just fit two fingers on top of each other underneath. A good way to checkyour bra is giving you enough support is to slide the straps off and seethe cups are still supportive. The straps are designed to hold the cups up, not to give support. Julia says: Some larger breasted ladies may suffer with sore red marks on their shoulders where the straps have been over adjusted with the intention of gaining extra support. If straps are shortened too much the breast will fall forward and the back of the bra will work its way up, therefore not giving support at all. The four-boob effect This is when the incorrect cup size pushes the tissue up. It can look very unflattering when youaposre wearing clothes. Julia says: This is a common problem we see regularly. Itaposs very common with women who have put on weight as the breast is made up of % fat. Some women donapost want to go up a cup size and continue to wear the wrong size which can make outwear look unflattering. Did you know thatyou wear the correct cup size you can actually look smaller  Back fat According to Julia: Unfortunately every woman, no matter their size, has this issue and can be made worsethe underband of the bra is too tight.  A good tip is to wear a shaped back bra as this smoothes any lumps and bumps. Cups are too big If youaposve lost weight recently, there is a good chance you cups will be too big. This means they wonapost support the breast tissue properly, and it can also make your bra look unflattering. The cup and the underband should fit snugly. How are bras measured  Bras are fitted by taking two measurements, and it only takes a few minutes.  You can wear your old bra while these measurements are being taken. The band size is the size of your rib cage, and is taken by measuring just below the strap of your existing bra. Itaposs recorded in even numbers, e.g. , , , . The second measurement is the bust. The person doing your fitting will when work out the dference between the rib cage and the bust size and work out your cup size. This will be a letter, e.g. A, B, C, D, DD. How long do bras last  If weaposre being honest, most of us have bras in the drawer which have seen better days.  Theyaposre not quite white any more and theyaposre definitely no longer sexy - but theyaposre just so comfy. But it looks like we should be replacing them more often than we thought. Julia says: In my opinion, a bra is at its best in its first year of being worn. How often should I wash my bra  This is something that causes of a lot of debate between women. Some will wash their bra every time they wear it, as they would with knickers, while others will wear it a number of times before popping in the laundry basket. Julia says: I would recommend washing after each use as this keeps your bra clean and fresh. What can I do with my old bras  Of course you can just pop them in the bin, but lot of shops offer a great recycling service. How do I pick the right sports bra  When it comes to buying a sports bra, lots of women find themselves a bit lost. Luckily, Julia has a few tips for finding the right one for your shape. She says: A good fitting sports bra can reduce the amount of bounce and provide extra confidence, in turn helping you make the most out of your workout.  Having the right support for your breasts during exercise is so important and provides the foundation for a great work out. Your breasts move in a figure of eight motion when youaposre running and can move up to cm in any direction during exercise so finding an impact level that bests suits your activity is key.

Tardigrades, also known as water bears, were reportedly travelling on an Israeli spacecraft that crash-landed on the moon back in April. They were being carried in a dehydrated form alongside human DNA as part of an archive of history. But it’s believed highly likely that the creatures, which are just under a millimetre long, are still alive. Arch Mission Foundation boss Nova Spivack said: “We believe the chances of survival for the tardigrades are extremely high.”    The grub-like, eight-legged water bears can reportedly withstand up to C heat and can survive being frozen to almost zero degrees. The unstoppable creatures can even be brought back to le decades after being dehydrated, according to reports. When they’re dried out they shrivel up but they can be revived by being introduced to water again. In , they became the first animal to survive in space. Spivack described them as “one of the most durable forms of le on planet Earth.”    Lukasz Kaczmarek, a tardigrade expert and astrobiologist at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poland, said the animals could have survived the crash landing. Tardigrades can survive pressures that are comparable to those created when asteroids strike Earth, so a small crash like this is nothing to them, he told . Mr Kaczmarek added that they could survive for years on the Moon. Itaposs thought the tardigrades were stored inside a aposLunar Libraryapos, a nanotechnology device that resembles a DVD and contains -million-page archive of human history viewable under microscopes, as well as human DNA, France  reports. NASA astrobiologist Cassie Conley said the exact survival time of the water bears would depend on the condition of the impact site and the temperatures to which they are exposed.

I think you get more for your money here than other places like Edinburgh.”Drinkers Emma Storrier and Kat Martin said the price of drink in the city depended largely on what pub you were in – with some offering cheaper tipples than others.Kat, , said: “If you go to a Wetherspoon’s in Dundee you are bound to get a really cheap drink but they would be cheap anywhere, to be honest.“The Stobswell Bar though is also somewhere you can get a drink for a decent price.”Emma, also , highlighted that in other parts of the city drinks were more pricey.She said: “Some of the independent places up the Perth Road and in the West End can be quite expensive.“It really depends where you go to get a drink.”The pint price data was collected by the site to mark International Beer Day, which was held on Friday August .Costs from  countries across the globe were gathered to determine where the cheapest and priciest pints could be found.For those looking for a budget night, then Mozambique is the place to be with prices at a lowly p.Butmoney is tight, it’s best to avoid Qatar where the average price of a pint is a whopping £.."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44541192-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44541192-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44541192-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44541192-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"dundees game of two halves leaves mcpake with decisions to make for ayr","story":"Dundee welcome Ayr United to Dens Park this weekend looking for victory after kicking off the Championship campaign with a draw at Dunfermline.Saturday will be the Dark Blues fans’ first chance to get use out of their season tickets but what kind of Dundee side are they likely to see run out in the first home league match of the season Manager James McPake is the first to admit the first-half performance at East End Park was well below expectations at the club.With that in mind it’s highly unlikely he’ll choose the same unchanged side for the third match in a row.Half-time subs Declan McDaid and Josh Todd impressed from the bench on Friday night as Dundee came from two goals behind to draw - and will come into the manager’s thinking this weekend.McPake said: “I’ve watched it back and we weren’t good enough in the first half. We know that as a team.“But you ask for a reaction and you ask for character – that was there in abundance in the second half.“I thought the two boys, McDaid and Todd, coming on did really well and we looked more of a threat.“Looking back at the game now it was a game of two halves — a cliche I know — but it probably ended up a fair result.“Near the end I thought we might nick it, too.“Both McDaid and Todd have been in the mix. I like both of them, and Jamie Ness is back in the mix now, too.“It’s healthy we have him back and healthy we have those two pushing for places. That adds to the squad.”So, what are the possibilities for the Dens gaffer against Ian McCall’s Honest Men Despite an error for the second goal at Dunfermline, Jack Hamilton is the undisputed No  goalie at the club and will almost certainly retain his spot ahead of second-choice Calum Ferrie.After seeing the three-man backline perform well in a commanding performance against Inverness in the Betfred Cup the match previous, it’s clear the same line-up didn’t work at Dunfermline.Every game is dferent but should McPake switch to a back four, that’ll obviously see one centre-half drop out.The knock picked up by skipper Josh Meekings and his injury history make him favourite to miss out.Andrew Davies is nowhere near match fitness so that leaves Jordon Forster and Jordan McGhee as central defenders for this one.At full-back, Jordan Marshall did OK and will likely continue, as will Cammy Kerr on the right, though he didn’t have his best night at East End Park.A shake-up in defence would bring another midfielder into play and with McDaid, Todd and Ness all banging on the door for a starting spot, McPake has decisions to make. Young Finn Robertson has been excellent so far this campaign but his youthfulness may see him replaced by the more experienced Ness for this one.Paul McGowan and Shaun Byrne are key players but,Dundee go to a -- that’s likely to see one miss out – or McGowan moved further upfield.On the wings, McDaid and Todd may have done enough to earn their starting spurs.Danny Johnson’s three goals in two matches make him almost certain to start. Less certain is Andrew Nelson’s place after he was replaced at half-time on Friday, however.Injury and illness have hampered Craig Curran lately, though he is expected to be fit for Saturday.McGowan in behind Johnson could be McPake’s pick for this big early-season clash."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-can-recognise-anyone-old-pictures-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-can-recognise-old-pictures-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Times"},{"url":null,"title":"exam-results-2019-east-renfrewshire-ballet-dancer-gets-ten-straight","story":"A schoolgirl is pursuing her dream of a ballet career after securing  A grades in her exams - following fears she would not dance again."},{"url":null,"title":"asylum-seeker-teenager-somer-passes-five-highers","story":"A teenage asylum seeker has excelled in his exams despite fearing deportation to Pakistan."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-elvis-presley-visits-prestwick-airport-pictures-glasgow-39-s-history","story":"A selection of images from the archives of the Herald and Times."},{"url":null,"title":"emergency-services-dash-multi-vehicle-collision-m80-traffic-stops","story":"Partof the M has reopened after a five-vehicle crash ground the northbound route to a halt."},{"url":null,"title":"cake-baked-russian-granny-wins-flour-power","story":"TATIANA Camilleri baked a cake in honour of her Russian grandmother to win last nightrsquos final episode of Flour Power on the new BBC Scotland Channel."},{"url":null,"title":"university-glasgow-cleaners-back-industrial-action-unite-union-ballot","story":"CLEANERS at the University of Glasgow have voted in support of industrial action in an ongoing dispute over working conditions."},{"url":null,"title":"things-glasgow-bloc-party-tequila-tasting-platform-market","story":"Bloc Party, Summer Nights at the Kelvingrove Bandstand, Kelvingrove Park, Tomorrow"},{"url":null,"title":"derek-macdonald-planning-system-focuses-much-past-not-future","story":"Ourcompany is privileged to have been selected to manage a conversion of an exclusive property in the heart of Glasgowrsquos west end into luxury apartments.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

He turned Duncan MacKinnon inside-out before flicking an inch-perfect ball to Fraser Watt on the left of the D and he slammed the ball high into the middle of the goal from  yards to make it -.Lochaber had their first shot on goal on six minutes when Ben Delaney found space on the left but his strike went wide of the left-hand post.Inveraray were showing good movement up front and they increased their advantage on nine minutes. The goal came from a corner and Garry MacPherson caught the Lochaber defence napping as he played the ball low from a wide area towards the front post where full centre Lewis MacNicol waltzed into the box and his first-time shot beat the helpless Callum MacDonald to make it -.Lochaber keeper MacDonald pulled off a great save on  minutes as he blocked Garry MacPherson’s fine drive from the left with his chest before clearing the ball to safety.Lochaber’s Ben Delaney and Stuart Callison tested Inveraray keeper Scott MacLachlan but it was the Winterton side who would add a third goal on  minutes. Again the goal came from Lewis MacNicol winning possession, this time deep in Lochaber territory, and he found the ever-alert Garry MacPherson whose defence-splitting pass picked out Fraser Watt running in unmarked through the heart of the Lochaber defence and he slotted the ball low past the keeper from close range.Lochaber were now up against it but, on  minutes, Conor Sweeney took a corner from the right, sending the ball into the danger-area. Stuart Callison found space to slam the ball goalwards and although Scott MacLachlan saved with his feet, he was unable to get the ball away and Ben Delaney was quick to react as he poked the ball over the line to make it - at the interval and give Lochaber hope.Lochaber started the second period with intent and Scott MacLachlan pulled off a great save to thwart Stuart Callison on  minutes.However, Lochaber’s never-say-die attitude got them right back into the match with just  minutes remaining. Lachlan Campbell played the ball across from the right and it came perfectly to the on-running Findlay MacDonald and his  yard shot from the left flew past the keeper to make it -, setting up a tense finishLochaber had a great chance to snatch a point on  minutes when referee John Angus Gillies awarded them a spot-hit, penalising keeper MacLachlan for a “kick” inside the D. Ben Delaney’s well-struck effort went straight down the middle and MacLachlan redeemed himself, saving superbly with his stick before clearing the ball for a corner.Inveraray saw out the rest of the game to claim two valuable points in what was a cleanly fought contest with no cards shown.The win sets Inveraray up for another crucial relegation battle this time at Kilmallie this coming Saturday.Caberfeidh  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from behind to beat Caberfeidh - in their pm throw up at Castle Leod.Caberfeidh have been on a bit of a scoring spree of late and they took the lead in the opening minute through Craig Morrison.It didn’t take Kyles long to level with Ross MacRae netting on  minutes and Colin MacDonald’s effort on  minutes meant they went into the break - ahead.Ross MacRae got his second on  minutes with Colin MacDonald doing like-wise with just  minutes remaining.Mowi South Division Inveraray  Kyles Athletic The Inveraray seconds and the Kyles Athletic seconds met in a match originally rearranged Thursday  July which was then put back  hours.Kane Kirkhope was playing in a more advanced role for Inveraray and he scored a well-taken goal in eight minutes after some impressive forward play.John MacKenzie was working hard in the middle of the park and he set up Inveraray’s second goal on  minutes. MacKenzie found Campbell Watt who let go a  yard strike which gave the Kyles keeper no chance.Inveraray sealed both points when Campbell Watt continued his good scoring run with his second goal of the game with  minutes remaining."},{"url":null,"title":"ardrishaig community trust maintains partnership with lochgilphead soccer centre","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMembers of the board of Ardrishaig Community Trust turned out on Saturday July  morning to watch an exhibition game from some of the boys and girls of Lochgilphead Soccer Centre and took the time to formally renew their strategic partnership.Chair of the Trust Hamish Nicol said: #We are delighted to be associated with Lochgilphead Soccer Centre who share our values about a community approach to development. We challenged the soccer centre to increase the number of children participating and ask how far and often they could let the young players experience events and festivals where and I am delighted they were able to match our ambitions. For that reason and for the second year running we are providing £, of funding. We know our funding last season allowed well over  young players to receive new strips in the Red Star design and attend events across the UK and we look forward to watching their developments over the next season.#Ben Tustin of the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre was equally delighted and said that the Ardrishaig Community Trust #is an excellent partner for us without which we would not have been able to deliver many of our strategic objectives. We are wholly dependent on external funding and volunteers and we do receive generous funding from other organisations as well as the Trust. Players subscriptions covers pitch hire, insurance and other bits and bobs but it is the support from other organisations that allows us to be ambitious and grow not only the number of children participating but also development opportunities including bringing in professional coaches for development weekends which are free to local children.#"},{"url":null,"title":"aliens invade lochgilphead library","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowChildren at Lochgilphead Library had a fun afternoon creating their own alien friends.As part of the LiveArgyll Space Chase to keep young people reading throughout summer, the theme of space travel was expanded upon at a merry little get together, with the children making their own little alien friends out of clay.While they worked, librarian Sylvia Bolwell read them a story of a distant planet where everyone fits in.The youngsters had a lot of fun chipping in with the story and they all had a fun new friend to take home."},{"url":null,"title":"northern jolly for loch fyne anglers","story":"Nikki ThompsonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Loch Fyne Sea Angling Club couldn’t have asked for better weather for its annual soirée to the fertile fishing grounds of Stornoway.The crossing from Ullapool was as smooth as you like and a sure sign we were in for a good couple of days. Day one saw us head out from Carloway aboard the SYSAC II under the watchful eye of skippper Robbie Bell who knows these waters like the back of his hand.The day kicked off with a bait hunt in the East Loch but the mackerel were pretty scarce, it took an hour or so to fill the baskets before steaming out to the two-mile mark in search of spurdogs. By then there was a fair wee wind picking up and it was a tad rough to say the least, with the heavy swell claiming a few breakfasts along the way.All that was soon forgotten as the battle commenced with the mighty spurs. The action started on the first drop with some thumpers coming aboard, single and double shots causing mayhem thrashing about the deck and we lost count of the number of rigs sliced through on the way up. But that’s what we came for, not everyone’s choice but great sport all the same.In between the madness we picked away at the haddock, whiting, grey and red gurnard, ling and pollack, until we had our quota and decided to seek the smoother waters of East Loch Roag for some flattie bashing on the soft ground. It was good to get into the calm and fish the light gear, picking away for dabs and plaice. There was plenty around, nothing huge but a steady flow coming aboard taking us to the end of the day with a good mixed bag of species.Day two set off in brilliant sunshine and not a breath of wind, it was almost tropical conditions. We quickly got our supply of fresh bait in West Loch Roag and set off for the rough ground in search of a few more species, but there was little or no drt so we took a turn into Clf Bay and settled in for a day on the rays. It was brilliant fun, everyone got their fair share with loads of thornback rays and a few spotted rays coming aboard, plenty of dabs, plaice, dogfish and a bonus lb oz turbot to add to the tally. It was a great opportunity to brush up on some of fishing techniques that don’t get practised much at home.We decided to hit the hard ground on the way back to the harbour. It was quite slow, maybe a wee bit early yet, but it produced more haddock, a lovely lb cuckoo wrasse and pollack bringing our two day adventure to an end. All in all another excellent club trip.This year we picked up  species,  counting fish and a few personal bests. Add to that, great company, loads of banter, a good skipper who makes a mean cup o’ tea and you have the ideal ingredients for another memorable few days away on Lewis. We’ll be back next year for sure.Results: Nikki Thompson  points, Robert MacBrayne , Nick Friel , Jim Smith , Gary Sinclair , Steven MacBrayne ."},{"url":null,"title":"mach1 scottish tarmack rally championship report","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWith  starters and  Cobble shop STRC registered the championship tables were always going to change on this mid-season two day event.Sunshine was forecast for the Machrihanish Airbase Community Companycourse and that’s what was delivered. Some crews were hoping for rain but this year it wasn’t to be. Last year’s winner Bruce Edwards in the Darrian T GTR was favourite and since Bruce had not driven the car competitively since Mach   we all thought he would be a bit rusty.Bruce led from the start and set some impressive times throughout the two days but on the last stage he threw it all away and rolled the car as he clipped a large lorry tyre a mile from the finish line, unable to right the car and with the stage blocked the clerk of the course decided on the grounds of safety to cancel the final stage. This allowed Alistair Inglis in the lotus Exige and a previous Mach  winner to clinch the top spot.Class  had  STRC registered this year and new to class  was Tom Blackwood in the gorgeous yellow and Black Fiesta R+. Tom#s first event driving in anger and showed that with some tweaks here and there with suspension settings it’s a great car to drive. How well the car drives notwithstanding, there was a slight moment coming out of one of the tight sections onto the main runway when Tom ran wide and clipped a boundary fence damaging the front bumper of the car but kept the fence intact. Tom finished third Overall and second in class .John Rintoul in another Fiesta R on the back of the recent win at Crail was on it all weekend but just couldn’t clinch the win this year, John finished second overall and took the class win.Alan Wallace in the distinctive green and white Mitsubishi Evo finished a very well deserved th overall and third in class. Harry Chalmers was a Mach  virgin and loved every mile of the venue. Harry commented at the end of the event they we had no problems at all on day one and the car ran faultlessly all day to give him a real confidence boost to push on harder and let him get used to some new parts on the car. Harry kept it neat all day and came away with rd overall after day one.Day two was very fast. Fastest he’s probably been in the car to date with these faster stages suiting faster cars Harry just had to push on brake late and keep it tidy and with that being said the team dropped to th overall due to some of the quicker cars retiring out.Harry said: #I couldn’t be happier for how this event turned out for the team and are all delighted with the result and how far they have come.#Harry also managed the full two days on the same Hankook Tyres Finishing th overall.Alan Stark in the stunning Red Mitsubishi Evo had decided he was playing the long game and would drive accordingly. The plan went well and they played about with tyres trying to make them last for the two days. On the second last stage on the Saturday the manold gasket started to blow and he lost a fair bit of power mid stage. The service crew managed to bolt it up again but the long stages were killing it and it usually faded about  rds in each time.On Sunday he decided to push on a bit and of course it bit him. The interior mirror fell off and he became aware there was a car coming up behind after a merge but wasn’t sure how close. He decided to do the next lollipop and then see where he was on the straight but in his enthusiasm got to him and he understeered into the bales bouncing off them, hitting his bonnet. He also noticed the brake pads were rattling more than usual and it turned out they had lost a pin. The team had to improvise with spare tyre borrowed from Allan Wallace which didn’t quite fit but they wired it in and it lasted.Class  had  STRC registered crews this year and top spot and current championship leader in class went to Colin Gemmell in the Mark  Escort. Colin had a trouble-free run on both days and managed to finish the event th overall just  seconds behind Tom Blackwood and second in class.Alistair Inglis winner of the  Mach  stages kept just ahead all weekend. Nothing could touch his car which stuck to the road like glue.Inglis said: #Overall victory and a class win  Can’t get any better.#Robert Marshall in the Mark  Escort was looking forward to some decent results but an issue on day one with the car losing all its water put an end to any real chances and on day two an engine mount broke putting an end to what Robert described as a perfect weekend.Ross Auld was a welcomethe Mark  Escort and also managed a couple of days assistance in setting up the venue. Ross had managed to set some decent times on Saturday but late in the day the alternator belt snapped and took with it the dry sump belt causing the engine to cease. Ross loaded up the car and headed home and by the Sunday evening he had the engine out the car ahead of its rebuild.Class  saw four STRC registered crews compete in Kintyre this year and top of the list was Greg Inglis in the Lotus Exige. Greg exited the last stage on the Saturday and noticed the rear brake calliper hanging off. A call was made to Montrose where a spare part was removed from a car and the handover was done half way between Montrose and Machrihanish. Greg finished a respectful fth overall and took the class win.Second in class and th overall was Michael Harbour in the Mark  Escort, on the back of electrical problems that saw the team fail to finish the last round at Crail the team have now got the car singing on the stages. Michael didn’t report any issues during the weekend and brought the car home in one piece.Michael Robertson isn’t having the best of luck this season as the Honda Civic Type R driver reported issues with the CV joint that led to driveshaft and df failure but as usual the team loved the event and will be back for sure.Class , with eight registered STRC in class  the battles were all tensely close. Taking top honours in the class was Kyle Adam a full two minutes ahead of nearest class  car of Des Campbell. Kyle also managed a top  overall clinching th spot and despite some overheating at one point the car ran faultlessly doing his championship hopes no harm.Lochgilphead local, Jamie Miller in the C R Max loves the track and had the luxury of booking indoor servicing. With navigator Ian McCulloch, his biggest problems were brake related but with some fluid changes and adjustments it was just all back to normal for the team finishing a well-deserved th overall and fourth in class.Kayleigh Strachan in the Citroen Saxo finished th in class on the event and th overall but managed to pick up  points and th in class in the STRC.Gary Coutts in the Fiesta commented after the final stage on the Sunday that on the second to last stage of day one he developed a few ‘minor’ issues. A change of driveshaft, ball joint, wheels and tyres seemed to cure the problem. With an early start on the Sunday morning the car was back on form. Loss of intercom on way to stage  and a half spin on stage  cost them a bit of time and after a few tweaks at service they were away again. The last stage of the day was cancelled resulting in a th overall and th in class.Alan Watt was again out in the green Saxo and finished th in class and st overall. A great result for the team with no damage or mechanical issues to report.Class  had four teams registered in the STRC this year at Mach  but only one managed to finish.

Goddards were granted permission to turn the house into a wedding venue with marquees in July , but Scottish Borders Council imposed strict conditions on the use after receiving strong objections from

It is bounded to the west by Montgomerie Terrace.ldquoThe proposed new development will be accessed via a new access created off Montgomerie Terrace, with the two new houses towards the front of the site, which replace the existing ldquodoran pre-fab and former canoe shed, accessed off the B.ldquoThese proposed homes reflect high standards of design to ensure successful integration with the character of the local area, without damaging the design characteristics of the conservation area.ldquoThe materials, scale and height of the surrounding area have all been assessed to ensure the proposed development is in keeping with the existing housing.The plans attracted five objections relating to the height of the buildings in relation to nearby properties, and raised issues surrounding privacy and sunlight.However, at a meeting of Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday August , planning officers urged councillors to approve the plans.In a written submission to the committee, planning officer Julie Hayward writes: ldquoThe main issue with the development is the potential impact of the dwellinghouses proposed on plots five and seven on the light, privacy and outlook of Orchard House to the east due to the position of the proposed houses and dfering ground levels.ldquoThe agent has submitted a drawing to show the relationship between the three houses and section drawings showing ground levels.ldquoIn terms of the impact of the proposed house on plot seven, the proposed house would have two bedroom windows in the east elevation at ground floor level and would be on slightly lower ground. Applying the guidelines in the approved supplementary planning guidance, there would be no signicant loss of light or privacy to Orchard House from this property.ldquoIn terms of the impact of the house on plot five on Orchard house, the garage would be positioned on the eastern side of the proposed house and the decking is shown on the western side beyond the rear wing.ldquoThere would be a window and door to the garage and a window to a WC in the rear elevation, which are not considered to be habitable rooms. There would be a large glazed area in the rear wing serving the living room.ldquoThe house is on signicantly higher ground than Orchard House.ldquoAgain, when applying the approved guidance there would be no direct overlooking and no loss of privacy to the habitable rooms of Orchard House.Kelso councillor Simon Mountford said he did not object to the proposals, but wanted to see a design change: ldquoWhat we have here those very boring roof shapes, although I appreciate modern roofs do not have chimneys or anything to break them up a little bit.ldquoIrsquom wonderingwe could ask the developer to break up the roof lines with some new designs.Tweeddale West councillor Eric Small told the committee: ldquoIrsquom quite happy with the way itrsquos sited in this location, so Irsquom going to go with the officers on this one.

humpback whale spotted off the coast of Scotland has been tracked with the help of social media.Humpback whales are known to make vast migrations between their breeding and feeding grounds, and are increasingly being seen in UK seas.Now the first ever confirmed record ofa UK-sighted whale hundreds of miles away in its summer feeding grounds in the high Arctic has been revealed, after its picture was spotted on Facebook by volunteer ldquocitizen scientists.--\"A photograph of the humpback whale in the Arctic was found by volunteer citizen scientists --Scientists studying the photographs and sightings of the whales in Scotlandrsquos Firth of Forth posted on social media believe the area is being used as a ldquoservice station on their long journey from the Arctic to the Tropics.The Firth of Forth appears to have become a winter hotspot for the giant marine mammals, with one humpback nicknamed ldquoVYking by local whale watchers due to its striking Y marking on the underside of its tail.Volunteers from theForth Marine Mammals Project, armed with a photograph of VYking who was one of four whales regularly seen in the firth in winter , worked with scientists to seethey could find a record of the mammal where.There was no sign of the humpback whale in scientic catalogues but a trawl through the internet by the volunteers turned up a picture on Facebook of VYking taken the previous summer off Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago in the high Arctic.--\" srcset\"https:content.assets.pressassociation.io    fce-d--bae-ebcbb.jpg w, https:content.assets.pressassociation.io

spotted from the shore of the firth, finding  validated sightings with pictures between January  and March , , and  between January  and February  in .In a study published in the journal Marine

marine biologists that led the study, said: ldquoUntil , humpback whales had only been recorded a handful of times in the Firth of Forth over the past century ndash now wersquore seeing them every winter on an almost daily basis.ldquoUK seas are full of amazing wildle, so keep an eye on the waves next time yoursquore at the coast and please share anything you happen to photograph with your local wildle organisation ndash it could be the start of a new discovery.Daniel Moore, co-lead author, said: ldquoThis research shows that UK seas play an important role in the migrations of some humpback whales and demonstrates the need for effective conservation of our marine environment.ldquoWe hope to continue our research in order to understand more about these movements and the

are fortunate in Scotland to have a way out of such dficulties in the form of a Debt Arrangement Scheme , which is one of Scotland’s best-kept secrets.  It’s available from charitable organisations such as StepChange and from commercial debt advisers such as TC Debt Solutions, too.  It is a Scottish Government scheme that is legally binding and prevents creditors from taking further action against people who owe money.Set up back in  by the Scottish Government, the scheme allows people to freeze interest and charges on their debts and pay their debts off interest-free over a longer period of time.  This brings payments down to levels that people can afford and gives people the chance to get their lives back on track.  Interest and charges are simply written off.Apart from reducing debt, one of the best things about the DAS scheme is that it protects people from their creditors but is not a form of insolvency: people get to pay back their debt in an affordable way.  Lenders like the scheme because they know they will eventually get their money back – and borrowers like it because they don’t have to pay interest charges and they get longer to pay their debts off.  It’s a case of everyone wins.There’s plenty of information about the Debt Arrangement Scheme online at  www.aib.gov.uk debt-arrangement-scheme.  Thousands of people have used the scheme, but so many more could get this help – whether through financial charities or commercial organisations.Richard Gardiner,"},{"url":null,"title":"letter thanks","story":"I#m pleased to report the day raised £ for

summer tournament, winning the competition in , the one-off match was played in a good spirit, but it was the Pupils who found their ruthless streak to snatch a win in the closing minutes.Rhu, fielding a team with plenty of height and energy, featuring several former youth players from Dumbarton FC # and former teammates of Pupils’ playmaker Donald McCallum # threatened early on.At the other end, though, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils had first-half chances, with Scott Souden and youngster Calum McKillop both having one-on-one opportunities, but their efforts were stopped by the Rhu keeper.The second half exploded into le on the hour mark as former Sons youth Callum Scott made his mark for Rhu, turning inside his marker to curl a classy left-footed finish beyond stand-in goalkeeper Ellis Robertson.Undeterred, the Pupils searched for an equaliser, and were given the opportunity minutes later when a Rhu handball in the box was penalised by referee Thomas d’Alessandro.John McCallum, playing as sweeper in a back three with Fraser Wylie and Ross Souden, stepped up to send the keeper the wrong way and make it -.However, after a lapse in concentration, the Pupils conceded a second goal, a cleverly guided header from a near-post corner evading Robertson in goal.Then, with the -degree heat and high humidity making the game hard work for both teams, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils rallied to equalise.A sweeping move involving midfield trio Keith Mitchell, Stuart Crossan and Donald McCallum found Scott Souden, who made no mistake when bearing down on goal, lashing a right-foot shot past the Rhu keeper, to the delight of his teammates and the clutch of Campbeltonians making the long journey to spectate.Then, in the dying seconds, after seeing shots blocked at their own end, thanks to some vital interventions from Robertson, the Pupils stole a winner when midfield substitute Finn Scott was teed up by Scott Souden to slot the ball home low beyond the Rhu keeper, ensuring the visitors completed pre-season unbeaten.Pupils manager Campbell Robertson said: ‘The conditions were tough, but the boys played really well, and our shape was good too. We would like to thank Rhu Amateurs for their excellent post-match hospitality.’Meanwhile, the Pupils’ centenary season officially starts tomorrowwhen they host Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star at

What were saying is its unnecessary. We will campaign against having a referendum, but we are not using parliamentary devices to block it mdash its as simple as that.\"Put to him that this was a change in Labours policy, Mr McDonnell said: \"Thats the debate we are now having about how we go forward.\"My view is we shouldnt be allowed in this way to be manipulated by Nicola Sturgeon in that referendum debate, by trying to accuse a UK parliament of blocking the will of the Scottish people.\"He later added: ldquoIt shouldnrsquot be down to English parliamentarians to block the will of the Scottish people.\"Mr McDonnell said he had made his position clear in interviews over the last three years.And he said Jeremy Corbyn had also expressed the view that a referendum should not be blocked.The latest comments are a double humiliation for Mr Leonard, and have provoked widespread anger in the party.A dozen Scottish Labour general election candidates have now released a joint statement insisting they ldquooppose another independence referendum.Martin Whitfield, Labour MP for East Lothian, said it was ldquodeeply disappointing that John McDonnell has doubled down on his desire to ignore the partyrsquos manesto, and branded it ldquoan insult to Richard Leonard and the entire Scottish Labour Party, which is working hard to win back the trust of voters and help elect a Labour Government at Westminster.Daniel Johnson, Labour MSP for Edinburgh Southern, said the comments had \"frustrated many Scottish Labour supporters\".He said: ldquoThe party is fully behind Richard Leonard in opposing a second independence referendum, which was our pledge at the last election and remains our commitment to voters.In March, Mr Leonard insisted a future Labour government would block a second referendum, eventhe Scottish Parliament requested the Section  power to hold it.But he apparently failed to make the shadow chancellor change his mind after their meeting yesterday morning.Nor did Mr Leonard repeat his March position in his statement, suggesting he has now backtracked on it.Speaking at the Fringe event, Mr McDonnell claimed Mr Leonard \"understands where Im coming from\".:Richard Leonard meets John McDonnell amid Labour row over independence voteElsewhere, the shadow chancellor once again ruled out any pact or coalition \"whatsoever\" with the SNP or any other party.He said he would not have a working arrangement with the SNP \"because were a socialist party they are not\".He added: \"My own view - I think theyre Tories, its as simple as that, and I always have thought that.\"It came as Nicola Sturgeon said Labour is the \"stumbling block\" to forming a progressive alliance to halt the Conservatives.The First Minister said she does not envisage any formal coalition with Labour but wants the SNP to be part of a \"progressive alternative\" to the Tories at Westminster.She said: \"The stumbling block to that is Labour - Labour are still on the fence on Brexit and Jeremy Corbyn is abdicating his position of leadership by not giving that clear direction.\"So we need to get Labour off the fence and then we can look to stopping Boris Johnson in his tracks, hopefully.\"The latest row comes after a poll earlier this week showed support for Scottish independence has risen to  per cent, with % against.

The Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard, on the rare occasions he surfaces to give an interview, has repeated the assertion. The UK leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has done a Brexit on the matter, saying he will make up his mindand when a request was made. Opposing another referendum is not a whim, it is a central pillar of Scottish Labourrsquos pitch to the people, one that Mr McDonnell smashed with a wrecking ball.Whether he acted initially from ignorance, carelessness, or both, he doubled down on his position yesterday, leaving the party in Scotland looking even weaker and more irrelevant. This is worse than being treated like a branch office. Scottish Labour now looks like the unpaid intern to Labour in London, hanging around waiting for a chance to make the tea.: McDonnell ignores LeonardThere is another explanation for his less than soft shoe shuffle into Scottish political territory. He is not the only one trying to make new friends ahead of the great September showdown in the Commons. While Mr McDonnell was speaking in Edinburgh, the First Minister was in Glasgow telling an audience that ldquosome kind of progressive alliance between the SNP and Labour to lock the Tories out of Government would not be the worst idea that she had ever heard.The Scottish Tories have been gleeful, seeing this as a chance to haul out those old posters of Ed Miliband in the pocket of Alex Salmond and get busy Photoshopping. That any deal would be received badly in south of the border was clear from the headline in the English edition of the Daily Mail, which went for ldquoLabour gets into bed with the SNP, while the Scottish edition plumped for ldquoIrsquod help Corbyn get keys to No , admits Sturgeon.: Bank chief warns of Brexit painFrom Ms Sturgeonrsquos side, a deal with Labour would be a certain path to another independence referendum, particularly tempting in the wake of the Ashcroft poll showing : in favour of Yes,not to her then to many in the partyrsquos increasingly impatient ranks.Any SNP-Labour alliance would destroy the Labour Party in Scotland. While that might seem to opponents to be merely hastening a process already underway, or even just punishment for past misdemeanours and arrogance, they should be careful what they wish for. As many a non-Brexit related issue shows, whether it be in the building of a childrenrsquos hospital or exam results, the last thing this Scottish Government, any Scottish Government, needs is less scrutiny.Having a Scottish party propping up a UK government also takes us into choppy constitutional waters. It is clear after the votes on abortion and same sex marriage in Northern Ireland that the SNP takes a more casual approach to voting on devolved matters than previously stated. Even so, how soon would it be before a Labour Government asked for help above and beyond supply and confidence, say  Having bent its own principles once, would the SNP be tempted to be flexible again  Looking at it from another direction, would the SNP really vote down a Labour Government Not for the first time, politicians, in Scotland and further afield, need to acquire a sense of perspective, fast, as the Brexit deadline looms. The sense of disillusionment among the electorate with politics and its practitioners is palpable. To watch Mr McDonnell and Ms Sturgeon engage in megaphone diplomacy with each other is hardly dignied and may ultimately prove to be premature and unwise.: Labour accused of betrayalWith no hope of cool heads in Downing Street as a no deal Brexit looms, it is up to others to make the best of a possibly calamitous situation.

The truth is, though, thatgames have the power to turn a player emotionally upside down, which they now do, then theyrsquove reached that place in our culture already.My praise doesnrsquot come lightly ndash I worship at the altar of the novel. I write novels. To me therersquos no higher art form. My heroes donrsquot kick balls or play guitar, they create worlds and ideas for me to lose myself in, to learn about people and places Irsquod never otherwise understand.The novel, like cinema and the best television, hits you once in the heart, and then again in the head. It works on you at both an intellectual and emotional level. What makes any art form art is that it draws out feelings and thoughts yoursquod never otherwise have experienced, it opens doorways into other worlds, lives, minds.Art is an edying experience, in the true meaning of the word it builds our interior world, and without our interior world wersquod be no dferent to animals. Art gives meaning to our shared humanity. By any fair standard, I believe that gaming can now call itself art.Games are no longer mere entertainment or rather games at their very best are no longer mere entertainment. Games have become capable of epic story-telling, of passing on moral truths, of changing you emotionally.Many readers will shake their heads, but let me give you an example. All year Irsquove eked out a game called Red Dead Redemption , the way I eke out novels I love and cannot bear to end. RDR is a western on a grand scale. It tells the story of a gang of outlaws at the twilight of the Old West trying to live a le already consigned to history. Itrsquos got the spirit of John Huston and Sam Peckinpah ndash echoing with their films The Searchers and The Wild Bunch. It has the verbal dexterity and character depth of HBOrsquos Deadwood series, and the melancholy and menace of novels like John Williamsrsquo Butchers Crossing and EL Doctorowrsquos Welcome to Hard Times.If that all sounds macho, then I have to be honest and say, yes, many games still feel traditionally male. RDR isnrsquot macho, though, despite its setting. Itrsquos rich in strong female characters. The most powerful figure in the entire story is a woman bounty hunter. The men arenrsquot mindless thugs, they have souls, emotions. The world is peopled with beggars, tycoons, the disabled, the lonely, the elderly, orphans, poets, scientists, journalists, doctors, shopkeepers itrsquos culturally rich with the newspapers of the day, the political dogma of the day from eugenics to communism, vaudeville, songs, folklore.Often the best games are female-led, like The Walking Dead, where you play a young girl trying to survive the apocalyptic end of the world. Here, therersquos no shooting and running. Everything is about emotion and decision. Will you help this person  Will you hoard this food  Should you trust that adult I played this game with my daughter when she was . At the end, we were both crying like babies. It had the emotional effect of something like the final scenes of Titanic or Beaches. Those two films are a good measure for the level of art Irsquom talking about in games. Itrsquos not Shakespeare - thatrsquos not what Irsquom saying. Great games are like a well-made play, novel or movie. Thatrsquos good enough when it comes to the ambition of most artists.I knew RDR was quite literally a game-changer about half-way through. Therersquos a point when the character you play ndash maybe the better phrase would be ldquoinhabit ndash develops a cough. Eventually, the character, called Arthur Morgan, a mix of gentility, violence, kindness and cynicism, is given a terminal diagnosis of tuberculosis.Irsquom not exaggerating when I say I was genuinely upset. There were tears in my eyes. It may sound absurd, but then saying  and some years ago that you cried over a silent movie probably seemed absurd too.I felt the way I do when a character Irsquove come to identy closely with in a novel dies. I didnrsquot want it to happen. I was angry with the creators. I stopped playing RDR for a few weeks because I didnrsquot want to watch Arthur Morgan suffer.What an incredible emotional effect, I realised. It made me think of some of my strongest reactions to other art forms. I remember first reading Hubert Selby Jnrrsquos Last Exit to Brooklyn as a student and being so outraged at the violence and cruelty in the book that I physically bit it and threw it at the wall, vowing never to read it again. Today, I read that book once a year, as it remains for me one of the most powerful pieces of th century literature ever written.Irsquom not equating RDR with Last Exit to Brooklyn. Even at its best, the computer game cannot reach the level of the novel, and probably never will, nor ever can. It is, after all, a dferent form of art. The novel will never be opera, and painting will never be dance. Gaming must be looked at as an art form on its own terms, but it assuredly can at least now be acknowledge as a form of art in its own right.As an aside, Scotland had a role to play in the development of this new and most st century of art forms. RDR was created by Rockstar Games. Rockstar Games has its own Scottish arm ndash Rockstar North, headquartered in Dundee, a thriving hub of a global games industry now bigger than cinema.If Scotland is clever and nurtures this industry, we could one day have our own little Hollywood on the Tay, and all the cultural clout that comes with leading a new art form into a still young century.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-snp-betraying-many-scots-remain-voters","story":"We did decide.In  the \"sovereign will\" of the Scottish people was made known in a democratic vote.

There are millions of people in this country who have no savings, whose wages havent kept up and overtaken inflation in the last  years, who live two or three weeks out of every month in their overdraft as it is and cant afford an economic shock\".What of course Ruth Davidson didnt say was that for nine years and three months of the quoted  years, we have been saddled with the excesses of her Government. She also fails to mention the dramatic rise to well over a million-plus people per annum forced to use food banks.What a record, what a disgrace, what a brass neck expecting people to vote for that.David Hay, Minard.STEVEN Camley , as ever entertaining and pointedly relevant, shows Jeane Freeman, Health Secretary, and John Swinney, Education Secretary, finding shelter from les slings and arrows under the bed.They should be ready to squeeze up to make room for Humza Yousaf, Justice, because of the adverse results of the Governments soft-touch community service scheme, and Derek Mackay, Finance, who has faced Scotland with a new pound billion black hole in its tax s in the first year after the SNP Government took charge of substantial new financial powers.Perhaps the two existing incumbents under the bed should just find a larger one for themselves and others.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.IAIN Macwhirter states that ldquoParliament is sovereign in our system . I disagree the people are sovereign, this brief phrase defining democracy.The SNP and its supporters, controlling the Scottish Parliament, seek to inflate the power of Parliament, but by doing so inevitably seek to diminish the power of the people. The SNP strives to win and not to be democratic.William Durward, Bearsden."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-never-ceases-amaze-inspiring-city-line-up-named","story":"With our award partners Arnold Clark, Cala Homes , COLAB, Developing the Young Workforce Glasgow, Glasgow Airport, Glasgow Caledonian University: Glasgow School for Business and Society, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and Volunteer Glasgow, the awards provide a  that celebrates the incredible talent and work going on across the cityNow in their seventh year, the Inspiring City Awards illustrate that there is no shortage of examples of where Glaswegian businesses, institutions and charities have gone beyond the call of duty to contribute to Glasgowrsquos prosperity and legacy with the  awards receiving over  nominations across the  categories.Each of the nominations have now been scrutinised by an expert  of leaders who representing the many dferent sectors that make up our erse city to identy the shortlisting of finalists to go forward to the awards ceremony on September , .Each of the finalists has demonstrated a broad range of work from across all the sectors from caring iniduals, leading environmental campaigns, volunteer excellence, business leadership, investing in young people and achievements in arts.Editor-in-Chief of the Herald Donald Martin, said: ldquoWe are delighted to once again organise and host these prestigious awards.Richard Muir, Deputy Chief Executive of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, commented on behalf of the judging  said: ldquoGlasgow never ceases to amaze me, with so many outstanding contributions from across the city.

Now, the environmental body hopes that this will be reduced by Scotland’s forthcoming depositscheme.Under the scheme, shoppers will pay a p deposit when buying drinks purchased in single-use plastic or glass bottles and aluminium or steel cans. People will get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling. The aim of that p will be to give people an extra incentive to recycle their empty bottles and cans, and make people think twice about dropping them.#Our new figures reveal how Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme could visibly slash the number of littered plastic bottles in the Orkney Islands,# said Zero Waste Scotland#s chief operating officer, Jill Farrell.#We all hate seeing empty bottles and cans littering our streets, green spaces and beaches. The great thing about Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme is it will give people a p incentive to do the right thing with their empty bottles — take them back for recycling, rather than risk them ending up on our streets or in our rivers.#Litter isn’t just an eyesore — it also pollutes our environment and seas. And for every bottle littered, more plastic has to be created, generating more planet-damaging emissions. When you take back your empty bottles to be recycled, you’ll not just be getting your p back — you’ll be doing your bit in the fight against the climate emergency.#Further figures from Zero Waste Scotland also show that Orkney goes through an estimated . million plastic bottles every year. An estimated , plastic bottles are littered in the county each year. With a p incentive not to throw away your empties, Zero Waste Scotland anticipates a  per cent reduction in litter for the materials included in the scheme. This would mean , fewer plastic bottles dropped in Orkney Islands each year.With plastic bottles only one of the materials included in the scheme, the overall impact on litter is expected to be even higher. Steel and aluminium cans, glass bottles will also be part of the scheme. The Scottish Government is expected to introduce legislation to enable the scheme later this year.

Internal features such as stone benches have also been found along either side.The hall is oriented towards the sea and finds include steatite , pottery, a bone spindle whorl and a fragment of a Norse bone comb.The find provides tantalising evidence of the earliest phases of inhabitation on this farm and settlement mound which may well have been inhabitated for over , years.It provides another piece to the ,-year jigsaw along this archaelogy rich stretch of coast as Westness in Rousay — described as the #Egypt of the North#.A team of archaeologists from the University of the Highlands and Islands Archaeology Institute, Rousay residents and students have been digging at the site for a number of years, investigating the later stages of the farm complex and its waste heaps with a particular focus on past diet, farming and fishing practices.Although only partly uncovered at this stage, the Skaill hall has parallels with other Norse halls excavated in Orkney, such as Snusgar, and where in Scotland.The excavation is part of the Landscapes of Change — Archaeologies of the Rousay Clearances and Westness Estate project which is exploring the Skaill farmstead.The present farm at Skaill dates to the th and th centuries and was part of the Rousay clearances during the mid-th century.The name Skaill suggests the site was home to a Norse hall or drinking hall, and was a high status site.Westness is mentioned in Orkneyinga saga as the home of Sigurd, a powerful chieftain, so it was always likely that a Norse settlement was located somewhere at Skaill.Earlier structures have been found below the present farm during previous seasons, and this season explored more of the Norse phases of the site.Three dimensional models of the farmstead can be found here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

More also came out top in the goat competition, with their Saanen cross Anglo-Nubian goatling, Rosie, taking the section.The winner of the dog section was Benjamin Franklyn, a Border Collie, owned by A.  V. More, from Veantro, while the top prize in the pets section was a New Zealand White cross English rabbit called Sooty, shown by Bethany Hall.For a full report from the show, see next week#s edition of The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Understandably, she declared there was “growing urgency” for Scotland to become independent because it faced being “dragged down a political path we don’t want to go”.Cue much licking of SNP lips at thoughts of a No Deal disaster, sweeping gains at a General Election as Scottish Labour’s tailspin turns into a screaming e, victory in a second independence vote next year and,the last prospectus was anything to go by, the  Scottish parliament elections to be for the first independent Scottish legislature. But some pro-independence commentators have begun to question the assumption that Boris Johnson is a gt and a No Deal departure will be the best precursor to separation. It is unquestionably true that the SNP does not want a No Deal exit, but then neither does the UK government, but is a soft Brexit like that agreed by ex-Prime Minister Theresa May really a path Ms Sturgeon doesn’t want to do down For the SNP, it could be the best of both worlds: it would still be Brexit, so Scotland will have been “dragged out the EU against its will” but with customs and regulations aligned the UK would have to play by EU rules over which it had no control. Under those circumstances the SNP would argue an independent Scotland back in the EU would give Scotland a say and with no adverse effect on rUK trade.No Deal is the reverse, where an independent Scotland going back into the EU would mean trade barriers, virtual or otherwise, where none currently exist because automatic harmonisation will have ended and the Irish question becomes the Scottish question. With four times as much Scottish trade going to the rest of the UK than to Europe, whatever the economic impact of the UK leaving the EU it would be four times as greatScotland left the UK.These febrile times are leading to a loss of grip and perspective, like Labour’s John McDonnell who promised yesterday that Labour would let the Scottish parliament decide whether there should be a second independence referendum, which it already has, even referring to Westminster as the “English parliament”. In one-garrulous Fringe chat show, Scottish Labour’s election pledge is now for Indyref , much to the dismay of Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray.Even in the parliamentary recess, the momentum towards an autumn election is accelerating because with no sign of European willingness to renegotiate the alternatives are a new parliament and a change of government or a No Deal departure on October .With his working majority down to one, the chances of a No Confidence vote when Westminster reconvenes in September are high, but Mr Johnson is not compelled to call an election and instead has  days to demonstrate he can form a new government which commands a majority. Onlythat fails must an election be called, so it is not unfeasible for an election to be after October  by which time the UK will have left the EU without a deal.The Conservative position of honouring the results of the  and  referenda and opposing re-runs of both has the benefit of consistency and for the sake of the Union Scottish Conservatives have no alternative but to get right behind the UK government and be ready for November .

The goodwill for such agreements was there, she added.It is easy to see the appeal of such agreements for those voters who believe that Brexit – especially the no-deal iety now envisaged by the Prime Minister – represents a catastrophic act of self-harm. If Swinson and the leaders of other avowedly anti-Brexit parties could reach agreements in key constituencies across the UK to stand only the candidate with the greatest chance of winning then, surely, the chances of the Johnson project being stopped in its tracks would be greatly enhanced.There are just one or two small hurdles in the way…The first of these is the fact that, although speculation runs feverishly, Johnson has not yet called a general election.It’s certainly true that many Conservative Party MPs would like the new PM to capitalise on a boost in the polls to try to increase their numbers at Westminster, but others believe this might be a risky strategy. If Nigel Farage’s Brexit Partysplits the right-wing Eurosceptic vote, then a snap election could bring the Johnson premiership to a sudden end.But let us imagine that Johnson goes down the general election route before the current Brexit deadline of  October and that Swinson sets about trying to build an anti-Brexit coalition. She might have been able to persuade Plaid and the Greens to step aside in a single by-election, but would these parties really be so keen to lay down their electoral chances across the country  Would they risk, by seeing their overall votes in a general election diminish severely, becoming less politically relevant And what about the SNP, every bit as opposed to Brexit as the Lib Dems  There are fewer seats in Scotland where anti-Brexit parties risk splitting the vote than there are in England, but one of them – East Dunbartonshire – is Swinson’s own.Swinson served as MP for that constituency between - and was then defeated by the SNP’s John Nicolson. She took the seat back in , largely, I suspect because of Nicolson’s unpopularity. But with a more impressive candidate, the SNP would surely have a fighting chance of snatching it back. The removal of the leader of the Liberal Democrats from the House of Commons would represent quite a scalp for the nationalists. Can you imagine Nicola Sturgeon passing up the opportunity to see off Swinson  I can’t. And nor would I blame the SNP leader for committing signicant resources to bringing down Swinson. Politics is a contact sport and Swinson is a major target. The suggestion from her that the SNP should give her a clear run at the seat would, rightly, be met with derision.Jo Swinson is not the only party leader now talking about pacts. Brexit Party leader Farage has raised the prospect of deals with the Conservatives, particularly in the north of England, to ensure the election of Eurosceptic MPs.Given the result of the  referendum, any such agreements would surely guarantee the evisceration of any anti-Brexit candidates in those areas.Yes, electoral pacts might be made to work for pro-EU parties but they could just as easily be the secret of Brexiteer success.Those now clamouring for agreements to be struck between the Lib Dems and other parties which take the same position on EU membership should, I think, be careful that they are not wishing for the creation of two-horse races in key constituencies across the country. That scenario would risk strengthening rather than weakening the Brexiteers’ squad at Westminster.Johnson is supported by a team in government that is fully committed to Brexit by  October at any cost. The PM will gladly sacrice the best interests of the UK economy to protect himself.This being so, and with Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour still embarrassingly weak on the matter of Brexit, the idea that the Johnson project might be stopped is an appealing one to those of us who would dearly like to see Brexit cancelled at this late stage.But I fear that any plan to run a single anti-Brexit candidate in a constituency would be met with a plan to run a single pro-Brexit candidate. Jiggery-pokery would be fought with jiggery-pokery.It is abundantly clear that Brexiteers won the  referendum with a campaign strewn with lies. Their promises of an effortless, painless departure from the EU have long since been exposed.But rather than turning against campaign leaders, pro-Brexit voters appear to be hardening their positions and cheering on a damaging no-deal departure.It may now be obvious that Brexit is going to be dficult to deliver. But stopping it will be harder still.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Other events of similar size # even in less challenging locations than Lewis # have come and gone. But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great. Jobs are scarce, depopulation of the more rural communities re. So the estimated £ million that the HebCelt generates is more than welcome, as well as providing a brief respite from reality and a sense of something major happening on the doorstep. But just like the visit of old friends tends to be too brief, so there is already a longing for next July."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2465-Raasay.jpg","title":"recruitment drive to restore nursing cover for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe move, which is part of the recommendations outlined bySir Lewis Ritchie in his out of hour health care report for Skye, Lochalsh andSouth West Ross, intends to end a period of four years in which the island hasbeen without an overnight nursing presence.In its advert, NHS Highland states: “Professor Sir LewisRitchie#s Report of May  into out of hours care in Skye, Raasay and SouthWest Ross has enabled a move towards innovative healthcare here when he saw theneed for equity of access to services even where numbers are relatively small…“Raasay offers a rare opportunity to provide cradle to gravepersonal nursing and primary care with continuity while working as part of amutually supportive team.”The chosen applicants will have a “considerable degree ofautonomy” and would liaise with “colleagues and line manager based in NorthSkye and with access to support from GPs in Portree and Rural Practitioners inMacKinnon Memorial Hospital, Broadford when required.”The band six positions at a salary scale of £, # £, per annum are permanent with both full-time and part-time hours available."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LOCHCARRON-GAMES-1-adj.jpg","title":"number 41 in the sun for lochcarron highland","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.Sinclair Patience of Tain and Angus Davren of Conon Bridge excelled at the st edition of the games as they wrote their names into the record books.Angus Davren hit new heights as he cleared . metres to set a new ground record in the high jump.

The results are projects which genuinely improve the lives of today#s residents # as well as visitors # and leave a legacy for future generations. What is even more remarkable is the fact these projects are achieved with very little access to loans. The good work of the community trusts is achieved through dogged determination to raise funds within the community combined with seriously clever navigation of the minefield of grant applications. By steadily securing the funds from a myriad public pots and local activities the trusts ensure each project is not only affordable now, but sustainable for generations to come.In Staffin # home to the iconic Old Man of Storr # the local community trust has raised over £, to upgrade existing footpaths and create new ones. There will be new parking, #welcome# structures and interpretation boards at all sites. The whole project will result in what the trust is calling #Skye Ecomuseum# which will encourage visitors to spend more time and therefore more money in Staffin.In the north west of Skye, the Glendale Trust covers a huge area that attracts , visitors a year # many travelling the long and winding single track road to the top five hotspot of Neist Point.The trust, under the leadership of Tim Hunter-Davies and three new directors, is working hard to develop sustainable facilities for the community and tourists. They have taken ownership of Meanish Pier and the foreshore, creating opportunities for local residents and regional businesses alike. It will be run commercially and provide income to enable the Trust to invest in further sustainable community projects.Glendale # which was the subject of Scotland#s first community buyout back in  # is rich in history and the trust is also looking to develop projects that preserve and share the story of the area, as Tim Hunter-Davies explains: #As well as being instrumental in land reform in the last century, Glendale has a rich heritage stretching back through the centuries. A steamer used to sail daily from Loch Dunvegan and was used as a point to transport many people away from Scotland during the Highland clearances. We want to preserve and share our history with the community and visitors.#In south Skye is the Sleat Community Trust. It has been working hard to provide and improve leline services for the community that also benefit visitors arriving and leaving Skye on the Armadale Mallaig ferry.The SCT currently provides shop, post office and fuel services in two buildings no longer fit for purpose. Over £, has been raised from public and private sources to build a new shop with a community #social# space and offices for the employees of the Trust. They hope to open the new shop in early summer .In addition, the purchase by the Trust of the -hectare Tormore Forest in  continues to create additional sources of income, including selling housing plots as well as an attraction for the community and visitors alike. As trust business development manager Mike Shucksmith explains, the success is based on a combination of commercial and voluntary activity.He said: #To maintain the forest, we have to generate income so we sell split logs to the community, create woodchip for biomass boilers and are developing a micro-hydro scheme. At the same time, we have a vibrant volunteer culture in Sleat who have created a network of paths, social areas and a polytunnel where local school children can help grow saplings to regenerate the forest. The trust also operates #Skyenet # a community broadband network # a community transport scheme, Tormore Explore Forest School and the Visit Sleat tourism group, which promotes the area as a destination of choice for visitors.#From the Sleat Peninsula to the gateway to Skye in the south where a new access route to the island is being created by the members of the Broadford and Strath Community Company. They are developing a cycle path all the way from Kyle of Lochalsh to Broadford. One of the project pioneers is keen local cyclist, Andy Neison.#I used to commute from Teangue on Sleat to Kyle by bike,# he said. #I was really unnerved by the road from Breakish to Kyle with a high volume of fast-moving traffic. When friends told me about the old road from Broadford to Kyle I started exploring sections of it. It#s a good starting point and will become a pioneer project for the highlands.#After receiving a grant of £, from Sustrans, a sustainable transport charity, to fund engineering and traffic surveys, the Trust is now working to secure funding for a project officer to take the Skye Cycleway to the next phase. The community is heavily invested in the project with volunteers coming out in all weathers to clear sections of the old road, but this is a long-term project with hundreds of thousands of pounds ultimately needed to complete the full route from Kyle to Broadford.Over the Skye bridge, the Kyle and Lochalsh Community Trust is creating a vast community and visitor experience on a piece of land known as the Plock.Securing funding from the Scottish Land Fund enabled the Trust to take ownership of the Plock and the old Skye Bridge toll office and develop a masterplan for these two community assets. On the Plock itself, there will be a hub building with cafe, carpark and toilets, a network of accessible paths, a #pitch and putt# course, a Viking living village, accommodation pods, a watersports centre, wildle hide and a for thrill-seekers a huge zipline across the bay.Jo Wawrzyczek of the trust expects the Plock to attract , visitors a year. #This is an ambitious project that will cost almost £million,# she said. #However, it is very important for local people and businesses as it will help to create a great community space as well as keep visitors in our community for longer.#The trust also owns and manages the public toilets and pontoons in Kyle which will be a source of income for the project. With the aim of making the project self-sustaining, the Trust plans to lease the café and watersports centre on the Plock as well as generating income through the accommodation pods. Inspired by the success of other community-driven harbour developments such as Tobermory on Mull, Portree and Braes Community Trust want to maximise opportunities for local people and visitors through taking ownership of the harbour and improving facilities.The trust is currently in talks about relocating the oil tanks at the pier head which would be a breakthrough for the project and open up commercial opportunities. They are also considering a new road from the south to improve access and ert traffic away from the town centre. But according to development officer Fiona Thompson a new breakwater and pontoons will be the real game-changer for Portree.She said: #There have been aspirations for improvements to facilities at the harbour for over  years with little major investment.The harbour group are now closer than ever to realizing the community#s vision for a new, vibrant, welcoming port. A breakwater will allow us to provide overnight berths and efficient, comfortable transfer for cruise ship passengers, while a visitor centre will provide a warm highland welcome to visitors from across the globe. This project will be transformational for Portree and surrounding areas.#The community trusts of Skye and Lochalsh all have several features in common. They have vision, ambition, energy and drive and they are full of volunteers who are committed to bringing long-term projects to fruition for the benefit of their community # and their visitors # for decades to come."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Skye-Bridge-2018-winners.jpg","title":"skye bridge 10k race to kick start kyleakin gala","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe first bridge k was held  years ago, and since  hundreds have taken on the challenge in an event which has helped raise thousands of pounds for good causes based in Kyleakin and surrounding areas.back again.Online entry — which is discounted — will be open until Friday th August, or runners can register on the morning of the race for £.

It’s really invaluable having Deirdre and Micheál onboard and it was incredible to see so much of an eclectic mix of people at the launch. Art and creativity is very much part of the foundation of Féile.”Aisling Award winner Deirdre Mackel has spent six years at the helm of the visual arts exhibition having previously become involved as an exhibitor. “I have seen the exhibition grow over the years, it’s brilliant to be a part of, to see the amount of people coming in and just taking their time to see the art works,” she said. “It just really warms my heart to see all the art up in St Mary’s.”Deirdre spoke of the amount of preparation that goes into the artistic showcase each year. “There is a lot of background work, the call that goes out for artists to display in the first instance. When you see people coming in and installing their art works it’s just magical. You really get a sense of what it means on launch night which we had last Wednesday, seeing what it means to people, to the artist it lts my spirits. Debuting artists would say ‘I’m so nervous’ and they come back year after year, the exhibition really encourages new artist development and another thing that comes out of it is a real sense of volunteering.”Deirdre continued: “Local artist Micheál Gallagher has also come on board and the team have been very much hands on deck. We have some really stand-out pieces from the West Belfast Arts Society, Richard Kelly and a focal point is always the Relatives for Justice Remembrance Quilt. We have a series of Civil Rights posters which were exhibited in the Tate Modern and now they have been brought to Féile.“We are seeing a lot of the artists coming here with their families and staying for the duration of the festival. The visual arts exhibit gains more and more momentum year on year.” The Féile Visual Arts Exhibition will be on display until Thursday, August . All are welcome to attend."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bmg-advert-banner-classified-v01.png","title":"shock at sudden passing of reds legend breslin","story":"THE local football community was plunged into mourning last night at the sudden passing of Cltonville legend Tommy Breslin at the age of .The former Reds player and manager died while on a family holiday in Spain.Breslin famously guided Cltonville to back-to-back Irish League titles in  and  and won eight trophies in a hugely successful four-year spell at Solitude.In the summer of , he was at the helm when Cltonville took on Celtic over two legs in an historic Champions League Qualier.He ed to the club on an interim basis following the departure of his successor Gerard Lyttle at the end of the  campaign while he was also a revered midfielder in his playing days at the club.Social media was awash with tributes last night as fans and rival supporters alike paid tribute to one of the game’s most affable and popular figures.Having updated their social media feeds to include a picture of their iconic former boss, Cltonville posted a statement which read: “Cltonville Football Club are devastated to this evening learn of the sudden and untimely death of Tommy Breslin.“While the club will naturally pay a fuller tribute to Tommy very soon, at the moment in time our thoughts are very much with the Breslin family circle and all of his many friends, to whom we extend our deepest sympathy.”Lyttle, who was also part of Breslin’s backroom team before taking over the Cltonville hotseat, tweeted: “Shocked and saddened to hear – one of the nicest men I’ve ever known.

finding  validated sightings with pictures between January  and March , , and  between January  and February  in .In a study published in the journal Marine Bioersity Records, the scientists say the photos of VYking provide the first confirmed record of a UK-sighted humpback whale in its Arctic feeding grounds.The team also said a dferent inidual, nicknamed Sonny, was identied from photographs taken in the Firth of Forth in both  and , providing the first evidence of a whale ing to the area in consecutive years.This suggests some whales could be using UK seas as a “service station” to rest and feed on their long migration from their Arctic feeding grounds to their tropical breeding grounds, the researchers said.Emily Cunningham, one of the marine biologists that led the study, said: “Until , humpback whales had only been recorded a handful of times in the Firth of Forth over the past century – now we’re seeing them every winter on an almost daily basis.“UK seas are full of amazing wildle, so keep an eye on the waves next time you’re at the coast and please share anything you happen to photograph with your local wildle organisation – it could be the start of a new discovery.”Daniel Moore, co-lead author, said: “This research shows that UK seas play an important role in the migrations of some humpback whales and demonstrates the need for effective conservation of our marine environment.“We hope to continue our research in order to understand more about these movements and the importance of UK waters in contributing to successful migrations.”The Forth Marine Mammal Project, a community project established in January , is led by volunteer citizen scientists who conduct watches from land year-round along both coasts of the inner Firth of Forth."},{"url":null,"title":"man who put toddler in tumble dryer has sentencing delayed","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

It is perched above the Co Donegal village of Burt and attracts thousands of visitors every year.The fort is a powerful manestation of what remains of ancient Ireland and on a clear day, from its pinnacle, it is possible to get a glimpse of three counties-Donegal, Derry and Tyrone. The commanding and spectacular waterways of Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle lie to its west and east respectively.But, in the th Century the fort, once home to kings of old Gaelic order, was rapidly disintegrating towards extinction. It was however saved by the vision of one man who spearheaded its restoration just over  years ago.Dr Walter Bernard was born on May ,  at Newmarket, Co Cork. His father was a captain in the th Rles, a regiment of the British Army and was amongst the reinforcements that arrived in Brussels on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo in June of  but was apparently too late to take part in the famed history changing conflict.Walter became a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland in , a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland in  and Fellow of that college in .Between - Dr Bernard served as a surgeon throughout the Crimean War attending the wounded British soldiers at Inkerman and witnessed the ravages caused by small pox and cholera. He later recalled that for every man that was shot, fty more were killed by those diseases, particularly in the notoriously harsh winters of  and .On the journey home from the Ukranian battlefields, he saved a man from drowning and was awarded with a certicate from the Royal Humane Society. Then, with his experiences of military conflict at an end, Dr Bernard landed back in Ireland and settled in Buncrana before building up a very large medical practice in Derry. He ran this surgery for over sixty years and was a prominent member of the city’s branch of the British Medical Association as well as holding many public offices throughout his career.One such appointment was to examine the quality of water in the city for Londonderry Corporation at public facilities such as the Creggan reservoirs built in stages between -, and which supplied much of the city’s domestic and industrial water needs.His experience of the waterborne disease cholera in the Crimea made him an ideal candidate for this job.Dr Bernard also addressed the Medical Society of King and Queens College of Physicians on the issuer of diphtheria in April . He cautioned the assembled medics that there was a reason why the disease was largely absent from statistics sheets.He said: “There are few diseases about which so many mistakes in diagnosis are made.”He feared the misdiagnosis rate was so high that it was almost impossible to ensure that ‘true diphtheria’ was as common in a town as reported.Dr Bernard added: “Diphtheria occurs in Londonderry, I have no doubt whatever…in my practice it has been my lot to treat many cases of this disease.”At some point in , Dr Bernard paid a visit to Grianan of Aileach and many years later in , he said of the experience: “Seventeen years ago, when this traditional and historical place was first visited by me, I found it in a very ruinous condition, and from that time I commenced to take an interest in its associations.“Year after year I witnessed further advance of its ruin, and I clearly saw thatsomething were not soon done to arrest the progress of its destruction, it would be in a few years a thing of the past.”Grianan of Aileach is a hilltop fort that sits on top of Greenan Mountain in Inishowen just over  feet above ground level.The ringfort was thought to have been built in the sixth or seventh century, although there is some evidence to suggest that the site had been in use before that.Greek astronomer and cartographer Ptolemy penned a remarkably accurate map of Ireland in  A.D. from which maps were later created in the th and th centuries. He called the land ‘Iouernia’, thought to mean ‘abundant land’ from which the Irish names Eriu and Eire are derived. Amongst two sites identied as ‘regia’ or royal places in Ireland by the Greek map maker, one of them is believed by some historians to be the Grianan of Aileach.Whether Ptolemy pinpointed it or not, the Kingdom of Aileach was indeed one of Ireland’s royal sites of the Gaelic order. The fort was thought to have been constructed originally by the northern section of the Ui Neill clan, but between  A.D. and the thirteen centuries, over  kings from ious clans, some also High Kings of Ireland, held the throne of Aileach. The last man to be known as the King of Aileach was Aed Buide Ua Neill who died in .Despite ious interpretations, it is generally agreed that Aileach means ‘stony place’ and the word Grianan means ‘sunny place’ so that Grianan of Aileach broadly translates as ‘The Stone Palace of the Sunny View’.Whatever the actual meaning of its name, it is evident that it was an extremely important place. Aileach’s political and strategic importance was such that the annals of Irish history record that it was attacked at least three times. In , Finsnechta Fledach, King of Ireland, destroyed the fort.Again, in , when Muirchertach MacNeill was king, Viking raiders sacked the site when they settled at Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. It’s also thought that King Brian Boru came to Aileach in , but it was destroyed once more in , when another King of Munster, Muirchertach Ua Briaincame to Inishowen and plundered the region and razed the fort. The fort was laid to waste by O’Brien in revenge for O’Neill’s destruction of his royal seat at Kincora and he reportedly told his soldiers to each take a stone from the Donegal hillside so the place would be reduced to rubble.The fort itself could have served two main s both as a defensive and a ceremonial one and moreover as a settlement that was surrounded by ringforts of lesser importance. Whatever its actual , it is known that buildings of this nature were very rare in North West Ulster and its presence signies that its inhabitants were regarded as being very important.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe linking of St Patrick to the site is seen as attempt by Christian converts to place it firmly in that tradition whilst acknowledging its pagan history and the naming of a holy well right outside the ringfort in honour of Ireland’s patron saint seems to confirm that.There is also a mythological and folklore version of the founding of Grianan of Aileach which says the ringfort was built by Dagda , a god and the king of the Tuatha De Danann-the supposed ‘Tribe of the Gods’-a supernatural race in Irish mythology. The Tuatha De Danann are said to have invaded Ireland before the Celts and built strategic stone forts on the tops of hills.Dagda was said to have fought the Second Battle of Moytirra against the Fomorians and the fort at Aileach was built over the grave of his son Aedh who had been murdered.In , a Derry based group called the Irish Irelanders, enthusiastic Gaelic revivalists travelled to the site on Sunday afternoons and carried out some repairs. But, the splendour and historical intrigue of Grianan of Aileach had largely been ignored for many years until in , Dr Walter Bernard decided to begin its restoration in earnest.In the s, painter, musician, antiquarian and archaeologist George Petrie examined Grianan of Aileach when he was head of the Royal Irish Academy’s antiquities committee which was linked to the Irish Ordnance Survey.Petrie’s findings suggested that the hill many have been enclosed by many other ramparts and a line of stones leading up to the entrance which were all gone by then.But, despite his efforts, the expert’s findings remained confined to the records of the Royal Irish Academy, there were no efforts by the organisation to attempt any restoration of the ancient site.It was Dr Bernard who took practical action beyond the analysis of the site. He paid for the entire project that took place between - and recruited his crew of labourers from the farms surrounding Burt. They ferried the materials needed for the restoration on the back up small carts up supplied by the local landowners up the incredibly steep hill.What the doctor found at the site was a disorganised mess of which he said it was: “An immense circular heap of stones, with its grey fallen masonry scattered over the interior-no vestige of a wall, entrance passage, or central building.”Remembering that Walter Bernard was a medical doctor with no detailed description of what an ancient ringfort truly looked like and that there weren’t enough stones on site to complete the job, makes this story even more remarkable.Dr Bernard discovered many animal bones on the site including sheep, cows and goats and items like sling stones and warrior’s clubs. The most interesting stone object discovered was a ‘slab of sandstone, chequered into thirty-six squares’, believed to be a games board of some type.The doctor and his crew of labourers used the measurements of other Irish forts such as Staigue Fort in Co Kerry as the comparative basis for the restoration project at Grianan of Aileach. The finished product is a fort that stands . metres in diameter and more than five metres tall with walls that are almost four metres thick.Dr Bernard later described a part of the building project by saying: “To bind our work into a complete unity we had to gather around the hill about  or  loose stones-certainly not more,so many-and to split from the adjoining rocks, cropping up through the heather,  coping stones. These are supposed to serve instead of those removed by King Murdock O’Brien in .”Only speculation can be used to assessthe interior of today’s fort accurately resembles its ancient predecessor, but when the alternative was the complete disappearance of the Iron Age construction, then surely Bernard’s efforts become even more admirable.The fort has stood for centuries as a silent witness to major events of Irish history. From the top of Grianan fort you can just make out the location of the Co Donegal village of Rathmullen on the western bank of Lough Swilly.It was from Rathmullen in  that the chieftains Hugh O’Neill and Rory O’Donnell sailed with their families after the final defeat by the English taking with them the last symbols of the old Gaelic order once enshrined in its pomp by places such as Grianan of Aileach. Behind them in the distance the old fort sat on its hilltop as a fading reminder of a society and its traditions that would never .A legend says that in a secret cave on a hill beneath Grianan O’Neill’s warriors rest in a bewitched sleep in full armour and sitting on their horses ready for the next fight. The spell, says the legend, will only be broken when the next destined leader of Ulster arrives to lead them to victory.It is a myth that would have no visible attachmentit had not been for the passion of Dr Walter Bernard in the late th century in restoring Grianan of Aileach to something approaching its former glory.A tourist road to the fort was opened on September ,  by President of Ireland Eamon De Valera who was accompanied by Fine Gael TD for Donegal West, Pat O’Donnell, then Minister for Local Government. In the early s the Office of Public Works in the Republic of Ireland carried out further repairs to Grianan of Aileacgh after a wall collapsed. But as late as October  the Irish Government was being severely criticised by political representatives in Donegal for still failing to establish tour guides and other facilities at the ancient site.In his obituary contained in the Universities and Colleges magazine of December , , it was reported that Dr Bernard died suddenly at his residence in Buncrana on eight days previously on December . He was -years-old and was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Dr Bernard’s obituary ended: “He leaves a widow. His le was deeply scarred by three great sorrows, the deaths of his three children.”CAPTION: The volunteers involved in the restoration of Grianan of Aileach pictured at its official re-opening in ."},{"url":null,"title":"national hunger strike commemoration take place strabane sunday","story":"This Sunday, August , for the first time the National Hunger Strike Commemoration will be held for the first time in Strabane.Thirty-eight years after ten republicans died in Long Kesh during the spring and summer of , thousands of people from across Ireland will march from Lford across the border to the west Tyrone town to remember the prison battle conducted against the Thatcher administration’s policy of criminalisation.Speaking at the announcement that Strabane will host the event, Sinn Fein’s West Tyrone MP Orfhlaith Begley said it was a privilege for Strabane republicans and the rest of the constituency to host the event.“The  hunger strike was a watershed in Irish history and had a profound impact in terms of radicalising communities throughout Ireland. This impact was particularly felt in areas like here in Strabane where pride in the hunger strikers, their courage and sacrice still remains undiminished almost  years on.”The roots of what took place in  began several years earlier, when in  Belfast republican Kieran Nugent became the first man to refuse to wear a prison unorm. In , republicans had been accorded what the British termed Special Category Status recognising the political nature of their offences.By the mid-s however, political status had been withdrawn and as the cages of Long Kesh were replaced by the concrete H Blocks, the new British policy of ‘normalisation’ was wholly designed to strike any notion of political credence away from the IRA campaign.When he entered the H Blocks, Kieran Nugent was instructed to put a prison unorm on by the authorities. He answered, ‘you’ll have to nail it to my back.’ This began five years of protest inside the prison and heightened violence outside it which resulted in dozens of deaths.The blanket and no wash protests of the first four years of the prison conflict yielded no concessions on the issue of political status.The years of isolation and living in dire conditions eventually brought the situation to a head. The choice was plain and stark. The protesting republican prisoners could either concede and serve out jail sentences classed as ‘ordinary criminals’ or escalate the protest to the last ‘weapon’ available to them inside a prison-the hunger strike.It was not a new tactic for the republican movement, and it drew its inspiration from stories from the old Gaelic order.It’s recorded in the annals of Irish history that when a citizen felt slighted by the ruling order, it was not uncommon for them to lie outside their dwelling and refuse food in the hope of publicly shaming the guilty party into reparation and or an apology.In , Thomas Ashe died in Mountjoy prison in Dublin after being force fed whilst on hunger strike demanding political status. Then, in , the Lord Mayor of Cork Terence McSwiney died after  days whilst on hunger strike in Brixton jail. And, next year in  to mark the centenary of the death of McSwiney, the National Hunger Strike Commemoration will take place in Cork city.Back in , Michael Gaughan died in Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight after  days on hunger strike, and shortly before the beginning of the prison blanket and no wash protests in Long Kesh, in February , another Mayo man, Frank Stagg died at Wakefield jail in Yorkshire after  days without food.The first Long Kesh hunger strike began on October , . The protestors set out a list of five demands: -The right not to wear a prison unorm -The right not to do prison work -The right of free association with other prisoners -The right to organise their own educational and recreational facilities and -The right to one visit, one letter and one parcel a week.Seven men, including Sinn Fein MLA Raymond McCartney said they would fast to the death in the pursuit of the re-establishment of political status. Simultaneously, three female republican prisoners also embarked on a strike in Armagh jail.As Christmas  approached, the British offered a deal which appeared to agree to the central demand of the right not to wear a prison unorm. One of the hunger strikers, Sean McKenna was close to death at this stage and the strike was called off. It later emerged that was really being offered was a deal to allow prisoners to wear ‘civilian type clothing’ supplied by the prison regime. The scene was therefore already set for a second strike.It began on March ,  when Bobby Sands refused to eat. Raymond McCartney said: “Obviously everybody’s memory of  is the fact that ten people died on hunger strike.“On March ,  the British Government removed political status. I think most people thought that this was a half-hearted attempt and they’d roll over within a short period of time.“But, clearly what was emerging was a complete change in policy by the British Government who were intent on the idea of ‘normalisation’, ‘criminalisation’ and ‘Ulsterisation’.“Instinctively, any of us who found ourselves in prison at that time, knew we were political prisoners and any attempt to criminalise us just wasn’t going to work. It became a battle of wills.“But, I think by the end of the hunger strike in October, , most people looking on were saying that whatever was going on in the North that nobody in their wildest notion thought it was a criminal conspiracy. They certainly saw it as a political conflict. They may not have agreed with the armed actions of the IRA, but they certainly viewed it as a political situation.“So, for us by that stage, the process of criminalisation was in tatters. But, there was a very high price paid because  people had died in prison and  or  people had died on the streets.“Within the prisons we knew that we still had work to do because what we had to do was turn that acceptance of political imprisonment into every day conditions. By the end of the hunger strike I suppose there was a big recognition of the dference between the criminal’s unorm and our own clothes was one manestation of it. And, over the years we continued to ensure the conditions in Long Kesh reflected that.“By the late s and early s, journalists were frequent visitors to the prison and left with the overwhelming impression that we were a ‘dferent type’ of prisoner. They may have gone out and had questions about who you were and what you were about but they were in doubt that we were political prisoners. That was a big source of validation.”The intensity of the events and scale of death and destruction between  and  in retrospect now seems enormous, but Raymond McCartney maintains that it paved the way for future political developments.“It was only five years, but it was a very intense five years. It is only when you get a bit older you realise just how short a time span it was, because when you roll onto  and the Good Friday Agreement there was an acceptance of the framework that there was a political conflict which had to be resolved by political means-the recognition of political mandates, the political framework to address all these issues, but at the core of that was the acceptance of political prisoners.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“There is no doubt there is evidence that there were elements within the British Government were determined that political status should not be granted for whatever reason.“Even in , when there was internment without trial and up to , people were held in conditions where they wore their own clothes. There was a recognition of the political conflict of one nature or another.“How that was defined by dferent people is a dferent matter. I know that other people have made the observation that for too long the British tried to deal with the North as a security issue. therefore, when you have a security mentality or emergency laws, emergency courts, emergency interrogation centres, everything is changed and turned upside down.“If you follow their logic from that point of view and they say ‘you cannot now say you are political prisoners’ whilst trying to pretend that everything  about the situation isn’t political too then the penny drops in a whole lot of ways.”The almost  years since  have provoked much debate within wider nationalism about whether or not the hunger strike was harnessed as a catalyst for the republican movement to embark on the path to politics.The election of Bobby Sands to Westminster and Kieran Doherty to the Dail was followed quickly by a debate within Sinn Fein about ending their policy of abstentionism from political institutions that would lead to a split in the republican movement in . The Derry News asked Raymond McCartney for his view on this.He said: “It is interesting now, because everyone has their story about what the origins of the peace process was. But, there is absolutely no doubt that when you look back as far as  that Gerry Adams that there needed to be a political way of resolving the conflict, because military stalemate was exactly that.“The famous Glover Report from the British Army accepted that there was not going to be a military defeat, was them in their own way, saying the IRA was a political force and that the guys in Long Kesh were political prisoners. They job they were sent to do, they couldn’t do and that was to impose a military defeat and by extension their laws of oppression were not going to work either.“It made the situation painful and made the conflict last longer. Then, whenever the formula for the Good Friday Agreement was put forward, some former prisoners will tell you that it was too high a price to pay, but the core accepted it was a political problem and without political solutions it was never going to be resolved.”When the first hunger strike ended in October of , Raymond McCartney had gone without food for  days. So, what are his own personal recollections of the physical effects of what took place “I suppose when you look at that time in , Martin Hurson died after  days whilst others like Kevin Lynch were approaching  days when he died.“In a very strange way hunger strike affects dferent people in dferent ways. Even the day the hunger strike ended in , I was still walking about, I was out of bed. But, there is no doubt that your body slows down.“My ability to see was greatly affected. But, the body is a remarkable piece of equipment and resilience is obviously built in. As you get older you reflect on it and it is dficult to work out in your head that you could sustain doing without food for  days and others for  days.“I suppose when you look at that time in , Martin Hurson died after  days whilst others like Kevin Lynch were approaching  days when he died.

But, there is no doubt that your body slows down. My ability to see was greatly affected.“As you get older you reflect on it and it is dficult to work out in your head that you could sustain doing without food for  days and others for  days.”Undoubtedly, it was Margaret Thatcher more than anyone  within the British establishment at the time who demonstrated complete determination to use the protests in Long Kesh to ide and break the republican movement.Many commentators have pointed to the INLA assassination of her colleague Airey Neave in  as one reason why the British Prime Minister embarked on a path of total intransigence towards the IRA. However, Raymond McCartney believes that her thinking was a lot wider than that.“Whatever her antipathy towards Ireland was and what came with that, she was setting out a broader political stall. Look at how she treated the miner’s later on.“Reading state papers now, years after these events, her take on the miner’s strike wasn’t just a battle about conditions in the mines, it was about strategically tackling trade unions. It was a case of her saying who is the strongest union-who is the spine of the working class and acting on that.“I always remember that being in jail gives you the time to reflect and read and think and I also always remember that Bobby Sands out of all the people who had been in jail was very clear about what he was there for because he wrote it all down. Some of the things he wrote captures the way a writer works-it’s all encompassing and puts it out there in a very vivid way.“I had previously been interned, I had an understanding about what being a political prisoner was. You had your own clothes and a bit of freedom to associate with other prisoners and you didn’t feel that sense of captivity although you were locked up. Bobby Sands caught on very early that the British were trying to defeat us in the prisons. It wasn’t just about trying to give you a hard time or denying you your own clothes, it was that they had a core idea to break us.“One of the rewarding things for me personally was that the system we had in the end in jail was one based on equality. That we treated people as equals. If you couldn’t treat the person beside you as a comrade and an equal that you couldn’t expect anyone  to believe that you’d treat all people as equals as you went on through le.”Those wishing to attend the th National Hunger Strike Commemoration are asked to assemble on Sunday, August  at .pm at the Diamond in Lford before marching across the border into Strabane where Martina Anderson MEP will deliver this year’s main oration.CAPTION: Raymond McCartney spent  days on hunger strike in ."},{"url":null,"title":"trade union blasts delusional derry employers treatment frontline workers","story":"A public sector trade union has blasted “unscrupulous” local employers for their “arrogant” mistreatment of workers.UNISON activists attended the recent NIHE Public consultation standardised regional payment rates event in the City Hotel to provide a voice for frontline workers employed through the Supporting People Programme.Earlier this year Derry City  Strabane District Council unanimously backed a motion in support of workers’ rights.The Supporting People programme, which has been operating since , provides housing support services delivered in partnership with service providers across the public, private and voluntary sectors.Support is provided to more than , vulnerable people every year, to enable them to live independently in their own homes, sheltered housing or in supported housing accommodation.Client groups include, Women’s Aid, the House in the Wells, Cheshire House, the Shepherds View Young Parents Project, Francis Street Young Persons Project, Apex Housing - Beechway House and the Simon Community.Its broad objectives are to achieve a better quality of le for vulnerable people, allowing them to live independently and maintain their tenancies. To provide housing support services to prevent problems that can often lead to hospitalisation, institutional care or homelessness.And finally, to assist with a smooth transition to those leaving an institutional environment to independent living.Following a review of the Supporting People programme by the Department for Communities in , it was recommended that payment rates across all Supporting People providers should be standardised.The new rates are supposed to ensure all schemes represent value for money.However, UNISON Community Branch members have questioned the commitment of certain employers within the sector.Niall McCarroll, UNISON Community Branch Chairperson said: “The Supporting People Programme has at its core the fundamental desire to improve the quality of le of those in our communities who need housing related support at any particular time.“However, the standards of living and quality of le frontline workers are experiencing does not reflect the work they complete, as a result of substandard terms and conditions of employment increasingly pushing them into debt, putting them at risk of homelessness and forcing them to use foodbanks.”‘Amoral employers’The UNISON delegation attending the Public Consultation impressed upon the NIHE that the current measures in place to protect frontline workers were inadequate and gave “unscrupulous employers” too much power. “Power which they use to disadvantage many workers whilst their inner circles led lavish lestyles on enhance contracts of employment,” Mr McCarroll added.He said the decision-making on how to manage staffing is at the behest of Supporting People funded organisations, this needs to change.UNISON told the NIHE that the current consultation process in place, designed to improve service delivery for vulnerable people would achieve nothing and fall short of any objectives,frontline staff were not valued and respected within the programme.The NIHE estimate that frontline workers should be in receipt of band  hourly rates with no mention of other band  terms and conditions such as sick pay or sht allowances. UNISON challenged this benchmarking estimate and its lack of detail in other areas, stating this was not the reality for many Supporting People Programme workers.Mr McCarroll continued: “A UNISON delegation of frontline workers will be meeting with the NIHE to further discuss our members’ concerns and we thank the NIHE for agreeing to continue the discussions on how best to protect and value workers, not forgetting that we are all involved in this programme to work together changing the lives of vulnerable people.“UNISON would like to put on record our appreciation of the position and approach taken by the NIHE in engaging with the trade unions and our continued disappointment at the right wing, anti-trade union position and approach taken by some Supporting People funded employers.“These employers operate with an arrogant, delusionary sense of entitlement, the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign will expose these employers and continue to organise workers to stand up and fight, bringing to an end the increasingly shaky gravy train which stops only at head office, bypassing frontline services.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh\"Head office staff receive  months full sick pay while frontline workers receive just  week in any year.  This particular contractual entitlement along with signicant dferences in take home pay is leaving frontline workers feeling undervalued.\"A NIHE spokesperson said the objective of the consultation is to hear the views of service providers, current and potential service users and their families and carers to enable the Housing Executive to identy the best option and approach for implementing this recommendation.The consultation runs for  weeks, it began on  June  and ends  August .Interested stakeholders are invited to participate by completing an online questionnaire at: https:consultations.nidirect.gov.uk nihe-supporting-people srpr"},{"url":null,"title":"waterfoot park residents take council task proposed construction development","story":"Derry City and Strabane District Councilhas pledged to engage fully with a group of residents in the Waterside after they accused the local authority of failing to fulfil their obligations in relation to their objections to a potential building development in their district.In July last year, residents of Waterfoot Park in the city lodged a formal objection to plans for a housing development in the area seeking to construct four semi-detached houses, two detached houses and six, two-bedroomed apartments.The Waterfoot Park residents objected to the proposed development on several grounds which included the potential impact of the construction project on existing properties at the site and that the planning application had not indicated accurate separation and height dferences between the proposed new project and the existing homes.A statement from the Waterfoot Park Residents Objectors Committee to the Derry News said: “The proposed dwellings are three stories in height on ground over two metres higher than the existing houses with restricted separation distances between both.“The layout would result in loss of privacy, natural light, sunlight and overbearing dominance, creating a sense of being hemmed in for us existing residents living adjacent to the boundary line.“Our concerns are also for the natural habitat of wildle species and the overall vast vegetation and trees. No details were provided on how existing vegetation will be retained and no bioersity checklist was provided.”The residents also employed planning consultant Lee Kennedy, who told the Council of his concerns that some demolition work to existing buildings on the proposed development site had already taken place, prior to planning approval and that trees had been felled along the rear boundary of the site close to the homes of the objectors.A spokesperson for the Waterfoot residents said: “Mr Kennedy went onto state that residents have expressed genuine fears about a threat to the remaining vegetation on the application site.“He reminded Council that they hold a duty of care to work in the public interest and offer protection to the remaining mature trees, by the serving of a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderunder the  Planning Act.”Mr Kennedy confirmed to the Derry News that he had submitted a request for a TPO from the Council, but “no action had been taken.”However, the Waterfoot Park residents say their fears were heightened again earlier this month when a team of workers appeared on the proposed development site and began to cut down more trees.A spokesperson for the residents told the Derry News: “On Friday, July  at .am the neighbours were woken with the sound of several power saws and saw a full team of tree cutters on site behind them.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Within an hour they had created absolute mayhem on the site, with trees felled all around and they were left when they fell. The ground and houses nearby vibrated and caused house alarms to go off.“Some neighbours felt very intimidated, shocked and panicked with the suddenness, noise level and by the time of the morning it happened. The residents are up in arms. It should never have been allowed to happen as Council was made aware last year about their responsibility of a duty of care to work in the public interest. The residents feel unsupported to date in their endeavours to the Council.”Addressing the residents’ concerns, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council said that: “During the processing of the application,  objections have been received to the proposed development.“Correspondence to the Planning Department from Planning Consultant, Mr Lee Kennedy acting on behalf of the objectors, was received on August ,  and raised concerns regarding the trees on the site, and a request for a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderto be served on the site.“These concerns were raised with the Planning Department’s Tree Preservation Officer on September ,  who advised on September , that in his professional opinion, a TPO was not appropriate for this site given the nature, type and scale of trees.”On April  this year, Planning Department officials met with objectors at the city’s Council offices, where again, the Tree Preservation Officer advised that a TPO was considered but was unnecessary when assessed against the criteria required for a TPO.The Council spokesperson continued: “The site was further inspected by planning officers on June ,  and officers met with objectors on site.“More recently, the case officer wrote to the agent and the applicant on June ,  to advise that further information was required. Amongst other things requested, the case officer advised that a tree survey of the site was required, a landscaping plan to show existing trees and vegetation to be retained and additional planting to be shown and a bioersity checklist was to be submitted to advise on any existing ecology on the site.“The agent confirmed in correspondence dated, July  that a Phase  habitat survey was instructed to be carried out as well as a tree survey and would be submitted in due course.”However, the Council spokesperson added: “The Planning Department were made aware by an objector by email on July ,  that eight trees along the boundary of the site adjacent to properties in Waterfoot Park had been felled on July  at .am.“Council takes its obligations in respect of these matters seriously and has undertaken an appropriate course of action to ensure that the opinions of residents are and will be fully considered in the processing of the planning application.”CAPTION: Residents of Waterfoot Park have accused the Council of failing to provide a duty of care in relation to a proposed building development."},{"url":null,"title":"machynlleth carnival 2019 event celebrates","story":"Moon landers : Olivia Garrod , Harry Smithand Izzy Owen ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt drop in on Machynllltspan classtruncate-full-screengteth Carnival.

They opened the scoring through Gareth George and he added a free to give the visitors an early cushion.Indeed, Bright had plenty more chances to add to this score, but were wasteful in their shot selection. The Holywood men finally woke up and a tidy score from Connor McAnespie after  minutes opened their account.Bright again replied with a fine score from Marc Burke before Martin Cox opened his account for Holywood with a point after  minutes. Barry Kilkey levelled the contest three minutes later from close range and Freddie OrsquoConnor scored for Bright to edge them ahead again.Foolish tackling and unnecessary frees were costing St Paulrsquos in the game and helped Bright dominate the play In the first half.The gamersquos opening goal, however, swung the play towards the Holywood men again. Fantastic work from Seaacuten Tucker around the middle of the park and his long ball into the danger area found Marty Cox in space.Cox caught the ball in mid-air, landed and turned in one motion before smashing the ball past Michael Ferrand, who had no chance. The sizable crowd roared with delight and momentum was now with St Paulrsquos as Tucker added another score from play.Once again, however, ill discipline and poor tackling would cost St Paulrsquos.

The game was tied at - to - drawing at  when St Paulrsquosadded their second goal in the th minute.Fine work from Daniel Eastwood and Cox set up Tucker who danced around two Bright defenders before slotting the ball home from  metres. The home crowd were again in raptures, expecting St Paulrsquos to see the game out.However, game management has been a big problem this season for the Holywood men, given the average age of the team is  it is perhaps understandable that experience to see games out is just not there yet.St Paulrsquos tried to slow the game down, but with about  minutes still to be played, it was far too early for that. Bright caught St Paulrsquos in possession on numerous occasionsand turned the ball over for score after score.George was a constant threat and punished each mistake by the Holywood men with a score.

He did, however, admit that the itinerary has been sent to Rome.Venues for the Popersquos visit are pure speculation and certainly newspapers are free to speculate, he added.It is understood that Downpatrick was one of the three venues north of the border suggested by the committee of  bishops, headed by Cardinal OrsquoFiaich, when they met last week.The decision on whether the Pope will include Northern Ireland in his tour will be taken in Rome, but it is believed that alternative venues in the Republic have been suggestedthe Pope decides not to cross the border.The choice of Downpatrick mdash with its strong historical links with Christianity and St Patrick mdash is understood to have been a move to give the Pope the opportunity to see as many people as possible.It is also thought that Armagh mdash the ecclesiastical headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland mdash and Londonderry were studied as possible venues for a visit.Until the programme is finalised, the only places certain to be included in the itinerary are Dublin and the Marian Shrine at Knock, County Mayo.Dr Joseph Maguire, Parish Priest of Downpatrick, said that he personally had not been contacted about any visit from Pope John Paul II, but he admitted that Downpatrick would have been one of the first places to think of.ldquoWe would be delighted to be so honoured with a visit from the Holy Father and he would be most welcome he said.KILLYLEAGH mdash A one-day token strike by production workers closed the Killyleagh Mill yesterday.Around  workers walked out, seeking a wages increase.

Two special zones will be developed for car parking on either side of the beach and a park for upwards of  cars will be provided in the centre, off the beach area.Under no circumstances, however, will cars be allowed to drive up and down the beach area and the council is expected to appoint full-time beach inspectors to supervise parking during the summer season.The private entrances presently used by beach-goers will be blocked off and two new public driveways will be constructed. It is thought that charges for cars to the beach will be scrapped.Other developments at the beach will include the provision of new toilet blocks and the construction of - self-catering holiday homes for renting.NEWCASTLE mdash A new peal of six church bells will ring out over Newcastle this year. They will be installed in St Johnrsquos Parish Church, which will be  years old in .Dr Noel Warren, the rector, says the parishioners are looking forward with tremendous interest to hearing the first peal of new bells to be installed in any church in Ireland for many years.

But when he arrived, to his dismay he found that the interview with the then taoiseach Jack Lynch had been turned into a press conference and he had largely wasted his time..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button It was Lynch who took the Republic into the EU on the same day as the UK joined in  – arguably Ireland’s single most transformative decision since partition.The outbreak of the Troubles meant that Lynch’s policy towards Northern Ireland defined much of his tenure, and although the current Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, only took up office two years ago and is only , Brexit is already almost certain to define his time in office.Leo Varadkar speaking to News Letter political editor Sam McBride in Belfast on TuesdayHis robust strategy of insisting that the UK commits to a backstop which treats Northern Ireland dferently to the rest of the UKBritain is to leave the customs union and single market now looks like it could have the unintended consequence of contributing to the UK leaving without any deal at all – a major economic threat to Ireland.Two weeks ago a poll found that a minority of the Irish publicback his Brexit strategy. The stakes are high not just for the Fine Gael leader, but for his nation.Sitting in the modern offices of the de facto Irish embassy in Belfast – the Irish Secretariat on Linenhall Street –Mr Varadkar has misgivings, he doesn’t show them.With relentless message discipline, he repeats the Irish government’s stance, insisting that it will not give up the backstop anda no-deal Brexit happens then it will be London’s choice.Mr Varadkar is a cautious interviewee, choosing words carefully and often appearing to say little beyond what has already been said. Even when asked when he first visited Northern Ireland , there is a sense that he is always thinking politically, delicately selecting his words.Did Northern Ireland at that time feel like an entirely dferent country or society “No. No. It definitely felt dferent, and is dferent, but certainly not foreign. I’ve always liked Belfast as a city and Queen’s in particular as a campus.”No deal Brexit risks cull of , Northern Ireland cattle, reports BBC NewsnightLeo Varadkar interview: We will oppose direct rule for Northern Ireland Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Again, when asked whether British-Irish relations are at their lowest point since the  Belfast Agreement – which seems obvious – he is coy, saying that relations between people in Britain and Ireland are “pretty good”, while “definitely Brexit has strained relations between the two governments ... and has created a very dficult environment for the parties in Northern Ireland”.But on Brexit there are subtle linguistic changes which hint at how the situation is changing. In January, he said that “even in a no-deal, there will not be ato a border”. Now, he implicitly accepts that no-deal will mean that there will be an economic border – although he hopes it can be enforced away from the border itself.However, he is clear that regardless of what happens – deal or no-deal, backstop or no backstop – the movement of people around the island will be unimpeded. Despite some people’s fears that no-deal would mean a border, impeding the movement of people crossing the border to shop, visit relatives or go to school, Mr Varadkar is clear that will not be the case.Highlighting how the UK and the Republic have given firm commitments to retain the common travel area, he says he is “confident” that will continue, along with access to each other’s labour markets, housing, education, welfare and pensions “as though we were citizens of both Britain and Ireland”.“We’ve agreed to keep that in place – so as long as the British and Irish governments commit to keep that in place, that will stay in place and our commitment to that is absolute and solid. I would hope that down the line the British government doesn’t decide that taking control of our borders means in any way diluting the common travel area – certainly we won’t.”His one caveat to that is that it is impossible to be certain of what “may happen down the line ... a lot of the reasons for the checks during the Troubles were security-related and I would certainly hope that the security situation would not deteriorate”.He stresses that violence at any future border is not inevitable “but I think we would be doing a disservice to our citizens north and southwe didn’t understand that it is a potential outcome”.Last week Arlene Foster – once Mr Varadkar’s opposite number as Stormont tourism minister and from whom he accepted an invitation to attend the Twelfth in Enniskillen seven years ago – accused him of being “very truculent” and refusing to engage in “sensible bilateral” discussions with the UK. She said he “hides behind the apron strings of the EU ... and he won’t speak to those of us who have a very big interest in finding a way forward”.When those comments are put to the taoiseach, he smiles, saying: “Yeah, I heard that and I’m conscious that it was Arlene Foster only last week who was advising me to dial down the rhetoric.“I don’t think in two years as taoiseach and in eight years in the Irish government I’ve ever made a pejorative comment about any unionist politician.”In a time of crisis in Northern Ireland  years ago, Jack Lynch’s solution was simple: “The reunication of the national territory can provide the only permanent solution for the problem.”Although Irish unity is more seriously talked about now than for many years, Mr Varadkar’s responses to questions around unity reveal a reluctance to rapidly move towards such a prospect.Asked whether the classic Irish nationalist idea of unity – an Irish unitary state – is a realistic or achievable prospect in the medium term, he said: “I would really not like to see the Brexit debate becoming a constitutional one. I fear thatyou have a no-deal hard Brexit, that that will arise and I don’t want that to happen ... I would really not like to see this issue of a united Ireland being brought to the fore as a consequence of a hard Brexit.“It’s the kind of thing that I always envisage,it ever would happen, it would happen in a more generational context and would give us time to talk about what that might look like because certainly for me it wouldn’t look like a unitary -county republic, the kind of thing that was envisaged by the founding fathers of the state, those that fought in the GPO – because that could never fully respect or embrace the million people here in the north who are British, who have a unique identity ... that was perhaps one of the flaws of the founding project of my state – that wasn’t properly respected at that time.”When askedhe envisaged the Irish and British governments staying neutral in a border poll or campaigning on either side of the debate, the taoiseach laughed and said: “That’s a good question, actually. I haven’t been asked that one before. I think long before we would ever have a border poll we would have to have a long and meaningful conversation as to what the question really is – we saw that with Brexit people voting on the issue of Brexit without perhaps a proper debate about what Brexit would look like or what Brexit would be.”Leo Varadkar, the gay son of immigrants at the head of a confident and technologically advanced Ireland, is a world away from Jack Lynch, the champion hurler at the helm of agrarian Catholic Ireland. But just as Northern Ireland unexpectedly imposed itself on his Fianna Fáil predecessor, so it is once more threatening to destabilise the southern state.try catch  TrendingN.I.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
