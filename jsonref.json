She had a considerable reputation as a photographer but, in the years to come, it seems to me, we will cherish her still more warmly and regard her work even more highly. The black-and-white pictures from the 1930s and 40s – kids playing in the streets, old people keeping a watchful eye on the neighbourhood – have a lyrical grace and a rough-and-tumble tenderness. The kids are having a lot of fun – even if that fun involves someone getting hurt – and it’s fun looking at the pictures. They’re easy on the eye in the way that Anna Karenina is easy to read compared with Ulysses. Henri Cartier-Bresson was a decisive influence but Levitt seemed happy to survey the flow of life casually going about its unruly business rather than pouncing on instants of suddenly perfect visual geometry. Her photographic moments, as a result, contain entire childhoods, whole lifetimes of everyday disappointment and routine happiness: the kind of stuff we associate with narrative fiction rather than photographs.In the 1950s she began shooting in colour – not as a formal experiment but as a natural extension of the urge James Agee had observed in the earlier black-and-white work: “to perceive the aesthetic reality within the existing world”. When almost all of this colour work was stolen by a burglar she started afresh in 1971.This picture is part of a retrospective of Levitt’s work now on show at Arles photography festival. I like fondly to think that Levitt had photographed the lady in the marbled blue dress on the left before, Seven Up!-style, caught in a similar gesture of playful triumph – now that she’s old it might just be backache – when they were both young, in the 1930s. But the other woman, on the right, haven’t I seen her before too, at exactly the age she is now, looking on with that same attitude of rough-hewn, nosy resignation, in black-and-white pictures from before the war? There is, in other words, something timely and eternal about Levitt. So while her city has changed, has become, in many ways, a playground for the young and affluent, this picture also depicts a distinctively 21st-century scenario: Airbnb guests, with all their luggage, wondering when their host is going to show up. Help is, as they say, at hand it’s just that no one knows what form it might take.• Helen Levitt: Observing New York’s Streets is at Espace Van Gogh, Arles photography festival, until 22 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17e1bbfae1e5c637b33a576c3b6844bc3fc09ad7/0_286_4285_2570/master/4285.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecc8458700bc997a36bb7ded0330d935","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"The running of the bulls in Pamplona, Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon, the earthquake in California and the Tour de France – the last seven days, as captured by the world’s best photojournalists."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcc4611913e167184c439f0a9eec3c3f91a4220e/0_0_1563_2000/master/1563.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=cdfff930be2b7bcb926f3c6989a04a17 1760w","title":"elif shafak books writers academics women hostility erdogan turkey","story":"The author once put on trial for ‘insulting Turkishness’ explains why writers, academics and especially women, face escalating hostility in Erdoğan’s TurkeyOne day two months ago I woke up to thousands of abusive messages on Turkish social media, many of them generated by bots and trolls. Sentences had been plucked from one of my novels, The Gaze, and were being circulated by people demanding fiction writers be put on trial for “obscenity”. My new novel, 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World, was also targeted. Both books explore difficult subjects – sexual harassment, gender violence and child abuse – and I was far from the only writer targeted in this way. Soon the hysteria turned into a kind of digital lynching of Turkish authors who had even slightly touched on similar issues in their novels and short stories.I received a distressed call from my Turkish publisher the same week, informing me that civilian police officers had come to the office demanding to see a number of books. Not only my fiction but titles by Duygu Asena, a leading feminist who died in 2006. The books were taken to the prosecutor’s office to be investigated.Since the attempted coup of 2016, 29 publishing houses have been closed by decree, and 135,000 books have been banned from public libraries, including those by Louis Althusser and Nâzim Hikmet, Turkey’s greatest poet. A prosecutor has accused Baruch Spinoza and Albert Camus of being members of a terrorist organisation. Much has been said about the anti-liberal nature of authoritarian populism, but relatively little about two other features concomitant with its rise: anti-intellectualism and anti-feminism. Authoritarian populism likes to ide society into two camps: the pure people versus the corrupt elite. Writers, poets, journalists and scholars are often associated with the latter group. In the populist imagination, being elite has nothing to do with economic power or social status. It is about values. In this way, a university assistant who cannot afford a house in the city and has to commute for hours every day but happens to have progressive ideas can be labelled “elite”, while a hedge fund manager will be called “a man of the people” if he sponsors populist nationalistic movements.The people are romanticised as pure and innocent. The deputy rector of a newly established university in Turkey, Bülent Ari, claimed on TV: “I’d rather trust ignorant people who have not attended university or better yet, not even attended primary school … because their minds are pure.” Saying he was unhappy to see literacy rates going up, he claimed that people who had higher education and were more cultured also had blurred minds and couldn’t think straight. “If Erdoğan leaves it will be a catastrophe,” he added. Afterwards, he was promoted by the government to the Council of Higher Education.There is a clear animosity towards intellectuals under President Erdoğan’s AKP government. More than 7,300 academics have been dismissed via emergency state decrees. Around 700 scholars have been criminally charged for signing a peace petition. They have lost their jobs and been blacklisted. Some have been arrested, others have had travel bans imposed on them or had their passports confiscated. Mehmet Fatih Traş, a university assistant who had signed the peace petition and was then fired, killed himself. Professor Şebnem Korur Fincanci, chair of the Human Rights Foundation, and Ayşe Gül Altınay, a professor of gender and women’s studies, were both given two-year prison sentences. Professor Füsun Üstel, one of Turkey’s leading academics on nationalism and identity, is in prison.It is equally hard for female journalists. Nurcan Baysal had police knocking on her door in the middle of the night. Baysal is one of the most important voices writing about the traumas of Yazidi and Kurdish women, and she was put on trial for her articles. Ayla Albayrak from the Wall Street Journal was charged with “terrorist propaganda” after penning an article about what was transpiring in the Kurdish-majority south-east. She was sentenced in absentia. Article 19 called the decision “an unprecedented verdict for a reporter of a foreign media outlet”.Turkey’s trajectory shows that wherever there is a rise of nationalism and authoritarianism, patriarchy and homophobia are also in the ascendant. Last month, for the fifth time, the Pride Parade in Istanbul was banned and dispersed with rubber bullets, tear gas and police violence. This is the kind of Europe authoritarian populists are trying to create: an anti-intellectual, anti-feminist, anti-LGBT and anti-abortion rights Europe. In Hungary, the government has banned gender and women’s studies, with the assertion: “We do not consider it acceptable to talk about socially constructed genders, rather than biological sexes.” Prime minister Viktor Orbán’s policy of giving tax cuts to mothers who bear more children resembles Erdoğan’s drive to encourage Turkish women to have bigger families. “Have not just three, but five children,” Erdoğan told Turks in Europe in 2017. Meanwhile the Polish health ministry has put out a video urging citizens to procreate: “If you ever want to be a parent, follow the example of rabbits.” Morning after pills are no longer available over the counter in Poland and Polish abortion law remains one of the strictest across Europe. In Warsaw 14 women were beaten and prosecuted for opening a banner that said “Stop Fascism”. In Spain, the Vox Movement hired a bus with a picture of Hitler on it and a caption underneath that said: #StopFeminazis.Gender is an important part of this new narrative. If women can be convinced to return to traditional values, the population will increase and majority-minority ratios will be as they used to be. Demographic changes are a primary concern for populist nationalists. If white populations continue to remain as the majority, nationalism will feel more secure. There will also be less need for immigrant workers coming from abroad. It is not a coincidence that anti-immigration rhetoric is entwined with a growing anti-feminist rhetoric.In 2006, after I wrote The Bastard of Istanbul – a novel about a Turkish and Armenian-American family – I was put on trial for “insulting Turkishness”. The words of several of my Armenian fictional characters were used as “evidence” by the prosecutors. As a result, my Turkish lawyer had to defend not only me but also my characters. I wish I could say that Turkey has made progress in human rights and freedom of speech since then, but I am afraid it has been the opposite.No country is immune to the rise of populist nationalism. As liberal democratic values continue to be endangered, we storytellers are now facing unexpected challenges. Doris Lessing once said that literature was analysis after the event. But there might be times when literature has to become analysis during the event. Paradoxically, at a time when truth is under attack, writers might need to defend fiction more loudly. In the age of anger, tribalism and apathy, we need stories of connectivity, humanism and empathy. In the face of binary oppositions, we need to promote a more nuanced way of thinking.

Here’s the full list of the historical characters that have appeared on banknotes issued by the central bank in England and Wales over the last five decades.1970 William Shakespeare, playwright (£20) 1971 Duke of Wellington, soldier and statesman (£5) 1975 Florence Nightingale, founder of modern nursing (£10) 1978 Sir Isaac Newton, physicist and mathematician (£1) 1981 Sir Christopher Wren, architect (£50) 1990 George Stephenson, engineer (£5) 1991 Michael Faraday, scientist (£20) 1992 Charles Dickens, author (£10) 1994 Sir John Houblon, first Bank of England governor (£50) 1999 Sir Edward Elgar, composer (£20) 2000 Charles Darwin, naturalist (£10)2002 Elizabeth Fry, prison reformer (£5)2007 Adam Smith, economist (£20)2011 Matthew Boulton and James Watt, steam engine industrialists (£50)2016 Winston Churchill, prime minister (£5)2017 Jane Austen, author (£10)While at Bletchley Park, Turing came up with ways to break German ciphers, including improvements to pre-second world war Polish methods for finding the settings for German Enigma machines.The Bank praised Turing for his role as a scientist and for the impact he has had on society. Prosecuted for homosexual acts in 1952, an inquest concluded his death from cyanide poisoning two years later was suicide.The Bank acknowledged Turing’s pivotal role in the development of early computers, first at the National Physical Laboratory and later at the University of Manchester.“He set the foundations for work on artificial intelligence by considering the question of whether machines could think,” the Bank said. “Turing was homosexual and was posthumously pardoned by the Queen, having been convicted of gross indecency for his relationship with a man. His legacy continues to have an impact on both science and society today.”Turing’s face will appear on the new £50 polymer note when it goes into circulation in 2021, following a public consultation process designed to honour an eminent British scientist.The Bank said it had received a total of 227,299 nominations, covering 989 eligible characters. These were narrowed down to a shortlist of 12, with Carney making the final choice.The shortlisted characters, or pairs of characters, were Mary Anning, Paul Dirac, Rosalind Franklin, William Herschel and Caroline Herschel, Dorothy Hodgkin, Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage, Stephen Hawking, James Clerk Maxwell, Srinivasa Ramanujan, Ernest Rutherford, Frederick Sanger, and Alan Turing.Speaking at the launch, Carney said the selection process for new notes was “as inclusive as possible.” However, MPs and campaigners had warned that choosing a white scientist risked sending a “damaging message that ethnic minorities are invisible” while on Monday the campaign group, Banknotes of Colour, said its 150,000-strong petition to have an ethnic minority on a banknote had “not been taken seriously” by the Bank.Asked by the  whether the new £50 note was a missed opportunity to reflect erse modern Britain, Carney said the Bank wanted to celebrate “all aspects of ersity” and that “to not represent the scale of scientific achievement in this country would be a mistake”.He added: “We want to represent as best as possible all aspects of ersity within the country, from race, religion, creed, sexual orientation, disability and beyond. What we have today is a celebration of one of the greatest mathematicians and scientists in the United Kingdom and not just this country’s history but world history.”The note was unveiled at Manchester’s Museum of Science and Industry, a short walk from the Manchester University building where Turing helped develop programming for the Ferranti Mark 1, world’s first commercially available electronic computer.A new exhibition at the museum showcases several artefacts connected to the pioneering scientist, including an original Enigma cipher machine used in the second world war, electronic components for a Ferranti Mark 1 computer, and a Manchester University marketing brochure from 1951 with a photograph of Turing leaning over a computer.It was also in Manchester where the campaign to clear Turing’s name began. The original petition calling for a posthumous pardon was begun by William Jones, a computer scientist living in the city, and eventually reached 37,000 signatures, prompting Turin’s royal pardon in December 2013.John Leech, the former Liberal Democrat MP for Manchester Withington who helped lead the campaign for a Turing law, said he was “very emotional” to see the new £50 note at the official unveiling and that it was a “massive acknowledgement of his mistreatment and unprecedented contribution to society”.Leech said: “It is almost impossible to put into words the difference that Alan Turing made to society, but perhaps the most poignant example is that his work is estimated to have shortened the war by four years and saved up to 21 million lives."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d601dbf8877adb1fc1a9fb5a4fa3ae9e5c2a1f33/10_208_3466_2080/master/3466.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c495018f537926fc9f47aff44ee8b23b","title":"boeing 737 max ordered by ryanair undergoes name change","story":"Decision fuels speculation that manufacturer and airlines will rebrand troubled planeA Boeing 737 Max due to be delivered to Ryanair has had the model’s name changed on the livery, further fuelling speculation that the manufacturer and airlines will seek to rebrand the troubled plane.Photos have emerged of a repainted 737 Max in Ryanair colours outside Boeing’s manufacturing hub, with the name 737 Max replaced by 737-8200 on the nose.The aircraft remains grounded worldwide after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed a total of 346 people. Boeing has yet to convince regulators that modifications to its software are sufficient to ensure its safety.Ryanair has 135 of the 737 Max models on order, the first five of which are due for delivery in the autumn. The airline has ordered a larger version of the Max 8, with 200 seats, now badged 737-8200 in the photographs taken at Renton in Washington, US, and posted on social media by Woodys Aeroimages.Neither Ryanair nor Boeing has commented or confirmed which airline decided to rebrand the model.It is not the first airline to use a different formulation. International Airlines Group, which owns carriers including British Airways and Aer Lingus, was equally coy when purchasing discounted Max planes from Boeing last month. Announcing the letter of intent signed at the Paris airshow, IAG referred to “200 B737 aircraft” that would to join its fleet, which it described as “a mix of 737-8 and 737-10 aircraft”.The first Boeing 737 Max begins commercial operations with Malindo Air. Norwegian Air is also an early adopter of the new model, operating transatlantic flights. The model promises fuel efficiencies attractive to carriers.Lion Air flight JT610 crashes after making a sudden, sharp e into the Java Sea 13 minutes after departing from Jakarta, Indonesia. All 189 people onboard are killed. That particular plane had been in use for less than three months.The plane\u0027s black box recorder reveals that the Lion Air plane had experienced problems with its airspeed indicators on its last four flights.Boeing issues revised instructions on how pilots should react to erroneous readings from “angle of attack” sensors, believed to be a key factor in the Lion Air crash.“In our view, the plane was not airworthy,” is the interim finding of the official investigation into the crash. The Indonesian transport safety agency did not pinpoint a definitive cause of the accident, but said Lion Air kept putting the plane back into service despite repeatedly failing to fix a problem with the airspeed indicator.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFlight ET302 crashes approximately six minutes after taking off from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people onboard. The captain had reported difficulties, and flight radar data shows the aircraft was climbing erratically with an unstable vertical airspeed.The EU, Canada and the US all ground the Boeing 737 Max. Boeing itself issues a statement saying it “continues to have full confidence in the safety of the 737 Max”, but that “out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public” it is recommending the grounding of the entire global fleet of 371 aircraft.The interim report into the Ethiopian Airlines crash finds that the pilots correctly followed Boeing’s emergency instructions, but were still unable to stop the plane’s nose repeatedly pointing down. The jet hit an airspeed of 500 knots (575mph), well above its operational limits, before cockpit data recordings stopped.Airlines extend their ban on using the Boeing 737 Max after the US aviation regulator said it had identified a new potential risk with the plane.United Airlines becomes the latest carrier to extend its ban on using the Boeing 737 Max after the US aviation regulator said it had identified a new potential risk with the plane.Pictures emerge of a Boeing 737 Max due to be delivered to Ryanair with the name 737 Max replaced by 737-8200 on the nose.Plenty of observers – among them the US president, Donald Trump – have advised Boeing to rebrand the plane before its eventual return to service. The US president tweeted in April: “If I were Boeing, I would FIX the Boeing 737 MAX, add some additional great features, \u0026amp REBRAND the plane with a new name.”Boeing told reporters at the Paris show that it would consider changing the brand name to help it return to the skies, although the company later said it was not working on a name change.The Max is Boeing’s top-selling aircraft, with about 5,000 ordered, although deliveries have ceased since the grounding in April and IAG’s is the only significant – and provisional – order.Investigations into the two disasters involving the 737 Max have highlighted the role played by anti-stall software that countermanded pilots’ commands as both planes crashed soon after takeoff. Airlines fear some passengers will refuse to fly on the Max."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e9c13d0d276f05e544cee8d64ca7339d1bb62cc/0_273_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18deecb21c45c45bc0a8e3a5e56d1859","title":"pets at home buys stake in dog walking service tailster","story":"Tailster uses app to offer network of 26,000 self-employed pet carers across UKPets at Home has taken a stake in the dog-walking and pet-sitting service Tailster, aiming to take a slice of a market estimated to be worth £1bn.Tailster uses a network of 26,000 self-employed pet carers across the UK, which it connects with customers via an app that offers GPS tracking of dog walks, real time photos and free insurance.The UK’s biggest pets retailer will offer Tailster’s services to its 4.4 million loyalty scheme members as part of its aim to fight off competition from online competitors, including Amazon, by generating half its revenues from services, up from about a third today.The market is growing fast as the under-40s splash cash on pets, which they increasingly see as family members.Pets at Home shares have recovered in recent months as trading improved after profits took a hit from a restructuring of its vets business.The company has spent millions of pounds buying back some practices that had been run as joint ventures and has closed at least 19 others since November. Services are already a core part of the business, including more than 300 grooming salons in stores and stakes in specialist pet hospitals.No details of the Tailster deal have been revealed but Peter Pritchard, the chief executive of Pets at Home, said the investment was “a win-win deal, good for both businesses but especially good for owners searching for someone they can trust to look after their much-loved pet”.Tailster was founded in 2014 by Indy Sangha and had raised $640,000 (£510,000) in funding for the business before Pets at Home’s investment, according to the tech startup site Crunchbase.Sangha, the Tailster chief executive, said said the company was aiming to consolidate a fragmented market: “Not only do the team at Pets at Home share our vision about how we can bring our services to UK pet owners and drive the growth of our business, but they also share many of our values of putting pets first, and the customer at the heart of what we do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a0602cc0cf06b1a03a90dadc656f178e3f78c24/0_157_4703_2822/master/4703.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31740f2b780b0aeaada0d9903e876bd5","title":"invasion electric scooter backlash","story":"They’re cheaper than cabs, less effort than a bike and more convenient than buses. But as the number of e-scooter accidents rises, a backlash is growingMost of the people riding electric scooters around Copenhagen glide like swans, bodies motionless and serene with heads tilted into the sunshine.I am the ugly duckling, wobbling and jerking while I struggle to figure out exactly how this two-wheeled contraption works. Where do I put my feet? How hard do I thumb the accelerator? And how on earth am I meant to indicate left and press the brake with my left hand at the same time?It doesn’t take long to start gliding, even if I don’t feel very swanlike, or to notice that people in Denmark have found all sorts of less conventional ways to use e-scooters since they were introduced in January. Couple after couple perch together, heels of their feet barely balancing on the footplate. A traveller presses his suitcase between his knees while he crosses the junction near Tivoli Gardens. Two teenagers dart along the footpath outside the city’s central station, nipping between pedestrians.“I’ve seen a guy sitting on a suitcase using it as a scooter chair,” said Jesper Hemmingsen, a researcher at the Danish council for road safety, the RST. “I’ve seen parents delivering their children to school, a child standing at the front and their parents steering. It’s an easy way to get there, but it’s not a safe way. I’ve seen parents hire scooters for their kids to give them something to do. People treat them like toys. But they have no protection.”Over the past 18 months, it feels as though e-scooters have taken over many of the world’s cities. Scooter share firms have staked claims in more than 100 cities worldwide. Lime and Bird (from the US) and Voi, Circ, Flash and Tier (from Europe), are start-ups dripping with venture capital backing, attempting to create and carve up a market that is changing cityscapes everywhere.But piles of scooters discarded by the roadside, a worrying number of injuries and even some road deaths have provoked a growing backlash in some places.Those dangers were underscored recently when Emily Hartridge, a 35-year-old YouTuber and TV presenter, was killed while riding an e-scooter in Battersea, south-west London, after a collision with a lorry at a roundabout. Last month Paris – the e-scooter hub of Europe, with an estimated 20,000 trottinettes on the streets – saw its first fatality after a young man was hit by a truck.So are e-scooters a vital new part of modern, eco-friendly urban transport, or are they a risky and unnecessary fad, pushed by tech investors desperate to disrupt the status quo? And what can people in the UK, where the use of e-scooters remains illegal on both roads and pavements – despite the rise in models for sale in shops – learn from the experience of other European cities?Copenhagen, where e-scooters arrived nearly six months ago, is well-placed to answer this question. The police and road safety council are assessing the impact of the seven scooter firms and 7,000 scooters that have arrived since the Danish government introduced a trial period on 17 January.Pedestrians complain about scooters strewn across pavements and that they are a hazard for blind people and wheelchair users, as well as other anti-social behaviour: one young man rode an e-scooter through the aisles of a Netto supermarket in Odense seven times in one day.The city is flat, which helps, but more importantly there are miles and miles of wide roads with dedicated cycle lanes, usually raised and separated from car traffic with a kerb. No one has to compete for space. A scooter shouldn’t need to be anywhere near a lorry.But the road safety council is still worried about a growing number of injuries. “At the moment we have an assumption that it’s the same level of injuries for e-scooters as for cyclists,” Hemmingsen said, mentioning a recent study by two casualty departments in Copenhagen that found an average of about two injuries a day. About 800 cyclists a year are seriously injured.Copenhagen police are also acting. After running an information campaign, senior officers mounted an operation against drink-riders earlier this month, posting officers around the city centre.In one night last weekend, 24 e-scooter riders were stopped on suspicion of riding while over the legal alcohol limit, and four more for some form of narcotic intoxication, superintendent Allan Teddy Wadsworth-Hansen said. They face fines of up to 2,000 krone (£240).One of the motorcycle officers standing in Frederiksborggade, a main route into the heart of Copenhagen’s night life, stopped one rider and breathalysed him. Then a second arrived who had also been drinking. “While he’s still trying to process the first one, a third e-scooter turns up with two people on it,” Wadsworth-Hansen said. “When they see the police, they try to slow down. The woman on the back falls off – she wasn’t hurt seriously – and the driver turns out to be driving under the influence of alcohol. And then a fourth one approaches, and he has also been drinking.”Although there is sometimes a spike in the number of car drink-drivers over the summer, “you would never get four drivers in a row over the limit,” Wadsworth-Hansen said. “It doesn’t really bode well for e-scooters late in the evening, because drinking and driving is dangerous.”“Road users are used to seeing bicycles, but they’re not used to e-scooters. When you see someone standing up, arms by their sides, it’s easy at a glance to think they are a pedestrian and not realise they’re coming towards you at 20kmh,” he said.The experience of Parisians suggests that it’s not only e-scooter riders at risk. Isabelle van Brabant was hit by an e-scooter in the park at Les Halles in May, breaking her wrist in two places and causing a bone tear. For the pianist at the Paris Opera, it’s a professional disaster as well as a personal one. “She cannot play piano for one year, and piano is her life,” said her husband Jean-René Albertin. “When Isabelle was at the hospital, they said that each day 10 people come in for treatment. We think about 200 people a day are hurt.”They have set up a campaign group, Apacauvi, to win compensation for victims, with legal actions planned against the Paris municipal authorities and the rider who injured Van Brabant. “We have received 10,000 messages and we have about 850 people who want to participate in the association – people who have been hurt,” Albertin said.He wants the French government to force riders to take out insurance before they start riding, so that victims can be compensated from a central fund, even if an inidual rider cannot be identified.Paris’s mayor, Anne Hidalgo, was in favour of e-scooters as a greener alternative to cars, but she has announced a crackdown on the “anarchic” dockless scooters. From this month, bad parking, riding on pavements and breaking the 20kmh speed limit will all result in fines. Police said they had issued 1,000 tickets and impounded 600 scooters.Albertin is unconvinced. “People just ignore the rules,” he said. But he is not in favour of an outright ban, as in the UK. “I don’t think making them illegal is right.”Britain remains a lacuna for the e-scooter share firms because, for at least the last 30 years, it has been against the law to ride them either on the road or the pavement. Electric scooters, like Segways, hoverboards, Go-Peds and self-propelled unicycles, are neither roadworthy enough under the Road Traffic Act 1988 to be registered as vehicles – complete with licence plate – nor can they be used on the pavement: an offence against the Highways Act 1835. People are occasionally prosecuted.Yet the e-scooter trade is flourishing. Halfords has 15 models available in the “kids zone” on its website. Argos has 23, also marketed as toys with designs from Trolls, Star Wars and Jurassic World. Ministers are in a bind, under pressure to liberalise or be left behind, while also wanting to enforce the law to prevent further tragedies like the one in Battersea.Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald told the Observer there was a “pressing need for the government to provide clarity and guidance” on e-scooters.In March, then transport minister Jesse Norman told the Observer he was considering licensing e-scooters, and his successor Michael Ellis is overseeing a review of legislation at the Department for Transport. But the government is also concerned about retailers flouting the law, and Ellis will hold a roundtable with Halfords, Lime, Bird and some manufacturers to urge them to tell consumers that they might be able to buy an e-scooter, but they can’t ride it in a public place.“We are examining whether they can be used safely on the road – and if so, how that should be regulated to ensure the public’s safety,” Ellis said. “However, companies must understand that reviewing laws does not necessarily mean laws will change. People who use e-scooters need to be aware it is currently illegal to ride them on the pavement and the road.”At night, the streets of Copenhagen are busy with e-scooters, and it’s easy to see why so many people have been stopped recently for drink-riding. You’re free to travel on a whim: it is cheaper and more immediate than cabs, far more convenient than buses or trains, and doesn’t require the effort of riding a bicycle.“It has completely ided people,” Hemmingsen said, as we walk round the meatpacking district. “Either people think they are the best thing ever or they are a scourge. I saw someone had put one in a rubbish bin. They dredged the harbour in March and they found 12, and scooters have only been here since January.”Here, there are neat rows of five Lime scooters on the street corners, and we soon catch up with the person leaving them there: Andrew, a Romanian driving a Lime van who has been working in Copenhagen for two months, repairing and recharging the scooters.He shows me how the handles, the GPS tracker and other parts of the scooter are damaged – “by drunk people” – but not very often. In other cities, scooter-share companies will pay freelancers, nicknamed “juicers”, a bounty for each scooter they charge, but Andrew says that there are 20 people like him in Copenhagen who are all well-paid Lime employees.There is some dispute about how long an e-scooter will last – some need to be replaced after just 28 days’ use in Paris, Albertin says, while Hemmingsen says they can go for up to three months. Andrew says many last much longer. The closest comparison in the UK is with dockless bike companies, three of whom have pulled out of the market within a year, complaining that vandalism in Britain is higher than anywhere else they have done business.The e-scooter firms say they take safety very seriously, and each app will remind riders of some basic safety tips when they scan and hire a scooter. Kristina Nilsson of Voi said the Swedish firm was in the process of creating dedicated parking spots in the 31 cities where they operate, giving riders the incentive of extra credits if they leave them in the right place.“We’re also in the process of rolling out speed zones, so in certain areas you go slower than 20kmh,” she said. Nilsson claims the crackdown by Paris is having an effect: “I understand Paris will have a tender for having only three players there. And we hope to be one of those three.”Some cycling charities see e-scooters as potential allies in the battle to get better cycle paths. Rachel White, head of policy at Sustrans in the UK, said they were “generally supportive” of scooters, if speeds were limited and they were kept off pavements. Beyond safety, they are only worried that having access to effortless travel might make us put in less effort. “A slight concern is that they don’t have the same health benefits as walking or cycling,” she said. “But generally, another group of organisations lobbying for more protective cycleways can only be a good thing.”The UK’s road network may yet dictate the future of e-scooters. In London the volume of traffic dwarfs the number of cars in Copenhagen while the cycling network is far less developed. London has 239km of cycle paths – less than the 375km in Copenhagen, and serving 13 times as many people. And outside the capital, the fragmented and often unreliable public transport system means commuters are wedded to their cars.Paul Hodgkin, CEO of UK mobility start-up Ginger, believes that in spite of this, Britain can introduce e-scooters safely. His firm is in talks about putting e-scooters in business parks and campus universities – on private land. “Innovation is happening elsewhere. Wait-and-see is not a neutral position. If we take too long, the industry will move on and we won’t be able to help set the model and get it right,” Hodgkin said.• This article was amended on 15 July 2019 to clarify a comparison of cycle paths serving London and Copenhagen, measured in kilometres.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/779d47de8e3d6c20ffc18d7e1e4ca119ad6c4085/0_47_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=369f10e54daa570647a897224385e10d","title":"cricket world cup england new zealand","story":"Money and chauvinism demand a victor and a vanquished. But in reality England and New Zealand were sporting equalsHuman nature hates a balance. It craves a victor and a vanquished. In yesterday’s Cricket World Cup final, not a wafer separated the England and New Zealand teams. They tied. The sporting solution would be for both captains to admit the fact and shake hands. But the money, the chauvinism, the howls from the gallery, were more powerful. Kipling’s “twin imposters”, triumph and disaster, had to be set on a pedestal and honoured with what amounted to a coin toss, the “most boundaries” rule. Cue mass hysteria in England and mass misery in New Zealand. Cricket had gone the way of football’s penalty shootouts.There is no denying that even the mildest patriot feels pride in victory for the home team – or in the case of cricket endearingly for the game’s “country of origin”. The chase is exciting and success goes deep into group identity. It is briefly and harmlessly heart-warming. It is curiously less an issue when the victor is not a team but an inidual, as in Lewis Hamilton’s F1 British Grand Prix triumph also at the weekend, or when Novac Djokovic beats Roger Federer in another epic encounter at Wimbledon – which perhaps also should have been an honourable tie. In all these cases, we can thank sport for taking our minds off troubled times and driving politics from the front page.George Orwell worried at the role of team sports in the national psyche. If they could boost morale, could they not also inflame it? He declared the chaotic 1940s football matches to be “war minus the shooting”. He was too alarmist. We have seen nothing since to equal Hitler’s 1936 Olympics, or the charioteer gangs of 6th-century Constantinople, who after one contest slaughtered hundreds and left the city a gutted ruin.Yet the emotion that now surrounds some commercially obsessive “world cups” recalls Orwell’s nervousness at sport’s military terminology and at the goading of governments to wild extravagance. The 2012 London Olympics blew some £13bn on two weeks of games at a time of national austerity. They were capped by Vladimir Putin’s $50bn Sochi Olympics and the crippling of Rio de Janeiro by the 2016 Olympics. Nation states used to compete with drugged athletes. They now compete with drugged Treasuries.Sport is not a proxy for war or for national prosperity. It is a pastime. The pleasure of cricket – so long in the doldrums – is the good humour with which it is played and its readiness to make itself less boring with shorter matches. The only pity is that when, just once in a lifetime, it delivers an uplifting equilibrium, it could not admit the fact, pat everyone on the back and share the champagne."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2e6407653e003ad99e170445ed2072c4e824229/0_98_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e94ff91d2f3f41e8ed1a57297fb5dc0","title":"european council fuel euroscepticism governments eu","story":"If Ursula von der Leyen gets the EU top job, it will undermine steps to give voters more of a role in European governanceAfter days of drama and late-night meetings, EU heads of government recently nominated their candidate to replace the Luxembourger Jean-Claude Juncker when he steps down as president of the European commission in October. As expected, the name to emerge was a German, but not the German who was expected. Rather than Manfred Weber, the lead candidate, or Spitzenkandidat of the biggest political group in the European parliament, the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP), Ursula von der Leyen, the German minister of defence was announced as the nominee. As some celebrated (finally) the promotion of a woman to the most powerful EU position, others (rightly) criticised her nomination for rendering the European electorate irrelevant in the process.In political science, European elections are referred to as “second-order” elections, as opposed to “first-order” elections, which determine national governments. In fact, European elections don’t even determine the EU’s “government”, which is constituted by the executive body, the European commission and the European council, where the member governments make new laws.In 2014, to make European elections a bit more relevant, or “first-order”, the largest political groups in the European parliament fielded their so-called Spitzenkandidaten or “lead candidates” for the commission presidency. Despite opposition from heads of government, notably Britain’s David Cameron and the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, Juncker, the candidate put up by the EPP, which won most seats in the 2014 elections, was voted president of the European commission for the 2014 to 2019 term.Five years on, this minimal attempt to give European voters more of a role in the EU’s governance has been abandoned in a return to the traditional horse-trading between national governments over the top jobs. Weber, Spitzenkandidat of the EPP, was opposed within both the European council and parliament, while Frans Timmermans, the lead candidate of the Socialists \u0026amp Democrats (S\u0026ampD), was rejected by leaders of the central and east European member states as well as the EPP.Instead, government leaders came up with Von der Leyen, a candidate no one expected, and who had played no role in the European elections. As a member of Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), she is supposed to represent the EPP, the overall winner of the European elections.But Von der Leyen is not the only candidate for a top EU position with no direct relation to the European elections. Nor is she the worst. Spanish foreign minister Josep Borrell, the council’s nominee for the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, was forced to resign as president of the European University Institute (EUI) over a conflict of interest in 2012, had to step down from the board of renewable energy group Abengoa because of a financial scandal in 2015, and was fined €30,000 for insider trading last year. His undiplomatic statements about American independence or Catalan separatism are right up there with Donald Trump’s. On the former, for example, he said: “all they (Americans) had to do was kill four Indians, but apart from that it was very easy.”Compared to Borrell, Christine Lagarde, currently managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the nominee for president of the European Central Bank (ECB), is squeaky clean. She “only” has a conviction for failing to challenge the state arbitration payout to a friend of former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, her then boss.Should the European parliament ratify the European council’s nominations in a vote on Tuesday, it will officially kill off the Spitzenkandidaten system. To be clear, this process was always an insider’s solution to an insider’s problem, namely the frustration of MEPs over their marginal role within the EU, rather than a true solution to the rightly maligned “democratic deficit” exemplified by the second-order status of European elections. Moreover, its top candidate, EPP Spitzenkandidat Weber, has done more than almost anyone to undermine the foundations of the European project by enabling Orbán to create an authoritarian state while remaining within Europe’s so-called “community of values”.In essence, the failure of the Spitzenkandidaten system is a logical consequence of the withdrawal of most of Europe’s national leaders in the wake of the great recession. Confronted with the unforeseen realities of the eurozone, they chose short-term national interests over long-time proclaimed European solidarity. From Berlin to The Hague they have rejected French president Emmanuel Macron’s reform proposal, which would further centralise governance of the eurozone, and instead called for less rather than more EU.The 2019 European election results were hailed as a setback for populists, who had “gained votes, but lost initiative,” while the highest turnout in 20 years was celebrated as a victory for democracy. Somewhat overstating his case, the EPP lead candidate, Weber, declared that Europeans had “used their right to vote to decide about the future of Europe and that gives the European parliament much more credibility and legitimacy for the future of the continent”.One month later, the European council has quashed this short-lived optimism for EU democracy. The governments’ motley crew of nominees shows not only a stunning disregard for the Spitzenkandidaten process but also for the European voter. They undid the little progress the European elections made, instead boosting Euroscepticism and weakening voter participation. For the sake of its own relevance as well as that of European elections, the European parliament should reject the nominees and propose its own list of candidates, who defend not only the interests of the European institutions but also those of liberal democracy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6314fc5301533d77b3ce11c98288c7033eeddd6f/0_24_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=511761506d73afeee1c91792c44e6755","title":"kamala harris 2020 record","story":"A leftward moving party is hungry for change. Just like Joe Biden, Kamala Harris’ past will prove to be a liabilityThe first pair of Democratic presidential primary debates showed how wide open the field is. Former vice-president Joe Biden came in with a comfortable lead, but stumbled during the debates and has dropped in the polls since.California senator Kamala Harris emerged the victor after the debate, confronting Biden on his past chummy relations with segregationist senators and vehement opposition to busing policies meant to integrate public schools. According to one poll, she’s now within two points of him.Joe Biden had a couple things going for him: he was connected to a popular Obama administration and he is still widely perceived as being electable. For stalwart Democratic voters, preventing a second term for Trump and an ever-rightward moving Republican party is a key priority.Biden might have stood out with his relatively conservative stances on healthcare, the environment, financial regulations and other issues that the Democratic base cared about – but at least he seemed like a safe bet to take on Trump. But now with the former vice-president crumbling under debate pressure and committing a seemingly endless string of gaffes, his electability may now be in question.The Biden team is constantly talking about “Obama-Biden” accomplishments, trying to inexorably tie him to the first black president’s legacy, but the more people find out about his own record, the more they’re turned off by it. The same will be true of Kamala Harris, a candidate who says all the right things on the debate stage, is surging in the polls, but will soon find out that positive attention may soon turn into negative scrutiny.Harris is talking about financial industry abuses, but she’s doing fundraisers with a Wells Fargo executive. Though often glibly compared to Obama, Harris’s policy triangulations, donor-base ties, and questionable political past are all reminiscent of Hillary Clinton. Take her stance on what was once seemingly her strongest policy stances. Harris was an initial endorser of Bernie Sanders’s 2017 healthcare bill, which would have set up a Medicare for All, single-payer system. Such a plan would get rid of private insurance middlemen, and improve health outcomes and efficiency across the country. “Let’s eliminate all of that. Let’s move on,” she said at a January town hall.Discussing her mother’s battle with colon cancer, Harris declared that “healthcare should be a right.”When candidates were asked during the debate whether they would “abolish private insurance in favor of a government-run plan”, she joined Bernie Sanders in raising her hand. That’s all fine and good, a brave stance that could have been followed up with an explanation telling millions of curious Americans that they can still keep seeing their regular doctors, only in our future universal healthcare system they no longer will have to deal with insurance companies and the accompanying hefty deductible and premium payments.Instead, she beat a hasty retreat. The morning after the debate, she said she had misunderstood the question and certainly believed the private insurance would continue to play a role providing supplementary coverage. In other words, she would keep around the same companies responsible for our failed healthcare system and allow them to rally their forces to undermine a Medicare for All plan. (Most Americans favor getting rid of private insurance, when told they can keep their doctors.)It’s no wonder that likely Democratic voters see Bernie Sanders as the best candidate to handle health policy – agree or disagree, he’s consistent, and has been standing firm for single-payer as others vacillate. Why trust newcomers to progressive stances over someone who has been saying the same thing for decades?Part of Harris’s dilemma must stem from the fact that she sees that her party’s voters are moving leftward, and sees Biden’s centrist vulnerabilities, but is at the same time reliant on far-from-progressive campaign donors. A recent New York Times headline captures the situation well: “Wall Street Donors Are Swooning for Mayor Pete. (And They Like Biden and Harris, Too.)”Harris is talking about financial industry abuses, but she’s doing fundraisers with a Wells Fargo executive, Miguel Bustos, implicated in the company’s fake accounts scandal. When it comes time to take on big banking interests, is it unreasonable to assume that she’ll be less willing to challenge the sector than, say, Senator Warren?And let’s not forget about racial justice, an issue Harris expertly used to contest Biden’s record. But what will happen when people start to pay closer attention to her history as California attorney general. Harris can talk about her past as a young black girl who personally benefited from school integration. But what about the young black people she sent to prison for drug violations? What about the poor mothers trying to get by in a society that gives them no support that Harris threatened to jail and fine if their kids didn’t show up on time to school?Some political evolutions are genuine, and Harris’s “law-and-order” past wasn’t out of place in the Democratic party at the time. But that old wisdom is now being called into question. It’s hard to imagine that a party tacking to the left in an increasingly polarized country is about to elect a criminal prosecutor as its nominee.For now, Sanders is still among the frontrunners but has some ground to make up. His debate performance was mediocre, and he needs to appeal better to older voters still in the Biden camp. But by having a record that matches his rhetoric and by avoiding monied interests, he’s showing that campaigns can be run on a very different basis than Harris is running hers.Bernie Sanders raised $24m in the second quarter of 2019. The workers that donated to him the most were teachers. His largest sum came from Walmart workers. That shouldn’t be a surprise – when other candidates were holding lavish fundraisers, Sanders was raising hell at a Walmart shareholder meeting, denouncing the Walton family’s greed and calling for the company to pay a living wage to its employees.That’s how you break from a stale establishment consensus. That’s how you actually show Americans that you’re different and that you care. That’s the type of angry and earnest politics that can beat President Trump.Kamala Harris isn’t just not leftwing enough to be the Democratic party’s nominee, she’s also not bold enough to win a presidential election and bring about the change we desperately need."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c143854fdec9550ff9cf71ef0d59fafc1da7b6c6/0_5_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7f1d19e224472ce29023829067bb9d3","title":"labour mps change uk jeremy corbyn","story":"Look, I get it. The headlines wrote themselves last week as more Change UK debris reformed as the Independents. Which faction was definitely, absolutely, fighting on as a party, and which bit was refusing to establish one? Was this the Peoples’ Front of Judea, or the Judean Peoples’ Front? Who got custody of Sarah Wollaston?It feels like some time ago, but for one short period back in the spring, it looked as though the formation of the Independent Group might just catalyse the unravelling of both parties of government. As one of the key instigators of the plan, I can tell you there was only one real metric of success that first week: could we get to the end of it without becoming a punchline? That we pulled that off was a testament to the desire of millions of people, feeling as politically homeless as the MPs that jumped, for something hopeful.We all know what happened next. The formation of the political party, Change UK, and its subsequent rather small and imperfectly formed electoral showing meant that moment passed almost as soon as it came.Nothing can be done, the moderately minded MPs of both legacy parties say, look at what Change UK did and take heed. Our failure is used as the proof point that something new can’t emerge. And yet: in many respects, the case for a proper realignment is stronger than when we left our parties.I shoulder my share of the blame for soiling the pitch. To rush to establish a political party, as just 11 MPs, was an act of hubris. That logo! The bus! We took the kicking that we deserved, especially when our desire to stand in the EU elections seemed destined to split the remain vote. But to use our (predictably) poor showing as an excuse for inaction, is surely the most cynical response of all.We were never going to be able to provide a compelling, centre-ground, future-focused electoral offer on our own. The act of leaving our parties was the beginning of something, not an end in itself. But others still need to face up to their own dilemma in representing parties they believe are unfit for office.So – to the real point of this missive. To my former Labour colleagues (for the Tories’ moment of reckoning will come in the autumn) let me say this: Don’t let Change UK put you off from acting.After last week’s revelations, you know everything you now need to about your leader. He isn’t going to change: the shutting down of democratic processes and debate his instincts on national security the vacuum of leadership on Brexit the stain of anti-Jewish racism in the party and his lack of interest in getting a grip. Truthfully, all this was visible the last time you passed a vote of no confidence in his leadership by a margin of four-to-one.Only two things have changed: his grip on the machinery of the party (insurmountably tighter) and his proximity to Downing Street (undeniably closer). The final foxhole that the moderate Labour MP will sink themselves into is “he’s unelectable, so it doesn’t matter”. Even if this were the case, it should matter. But I think that assessment is also catastrophically wrong. This was the prevailing wisdom last time around, before Labour went on to gain seats and deny the Tories a majority.If all you can come up with is stay and fight, you’re actually going to need to do both. In 2016, the Parliamentary Labour party delivered 172 votes to challenge Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. Today’s threshold is 52 MPs and MEPs, and the window for a challenge is closing. If you don’t act now, you will be heading for a speculative autumn election, and campaigning to make a man you believe is unfit to lead your party the leader of our country.There are just 10 days to go before parliament slumps into its long summer – if you can get one in five of your colleagues to support a challenge to the leader of the opposition, you must act now. And if you can’t clear even that low bar, then at least be honest with yourself – the fight is lost. All you’re doing is staying and propping him up.History is not just shaped by action, but by inaction as well. • Gavin Shuker is the MP for Luton South and a member of the Independents• This article was amended on 15 July 2019 to clarify that the writer is arguing that antisemitism is an issue in the Labour party rather than the Labour leadership"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ad5a896eb4935a5b666ccdff67338c37e6b85fd/0_109_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=686073bd5b0c4a376e790b918d857a2f","title":"12 of the best beaches in wales in pictures","story":"The coastline of Wales is dotted with more than 100 beaches, many of them award-winning.

This presents some very real risks, which we have seen highlighted by the recent failures of some academy trusts.” The system of summary evaluations of Mats was introduced this year and allows Ofsted to carry out inspections of a number of schools and publish inidual reports. Overall findings are discussed with trust leaders before a summary evaluation report on the work of the Mat is published, though an inspection grade, which would be normal with schools, is not given.Six Mats have been the subject of summary evaluations, among them the Outwood Grange academies trust, which has in the past been criticised for its discipline policy and high levels of exclusions. Ofsted’s report was positive overall but recommended that the trust should reduce exclusions by continuing to improve pupil behaviour.Ofted published a report on Monday based on an investigation into Mats, which found that schools in larger trusts benefited from economies of scale, back-office support, training, career progression and recruitment. However, it said some Mats had taken on a large number of struggling schools too quickly, without always having the capacity or leadership necessary to improve them.A Department for Education spokesperson said the academies programme and the freedom it gave school leaders has been at the heart of the government’s education reforms. “Ofsted have already published a number of summary evaluations reports, which are among a wide range of tools we use to hold academy trusts to account. This includes published information about trust performance, annual accounts and letters to trusts where there are issues of under-performance or weaknesses in governance or financial management.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/801e44bbbdc1707ef6972a145c98e1a88cae216e/0_299_3721_2232/master/3721.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6c30c883159fcfb4042c41dfdfc1c8b","title":"james bond 007 black female actor lashana lynch daniel craig","story":"Online joy over Lashana Lynch inheriting James Bond’s codename may be premature. White men won’t give up their hero status so easilyFans have been hoping for a black actor to play James Bond at least since 2012, when Idris Elba was first rumoured as a possible successor to Daniel Craig. The franchise seems to have finally come through this weekend it was reported that Lashana Lynch is going to be the new 007.There was much celebration on social media, which is understandable. But it may be a little premature. Casting black female actors as legacy characters is a great step towards rectifying the historical racism and sexism that has led to a disproportionate number of those characters being white men. But it’s only a step. Black women also need to be written with respect they have to be presented as natural, worthy heroes who deserve to wear the cowl or cape or tux in question. Otherwise, the new hero just becomes another way to demonstrate that the real, worthy hero is the white guy.There are numerous examples of this dynamic. One is the character of James Rhodes, who in various Marvel comics takes over from Tony Stark as the hero Iron Man. Rhodes is in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), too, and has long been presented as a kind of successor in waiting for Robert Downey Jr’s Stark.But, despite being the heir to the Iron Man helmet, Rhodes has never managed to get much attention or respect in the MCU. He was first played in the original Iron Man film by Terrence Howard, but creative and money differences meant the actor was cut from Iron Man 2. The role was taken over by Don Cheadle, who got to suit up as War Machine, an Iron Man clone, in a number of MCU films.After Stark dies in Endgame, though, it’s not Rhodes who is pushed forward as his heroic heir, but the white Spider-ManPeter Parker (Tom Holland). Parker is willed access to Stark’s global weapons system in Spider-Man: Far From Home. He and the entire cast of that movie talk at length about who should pick up Stark’s legacy. The most obvious answer is Rhodes, the guy who’s been piloting the armour for years. But he’s not even mentioned no one, apparently, remembers that he exists. Casting a black man as an important legacy character doesn’t matter much if you push him off to the side as soon as it’s his turn to put on the boots.Netflix’s Marvel show Iron Fist dumped its POC legacy character even more dramatically. The martial arts master Iron FistDanny Rand was portrayed for two seasons by Finn Jones. In the last episodes of season two, the Iron Fist power, complete with chest tattoo, was passed to Colleen Wing, played by Jessica Henwick, an Asian woman. Jones never seemed comfortable in the Iron Fist role his Danny Rand was a whiny nonentity, and he performed the fight choreography with a remarkable lack of conviction. Henwick was a much more likable and physically adept performer. It would have been exciting to see her in the title role. But as soon as it passed to her, Netflix cancelled the show.Another instructive example is the character of Bonnie in the television show The Vampire Diaries. In the books that the series is based on, Bonnie is white. The showrunners, though, chose to cast actress Kat Graham. That was meant to be a progressive move. But, as Ebony Elizabeth Thomas argues in her book The Dark Fantastic, the results were mixed. The show’s creators cut out most of Bonnie’s romantic plot arcs and made her a much less sympathetic character than she is in the books. They may have been concerned that white viewers would have trouble identifying with a black character. Whatever their reasons, Thomas points out that the casting change alone was not enough to overcome the powerful impulse to treat black girls’ stories as secondary to those of their white counterparts.The difficulty with changing legacy characters is that the original is generally seen as the iconic version, and successors are temporary and secondary. As a result, the non-white or non-male versions of the character can be treated as afterthoughts or sidekicks, or as mistakes to be quietly pushed from centre stage.There are some counterexamples. The animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse featured African-Latino Miles Morales as Spider-Man, and Morales did get to be the hero of the story, with Peter Parker serving as secondary support. Similarly, Jodie Whittaker’s Dr Who is unquestionably the star of her own episodes. Ocean’s Eight gender-swapped Ocean’s Eleven, and, while a couple of characters from the original franchise have cameos, they never steal the spotlight from the women (as if anyone could steal the spotlight from Rihanna).So will the new Bond treat Lashana Lynch as the real, heroic, central 007? Early reports suggest maybe not. Supposedly, Lynch has inherited the 007 codename, and her mission is to ask Craig’s Bond to come out of retirement for a serious mission. That sounds as if the white, male Bond is still considered the best of the best, with Lynch relegated to a supporting role. It’s not hard to imagine her written as little more than another, slightly glorified Bond girl, who gets killed off halfway through.Or the franchise could do better than that. If the plan is to set up Lynch to take over the mantle from Craig and helm a few Bond movies herself, that would be great. But it’s premature to give the film-makers too much credit. Experience suggests that, no matter what they say to the contrary, white guys are reluctant to pass their legacies on to anyone else."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ff85c1697d49a38811677a4a8b351f6d1bb925f/1397_23_1437_862/master/1437.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c1dceec99eec30fa0dffe5d5bfebdaf","title":"lashana lynch new 007 james bond daniel craig","story":"Daniel Craig retains title role but 25th instalment in the franchise reveals codename has been reassigned to British actor Lashana LynchWhile Daniel Craig is set to reprise his role as James Bond in the next film, the franchise is set for a shake-up, with reports claiming that black British actor Lashana Lynch has been cast as 007 – taking over Bond’s secret agent number after his character leaves M16.The Mail has quoted from an anonymous “movie insider”, who says that the 25th film opens with Bond (Craig), retired in Jamaica, being called back to action to fight a new villain.“There is a pivotal scene at the start of the film where M says, “Come in 007”, and in walks Lashana who is black, beautiful and a woman,” the source said. “It’s a popcorn-dropping moment. Bond is still Bond but he’s been replaced as 007.”Originally from West London, Lynch, 31, made her film debut in 2011’s Fast Girls, but her breakthrough role came earlier this year, as fighter pilot Maria Rambeau in Captain Marvel.The news of her being given Bond’s famous code name has been widely praised on social media, coming weeks after US singer Halle Bailey was cast as Ariel in Disney’s live action remake of the Little Mermaid.The 25th Bond film – which is being shot in Italy and the UK – has been plagued by difficulties, beginning in October 2015 when Craig said he would “rather slash my wrists” than play Bond again.Despite once saying he would rather take his own life than reprise his role as 007, Daniel Craig confirms he will return as James Bond for the franchise\u0027s 25th movie.Danny Boyle confirms he is working on a script for the next Bond film alongside his Trainspotting collaborator John Hodge.EON Productions’ Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, the custodians of the Bond movies, confirm production will begin at the start of December 2018, with the film released in the UK on 25 October 2019 and in the US a fortnight later.Boyle quits the movie over \u0027creative differences\u0027.

Green-shouldered tomatoes too, fat red peppers and a bunch of basil, its leaves as big as bay. A heavy wedge of watermelon perhaps, a cool cucumber and spiky bunches of hot rocket. Summer shopping is frustrating. Peaches or nectarines? Peas in the pod or broad beans? Should we buy radishes and artichokes? We need food for the grill, something to marinade, and yet we still want something of substance. (Seafood for a potato-topped pie, chicken for the barbecue.) From now till late autumn there is almost too much from which to choose. We should make the most of it.A halved watermelon becomes a fixture in the fridge from now till early autumn. Its ruby flesh chilled and waiting to become part of a salad or cut thick and brought out on a plate of crushed ice to finish a garden lunch. A watermelon laughs loudest when it is matched with chilli as it is so often in Mexico, but also when in the company of salty cheeses such as feta or ricotta salata.In deepest summer, I soak iceberg lettuce, bunches of thick-stemmed watercress and white-nippled radishes for 20 minutes in a bowl of ice and water to crisp and refresh. The watermelon needs a good hour or two in the fridge before slicing. The marriage of ice-cold melon, salty cheese and chilli is dazzling. Tweak the amount of chilli flakes to suit your own taste.

Add the chilli flakes, continue cooking for a minute, then remove the pan from the heat and set aside.Peel the watermelon, cut into thick slices and then into large chunks into a bowl, removing the seeds as you go.Finely chop the mint leaves, add to the melon then crumble or coarsely grate the ricotta over them. Drain the watercress, chicory and radish and add them to the bowl.Tip the seeds, spices and their oil over the watermelon and tumble everything together gently then transfer to a serving dish and bring to the table.A spice-speckled yogurt marinade is something I use a lot with chicken I plan to grill. It must be said that it does have a habit of sticking to the bars of the grill and the smoke that ensues sets off the fire alarm, so I have taken to browning the marinated chicken under an overhead grill in the oven. The meat shouldn’t be too close to the heat, lest the skin brown before the flesh is cooked through. I move the oven rack closer to the heat towards the end of cooking, to encourage a crisp skin. I think a little charring here and there is to be positively encouraged.Grind the saffron to a powder, tip it into a small bowl then pour the hot water over and leave for 10 minutes.Finely chop the chillies and put them into a large mixing bowl. Peel the garlic, finely chop and add to the chillies, then stir in the yogurt and the saffron liquid and set aside.Place a chicken thigh skin-side down on a chopping board then cut out the bone with a sharp knife. Open each boned thigh flat, skin side down, then bat out with a heavy weight such as a rolling pin or cutlet bat, till the meat is about ½cm thick. Submerge the meat in the yogurt marinade and set aside for a good hour.Put the rocket leaves into a large bowl of ice and water and leave for 15 minutes. Peel the cucumber, then cut into large diagonal chunks. Pick the parsley leaves from the stalks and add to the cucumber, then drain and shake the rocket dry and toss with the cucumber, olive oil and white wine vinegar. (No salt or pepper is needed here.)Heat an overhead (oven) grill. Line a grill pan or oven tray with foil, lay the pieces of chicken on it skin-side down and cook, a good 15-20cm from the heat source, for 8-10 minutes, then turn over and cook the other side. Check the flesh is cooked right through and adjust the proximity of the oven shelf to the heat as necessary. The chicken should be nicely browned, cooked all the way through, its skin patchily gold and dark brown.Serve the chicken hot with the cucumber salad.Prawn shells make a light but flavoursome stock. Stuff the usual aromatics in with them – bay, peppercorns, parsley stalks – but not carrots, which can introduce too much sweetness. I used hake, which was snow-white, cheap and sustainable, but haddock or cod are suitable too, especially if the fillets are thick.I prefer a filling that is mostly fish, but the recipe lends itself to some improvisation. You could cut down on the fish and add instead a couple of handfuls of lightly cooked and skinned broad beans or a large leek sliced and softened in butter.Serves 4raw prawns 500g large bay leaves 3black peppercorn 10water 600mlfloury potatoes such as maris piper 850golive oil 5 tbsphake 700gspring onions 3butter 50gplain flour 50gdouble cream 100mlSet the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Peel the prawns, putting the shells into a medium-sized saucepan and returning the prawns to the fridge. Add the bay, peppercorns and water to the pan and bring to the boil. Lower the heat, partially cover with a lid, then leave to simmer for 30 minutes before removing from the heat.Peel the potatoes then coarsely grate them. Warm the olive oil in a shallow pan over a moderate heat, add the potatoes and let them sizzle for a few minutes until pale gold. Using a draining spoon or fish slice, transfer them from the pan to a piece of kitchen paper.Strain the stock and discard the prawn shells and aromatics. Skin the hake and cut into thick pieces about 4cm in length. Roughly chop the spring onions.Melt the butter in a medium-sized saucepan, add the flour and cook over a moderate heat, stirring constantly till you have a smooth paste. Pour in the prawn stock, stirring with a wooden spoon until you have smooth sauce. As it bubbles, stir in the cream and a few grinds of salt and pepper. Add the hake, pushing the fish under the surface. Leave them for three or four minutes then add the prawns and the chopped spring onions.Transfer the filling to a pie dish, scatter the fried potato over the surface, leaving a few gaps here and there. Bake for 30 minutes till the sauce is bubbling up through the crust.A scarlet slice with which to start dinner a light garden lunch or a weekend breakfast, there is almost no stage on a summer’s day when this tomato toast isn’t appropriate. The roast vegetables, sweet-sour and smoky, will keep in the fridge for a day or two. A useful sauce in which to toss bucatini or perhaps gnocchi that you have fried in a little olive oil till crisp.Set the oven to 200Cgas mark 6. Peel and roughly chop the shallots. Halve, seed and roughly chop the peppers. Put the peppers, shallots and the whole cherry tomatoes snugly in a roasting tin, pour over the 6 tablespoons of olive oil and roast for an hour until all is soft and the skins are blackened here and there.Toast the pine kernels in a dry, shallow pan till golden, shaking them now and again, so they colour evenly. Cut the beefsteak tomatoes into large pieces, put them in a bowl then tip in the pine kernels. Tear the basil leaves from their stems and add them to the tomatoes together with a little salt and a splash of olive oil.Slice the ciabatta in half horizontally. Toast the cut sides until golden and lightly crisp, then place on a serving board or plate. Crush the roast vegetables to a rough puree with a fork, or in a blender or food processor, and spread generously over the toasted bread. Pile the chopped tomatoes and basil on the toast, cut each piece into four slices and serve.Jelly and cream was one of the most looked-forward-to desserts of my childhood, albeit orange jelly from a packet and tinned cream. Don’t even think of juicing your own cherries for the recipe that follows. Better I think is to find a brand of bottled cherry juice without added sugar. (Health food stores are a good hunting ground.) I like a soft, barely set jelly that glows in the glass and shimmers on the spoon rather than one you can set in a mould and turn out. Put a spoonful of the cherry cream on top of the jelly and dig deep for a little of both the sweet, orange-scented cream and sour garnet red jelly.Enough for 6 large wine glasses or 12 small onesgelatine 7 sheetscherries 200gcherry juice 1 litreFor the creamcherries 150gcaster sugar 3 tbsporange finely grated zest of 1 smalldouble cream 250mlPlace the gelatine in a bowl of cold water and leave for a few minutes to soften.

Lift the softened gelatine from the water and stir into the warmed cherry juice. When the gelatine has dissolved, stir in the remaining juice and pour into the wine glasses. Place in the fridge and leave for five hours or until lightly set.Make the cherry cream. Shortly before serving the jellies, halve and stone the 150g of cherries. Put the sugar and orange zest into the bowl of a food processor, and process briefly until the sugar has turned a pale lemon colour.Pour the cream into a chilled bowl and whisk until it will sit in soft folds (stop before it is stiff enough to stand in peaks). Fold the cherries and most of the orange sugar into the whipped cream. Do this lightly, without further whipping the cream.Serve the cherry cream with the jellies. I like to pile a spoonful of cream on each jelly at the table and a sprinkling of the remaining sugar over the top. and Observer aim to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

It is usually started by Dad because the plates are not hot enough (so the food goes cold). The discussion then treads a familiar path. Dad’s fixation with hot plates is put down to his Lancashire childhood – my grandma was extremely keen on heating plates, and believed that piping hot food and hot plates was evidence that it was freshly cooked (ie, not sitting around).The irony of this was that when faced with Grandma’s food, everyone spent a great deal of time puffing in and out, saying: “Hot, hot!”, then blowing on the food to cool it down. The opposite pole of the discussion is still that the plates, and subsequently food, are too hot. This is usually started by me, and it boils down to the fact I live in Italy, but that’s for another column.There was also polarity when it came to soup – hot and cold. At least, that was how I used to think about it: there are soups that warm when it is cold, and soups that cool when it is hot. What is becoming more and more apparent is that many of the soups I enjoy most, regardless of the season, inhabit the space in between the extremes – a just-warm to room-temperature spectrum.I have been thinking about this a lot this summer, for as much as I like an icy gazpacho, Vichyssoise, almond or cucumber soup, I think I most enjoy the flavours that come with a soup that is served just-warm. I am thinking about Jane Grigson’s mint and pea, or one that is made with a floppy-leaved Sicilian green called tenerumi, and one made from a pap of bread and tomato, or borlotti beans and pasta – all soups that benefit from moderation rather than extremes. Marcella Hazan has a lovely description of Milanese minestrone with rice in her book The Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking, describing how, in the hotter months, restaurants would make it in the morning, then leave it sitting to settle to room temperature in readiness for lunch.In the summer I, too, make this Sicilian minestra di patate e peperoni – red pepper, tomato and potato soup – in the morning so it is ready for lunch. I thought it was an odd-sounding soup when I first read about it, but it is surprisingly good, the soft sweetness of the pepper, red onion and ripe tomatoes given starchy substance by the potato.The “recipe” I first followed was a sketch, with no real quantities, from a friend, which I found quite liberating, but I include one below. I haven’t been adding spinach or chard because I didn’t fancy them. The advice of another recipe is to add a spoonful of red-wine vinegar at the end. It is a lovely addition, especially if you have a good vinegar, the soft acidity sharpening the edges and contrasting nicely with the mellow sweetness of the red peppers. For a smoother texture, half the soup can be blended, then added back in at the end. If you are particularly averse to pepper skins, you could cook them separately, roasting, resting and peeling, then adding them towards the end of simmering. You will be skin-free, but it also means the soup won’t have the same depth of flavour or rosy-red colour.Resting the soup once you have made it isn’t just about temperature, but flavour, which develops while it sits. I love this soup when it is just warmer than room temperature, with bread and cheese on the side.“Minestra” comes from the word, ministrare – to administer or share out. The beauty of soup is not just the sharing, but that it is given the shape of the dish it is put in – and the dishes can be any temperature you like.6-8 tbsp olive oil1 red onion, peeled and slicedSalt and black pepper1 large potato (about 400g), peeled and diced2 large red peppers, deseeded and diced2 large tomatoes, peeled, deseeded and roughly chopped1 handful spinach or chardRed-wine vinegar (optional)Put the olive oil, onion and a pinch of salt in a large, heavy-based pan over a medium-low heat.

I had never before thought of it in the same light as a tomato, but tossed in this simple salsa, its sweetness and acidity work remarkably well with the caramelised, fatty pork.Although you can slow cook ribs, they are also beautifully tender when roasted hot and fast.For the marinade1 dried chipotle chilli, or 1 tbsp smoked paprika2 tsp cumin seeds2 garlic cloves, peeled1 tbsp dijon mustard2 tbsp tomato puree2 tbsp molasses sugar75ml cider vinegarSalt and black pepperFor the pineapple salsa½ small, ripe pineapple, peeled and core removed½ red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped½ small bunch mint, finely chopped ½ small red onion, peeled and finely choppedJuice of 1 limeHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan) 390Fgas 6, if you are going to cook the ribs without marinating. For the marinade, put the chipotle chilli in a small pan, cover with boiling water and simmer for 10-15 minutes, until soft. (Alternatively, to speed things up, put the chilli and water in a heatproof bowl and blast in a microwave for a minute or two). Once soft, discard the stem and remove most of the seeds. Transfer to a tall jug with the cumin, garlic, mustard, tomato puree and molasses sugar. Blitz with a stick blender, slowly pouring in the vinegar to create a smooth paste, and season well with salt and pepper.Put the ribs in a large, foil or silicon-lined baking tray and rub in the marinade. Preferably, leave to marinate for a few hours, or overnight, but if you want to serve them sooner you can cook them immediately. Roast for an hour, turning them over halfway, until the ribs are golden, caramelised and the meat is soft. Remove from the oven, cover with foil and rest somewhere warm for 10 minutes.To make the salsa, cut the pineapple into long, thin strips, then finely chop and transfer to a bowl. Add the other ingredients, and season to taste, adding more lime if needed, and a pinch of sugar if the pineapple is not sweet enough.Serve the ribs with the salsa, some baked potatoes and a crisp slaw of wafer-thin red and white cabbage, radishes, fennel and chopped coriander.Sweat two onions in butter for 15 minutes until soft, then add the marinade ingredients, plus half a bottle of ketchup for a delicious homemade barbecue sauce (ramp up the chilli, if you like). Or mix the marinade into pork or beef mince for delicious burgers.

Another $200,000 in “expenses” was also requested for a private Qatari company, Oryx QSI, run by his brother.It is forbidden for a club president to personally pay an agent. According to article seven of Fifa’s regulations for intermediaries “any payment for the services of an intermediary shall be made exclusively by the client of the intermediary to the intermediary”.The French Football Federation (FFF) confirmed to the  and the French website Mediapart that such a payment would violate its regulations. The French Professional Football League (LFP) said it would also breach L. 222-17 of the Sports Code, which stipulates that only players and clubs are allowed to pay an agent. “A club president therefore can not, personally, directly fulfil the payment of commission to an agent,” it added in a statement.The confidential letter, written in Arabic, also suggests that Khelaifi gave inaccurate information to Renaud Van Ruymbeke, a French judge who is an investigative magistrate, when he told him he did not have authority to sign. He told the judge: “I did not have the signature – I could not order any expense” for Oryx QSI in 2011. However, the letter was written on Oryx QSI notepaper and signed by Nasser.The letter is included as an PDF sent by email in a large tranche of documents seen by the  and Mediapart. Information in the letter has been supplemented by documents from Football Leaks, obtained by the German news magazine Der Spiegel.It appears to describe an operation ordered by the current emir of Qatar, which aims to pay – through Khelaifi and the company Oryx QSI – an undisclosed commission to an agent.The letter, apparently from Khelaifi, is addressed to “His Excellency Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa Al Thani, Chief of Staff of His Highness the Crown Prince”, and includes the subject line: “Commission of the agent in charge of the player Javier Pastore and expenses of the company Oryx QSI.”In the letter Khelaifi writes that his letter is “based on verbal instructions given by His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, heir to the throne, may God protect and conserve him, regarding the payment of the commission due to the agent in charge of the player Javier Pastore amounting to 2 million euros (2,000,000) in exchange for his transfer from the Italian club of Palermo to Paris Saint Germain, in addition to the expenses of Oryx QSI, amounting to US $200,000 (two hundred thousand US dollars).”Details of where to make the payments are then given, before Khelaifi adds: “We thank you for your help and cooperation with us. Please accept, Your Excellency, the expression of my respect.”Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani succeeded his father as emir of Qatar in 2013.When contacted by the  with detailed questions, Khelaifi’s lawyers initially responded by saying that the states leading the blockade of Qatar – which includes Saudi Arabia, UAE and their allies – had circulated “a huge amount of misleading information and fabricated documentation purportedly referring to the State of Qatar and the activities of various of its citizens”.They added: “In these circumstances … our client cannot admit either the authenticity of the material you have described but refused to provide … or the various conclusions you seek to draw from this.” and Mediapart offered precise information allowing Khelaifi to find the email regarding Pastore in his mailbox, as well as an English translation of the typed letter in the attachment. Since then no response has been forthcoming from his lawyers.Representatives for both Thanis also refused to comment.Khelaifi has received a preliminary charge of “active corruption” as part of an inquiry into the bidding process for the 2017 and 2019 World Athletics Championships. During the bid a payment of $3.5m payment was made from Oryx to the marketing executive Papa Massata Diack which the French authorities suspect was a bribe.The Argentinian was also representing Palermo in the deal although, under the French and international rules prohibiting an agent to represent several parties in the same operation, he was not allowed to be paid by PSG for the transfer.However, confidential documents from Football Leaks appear to show that on 15 September 2011, a month after the transfer, a colleague of Simonian contacted the French lawyer Emmanuel Moulin about the Pastore deal – and asked him to get in touch with PSG to claim an amount which the club owed to Simonian. Football Leaks documents also suggest that Simonian was informed of this request.According to those documents, an employee of Moulin’s law firm contacted Simonian and his acquaintance the next day, to tell them that Moulin had been in touch with PSG and that the club had confirmed that the payment was made. There was no indication of the sum involved.Presented with this information, Simonian any denied any wrongdoing. “Maybe you have misread or badly translated,” he replied. He said he did “not remember” such an exchange, adding that he “never asked PSG to be paid” regarding the transfer of Pastore.“Neither me nor Emmanuel Moulin have received any commission on the transfer of Pastore. Zero,” he added. “I could not receive a commission because I was the co-owner of the player.”Moulin declined to comment on the request for payment to PSG. But he rejected “with the utmost vigour” that there had been any wrongdoing or compliance issues regarding Pastore’s transfer or in the way it was reported to French football authorities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7945f7520c8f361b5fd9ca45d7ea03f0a741d833/0_186_5025_3015/master/5025.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3277ae13c51e1a2238f7d845bc6a2f6","title":"rose seeds from syria refugee family cultivating new life lebanon","story":"Sweet-smelling success for Syrians who have settled in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley is dampened by growing anti-Syrian sentimentby Jenny Gustafsson in the Bekaa valley photographs by Alia HajuWhen the plastic bucket is filled with roses, Nahla al-Zarda takes it into the kitchen, where she separates the petals from the buds. She soaks them in boiling water, which blushes pink.“I love this colour. It will be even stronger when the drink is ready,” she says.Her husband, Salem al-Azouq, a man in his mid-40s, is out picking in the small field behind his house, which is filled with roses of the same shade.“There was nothing here when we came five years ago. It looked like that,” he says, pointing to the wheat plantations on either side of the plot.It is six years now since they came to Lebanon, and five years since they moved to the makeshift house at the edge of the plantation. Before that, they were in a refugee camp, like many of the 1 to 2 million Syrians in the country.Al-Azouq works quickly and with ease. He only picks large buds, leaving the smaller ones for later. Now, during the season, he harvests two or three times a week, preferably in the early morning.“That is the best time. The rose is still asleep, holding on to its fragrance,” he says.Behind his back, in the far distance, lies the mountain range separating Lebanon from Syria. Al-Azouq’s home village is beyond those mountains, in a farming area near Damascus.He started coming to Lebanon in 2006 for seasonal work, just like hundreds of thousands of other Syrians. It was always in cultivation: roses and trees were his speciality. Then, the war came. The couple, with their small twin daughters and baby son, fled.“We had just spent all our savings on building a house. Nothing is left of it now. You don’t even hear birds singing in our village today,” says al-Azouq.His youngest son, two-year-old Ahmad, follows his father through the field. When they pass by a tap and buckets being filled up, he stops to play with the water. Al-Azouq points to the different things he grows: red and white roses for people’s gardens, trees about to bear fruit, rosemary, basil and lavender. But the star is a bright pink rose with a fragrant smell, the one he was picking earlier.“It’s the sultani, the best kind of rose. No other has the same strong flavour,” he says.For the rose growers of Lebanon and Syria (lands that gave name to the Damascus rose, cherished by Shakespeare, the Babylonians and ancient Egyptians), this is what ultimately matters. Most of their roses go into making one of the most significant culinary products in the region: rose water.This scented liquid, still produced with the same distillation technique that 11th-century medical scholar Ibn Sina invented, is used in a range of Middle Eastern recipes. Lebanese and Syrians add it to their cheese dessert kanafeh, as well as their date cookies and syrupy baklava. Turks and Iranians flavour ice cream and Turkish delight with it Indians their lassi.Sweets aside, rose water has always had an important place in folk medicine as well, and is used for ailments including digestive issues, high blood pressure and insomnia.“For us, it is part of our tradition of mouneh, preserving food for the winter. This is how we capture the flavours of the season,” says Lebanese food writer Barbara Massaad.The couple do not produce rose water themselves – they do not have the equipment, and al-Azouq’s expertise lies in cultivation and growing. They sell to others in Lebanon doing distillation, both in the Bekaa Valley and on the coast.Despite the history that Lebanon shares with Syria, and the many family ties that cut across the border, anti-Syrian attitudes have been growing in the country. Refugee settlements have been raided and families evicted, and municipalities have imposed curfews on Syrians.“Families are not allowed to leave the camps without a permit, not even to buy water or see the doctor,” says Doha Adi from the organisation Sawa for Development and Aid.After several years of extending great hospitality to Syrian refugees, Lebanon has been struggling with an economic crisis and foreign minister Gebran Bassil recently made anti-refugee statements on Twitter and in speeches.“This way, people are steered towards blaming refugees for their worries, even when they have nothing to do with it,” says Adi.Cultivating roses, al-Azouq and al-Zarda work in one of only three sectors legally open for Syrians: agriculture, construction and waste management. They pay rent for their land, as all refugees do, including the majority of those living in camps.“The flowers we grow are from Syria. We brought seeds with us when we left,” says al-Azouq.He stretches out his hand to pick a rose and almost grabs hold of a bee – but that is OK, he says, he usually gets stung once a day.“I am happy for the bees. They are a sign that the fields are healthy.”Al-Azouq brings two-year-old Ahmad into the kitchen. He is about to go and pick up the other children from school, then pass by the organic farm he runs together with other Syrians, Lebanese and a French brother and sister. Using natural techniques, they aim to protect the bioersity of the region, not least species that have suffered from the war in Syria. They cultivate a range of fruits and vegetables there – but no roses. These are reserved for the family’s backyard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b9a501ee68cd22e989e61f607e92f3a09568a4d/0_0_5575_3345/master/5575.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf3dbcf748331f2961610b6aa0dd4599","title":"tell us have you remarried your partner after divorcing them","story":"Does the marriage feel different the second time around?

The conditions were hardly dreamy: it was raining I hadn’t bought a bathing suit the only towel I could use was the child-sized one provided by the Airbnb. But I took them up on it all the same. “I’ll be with you in five minutes,” I said, grinning.In the past, I would have required more coaxing spontaneous, sociable swims were hardly my default mode of exercise. I’d suffered from anorexia in sixth form, and although I’d recovered while at university, in my mid 20s I’d started to slip back into that old, punitive mindset. Supposedly “healthy” eating plans were accompanied by a strict exercise regime: running. Five times a week. Solo. (Just like when I was a calorie-counting A-levels student, I craved control. Having someone join me would require compromise and flexibility – two concepts that seemed about as palatable to my weight-conscious self as supersize tubs of lard.)To clarify, this wasn’t a constant period of anguish. Rather, it was three years or so in which I’d flit between nervy months of restraint and periods of respite when I somehow felt grounded enough to … well, chill out a bit. In these stretches, I could skive my runs entirely – or ditch them for a more leisurely form of exercise. I started going for lazy, pleasure-driven swims, and in doing so clutched at a lifeline that would eventually haul me from the whirlpool of self-criticism and obsessiveness for good. (Well, almost.)As a child I had enjoyed visiting my local pool, but seeing as you can hardly open a newspaper nowadays without someone gushing about wild swimming, the adult me gravitated outdoors. On trips to visit family in Sweden, I floated languorously around calm, cavernous lakes. And like all good arty millennials in London, on boiling Saturdays I made for the ponds on Hampstead Heath.It wasn’t until the hen party, though, that I realised how profoundly swimming had changed me.Tragically, a women-only weekend like that – one involving glamorous outfits and carefully apportioned “getting ready” time – would normally bring out the worst of my neuroses. But instead of glaring at my thighs in the mirror, I was bobbing up and down in the sea in greying underwear, too busy squealing at the cold to think about anything else.The physical benefits of wild swimming are well documented. But for me it was about more than the rush of adrenaline that comes with charging into a freezing sea, or the blissed-out peace you feel while towel-drying your hair in the cool evening air. Swimming outdoors, it turned out, had fundamentally recalibrated my mindset around exercise. After all, unlike running, it wasn’t an activity that I could control and schedule. Unless you’re phenomenally hardy, it’s weather-dependent – and, equally, unless you happen to have a lido on your doorstep, it hinges on location. You do it with friends, and having company blasts any perfectionist routines (“If I don’t do blah lengths in blah amount of time, I will have failed!”) out of the water. I started to appreciate the relief that comes with letting forces beyond yourself – the weather, the seasons, other people – dictate your agenda. While it’s no bad thing to take your fate into your own hands, I had a habit of squashing it once it was there. Swimming taught me the good that can come from letting go.It also helped me to embrace my body. After all, in the water, plumpness is power. When I was at my lightest, in school, I was cold all the time – and swimming, particularly outdoors, was out of the question. But now I can do lengths and lengths without a worry. I’ve stopped dieting, and while numerous factors brought that about, the way swimming made me feel more comfortable in my own skin undoubtedly contributed.Nowadays, I get into the water as much as I can. But it isn’t a strict routine I approach it as a treat, like going for an ice-cream. While I still run, swimming has helped me see the benefits of exercising less intensively. I do a slow jog a couple of times a week – and most of the time it is motivated by a desire to let off steam rather than a compulsion to shed calories.I’d be lying if I said I had shaken off my anxieties completely. I suspect I will always have an obsessive side. Happily, though, swimming is not only helping to keep this under control – it is also the result of doing so. If I’m relaxed enough to jump into the waves on an overcast Saturday, chances are, life is pretty sweet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b01f58e04f9596cd30673e0eb8cfcc9a816a253/176_0_5104_3064/master/5104.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db2128b1cbe57c9389ad0aacb4bc67f6","title":"how we met his tinder profile said he wanted to cycle round the world i asked when are we leaving","story":"Mike and Helen Langridge live in Edinburgh. Mike, 32, is a solicitor and Helen, 30, works for an outdoors clothing companyWhen Helen saw on Mike’s Tinder profile that he was a keen cyclist and wanted to cycle around the world, she sent him a message. “I said: ‘When are we leaving?’,” she recalls, “and he said: ‘How about Tuesday?’”When they met up in a pub a week later, in January 2016, they talked about the trip. “It was, initially, ‘Wouldn’t it be funny? How would you do it?’,” says Helen. “It was on the second date that it started to be a bit more: ‘Why shouldn’t we do it?’ We weren’t happy with our jobs, and we had no responsibilities to hold us back.”After four weeks they were a couple, and after five months they moved in together, mainly to save money. They sold everything worth selling, and stopped spending. Mike was working long hours as a trainee solicitor, but took an evening job in a restaurant. Helen worked in a medical lab and transcribed medical notes in the evenings. In November 2016, Mike proposed, and in April 2017, they embarked on their round-the-world cycle ride. They left on a Tuesday.“Lots of people would say to us, especially when we’d been on the road for a while, ‘That must be like 10 years of marriage condensed into 18 months,’” says Mike. “In a way it was, because we spent every day together.”They didn’t cycle side by side the whole way. “We would very rarely lose sight of each other, but it didn’t mean we were always in conversation every second of the day,” says Helen. “Occasionally I wanted some of my own time, but even then I was like: ‘Don’t go too far.’”They got to know each other, and themselves. “It was a big lesson in compromise, communication and listening,” says Mike. “Not just what someone was saying, but all the non-verbal things: is Helen tired? Is she stressed? She’s saying we can go on, but does she mean it?”And they saw each other during extreme moments. Cycling across Australia – in 40C heat, into a headwind that meant they couldn’t travel more than six miles an hour – was the most brutal time, physically and mentally. “For weeks on end, nothing changed,” says Helen. “We both reacted very differently to release that stress.”Helen cried every day Mike tended to bottle up his emotions, but, after a minor disagreement, had a meltdown. “It’s probably quite a rare thing to learn about a partner,” says Helen. “I guess not many people experience that kind of extreme to know how the other person would react.”Moving on to the US, they cycled from San Diego to Yosemite national park, where they got married. “I think by then we’d done a year and about 12,000 miles,” says Mike. “We were like: ‘We’ll be fine we’ll still love each other enough to get married.’” Their parents and a couple of friends flew out, then Mike and Helen carried on. It was about a month later that Mike nearly died of hypothermia in the Rockies. “That was our honeymoon,” he says with a small laugh.They had left Salt Lake City and were cycling along the hard shoulder of the interstate highway when a storm came in. Within minutes the temperature had dropped to about 4C and there was nowhere to shelter. Helen was in front. “Over the noise of the traffic I heard him shout, so I turned around and he had his eyes closed but he was screaming and crying, and he wasn’t really with it. I don’t know how he hadn’t already cycled into traffic because he was weaving along the hard shoulder with his eyes closed. I dropped my bike, and caught him. His body was curling over the bike and I couldn’t unfurl him.” She turns to him. “You weren’t reacting to me.”She waved a car down and a man helped drag Mike off the bike and get him into the car to try and warm him up until the ambulance arrived.After Mike recovered, they cycled on through Canada, and two months later flew to France and made their way back home, arriving in the UK in August last year. Was it hard to get back to a more normal life? “It’s almost like it never happened,” says Helen. “All those amazing experiences and places and people, it’s like it never happened.” Mike had the harder task, she says, going back to work so quickly.There are new adventures, though of a more stationary kind (they are buying their first house). Everything in their relationship until now had been focused on the trip, says Helen – either planning it, or on it. “I think there was a risk that our relationship was so based around that trip that it could have fallen apart once we came back,” she says. “But it’s very naturally changed into a relationship at home.”Want to share your story?

What’s behind the malaise?Louise set herself two New Year’s resolutions for 2019: to start yoga, and to keep a journal. She did better than most people, sticking to both for five months. About six weeks ago, however, she recognised something was off. “During May, I noticed all I kept writing was how lethargic, below average or ill I was feeling.”Writing in her journal in the first week of June, the 30-year-old from Nottinghamshire wondered if hitting the six-month mark and “the downwards slope to winter” was taking its toll. “I was ready to brush it off as irrational,” she said, “until I saw this.”“This” was a  callout on “mid-year burnout”, asking readers to assess their moods and energy levels at this point in 2019 – were they tracking upwards with the mercury? Or were the longer, warmer days not having the positive impact they usually did?It was undeniably, as one reader said, “a self-selecting sample answering a leading question” – but many more saw the words: “Could you be suffering from mid-year burnout?” and responded with an unequivocal yes. Their responses, mostly submitted on condition of anonymity, told of sleep disrupted by lighter evenings, of unusually bad hay fever, of illnesses still lingering after months.Readers wrote of feeling as if they could fall asleep standing up, of waking with a racing heart or clouded mind, of having lost their energy, appetite or libido. They felt stretched too thin, in and out of work. They would go on holiday and spend all day in bed – or come back from holiday and find the positive effects gone after a couple of days. They were regularly surprised to find themselves irritable or tearful. Many said it was as if the joy had been sucked from life.Some were people whose existence was threatened – by debt, poor physical and mental health, underemployment, austerity, hate crimes or insecure work and housing. But even those who should have been thriving, or at least broadly fine, reported an apparent groundswell of malaise.For every reader who scoffed at the premise of mid-year burnout (“a trendy tag for tiredness. What the hell has the calendar got to do with this?”), there were many like Charlotte, a 47-year-old from East Sussex. “I wake up in the morning and think, did I get drunk last night?” she wrote. “And then I remember, no, this is just what normal feels like now. I’m just tired and moody all the time.”I understood, because I felt the same way. Summer was typically the season when everything just flowed, when longer days and warmer nights seemed to make it easier to balance life and work, while making the life part effortlessly more fun.Not this year, though. This year Lana Del Rey’s seven-year-old Summertime Sadness re-entered the US iTunes chart (“Is everyone OK?” fretted a viral tweet). Though I love my job, have no children or mortgage, am in good health and have taken regular holidays, by June it felt as if I was already out of fuel when I thought I’d only just stopped to fill up. The thought of another six months of running on empty seemed both impossible and inevitable.Gina, 33, from Kent, knew just how I felt. “The weekends don’t seem to bring respite at the moment,” she wrote. She and her husband were both “unusually tired and in need of a holiday this year”, despite a good work-life balance and holiday allowance. “I don’t think you would know from looking at us that we feel burned out – we are very active, busy people, with wholesome leisure activities and an active social life. But it all feels like too much.”There were obvious, numerous and very real reasons why people might be struggling. This was different (and, of course, incomparable, in terms of stakes or urgency): fatigue, felt both at a gut and bodily level, and in the atmosphere. Rob, 53, from The Hague, described himself standing in the shower each morning, yawning. He ached to take some time off, “to do nothing but just be”. “It’s like I lifted my head and it’s June already – how did that happen? It was Christmas a few weeks ago, wasn’t it?”There is some psychological significance to the midway point of the year, as a logical opportunity to take stock. People may be reminded of the optimism that they felt in the new year, or the goals that they set and are now no closer to achieving. “I think all the prospects of possible change die down, and it just becomes a slog towards the end so you can start afresh,” said Louise.Parents (and teachers) find themselves beset with demands for end-of-term events such as sports days and performances. “It is like a race to get to the finish line at home and work,” said a 42-year-old mother of two working in higher education in Worcester. “It is worse than December by some distance as there is only a long summer of juggling childcare and work commitments as a reward.”As in the runup to Christmas, social calendars also tend to fill up in summer – and the assumption of a lighter workload and a break is not always borne out. “It seems that it’s not only the onslaught of work, with various people off on holidays and clients wanting everything, even on a Sunday, but the birthdays, parties, gigs, all at once,” said Robert, 35, from Manchester. “It sounds like I’m being ungrateful. I’m not – I’m just utterly drained.”Other readers attributed their low mood and energy levels to the news cycle. Jan, 38, from Edinburgh, said the expectations of picnics, barbecues and socialising were “emotionally incongruous” with the climate emergency, Trump, the possibility of a no-deal Brexit and “the Tory leadership nonsense”: “This year more than ever, I want to hide from the world.”Many readers were holding out for autumn, winter, September, November, Christmas – a point in the not-too-distant future when this low ebb would pass, like bad weather. I thought I understood why. It was the same reason that I’d classified my own desperation as being of the mid-year. It was that the alternative was too grim to consider: that this threadbare feeling wasn’t seasonal, tied to longer, warmer days – but our new basal temperature.But Dr Natasha Bijlani, a consultant psychiatrist at the Priory hospital in Roehampton, south-west London, says that is exactly right. “I am sceptical about there being such a thing as mid-year burnout. We do know that there are high levels of burnout in our society in general I think it’s reaching epidemic levels. If you asked people the question in April or September, you could say it was the three-quarter-year burnout.”That doesn’t dismiss the issue rather, it casts it as catastrophic. Any discussion of burnout is valuable when so many people are suffering in silence, says Bijlani. “It allows people to be aware of all the time, not just in the middle of the year.”The World Health Organization clarified in May that it does not consider burnout a medical issue rather, it understands it to be an “occupational phenomenon” resulting from chronic and unmanaged workplace stress. It “should not be applied to describe experiences in other areas of life”.Definitions serve a purpose – especially when classification as a medical condition paves the way for treatment by medication. But for many, the suggestion that feelings about work can be restricted to “the occupational context” will provoke hollow laughter.Readers wrote, with no small desperation, of the impossibility of keeping their job separate from other areas of their life. A 38-year-old public servant said her husband was supportive, their jobs were rewarding and meaningful, their four children “thriving” – but she was hanging on by a thread. “My husband is exhausted with work too, and every day we say, ‘We can do this – just keep swimming.’ Some days it feels like everything is in its place and this is working other days – like today – it feels like the wheels are coming off.”The fix is not as straightforward as taking time off when that can create more work in the leadup, and another pile on your return (while those who remain take up the slack). Londoner Claire, 35, used to work 60-hour weeks, only able to catch up on sleep and laundry at the weekend. “It always got worse in summer – the bosses would take the full six weeks off work and come back all refreshed, while my ‘holiday’ was the August bank holiday weekend, when I’d go to visit family and I’d crash out from exhaustion.”Bijlani sees only the most severe cases of burnout at the Priory, but she lays the blame with a culture that frames overwork as the norm, and the technology that facilitates it. She urges people to observe strict limits on work, and to put themselves first: if that sounds indulgent, she says, it’s only more evidence of the ridiculous state we’re in. Work-life balance should be for everyone, not just those at the tops of their fields. “I’ve had people come in and say, ‘It’s all right for the CEO to do that, but I can’t,’” says Bijlani. “It needs to filter down.”Siobhan Murray, a resilience coach, psychotherapist and author of The Burnout Solution, says the pressure is built into society – from millennials who have had their worth eroded by competitive but unpaid internships and unstable work (“By the time they’re into their late 20s, they’re already burned out”) to thirtysomethings racing to achieve the “bizarre goal” of retiring by 40.Others took on more obligations, such as caring for their elderly parents, without thinking to let go of others, only realising they were overcommitted when they reached breaking point. Of Murray’s 12 current clients, more than half had been signed off work with burnout on their doctors’ orders – some for as long as two months. “There are degrees of burnout,” she says, “and the average  reader isn’t necessarily at that high end where they’re being signed off or going to the Priory – but they could fast be approaching it.”The discovery that a long-awaited getaway may not be as restorative as you had hoped can be a dismal wake-up call. Shorter, more regular holidays throughout the year can help – she suggests taking a week off every three months.We can dream of the introduction of a universal basic income or four-day working week – but for as long as burnout is the baseline of society, Murray says iniduals must be realistic about the demands on their time. She recommends a regular “life audit”, reassessing commitments or goals to prioritise those that matter. “You can’t hit a gym class in the morning and be a parent and travel with your job and see your friends because there are not enough hours in the day. We spring clean our houses we have to get into the habit of doing that with our selves and our lives.”A more balanced schedule – grounded in inidual priorities and realistic expectations, and protected against every attempt to undermine it – may enable us to feel more in control of our lives, says Murray. “It’s about being able to get into bed every night and say: ‘OK, this didn’t work, but this did, so you know what, I did a good job today.’” More openness about the pressures that many of us are under can help us realise that we are not alone, and seek help when we reach breaking point. “There’s a sense of personal failing to burnout, but it’s not,” says Murray. “Sometimes we just need to be able to say: ‘I’m not coping.’”The people who have successfully safeguarded themselves against burnout have learned to go easy on themselves, and they have defined personal boundaries that they defend against everything the world is going to throw at them. “I can guarantee that those are not people who are never going to get burned out and who just have it all sorted,” says Murray. “They’re the ones who have actually experienced it, and know what they have to pull back on in order to be able to live.” And not just until the autumn.All names except Murray and Bijlani have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbc4a9515bb473288c2cd82757157ca764dd5a03/220_0_3060_1836/master/3060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb727dd733ffe11058dfa99144d3b1e7","title":"theresa may refuses to defend journalists right to publish leaks","story":"No 10 declines to comment on police threat to prosecute under Official Secrets ActDowning Street has refused to stand up for the right of journalists to publish leaked official documents in the public interest after police warned last week that editors could face prosecution if they reveal any further diplomatic cables from the British ambassador to the US, Kim Darroch.No 10 declined to say that the police should not be telling journalists what they can print, with Theresa May’s official spokeswoman only saying that she believed in a free press.Neil Basu, the Met assistant commissioner, was criticised on Friday by Tory leadership hopefuls and others for warning owners, editors and publishers not to publish any leaked diplomatic cables because it could be a breach of the Official Secrets Act (OSA).He partially retreated on Saturday, saying the force “respects the rights of the media and has no intention of seeking to prevent editors from publishing stories in the public interest in a liberal democracy”.However, he added: “We have also been told the publication of these specific documents, now knowing they may be a breach of the OSA, could also constitute a criminal offence and one that carries no public interest defence.“We know these documents and potentially others remain in circulation. We have a duty to prevent as well as detect crime and the previous statement was intended to alert to the risk of breaching the OSA.”Boris Johnson, who is expected to be chosen by the Conservatives as the new prime minister next week, said that stopping newspapers printing such documents would represent “an infringement on press freedom and have a chilling effect on public debate”.His rival, Jeremy Hunt, tweeted that the leaks had “damaged UKUS relations \u0026amp cost a loyal ambassador his job, so the person responsible MUST be held fully to account. But I defend to the hilt the right of the press to publish those leaks if they receive them \u0026amp judge them to be in the public interest: that is their job”.Sadiq Khan, the Labour London mayor who is responsible for policing in the capital, told the Daily  on Monday: “Free speech is a vital cornerstone of our democracy. We are rightly the envy of the world. The media must not be told what they can and can’t publish.”However, May’s spokesman refused to comment on the row after repeated questioning at No 10’s regular daily briefing for journalists.“The Met have issued two statements, both of which are a matter for them and I won’t be commenting on either,” he said.“As the the prime minister has said the leak was completely unacceptable and the person who leaked the documents should now face the consequences. I’m not going to comment on an ongoing investigation and it’s important the police are now able to get on with their work. The police’s investigation to identify the leaker has the government’s full support.“On press freedom, the prime minister’s views are very well known. As she has said, a free press is one of the foundations on which our democracy rests.”Most of the offences covered by the legislation affect crown servants and government contractors. Any unlawful disclosure relating to security or intelligence by a member of MI5, MI6 or GCHQ is an offence. Officials do not need to sign the act to be bound by its provisions. The maximum punishment for leaking documents is two years in prison or an unlimited fine.An official is guilty of a crime if he or she \u0027without lawful authority makes a damaging disclosure\u0027 of information about international relations between states, defence, law enforcement, or which falls into a class of information likely to damage the security services’ work. Leaks are deemed to be damaging if, among other consequences, they \u0027endanger the interests of the United Kingdom abroad\u0027. There is a defence for any leaker that they released the material not knowing it would be damaging.\u0026nbspProsecutions under the Official Secrets Act are rare. Recent cases have included that of the MI5 agent David Shayler\u0026nbspin 2002. He was jailed for six months. In 2007, a Scotland Yard civilian employee,\u0026nbspThomas Lund-Lack, was sentenced to eight months for leaking information on planned al-Qaida operations in Britain to a Sunday Times journalist.A number of cases have involved civil servants who mislaid sensitive information. At least one,\u0026nbspRichard Jackson, a Cabinet Office official, was fined £2,500 under the act after he left classified papers relating to al-Qaida and Iraq on a train.\u0026nbspThe police are investigating who leaked Darroch’s memos to the Mail on Sunday, which published more revelations from the ambassador’s memos at the weekend, after Basu’s warning that official documents should be handed back to the government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc1baf8c5e323dfe40a093dd4b700b5fc48727ee/1157_1001_4811_2887/master/4811.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbd35472e3631a3f7d6ab8ddc583a828","title":"kd lang review hull bonus arena","story":"Hull Bonus Arenalang’s Ingénue album may be 27 years old, but it’s more relevant than ever, in a crystalline show of humour and humanity‘Are there any gay people in the audience?” asks kd lang, to whoops of affirmation, especially from women. “Yes, there probably are a few lesbians,” chuckles the singer, to more whooping. Times have changed. In 1992, when out women in pop were virtually unheard of, the Canadian singer’s landmark album Ingénue subverted traditionally conservative country music – initially to bad reviews. When she came out during the album’s promotional campaign, some radio stations stopped playing her music and she faced a picket line at the Grammys (she has since shrugged this off, saying she’d already faced worse when she made an anti-meat-eating advert for Peta). By then, though, Constant Craving was a global hit and Ingénue was on its way to shipping multi-platinum, turning lang into an icon.The strange thing about her performing the album again now – on the Ingénue Redux tour – is that for all the progressions of same-sex marriage, oppressive attitudes are rising once again. Recent homophobic attacks and last week’s startling news that intolerance of gay sex is on the rise for the first time since the 1980s Aids crisis have certainly sharpened the songs’ relevance. When lang sings about being unable to discuss her feelings so she ends up talking to herself, “causing great concern for my health”, in The Mind of Love, she could have written the words yesterday.With her black suit and boyish quiff, the 57-year-old retains the androgynous style that once led Madonna to exclaim, “Elvis lives, and she’s beautiful” and paved the way for, say, the gender-fluid Héloïse Letissier, AKA Chris. lang’s voice remains as pure as the proverbial driven snow and yet, serious song content aside, she’s a hoot. She asks the audience “How the Hull are you?”, illustrates the accordion-powered Miss Chatelaine with a comical Morecambe \u0026amp Wise-type jig and makes rude jokes about “strapping on” her acoustic guitar. Suddenly, though, she announces an end to the “bantz” because it will ruin Ingénue’s “hypnotic effect” and she’s right.These are songs of desire, denial, repression and devotion. Wash Me Clean finds her reaching deep into her well of emotions for the line: “My desire carries no shame.” Her excellent band, featuring Ingénue bassist David Piltch, deliver the album’s mix of roots and lush pop almost entirely as it was, although there’s a new monologue about a cypress tree. A jazzy Season of Hollow Soul erupts into its soaring Abba-style chorus Outside Myself remains an ecstatic cry for freedom.lang’s concerns are always widening. She talks about the “insanities” in the US and dedicates songs to environmentalist Greta Thunberg and gun control campaigner Emma González. When she urges everyone to turn the world’s rising hatred into love, it’s more heartfelt plea than cheesy patter. The encores include a beautiful reworking of Neil Young’s Helpless and a version of Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah wherein lang holds every note like a prayer.Constant Craving closes the Ingénue section, as on the album. lang delivers it perfectly before handing the microphone to the audience for them to sing, slightly off-key but joyously and arm in arm. The evergreen chorus of “Constant craving has always been” sounds like an uplifting celebration of hard-won freedoms and a defiant manifesto for battles that are still ahead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c02472062070f107f6bcebf07ee7cc2a764a962/0_0_14473_8684/master/14473.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3c06fa898ca329a44ae1dad7ad7c1ed","title":"euthanasia and assisted dying rates are soaring but where are they legal","story":"It is available in a growing number of countries and jurisdictions – but not the UK, where it remains outlawed“The main difference between euthanasia and assisted suicide is who performs the final, fatal act,” said Richard Huxtable, professor of medical ethics and law at the University of Bristol.Euthanasia refers to active steps taken to end someone’s life to stop their suffering and the “final deed” is undertaken by someone other than the inidual, for example a doctor. If the person concerned has requested this, it falls under the term “voluntary euthanasia”.Assisted suicide is about helping someone to take their own life at their request – in other words the final deed is undertaken by the person themselves. Assisted dying can be used to mean both euthanasia, generally voluntary, and assisted suicide however, some campaign groups use it to refer only to assisted suicide of terminally ill people.“One of the dilemmas we have in these ongoing debates is how people use the various phrases,” says Huxtable. Most, but not all, jurisdictions that allow some form of euthanasia or assisted suicide require the involvement of medical professionals.Palliative sedation, in which people can request to be kept under deep sedation until they die, is allowed in many countries, including the Netherlands and France – is not euthanasia.The Netherlands and Switzerland are the most well known, and Belgium considered perhaps the most liberal, but several other jurisdictions allow some form of euthanasia or assisted suicide. That said, permitted circumstances differ considerably.In the Netherlands both euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal if the patient is enduring unbearable suffering and there is no prospect of improvement. Anyone from the age of 12 can request this, but parental consent is required if a child is under 16. There are a number of checks and balances, including that doctors must consult with at least one other, independent doctor on whether patient meets the necessary criteria.Belgium, Luxembourg, Canada and Colombia also allow both euthanasia and assisted suicide, although there are differences – for example only terminal patients can request it in Colombia, while Belgium has no age restriction for children (although they must have a terminal illness).Again, the exact circumstances in which assisted suicide is allowed vary, with some jurisdictions – Oregon and Vermont – only allowing it in the case of terminal illness. For some places it is permitted not because laws have been passed, but because laws do not prohibit it. For example in Switzerland it is an offence to assist a suicide if it is done with selfish motives. “The result of that is there is this growth of not-for-profit organisations,” says Prof Penney Lewis, an expert on the law around end-of-life care at King’s College London.Other countries, including New Zealand, are considering legalising some form of euthanasia.Euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal. Euthanasia can lead to a murder charge and assisted suicide could result in a sentence of up to 14 years in prison.It is not normally illegal for a patient to be given treatment to relieve distress that could indirectly shorten life – but this is not euthanasia. It is already legal in the UK for patients to refuse treatment, even if that could shorten their life, and for medical care to be withdrawn by doctors in certain cases, for example where a patient is in a vegetative state and will not recover (sometimes controversially called passive euthanasia).Total figures from around the world are hard to collate. Figures from Switzerland show that the numbers of those living in the country who underwent assisted suicide rose from 187 in 2003 to 965 in 2015.Agnes van der Heide, professor of decision-making and care at the end of life at the Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, says the reason euthanasia is more common than assisted suicide in the Netherlands is multifaceted. Doctors may feel that by performing the deed themselves they can have more control over dosages and the time the procedure takes.“Patients are often in a very advanced stage of their disease where it is practically difficult if not impossible to drink the lethal drink they have to take when they chose for assistance in suicide,” she adds. “It is a very bitter-tasting drink and it is quite an effort to drink it until the end,” she added. There might also be an element of viewing the act as a medical procedure and hence preferring a physician to do the job.Lewis says the vast majority of people do not end their lives by euthanasia even if they can. “There is far more withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment, even in jurisdictions that permit euthanasia,” she says.Noa Pothoven, who was 17, died last month – she had anorexia and severe depression. At first media reports suggested she had been “legally euthanised”, but later reports said it was unclear how she died, with her friends releasing a comment saying that she died after she stopped eating and drinking.Van der Heide said that while she could not comment on Pothoven’s case, it is possible for minors over the age of 12 to seek euthanasia or assisted suicide in the Netherlands, under certain conditions.In some places, yes. According to van der Heide, while suicide tourism is not formally forbidden in the Netherlands, physicians must work with the patient to establish that they meet certain criteria. “I think if a physician would provide euthanasia to a patient he doesn’t know then it is very likely that the regional committee would have a problem with that,” she says.However, people do travel to Switzerland for assisted suicide. According to statistics from Dignitas, 221 people travelled to the country for this purpose in 2018, 87 of whom were from Germany, 31 from France and 24 from the UK.Euthanasia and assisted suicide have proved contentious among doctors. Some argue that support for such ideas goes against the commitment to “do no harm”. Others say some people might choose not to end their life if they are made aware that they could be made comfortable with good end of life care.“Some health professionals are familiar with the care of dying patients and with what palliative care can do – so they may have a feeling that assisted dying isn’t always necessary ,” says Dominic Wilkinson, professor of medical ethics at the University of Oxford. “All the criteria and also the practice of euthanasia is mainly shaped by how physicians feel it should be,” says van der Heide. “I think for the typical patient with end-stage cancer and severe unbearable suffering, there is hardly any physician in the Netherlands who thinks that the issue of harming patients is at stake there.”That depends how you look at it. Support for the Dutch laws clearly remains high, but some say there are signs of a “slippery slope”, with the practice being applied too widely.However as Huxtable points out, other jurisdictions including Oregon show that broadening of use is not inevitable. “The fact there has been some slide in the Netherlands should give everyone reason to pause,” he says. “We should think right form the outset what do we think in principle is defensible and are we going to – and we should – police the boundaries.”There have also been allegations of malpractice. In 2018 both the Netherlands and Belgium reported their first cases in which doctors were investigated for possibly breaching the laws, with three more investigations under way in the Netherlands involving the euthanasia of psychiatric patients.“Nowadays there are more controversial cases, so the likelihood that there now will be cases that do not fulfil the criteria to the extent that the public prosecutor thinks it is necessary to install a criminal procedure is more likely than it used to be,” says van der Heide.There have been concerns by disabilities groups that as euthanasia and assisted suicide become more common, it could put a pressure on those living with non-terminal conditions to end their lives. But van der Heide says doctors in the Netherlands take great care when dealing with requests to make sure patients meet strict requirements, and turn down those who do not.She adds that the development of laws to allow euthanasia or assisted dying must be handled carefully. “I indeed acknowledge that having a system in which euthanasia is an option should be really carefully monitored and researched because it in principle involves the risk of life of vulnerable people being regarded as less worthy or more prone to doctors’ assistance in dying,” she says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab91bd2558f894d2d4188fcd8cd1410bc4384f03/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c29a29a2ca771a650f53b83ed592de24","title":"stop and search is ineffective so why is it on the rise podcast","story":"The first stop and search Jamal ever experienced was when he was 11 years old.

Tom Curran and Jason Roy are originally from South Africa, while Ben Stokes and Jofra Archer were born in New Zealand and Barbados respectively. In addition, Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid are the grandchildren of Pakistani immigrants and both belong to the Mirpuri community.While the team represents England and Wales, under English and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) regulations a player must be a British citizen, have been born in England or Wales, or have lived in either country for three years to qualify.The ECB changed their regulations last year, reducing the eligibility criteria from seven years in a move that was widely seen as allowing Archer, 24, the chance to play. Archer bowled the dramatic, victorious super over.Rees-Mogg’s fellow Conservative MP Ed Vaizey said that his colleague was guilty of “slightly misjudging the mood”, before adding that “while you’re on, the English captain is Irish”. Alastair Campbell suggested that “perhaps instead of making a silly Brextremist point, offer congratulations to the Irish captain, the NZ-born man of the match, and the Barbadian bowler who got it over the line”.Daniel Lawes, the founder and chief executive of YouthPolitics UK, tweeted: “Captained by an immigrant, batting led by an immigrant, fastest bowler an immigrant, leading all-rounder an immigrant, main spinner son of an immigrant.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9873fcd91e01185f24514870aa2f2afe5e5afeb/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57bebef29f9e23b5adf2e3f09dc88e5f","title":"labour staffers letter jeremy corbyn whistleblowers","story":"Shadow cabinet members from Lords tell Corbyn he must demonstrate ‘decisive leadership’Labour’s leaders in the House of Lords have made an offer to Jeremy Corbyn to investigate the handling of antisemitism in the party and advise on a new complaints system, warning him that without decisive leadership it is a “cancer that will continue to grow”.Four senior peers wrote to Corbyn on Monday with an offer to establish a panel to review the allegations of former party staffers made in a BBC Panorama documentary and to “provide advice and support on how a properly independent complaints process could be set up and run”.The peers – Angela Smith, the party’s leader in the Lords, her deputy, Dianne Hayter, the chairman of the peers’ group, Toby Harris, and Tommy McAvoy, the chief whip – set out their view amid consternation about allegations made on the BBC’s Panorama programme that the leader’s office interfered in complaints about antisemitism. The party denies the allegations.It represents another major challenge to Corbyn from within his shadow cabinet, after the deputy leader, Tom Watson, wrote to Jennie Formby, Labour’s general secretary, accusing party bosses of having “smeared” former staff members who criticised Labour’s handling of complaints.Watson himself has come in for criticism for taking Formby to task when she is undergoing chemotherapy, and Labour has accused the BBC of bias over the Panorama programme.In their letter, the four Labour peers set out their concerns about the party’s approach to tackling antisemitism, saying: “It is now a toxic and endemic problem that we have failed to eradicate. Whatever action has been taken has failed to give confidence to Jewish and non-Jewish members alike that there is an absolute determined will to effectively deal with their concerns.“This failure goes to the core of Labour’s values and ideals. How can we be seen to be the party that above all others promotes equality, and that embodies anti-racism and anti-discrimination, if we appear to tolerate antisemitism?“It is deeply saddening, but not surprising, that three of our valued colleagues recently resigned the Labour Lords whip. The scale of abuse that they and others have suffered is heartbreaking.”They also criticised the party’s reaction to the allegations about the handling of complaints made in the Panorama programme. Labour responded by complaining to the BBC and dismissing the whistleblowers as “disaffected employees”.They said: “Also heartbreaking was the decision to attack those who spoke out in last week’s edition of Panorama. Whilst there may be genuine concerns about the making of the programme, the accounts of members and former staff was powerful and shaming. We understand that any employer requires former staff not to disclose sensitive data, but non-disclosure agreements should never be used to silence criticism or to avoid embarrassment – especially by the Labour party.”They made a three-pronged offer to Corbyn for peers to help tackle the problem, saying a small panel from the Lords could review the Panorama allegations and report back to the leader, national executive committee and wider party.“This would necessarily mean that they have full access to existing and former party staff, as well as all paper and electronic records,” they said.The second offer was to draw on the trade union, legal and other experience in the group to set up a new complaints process, and the third offer was to propose how the party’s governance arrangements could be improved to foster transparency and proper decision-making.It ended: “As the leader of our party you have a responsibility to ensure that we do this. In particular, you need to demonstrate decisive leadership that Labour is determined and committed to do everything possible to remove antisemitism, and those that defend it, from our party. Without full openness, this is a cancer that will continue to grow – and, in hurting us, it will most hurt those that need a Labour government.”The letter came as Labour staffers demanded an explanation from party bosses over the treatment of the Panorama whistleblowers. Eight former employees discussed the handling of antisemitism allegations on the programme.More than 200 former and current Labour staffers wrote to Corbyn asking for more support for whistleblowers after the programme. That letter, co-ordinated by the former MEP candidate Amy Fowler, said staff had watched the programme on Wednesday night with “alarm and anxiety” and that the party’s response had been “to smear Jewish victims, and former staff, accusing them of acting in bad faith”.It said: “The way the party has threatened and denigrated these whistleblowers is appalling, hypocritical and a total betrayal of Labour’s core values. Exposing racism and corruption represents Labour values in action, and these whistleblowers should be thanked, not demonised.”It also addressed a series of questions to Corbyn about the extent of his knowledge about any interference in antisemitism cases and the workplace atmosphere in the party.“The crisis has moved beyond a question of rules and disciplinary processes, to a question of a political culture, and crucially, leadership,” the letter said. “As its leader, the moral responsibility for Labour’s antisemitism crisis ultimately sits with you. Own that responsibility, or give it away to someone who will.”Labour staffers in the GMB union have also submitted a motion for discussion at their branch meeting this week, demanding an apology for the party’s response and condemning “obscene threats of legal action”.The motion, which will be debated on Thursday, condemns the Labour press office’s Twitter response to the programme. and says it was “unacceptable for an employee’s workload or the culture of an organisation to cause staff to have breakdowns or to contemplate suicide as several whistleblowers claimed on the programme”.In response to Panorama on Wednesday, a Labour party spokesperson said several of the whistleblowers involved were staff with political grudges against Corbyn.“These disaffected former officials include those who have always opposed Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, worked to actively undermine it, and have both personal and political axes to grind,” the spokesman said. “It is simply untrue to say that there were any significant number of disagreements about what constituted antisemitism.“Labour is taking decisive action against antisemitism, doubling the number of staff dedicated to dealing with complaints and cases. And since Jennie Formby became general secretary, the rate at which antisemitism cases have been dealt with has increased fourfold.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/199858d27fb8a3815025a7d17dda40ff59624513/0_145_2962_1777/master/2962.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c088026320bbcaba4c430594f0940206","title":"share your memories of the apollo 11 moon landings","story":"Do you remember where you were when man first landed on the moon?

Indeed, later in his career Turing wrote a seminal paper explaining how patterns such as spots and stripes can appear during chemical reactions.While the importance of Turing’s work and the foundations he laid have become increasingly apparent with time, so too have his personal struggles. These have been highlighted in a biography and a number of plays in the 1980s, as well as the 2014 film The Imitation Game, in which Turing was played by Benedict Cumberbatch.Born in London in 1912, Turing joined Sherborne school at 13. His reports suggest his abilities were mixed, but hint at his imagination and originality. “He must remember that Cambridge will want sound knowledge rather than vague ideas,” his physics teacher wrote.Turing joined King’s College, Cambridge, in 1931 and became a fellow there in 1935. What followed were a number of seminal ideas, including his vision of a universal computing machine, which can be fed an algorithm for a particular computation and then apply it. It was an idea that was to be pivotal in the development of the computers we use today.After a stint at Princeton University in America, Turing returned to the UK, where he worked in code-breaking. With the outbreak of war, he joined Bletchley Park.As a gay man in the early 1950s, at a time when homosexual acts were illegal, Turing faced a demeaning choice when a burglary at his home brought Turing’s relationship with a man to police attention.He was found guilty of gross indecency and had to decide between going to prison or undergoing chemical castration. He chose the latter, a horrifying treatment that involved hormonal injections.Turing died in June 1954, aged 41, at his home in Wilmslow, near Manchester, in an apparent suicide. On Christmas Eve in 2013, the Queen signed a posthumous pardon for him.Turing’s legacy lives on in the machines we take for granted every day, with his name also linked to burgeoning advances. The best known of these is the benchmark Turing test for whether a machine that can think like a human, which hinges on whether human judges can distinguish a computer’s text answers from those given by a person."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89c30a757dd29dc63a488a215ac728f0390c2e66/584_419_4922_2953/master/4922.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a61e44aa5d30bb64a3a3ce9773c964f5","title":"can you solve it cheese cube nibbles","story":"Today’s puzzles all concern cubes of cheese.

He added that “it would look churlish” to decline.The Queen’s then private secretary, Michael Adeane, writing on Buckingham Palace headed notepaper, recorded the Queen had approved the suggested text of a message. But, he added: “Her Majesty agrees that this idea is a gimmick and it is not the sort of thing she much enjoys doing but she certainly would not wish to appear churlish by refusing an invitation which is so obviously well intentioned.”The Queen’s reaction is revealed by Dr Juliette Desplat, the head of modern overseas, intelligence and security records at the National Archives, in a blog to be published on its website on Thursday, in the 50th anniversary week of Apollo 11’s launch. The Queen’s message was sent, along with those from figureheads from 72 other nations, on a tiny disc carried by the astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, the first men to walk on the moon on 21 July 1969. It read: “On behalf of the British people, I salute the skills and courage which have brought man to the moon. May this endeavour increase the knowledge and well-being of mankind.” British reaction to the space race and lunar landings is captured in several documents, with a small selection on show at the National Archives in Kew, west London, to mark the 50th anniversary.In the end, it was decided not to mention any of the above. “The cumulative effect of these British contributions is not insignificant, but, seen in context, it might seem disproportionate for them to be mentioned in the PM’s broadcast”, the briefing note concluded.The archives include an apology from the then UK ambassador to the US, John Freeman, for missing the historic Apollo 11 launch. He admitted his absence was a “mistake”, but explained that having witnessed the launch of Apollo 10 at Cape Kennedy just two months previously, “a further visit so soon afterwards would be a pure pleasure jaunt”.The astronauts brought moon dust back with them. Four tiny pieces, embedded in clear plastic and mounted in a display with a miniature union flag, were given by Richard Nixon to Wilson. But the question of what to do with them taxed several prime ministers.Wilson sent the gift to the Science Museum, and it later went on a nationwide tour. By the time it landed back at No 10, Edward Heath was apparently “unable to identify a sufficiently public spot … aesthetically suitable” for the display, according to records seen by Desplat.The dust spent several years in a Downing Street cupboard, to be rediscovered by accident in 1979, during Margaret Thatcher’s tenure. An offer of a loan to the Science Museum was declined in 1985, on the grounds that the museum had plenty of other moon rocks and “it was not really a very exciting exhibit”.American space success came after the Soviets had launched Sputnik 2 in November 1957, with the dog Laika, a stray Moscow mongrel, on board, though she died in orbit. In April 1961, Yuri Gagarin became the first man to orbit around Earth, returning a hero.When Gagarin visited the UK in July 1961, while much of Germany was still under Soviet occupation, such was the rapturous UK welcome that the British ambassador to West Germany, Sir Christopher Steel, reported: “The average German finds it alarming that the British, who are supposed to be reserved and politically mature, should rave over a Bolshevik on a propaganda mission, even if he is a hero.”The then prime minister, Harold Macmillan, noted: “I think Sir C Steel might point out to the Germans that Gagarin’s reception was nothing like that which the little dog would have got.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10541d22facbcaadfefece21f39b888f9d9d88e2/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d63ecf7871a3ea01e5897b1ea2c07c6","title":"how has the menopause affected you share you experiences","story":"We’d like to find out what sort of support you have had at work or home and what if anything has helped symptoms?

Being overweight increases the risk of health problems such as heart diseases, type 2 diabetes, and some forms of cancer. Sugar is also one of the main causes of tooth decay.\u0026nbspThe NHS advises that most adults and children in the UK eat too much of a type of sugar called \u0027free sugars\u0027. These are the sugars added to food and drinks, found in biscuits, chocolate, breakfast cereals and fizzy drinks. But they are also found naturally in honey and unsweetened fruit juices.An analysis from WHO Europe of what was for sale in the UK, Denmark and Spain in 2016-17 showed that commercially available baby foods generally complied with guidance on salt, protein, fat and carbohydrate, but many products were high in sugar.These can be considered free sugars, just as they are in fruit juice, and if eaten frequently “may pose a threat to the very young as first teeth erupt”. The sweetness may also influence the child’s food preferences as they grow up, said the report.The report, described as a discussion paper, sets out WHO Europe’s recommendations for a “nutrient profile model” for baby foods.Fruit drinks and juices, sweetened cows’ milk and milk alternatives, confectionery and sweet snacks should not be marketed as suitable for infants and young children up to 36 months.The lead author, Dr João Breda, head of the WHO European office for prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases, said they were very concerned about the high levels of sugar in baby foods and the labelling of products.“In these commercial products we found a very significant amount have added sugar,” he said. “There is way too much sugar. Added sugar in many products should be eliminated, in our view. The total amount of sugar is also too high in many products. And we have issues with marketing. A lot of products are marketed as suitable at four months and under six months, totally against the WHO guidelines.”Although babies like the sweetness of breast milk, it was important to let them explore different tastes after six months, he said. “We are talking about ersification of the diet at six months. It is really crucial you have products that are not only sweet products. If babies are exposed to different tastes from the beginning, they will be more willing to try other things.”He said there was already a move to reformulate these products in the food industry, which he hoped governments would encourage.

With nine needed from three deliveries, Ben Stokes and Adil Rashid pushed for a second run when a throw from the boundary deflected off Stokes’s outstretched bat and away to the boundary for four byes and six in total.But Taufel, who was named the ICC’s umpire of the year on five occasions, told foxsports.au: “They should have been awarded five runs, not six. It’s a clear mistake. It’s an error of judgment.Law 19.8 of the MCC rulebook states: “If the boundary results from an overthrow or from the wilful act of a fielder, the runs scored shall be any runs for penalties awarded to either side and the allowance for the boundary and the runs completed by the batsmen, together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the instant of the throw or act.”Taufel told the Sydney Morning Herald: “So given that scenario, five runs should have been the correct allocation of runs, and Ben Stokes should have been at the non-striker’s end for the next delivery.”Replays showed Stokes and Rashid had not crossed when the throw came in from Martin Guptill. The ICC, meanwhile, are said to be satisfied with the conclusion of the final, which after both the match and the Super Over were tied went down to boundary countback, with England having struck 26 over the course of the day to New Zealand’s 17.A spokesperson told the  that this method of super over tie-breaker is well established across a number of domestic Twenty20 leagues and would only be reviewed in conjunction with them. There are currently no plans to do so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf5ec698c6b076af40816aef721090c3c84c34a2/0_110_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d782e7860c7bddafc7779025c8bfa39e","title":"novak djokovic roger federer grand slam record","story":"Wimbledon champion says Swiss rival is an inspiration and he hopes that he will still be competing at the age of 37At the end of this seesawing and tempestous epic, which was not only the longest final in Wimbledon history but perhaps its most dramatic, Novak Djokovic pointed one finger to the sky in triumph. He might as well have been waving it in defiance at the Centre Court crowd, who had spent four hours and 57 minutes willing and baying Roger Federer to victory.Afterwards the Serb explained that he had tricked his mind so that every time he heard “Roger” he felt that people were actually cheering for him. “If you have the majority of the crowd on your side, it helps, it gives you motivation, it gives you strength, it gives you energy,” he admitted. “When you don’t, then you have to find it within. I like to transmutate it in a way. So when the crowd is chanting ‘Roger’ I hear ‘Novak’. It sounds silly but it is like that. I try to convince myself that it’s like that.”It was not the only trick Djokovic pulled off to win his fifth Wimbledon title. He was the worse player for four of the five sets. He did not conjure a break point until deep into the fourth. He was down two match points at 8-7 in the fifth. His opponent served better, volleyed better, returned better, hit 40 more winners and won 14 more points. And yet Djokovic still emerged victorious. Brad Gilbert once wrote a book called Winning Ugly. This was the director’s cut.Afterwards the Serb admitted he was on the back foot for most of the match. Yet the way he was able to raise his game in each of the three tie-breaks while Federer slipped into his shell was deeply impressive. Djokovic’s fifth Wimbledon symphony might have been discordant but in some ways it was his most glorious.It also enhances his bragging rights. For in the decades ahead, when talk turns to who was the greatest, Federer, Djokovic and Rafael Nadal know their names will be rattled out fast and furiously. But Djokovic now has 16 titles, closing in on Federer, who has 20, and Nadal, who has 18. And at 32 he knows that time is on his side.Afterwards he issued an ominous warning to his great rival. “Roger hopes to inspire people to keep going at 37,” he said. “I’m one of them. The fact that they have made history of this sport motivates me as well, inspires me to try to do what they have done, what they’ve achieved, and even more.”Federer made his aggressive attention clear in his opening service game, with two aces and a rasping forehand winner. The Swiss continued to have the better of the first set only to falter in the tie-break. The crowd were deflated. They, like everyone else, had felt that the best chance Federer had was to start fast. Yet he had other ideas, breaking immediately before racing way to win the second set 6-1 – the most lopsided set he had won against Djokovic for seven years.He continued to press. But Djokovic, tennis’s greatest wall, stubbornly refused to budge. Time and again he was like the superhero Plastic Man, whose malleable body allows him to stretch to impossible lengths, getting balls back that Federer thought had been dispatched for a winner. Another tie-break came. Again Federer faltered. Somehow, incredibly, Djokovic was a set from victory.Federer looked to be tiring. Yet again he picked himself up and, when Djokovic erred, he went for the jugular to go 5-2 up and win the set. As he hit the winning point the decibel levels inside Wimbledon went from 0-100 faster than any sports car.Up until now it had not always been a match of the greatest quality. But the final set, which lasted two hours and two minutes, became intensely gripping and grippingly tense. Djokovic broke early and went 4-2 ahead, yet when Federer broke back suddenly 10,000 people were standing and punching the air as if they were at a religious revival. Briefly it seemed as if they were.Of course the Centre Court crowd wanted Federer to win. Could one blame them? This could be the last chance they get to see him, a dominant presence at Wimbledon for 16 years, on the court he loves best. They were similarly supportive of Serena Williams on Saturday, knowing that genius – no matter how brightly it burns – eventually has to fade.It looked as if they were going to have their wishes granted when Federer had his 21st grand slam title on his racket at 8-7 and 40-15 up in the final set. Yet Djokovic, just like when he saved two match points against Federer in the US Open in 2011, had other ideas. The first was saved with a thumping service return to the body. The second by a sublime passing shot as the Swiss player rushed into the net. It is possible to wound Djokovic. But putting him away is another thing altogether.On the match went until it got to 12-12 and became the first singles match at Wimbledon to end on a tie-break. Once again Djokovic handled the pressure better.Federer tried to shrug off the defeat, saying: “Every loss hurts at Wimbledon but I am very strong at being able to move on. I don’t want to be depressed about an amazing tennis match.” But rarely has he looked more deflated.With this victory Djokovic extends his lead over Federer to 26-22. For good measure he has also now beaten him in three of their four matches on grass. And once again he did so almost alone, except for those inside his player’s box and a pocket of Serbian fans cheering him on. Not for the first time he proved impervious – and imperious."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/971bdd1e2ddb0684f05c636dbc199ec303876c45/0_30_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=feb8a2ffb991c8adc31275b808410644","title":"sporting sunday britain olympic spirit 2012 cricket world cup","story":"Bread and circuses, eh? A full house of 140,000 at Silverstone, Wimbledon packed for the men’s final, the entire nation taking advantage of the free-to-air concession to follow the twists and turns of an unprecedented cricket showdown at a sold-out Lord’s. Who, we asked ourselves, does this stuff better? And yet amid the unfolding delirium of Sunday’s sporting cavalcade there were moments when it was impossible not to pause the action and ask what it means, in the times through which we are living, to find a few hours’ relief by cheering a bunch of talented people hitting a ball or driving round in circles.Whoever and wherever you were, it was a glorious day. There may have been nothing quite like having a seat at Lord’s as the astonishing climax to the World Cup final went through its various stages of escalating delirium. But the real place to be was in England’s back garden, with family and friends and a big screen and a bucket full of iced drinks. Then, as an average sort of day was transformed by golden late-afternoon sunlight, you could watch and marvel it all, surfing on one wave of emotion after another.The TV cameras captured the enthusiasm of all those crowds, from the grassy mounds to the royal box. But that’s where Stormzy, Jeff Bezos, Sharron Davies, Daniel Craig, Seb Coe, Clare Foy, John Bercow and those nice Cambridges and Cumberbatches got it wrong. It was good to see them all showing up at a major sporting event. But they’d have been better off in a T-shirt and shorts in the back garden, soaking everything up at once, gripped by the dizzying crescendo of a unique day.It’s not necessary to claim that a record-breaking sixth victory at Silverstone makes Lewis Hamilton the greatest grand prix driver of all time, or that the first Wimbledon men’s singles final to be decided by a fifth-set tie break was the greatest tennis match in history, or that by fighting each other to the very end England and New Zealand had produced the greatest cricket match ever played. Probably none of those things is true. But we can be pretty certain that there has never been an all-round day quite like this one, when events followed each other in a way that otherwise only happens during an Olympic Games, with its formal and interlinked structure.And the Olympics was the comparison that also came to mind while observing the joy of the crowds at all three places. Seven years ago this month Britain became the sporting centre of the world when London hosted the Summer Games. Immoderate expenditure and matching inventiveness allowed the country to show its best side, starting with an opening ceremony in which Danny Boyle brilliantly reacquainted us with our history, our ersity and our moral assets. For two weeks we were enraptured not just by the athletes’ achievements but by a comforting sense that we had recognised our better selves, despite the austerity measures newly imposed on British lives by the men occupying the best seats in the stadium.All things pass, we told ourselves. The Camerons and Osbornes will fade into history but our real values and principles, ancient and modern, will endure. Look at Jess Ennis, a mixed race woman from Sheffield. Look at Bradley Wiggins, born in Ghent and now enthroned at Hampton Court Palace. Look at Mo Farah, a refugee from Mogadishu. The future is right there, enfolded in a union jack, and it wasn’t formed on the playing fields of Eton. That’s what we said as the cheers faded on the last of those wonderful summer evenings, before the daily grind resumed.One Olympic cycle later a truer picture of Britain’s essential nature emerged through the result of the EU referendum, and Sunday’s events took place against the backdrop of a nation more deeply ided than ever, readier to turn disagreement into hatred and anger into violence. In such an environment, even the bliss of a first win for England in a Cricket World Cup final could not feel entirely unmixed.No response to that triumph was more self-revealing in its stupidity, ignorance and opportunism than that of Jacob Rees-Mogg, who took to Twitter to proclaim that “we clearly don’t need Europe to win.” There are three answers to that. First, “we” don’t need Europe to win the Eton wall game, either. Second, the Ryder Cup. Third, he seemed not to have noticed that the squad deemed worthy of his accolade contains a host of players with immigrant backgrounds, including men born in Dublin, Christchurch, Bridgetown and Durban, and with skin shades and cultural affiliations reflecting what anyone can see on a walk through the ordinary streets of Britain. They don’t represent some utopian Rainbow Britain, but they do represent the us that history has fashioned, and which is under attack from those with a different agenda.For the participants, the glow of that magical day will never fade. The rest of us can also cherish the memories and the sense of pride – not just in the prizes won in our name but in the knowledge that the stage and the audience proved worthy of the occasion. Hamilton and the England XI were inevitably cheered to the echo and beyond, but Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer, a Serb and a Swiss, could not have wished for a finer setting for their efforts or a warmer embrace from the crowd. It took all sorts, not least New Zealand’s widely appreciated sportsmanship, to create that day of marvels, allowing us another glimpse of our better selves. By the time the next one arrives, the need might be even greater."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddbace9686f2edbd267e26439e3a0ac911a83874/0_75_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8b02fb9d825a5b4f0c437cb756ca245","title":"this is england nation unites to rejoice in cricket world cup win","story":"Outpouring of euphoria across England after unprecedented victory against New Zealand at Lord’s“Incredible … Indescribable … You couldn’t make it up.”England’s cricket players and fans have been struggling to sum up their emotions after the team won an extraordinary World Cup final against New Zealand at Lord’s.The victory by the never-seen-before margin of “boundaries scored” came after the two teams were tied at the end of their respective 50 over innings and a penalty shootout-style super over also failed to separate them.The thrilling climax sent most of the 30,000 fans at the home of cricket into paroxysms of delight and the scenes of joy were mirrored across the country as celebrations spilled from homes and pubs and into the streets.Eoin Morgan, England’s captain, said it was “the most incredible game of cricket”, and admitted that there had been nothing between the two sides.“I’m pretty lost for words. All the hard work that’s gone in over these four years, this is where we aspired to be. To do it with such a game, I don’t think there will be another like this in the history of cricket,” he said, while also paying tribute to the New Zealanders’ fighting spirit.Trevor Campbell from Middlesex, who was one of the lucky fans at Lord’s, said he had “never seen” anything like it.“I did not believe it, half way through I was sure New Zealand was going to win, it was not until the last over. You could not make this up. There has never been anything like this,” the 88-year-old said.Thousands had gathered under blue skies in front of a big screen in Trafalgar Square to watch the final, which was England’s fourth attempt to win the biggest prize in the sport after failures at the last hurdle in 1979, 1987 and 1992.Jonny Bennett, 26, from St Albans, watched the match in the square and joined in the celebrations afterwards at The Admiralty pub.“The relief and the sheer joy is incredible. It was indescribable,” he said. “I think there’s just a general sense of disbelief.”The reaction was not limited to fans. The Queen, not known for her love of the game, said in a statement issued by Buckingham Palace that she and Prince Philip had sent their “warmest congratulations” to the England team after “such a thrilling victory”.Theresa May, the prime minister, was so happy with the result she broke into a jig and Jeremy Corbyn hailed “the most incredible result”.However, Jacob Rees-Mogg attempted to make political capital from the victory with an off-key tweet saying that “we clearly don’t need Europe to win”. It was quickly pointed out that England did actually need Europe to win – in the form of Morgan, who is Irish.The actor Adil Ray went a step further by rejoicing in the ersity of the England team which, along with Morgan, also features players of West Indian, Pakistani and South African descent.“This is England and it feels bloody fantastic,” he said.The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, joined in to by celebrating Morgan’s Dublin roots.Away from politics, Gary Lineker tweeted: “Never seen anything like that… Cricket is coming home”.Morgan paid tribute to “superhuman” man of the match Ben Stokes, who managed to bludgeon 15 runs from the final over of normal play to bring the scores level, a tally that included a bizarre, ricocheted six.But the England captain also hinted that the match – which was shown by Channel 4 on free-to-air television in addition to cricket’s usual berth on Sky – could inspire a new generation of players to emulate Stokes.“He’s really carried the team and our batting line-up,” Morgan said. “He managed to deal with the emotion and atmosphere in an incredibly experienced manner. Hopefully everyone watching at home will try to be the next Ben Stokes.”On the same theme, Michael Vaughan, England’s 2005 Ashes-winning captain, writes in the  today that the win could change the English game forever.“This team have made England, a Test-loving nation, embrace white-ball cricket where before we treated it as an afterthought which is why the men never won a World Cup,” he says.“We all want to watch this side. The biggest compliment I can give them is I would want my children to play like every single one of them.”The papers were united in celebrating England’s win.  has a picture of England’s two heroes – Ben Stokes and Jofra Archer – celebrating the win with the headline “Last-ball joy as England seal World Cup win”.The Times opts for a wraparound style front and back page with a beautiful image of the dramatic moment when Jos Buttler runs out Martin Guptill to seal the win.The  features a huge picture of the England players lifting the trophy with the headline, “Who said cricket was boring?”.The most popular headline of the day is “Champagne super over”, a cunning pun combining the victory celebrations and the unprecedented format of the finale which is used by the Mirror, the Star, the  and – more surprisingly – the FT.The Daily Mail goes it alone with a picture of Ben Stokes kissing his wife, Clare, above a headline which reads: “Kiss that says: we’re on top of the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/795f618f88fb9b10409bb2d86e9c70ffa677d591/0_328_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8f71bfa519268cae613f9cd24908019","title":"cricket world cup england new zealand revival","story":"England have the spoils, to New Zealand goes the glory, and the nation has a chance to fall back in love with cricket againIt is a phrase that is usually painfully glib or laden with irony but for once it may be appropriate: perhaps cricket really was the winner. The audience beyond, thankfully enlarged, as well as those crammed into every nook and cranny of Lord’s, watched a melodrama that left everyone gasping. Spectators eventually filed out of the old ground stunned by what they had just witnessed, enthralled and exhausted.The last hour at Lord’s was complicated, yet there seemed to be women and children present who found it utterly captivating. The result may not have been just but that is often the nature of sport. The ricochet from Ben Stokes’s bat in the final over of the longer match was a freak occurrence, a deus ex machina that no self‑respecting playwright would dare to introduce. Never have I seen that happen with the game on a knife-edge. Without those four extra runs England would have needed seven to win, six to tie, from two balls: not impossible, but not very likely.Every English cricketer would have known that. It was a moment that subsequently demanded humility and compassion from their side. Meanwhile the Kiwis, whose resilience and resolve in the field was breathtaking, can only be commended for their grace in what the scorecard somehow decrees to be a defeat.That climax will define this World Cup: the one with the Stokes deflection and the super over, which ended with Jos Buttler ing at the stumps in the manner of Jonty Rhodes in the 1992 tournament, the one when the Kiwis demonstrated to the world at large how to respond to a ridiculous, undeserved defeat. It would be wonderful if it was the one that triggered a revival of interest in cricket in this country. But don’t count on that.The match at Lord’s had everything that will not be present in the Hundred. There was a context it was a contest whose outcome really mattered, that will be remembered for decades it was not difficult to identify the teams and what they stood for. There was time for the game to breathe, to ebb and flow before it reached its astonishing crescendo. There were not many sixes, four in total plus the unforgettable one off the back of Stokes’s bat but somehow it still kept us all awake.It was a brilliant advert for the game but someone had better inform new viewers – and, glory be, there might have been quite a lot of them on Sunday – that it is not always like this. The Hundred, which is the next cricket scheduled for free-to-air television, may not be like this either. But don’t rule out the marketing men and women of the England and Wales Cricket Board telling us that this will be the case before too long. The final highlighted the bleeding obvious: that the pinnacle of the game should, on special occasions, be available to a wider audience rather than an unloved, hare-brained scheme dreamt up in a vacant boardroom. The biggest audience warrants the best cricket – not a wild, unproven gamble that may well make the game look stupid.Maybe this is not the time to complain about the Hundred. The myopic sleepwalk in that direction, with barely a murmur from the counties who are denied hosting any matches – they will take the dosh instead, thank you very much – allied to the tacit support of ECB employees and the influential pundits, who must remain loyal to their paymasters, is more or less complete. Instead it may be time to hail our all-conquering cricket team, brilliantly led by Eoin Morgan and self-effacingly nurtured by Trevor Bayliss. Yet even that feels inappropriate after the epic at Lord’s. We could just as easily be lamenting a missed opportunity but for the ricochet.The New Zealanders demand as many superlatives for their resolve and their capacity to compete even though their resources are so much thinner in terms of funding and depth of talent. Yet again they have maximised their talents brilliantly with Kane Williamson, all quirky calmness, calling the shots along the way. He even won applause from the press corps on Sunday night, something that never happens, for the way he responded to New Zealand’s “loss”. The victors had the spoils, but the glory belonged to New Zealand.So somehow this may not be the moment to hail England’s heroes too vigorously. Soon they may be venerated with Morgan our 21st‑century Bobby Moore and Jos Buttler our ice‑cool Jonny Wilkinson at the end of a compelling contest. An amazing transformation has taken place. In four years England have gone from talking a good game to playing a good game. Morgan has moulded a tight-knit group of players from a wide variety of backgrounds into an exciting, dynamic team. In the end they needed a huge slice of good fortune to prevail. But they did it. And a good chunk of the nation had a chance to fall in love with cricket again.Both teams will be responsible for the 2019 World Cup being hailed a triumph. Forget the agonising about the rain, the pitches or a format comprising just 10 nations, the tournament will be remembered for an astonishing final in front of packed stands. Of course, it is not so difficult to sell a final which is why it has been so uplifting to attend matches from Taunton to Chester-le-Street, where the stands have been heaving with fans of Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and, of course, India: noisy, passionate and cheerful even when the rain poured down. There was never a match when we lamented acres of empty white bucket seats.There have been brilliant performances from predictable sources such as Mitchell Starc, David Warner, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Jasprit Bumrah and Shakib Al Hasan. A few less familiar faces have made their mark: Lockie Ferguson, Babar Azam, Sheldon Cottrell, Avishka Fernando and Mujeeb ur Rahman. But they were all overshadowed by a final that will live in the memory for years and Kane Williamson saying, “one of those things, eh?” at the end of it all.

A petrol-fuelled romp in the Midlands couched among country lanes and English villages, the 52-lap race is an unmissable fixture in the sporting summer. This weekend delivered excitement, nostalgia and glory, all wrapped in a neat carbon‑fibre package.The 10th round of the Formula One world championship faced stiff competition this year, with both Wimbledon and the Cricket World Cup scheduled for the same Sunday. Such clash of commitments suggests that major sporting event planners should coordinate timetables if not for viewing numbers, at least to ease the FOMO (fear of missing out) for fans. Silverstone has the magic combination of a terrific track, fervent supporters and a proud past. It is, after all, where the first World Championship Grand Prix was held in 1950 and in many ways the British race has stayed true to its roots.For some fans the festival begins on Thursday or Friday, as streams of cars and caravans begin to fan out across fields in the area – a sign of the excitement to come. Gone, however, are the horror stories of gridlock and bogging of yesteryear, as effort has been invested into preparing the site and surrounding infrastructure for smooth traffic flows in and out of the site.The committed fans who arrive early will spend hours in often fading light, meticulously putting up their tents and marquees, preparing their campsites for cosy habitation over the next few days. Fields turn into a city overnight, with music pouring out of mobile speakers, portable kitchen and dining tables on every tent avenue and shared open spaces aplenty. These are the fans who wake up at 4am on the Saturday and Sunday, queuing up as early as possible with picnic blankets and foldable chairs to make sure they nab the best viewing location on the track (Becketts, Stowe and Luffield among some of the most sought‑after). Food truck vendors littered around the track start serving at 5am. There are a couple of vegetarian and vegan options available as well, a display of culinary inclusion. Not much halal meat, though, but one can’t have it all.Driving up, the track doesn’t show itself immediately. The roads leading up to the circuit are quaint, winding, surrounded by shrub and woods reminiscent of the country described by Enid Blyton. As chirps of baby tawny owls are echoed by whispers of engines roaring, the circuit comes into view and the energy immediately shifts. Conversation takes on an animated babble, turning to race predictions, favourite drivers, tire selection strategy and lunch. The race did not disappoint. Valtteri Bottas taking pole position was a touch unexpected as the Mercedes front row delivered, Lewis Hamilton breathing down his teammate’s neck. Although the safety car, appearing on lap 21 after Antonio Giovinazzi spun his Alfa Romeo, put a dampener on that exchange, it was a display of the race craft skills we don’t always get the chance to see. Ultimately, however, it was Hamilton’s one-stop pitting strategy compared to Bottas’s two stops that gave him the edge.Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen duelled hard for third place, with Red Bull’s Pierre Gasly and Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel also occasionally in the mix. Verstappen had his pace, Leclerc had his craft, and it was those two up against each other, lap after lap, offering fans a battle for the ages. Even in the pits, they came in together on lap 13 and exited side by side, the Red Bull nosing ahead. Vettel running into the back of Verstappen gave Leclerc the opening he needed to win back third place. “It is the race I enjoyed most in my F1 career,” Leclerc said.Hamilton walked away from Silverstone with his sixth victory at the track and well ahead of all his competition on the world championship leaderboard. He was humble in victory, thanking his fans and exalting the support of his home grand prix. The support came out in droves but is not without its detractors, as is evident any time the five-time world champion dares to falter. When a question referencing the double standards levelled against Hamilton compared to other drivers over his national identity provoked defensiveness from fans and pundits alike, the underlying current of discomfort was laid bare.Silverstone is as British as it gets, and with that comes reflections of the anxieties the country is grappling with across the board. Sport is ultimately a reflection of its society, rather than an escape from it. F1 is no exception, no matter how fast they drive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49ac090895dec09b131a21a2e7a608c0001311fe/0_103_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f44bfb4fdf0152d0f23fc39954ecb01a","title":"talking horses britain cant match pace set by female jockeys in france","story":"Seven of France’s top 50 Flat jockeys this year are women, up from zero in 2016 and five more than in BritainWhile waiting at Longchamp for Japan to win Sunday’s big race, it crossed my mind to check how female jockeys are faring in France, two years after officials there decided to help their cause with a 2kg weight allowance, later trimmed to 1.5kg. The answer appears to be that the initiative, viewed with widespread suspicion in Britain, is proving a success.I remember reporting, when the idea was just a couple of months old, that uptake by trainers and owners had been limited and there was only one female jockey in the top 50 in France, and she was only in 32nd place. “Clearly there has been no gold rush here,” I wrote, and that still seemed fair when 2017 ended with just three women in the top 50.Last year brought the phenomenon of Mickaelle Michel, who led the jockeys championship for months in the first half of the year and eventually finished 12th. But what is more impressive, on reflection, is that seven female jockeys finished in the top 50 last year. Bear in mind that there had been none just two years before, when France-Galop decided to act.It seems that last year’s outcome was no flash in the pan, either. Once again, there are seven women in the top 50 at the moment and the best of them, Coralie Pacaut, is 12th. This year’s seven don’t even include Michel, who is having a slower year for reasons that have passed me by she rode out her apprentice claim towards the end of last year, but so too did Pacaut.British racing might have a stronger tradition of female success in the saddle but we can’t match what’s now happening in France. Hollie Doyle and Nicola Currie are the only women in our top 50 and neither of them are in the top 25. Could it be that we need to consider introducing an allowance of our own?France-Galop’s chief executive, Olivier Delloye, told me yesterday: “The allowance means more rides, more wins and you can see one or two or three female jockeys now achieving a certain level of success, a certain status, with some media coverage. A rider like Mickaelle Michelle is pretty well known by punters. We have Coralie Pacaut, who has now won a lot of races and is known as a very good rider.Arecibo (3.50) is the nap, as he goes to Ripon in an attempt to follow up his success last Monday. That was a first British success for David O’Meara’s charge, who was useful in France. Evidently he is not the most tractable and it is probably no coincidence that a gelding operation was required before he could score here but he impressed last week and the runner-up was then third in a hot handicap at Ascot on Saturday. He’s still below the mark he had when first racing here in April and can take another step forward. He’s 100-30 because of the interest in Roundhay Park, a dual course winner who is running into form.It could be a good day for O’Meara, who has the 15-8 shot Infinite Grace in a nursery earlier. She put up a big effort at Pontefract last week on her handicap debut and may have been unlucky to run into a nicely treated rival. She runs from the same mark today.The O’Meara-fest continues at Ayr, where I’m a bit surprised to be getting 5-1 about Tomily (2.05). This veteran of 43 starts, who left Richard Hannon after bolting up in a seller a fortnight ago, has dropped 10lb in two months. He’s still fast enough to carry plenty of threat in this class.At the end of the card, there’s 5-2 about Arms Of The Angel (5.10), a steadily progressive three-year-old with Mark Johnston who should relish this marathon race against mostly older horses. She didn’t quite have time to get by a Sir Mark Prescott-trained winner at Epsom last week.Plunger (7.00) is the interesting one at Windsor tonight. He’s slipped below the mark from which he won last summer and Kieran Shoemark is an encouraging booking for a horse who ran well here last month. From the in-form Paul Cole yard, he’s 12-1."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12d0c654c417a57c0fdfdf36a5aa1d18610685f2/0_0_4010_2407/master/4010.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce5a2ef85b310d62e595f5f966c391e2","title":"england cricket world cup final reaction new zealand live","story":"• Reaction and celebrations after Sunday’s incredible final• Barney Ronay: England win a World Cup and the nation was watching• Andy Bull: Lord’s the perfect venue for greatest one-day game• Match report from an unforgettable match | Relive the drama• Email Simon or tweet him with your thoughts“I spent yesterday watching both the cricket and tennis finals on adjacent screens in a Teddington pub,” writes Michael Mand. “Just as both went to ‘extra time’, the bar staff decided that both had ended in draws and turned off the TVs, so that a lame Bob Dylan impersonator could take the stage.” That’s an abomination. I’d have been beyond furious. I’d have been knockin’ on the landlord’s door, that’s for sure.Here’s a great photo from the Oval celebrations:Several readers experienced precisely the same commentary outage described by Justin Horton below. “I wouldn’t say it completely spoiled the whole thing, but it certainly took the wind out of the sails at exactly the wrong moment and you would have heard loud swearing coming from my flat if you’d been walking past,” writes Richard Harman, from Bressanone, Italy.Lots of you are sending in your World Cup final stories, and if you’ve got some more World Cup feelings to get off your chest, this might be the place for it:Here’s Tim de Lisle, who did some fine work on the OBO yesterday. I suspect that there are a lot of similar words stored for posterity on a lot of journalists’ laptops.A report from this morning’s Kennington-based celebrations: “I work around the corner from the Oval and popped down earlier to hang with the champs,” writes Lewis Freeth. “Paparazzi were heckled for obstructing our view like a swarm of clicky locusts. That aside, it’s a lovely old lump of gold.”I don’t like plugging obvious PR exercises, but NatWest have programmed a bowling simulator to precisely replicate Trent Boult’s super over, and anyone who turns up to Kings Cross today (it ends at 6pm) can have a go facing it, which sounds like fun (annoyingly lengthy queue depending).Meanwhile Justin Horton is in Huesca. “It wasn’t a great finish for everybody. I live abroad and had listened to the radio commentary via cricketworldcup right from the opening over. But with about five overs to go, at what I should think was half past six your time, it suddenly cut out, to be replaced by a message saying something like ‘This programme is no longer available. This is either because of rights restrictions or a technical error. Please try again later.’“Try as I might, I couldn’t get it back, and though all kinds of ball-by-ball services were available (eventually I went and sat in the shed, and followed the Super Over online) it’s very much not the same, especially when you’ve followed the whole game.I don’t know who or what was responsible, or if anybody else had the same experience, but it spoiled the match, the day and the memory completely.”Any fellow sufferers out there?Hi everyone, Simon here again. I return with an email from Tony Chronnell: “My Dad and I were at England’s first final in 1979 when Viv Richards and Collis King smashed us all around the ground. These days I’m living in Hamburg and I watched the end of the game with my German wife (who doesn’t understand cricket at the best of times and certainly couldn’t understand my gibbering attempts to explain the last few overs). Today I’m sitting here in the office amongst German, Finnish, Chinese and Italian colleagues, none of whom follow cricket or know that England won the World Cup, or can share the agonies and ecstasy of last night. It’s fair to say that the Company IT system is currently experiencing an unusual spike in the number of cricket pages and videos viewed, but luckily no one has yet caught me crying at my desk! And my 84 year old Dad when I texted him last night to share my joy and thank him for introducing me to cricket all those years ago? A single message saying, ‘Not a fair result’!”Jimsey on the Australian reaction to losing as compared to their old friends in New Zealand. “In response to Anthony Pease’s lovely email, I’d wager here in Australia we couldn’t possibly react with the same level of grace, sportsmanship and humility that the Black Caps have if we’d lost a final in that manner. Unfortunately it’s not in the DNA of the national cricket team, and that is the biggest lesson we need to learn since Sandpaper-gate. Ah well, there’s always the Ashes.”David Horovitz emails from Jerusalem, where he”watched the mind-boggling drama unfold through Sunday afternoon and evening via a succession of unreliable live-streaming websites that went into beyond-infuriating buffering mode at several pivotal moments — though not, crucially, in the final minutes.”Horovitz wrote this in a Times of Israel piece last night, in the immediate aftermath of all that glorious insanity: “What was most striking was the composition of this England team... This group of players, of different places of origin, skin color and religion, having come close to exiting the tournament in its earlier rounds, pulled and pushed each other forward to victory. It was a success that ultimately came down to team spirit, to togetherness... It exemplified a whole so much greater than the sum of its disparate parts... What a joy to behold.”Memories of 2015. Here’s how we covered the final four years ago, which was not quite so exciting. For reference, the writer was Australian. They might be more excited once they come out of their current wilderness period. That might be the Ashes, of course. Announcing the result: “Smith pulls to leg for four and it’s all over. Australia win by seven wickets. The final was a bit of a letdown really, but there’s no question that the best team in the tournament have won it.”Final post: “So that’s that. A decent tournament comes to an end – it’s not been a classic but it’s not been too bad.”Alex Hughes was watching the game in a most exotic location, but then had to reach for the bank of Mum and Dad. “I watched the game yesterday on my laptop in a hostel in Merida, Mexico. Unfortunately, my (totally legitimate cough cough) stream went down just before the start of the 49th over. After the excruciating experience of following the 49th over by refreshing the OBO, I decided to call my parents back in the UK and my Dad provided commentary for me on the super overs via a WhatsApp call. While this was not quite the same standard of commentary as TMS it had its own unique charm. It was difficult to hear what dad was saying because he was being drowned out by the sound of Mum just screaming something inaudible about Jofra Archer over and over again in background during the second super over. By the end mum was so frazzled she was muttering something about Australians (not sure why) and on the last ball Dad finally also lost his composure and just screamed ‘run out, run out, run out, run out’ so I just about got the message that England had won.”Anthony Pease emails in: “Afternoon, John Is it just me, or are the Kiwis taking this result with significantly more grace and humour than their cross-Tasman cousins?”I couldn’t possibly comment. Cockermouth School PE teacher Chris Hayes, Ben Stokes’ cricket coach for four years, has been talking to the Press Association about his star pupil: I was absolutely convinced he would not be out. I’ve seen that in him before. He won’t give his wicket away. He’ll take that responsibility to try and see the job through and close the deal - and by hook or by crook he did. He had that determination all the time, that game management as well as the talent. It doesn’t surprise me at all that he was able to do that. You talk about his lack of concentration in the team meeting or school environment, but the ability to concentrate with that bat in hand is unbelievable and he showed that on many occasions with us. He wanted to be involved in all formats of the game - his batting, his bowling, his fielding. He could throw the ball further than anybody I’d ever seen…He came through and matured in the game at the same time as Twenty20 took off. I thought he could play T20 for England potentially, knowing he could reach the boundary - he’s always been able to hit the ball. The interesting thing to me is that he’s made his mark in Test matches as much as he has in the one-day game. He’s not just a professional cricketer, he’s not just an international cricketer, he’s actually a world-class cricketer. You can’t really spot that! You think this lad is good and he’ll make a cricketer, but to go on and be a world-class cricketer... he’s been unbelievable.Simon Jenkins thinks the final should have ended in a tie. Cricket had gone the way of football’s penalty shootouts.Publicity corner from an Aussie bookmaker? From the New Zealand Herald. Australian bookmaker Sportsbet has refunded those who put money on the Black Caps to win the Cricket World Cup final against England...The company said it had refunded 11,458 people a total sum of $426,223 after the host nation won the final on a controversial boundary countback rule following tied scores after 102 overs of cricket. “Punters who backed New Zealand in both the head to head and the outright tournament market will be refunded their stakes in bonus bets. Let’s not beat around the bush, for a World Cup to be decided in that manner is an absolute disgrace, and the punters shouldn’t have to pay for the ineptness of the ICC,” said a spokesman.Vic Marks considers whether cricket can recapture the audiences of yore. Jim Waterson has the news on the viewing figures. For reference, 15m watched the Rugby World Cup final in 2003, and in 1966 it was 32.3m viewers. It was 7.4m for the Ashes in 2005. Afternoon. No scenes like this as yet. or this from 2003, for that matter. Or this from 1966.I’m going to take a quick(ish) break. John Brewin will keep you up do date in the meantime - send your emails to him here, if you would. Bye for now!“I’ve seen a lot of people asking who wrote the script for England’s 50th over, in particular the six runs from the overthrow,” writes Chris Laycock. “Does no one else remember the episode of Neighbours where Karl needed a six off the last ball to win? He hit it for two, but then got four overthrows to win the match. Just me then?” Drew is batting and now they need 6 to win off two balls. Unfortunately, the ball goes in the air and Drew is caught out. Now it’s up to Karl to make six off the last ball. Joe raises his eyes to heaven and prays. Gordon Collins torments Lou and says he doesn’t fancy Karl’s chances.Karl steps up to the crease and Joe advises him - “Never Give In” The ball comes and Karl hits it, but it isn’t hit for six. However, a series of fielding errors ensues - they run two and then the ball goes over the boundary and gives them and extra four. Our Heroes start shouting excitedly that they’ve won, Joe kisses Karl and Lou tells Gordon Collins that he’ll take cash or cheque! “I was just at the Oval and can confirm that Liam Plunkett looked mullered,” reports Daniel King.Mike Hesson, New Zealand’s head coach from 2012 to 2018, has written for the Sydney Morning Herald about the World Cup final. Here’s how he starts:Kane Williamson and Eoin Morgan should have jointly lifted the Cricket World Cup. Certainly neither England nor New Zealand deserved to lose.Using a Super Over to decide it was farcical and the International Cricket Council needs to give itself an uppercut for even entertaining it as a tiebreaker. To just copy and paste the playing conditions from Twenty20 and use the highest number of boundaries to determine who wins in the event of a tied Super Over is not at all necessary. This is a 50-over World Cup.I didn’t agree with the concept of the Super Over in the first place. The whole idea of a Super Over is in a situation when you need a side to progress, like in a semi-final. That’s when the necessity of finding a winner makes sense. When you’re playing a final of a World Cup after seven weeks’ hard toil, to decide it by some obscure means that is made for T20 cricket is ridiculous.Sky interview Jason Roy. He can hardly speak.I don’t think I’ll ever be part of something like that again. The yo-yo of emotions throughout the whole day was scary. I couldn’t watch. I spent 10 overs in the showers just holding my head. I didn’t know what was going on.He says that after delivering the ball to Jos Buttler for the decisive run-out “I tried to run off, but realised by legs don’t work. My legs were wobbling. I lay on the floor for a couple of minutes.” He also says he will “hopefully” be part of England’s Ashes team.I’ve been surprised by how decent all the England players look at the Oval, compared with the Pietersen- and Flintoff-led madness in 2005. However, apparently there are some rough faces about:This gallery of Tom Jenkins’ best photographs from Lord’s is thoroughly excellent:The Times is reporting that every member of England’s World Cup squad will be honoured for their achievement, saying “Whitehall sources” have told them that MBEs and OBEs will be handed out in the New Year Honours list.“At 86-4, I decided to cut my losses and accompany my wife to the 14 July celebrations at the French embassy in Amman rather than endure the pain of watching the capitulation at home alone, but took my earphones along just in case,” writes Charlie Dunmore. “At 150-4 I tuned into to TMS, and spent the next two hours staring blankly ahead while people quaffed their wine and chatted around me. My primal scream when Butler broke the stumps to win the game drew plenty of strange looks, but not half as many as when I sheepishly explained that England had just become World Champions. ‘Champions de quoi..?’”“I don’t think anything will faze me again,” says Jos Buttler:I can’t believe what has happened, but it’s nice to wake up and know it did. I don’t think anything will faze me again. I don’t think think I’ll ever care about anything ever again. I don’t really care what happens now in my career.” We were laughing about the fact that four years of work came down to one ball. Four years and then then it’s one ball ... can we get a run-out? It justifies everything we have done for four years to get to this point. It’s an incredible journey. At the end I remember that 10 seconds of just running around, the atmosphere is something that will live with me forever. It’s alright when you’re in the middle because it’s what you know - catch a ball, smash the stumps - but the consequences are obviously quite a lot larger!The England players are gamely submitting to interviews on the field at the Oval. Here’s Mark Wood:It hasn’t quite sunk in until this morning. Everyone’s on their phones, talking about last night. Last night was pure ecstasy. Everyone was on top of the world. It’s pretty surreal to be honest. A pretty special moment. I don’t think we’ll ever see anything like that again. Especially in a World Cup final. Almost beyond belief.This just in from our deputy political editor, Rowena Mason:Theresa May - a devoted cricket fan - has invited the England men’s cricket team to Downing Street for a reception this evening to celebrate their victory.Ahead of the event, she said: “Yesterday was a brilliant performance by a brilliant team. They showed flair courage and an absolute determination to become world champions. The achievement delivered in such a thrilling style on home soil will live forever in our sporting history. It is also exciting to think how many children will be inspired by this victory to pick up a bat for the first time and hopefully become the great cricketers of tomorrow.” Theresa May was at Lord’s yesterday (and at Wimbledon on Saturday she had quite the sporting weekend):“A couple of contributions haven’t yet received the focus they perhaps deserve,” writes John Withington. “Firstly, Jofra Archer faced with seven needed off four balls? A remarkable comeback after the first three balls including the wide. And how about Jason Roy who’s not had a good tournament in the field? The ball followed him all over the park in that final over, fielding three of the six legal deliveries. The first he fumbled terribly to concede an extra run. The second he chose the wrong end to throw to. He knew that he’d probably lost the World Cup when England could have had two run-outs to win the game. And then the final ball. He was probably a little too deep on the boundary, wasn’t the fastest off the line, but gathered cleanly and fired in the perfect throw. Massive bottle under huge pressure.”Here’s our news story on the suggestion that England were erroneously awarded an extra run:Stephen van Rooyen, Sky’s UK and Ireland chief executive, has released a statement about the viewing figures:We’ve been proud host broadcasters of a home cricket World Cup, dedicating a channel and showing every single minute, which has been absorbing from the first ball to the unforgettable final delivery. Sunday saw a peak across Sky and Channel 4 of 8.3 million – a huge audience for a huge moment for British sport. On Sky’s channels our peak was 3.5m alone, a fitting way to cap a terrific tournament.We are proud of our long term cricket partnership, which has grown over three decades, delivering record investment into the sport. This partnership will continue with our coverage of the Men’s and Women’s Ashes this Summer, and by working with the ECB to deliver a new grassroots cricket participation campaignNew Zealand’s players have also been up and out this morning:As a remarkably fresh-faced group of players sign infinite autographs on the Oval turf, Ashley Giles is quizzed by Sky:Amazing day yesterday. The boys all thoroughly enjoyed their night I think as well. I think some of them have slept. We just don’t have days like we had yesterday. To be world champions, after all the work that’s gone in over the last four years, and the emotions yesterday, I think we’re all exhausted. The whole day was hard but the last half an hour was just dreadful. I thought we’d won it, then I thought we’d lost it, then I thought we’d lost it by even more, and then to go to the super over ... I understand there were three or four people in the crowd who passed out.For now, they have arrived at the Oval, and are fighting their way through a throng of schoolkids.The England team will attend a reception with the Prime Minister at Downing Street at 7pm this evening. A visual reminder of England’s last post-victory visit:This from Yevaru BTL on England’s controversial overthrow six: “On TMS, Michael Vaughan said he was sat near Jos Buttler when that overthrow happened. Buttler’s reaction shows he’s as cool off the pitch as he is on it: ‘That’s the first one Ben has middled all day.’”Here’s Tanya Aldred’s take on yesterday’s drama:“Next a train change at Lancaster. I run phone in hand to make the Virgin train, I dart into the nearest door and commence viewing, there is a man there receiving updates over the phone from his wife. I invite him to watch with me on my phone, a few minutes later there are 5 of us huddled around my phone, cheering, jeering, hoping our hearts don’t pack up! What a rollercoaster, myself and four complete strangers in absolute delirium as Buttler takes the bails off to break New Zealand hearts!”The gates are open at the Oval and the England team and their new trophy are about 15 minutes away. There are 1,000 local schoolchildren there, but grown-ups are allowed too.In New Zealand, there are some complaints that the title was eventually decided on a fairly arbitrary metric (the number of boundaries hit in the final), rather than on wickets taken, or dot balls bowled, or just letting the teams share the trophy. This is what the former New Zealand all-rounder Dion Nash told stuff.co.nz: Meanwhile the former Kiwi wicket-keeper Peter McGlashan said this:I think it’s a shame, that we’ve played a tournament which has gone for 48 games, and yet it’s decided by someone getting out a piece of paper and a pen and picking apart the bones, New Zealand’s strength throughout this tournament has been about rotating the strike, our strength hasn’t been boundaries, so it seems a bit of a shame to be judged by that all of a sudden.A Super Over works for T20s, but I think 50-over cricket needs to have something that reflects the amount of work and energy that’s gone into the game. The Super Over just seems the wrong way to decide it. It’s a little bit like deciding a marathon with a 100-metre sprint at the end of it - it’s not the appropriate way to judge the performance of the athletes on show. Another choice clip from yesterday, as Moeen and Rashid make a last-minute dash from the imminent Champagne deluge.Overnight viewing figures suggest that a peak of 4.5 million people watched on Channel 4, with an average of 2.4 million. Sky also showed it on three channels, which had a combined average viewership of 1,474,000 people, and a peak of a shade under three million. In the Sunday sporting spectacular it was well beaten by the tennis (peak 9.6 million, average 6 million), but thrashed the GP (peak 2.5 million, average 1.8 million).This bit wasn’t in the highlights packages, for some reason:Here’s a report on celebrations on the streets of England (my favourite bit of this photo, by the way, is the random shoe flying through the top-left corner):And here’s a report on the rather different reaction on the streets of New Zealand:The cricket is of course on all British front pages today. Here’s the :Though I do think the Times’ wraparound front wins today’s front-page title by a knockout:“You’ve hit the nail on the head there, I think,” says Simon McMahon. “What made yesterday’s events at Lord’s so memorable was not just the incredible skill allied to heart-stopping drama, but the sheer likeability of both sets of players, and the honouring of crickets greatest traditions. I for one will forever associate England’s eventual triumph, after a remarkable four year journey, with the unbelievable class and dignity shown by the New Zealand players. *Cliche alert* (but it needs saying, because it’s true) - cricket really was the winner.”Some advice from New Zealand’s Jimmy Neesham:One of the big talking-points remains the six runs awarded to England when the ball deflected off Ben Stokes’ bat and to the boundary, turning two runs for England into six. Here’s a visual reminder:Here’s the relevant law:19.8 Overthrow or wilful act of fielderIf the boundary results from an overthrow or from the wilful act of a fielder, the runs scored shall beThe issue being that the batsmen had not crossed for the second run when Martin Guptill released the ball. Thus England should have been awarded five runs, rather than six.The former umpire Simon Taufel has been speaking to the Australian media about this, and here’s what he told the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age:There was a judgement error on the overthrow. The judgement error was the timing of when the fielder threw the ball. The act of the overthrow starts when the fielder releases the ball. That’s the act. It becomes an overthrow from the instant of the throw.In this particular case, the umpires have got a lot on their plate, because like every ball, they’ve had to watch the batsmen complete the first run, they’ve had to watch the ball being fielded, to understand how it’s in play, whether the fielder’s done the right thing. Then they’ve got to look to see when the ball is released, in case there is an overthrow. And that happens every delivery of the game. And then they’ve got to back to see where the two batsmen are.They’ve then got to follow on and see what happens after that, whether there is a run out, whether there’s an ‘obstructing the field’, whether the ball is taken fairly. There’s multitudes of decisions to be taken off the one delivery. What’s unfortunate is that people think that umpiring is just about outs and not outs. They forget we make 1000s of decisions every match.So it’s unfortunate that there was a judgement error on the timing of the release of the ball and where the batsmen were. They did not cross on their second run, at the instant of the throw. So given that scenario, five runs should have been the correct allocation of runs, and Ben Stokes should have been at the non-striker’s end for the next delivery.We’re not perfect. You’ve got the best two umpires in the elite panel doing the final. They’re doing their best like the other two teams are. This is just part of the game.I think it’s unfair to say that the World Cup was decided by that one event. There’s a lot of ‘what ifs’ and ‘what should bes’ and ‘what could bes’ that happen off those 600-plus deliveries. That’s the nature of sport.Let’s just start with this moment. It’s 220-7, England need 22 from nine balls, and Trent Boult catches Ben Stokes just inside the rope, before tossing the ball to Martin Guptill. If he treads on the boundary rope before throwing the ball, it’s six. If he doesn’t, it’s out, and New Zealand effectively win the World Cup. Just think of all the sportspeople in all the sports who would and indeed do do absolutely anything to give their sides victory: punch the ball off the line in the dying moments of World Cup quarter-final arrange state-sponsored doping factories sneak sandpaper onto the field in their underpants. And then consider what Guptill’s instinct was at this moment: to instantly award England the six. Sure, the TV umpire would have done it anyway, but I thought that moment of honesty summed up the Kiwis’ class.So far this morning I’ve watched the Channel 4 highlights, and then Sky’s highlights. For what it’s worth, Sky’s were much better. Anyway, I can confirm that it actually happened, and the entire business was absolutely ludicrous in the most fantastic way: drama, skill, luck, mistakes from players and umpires, emotion, more drama, the use of rules that few would have expected anyone would even read let alone put into action, and also the most phenomenal sportsmanship, astonishingly impressive in the circumstances. Let’s see what the world has to say about it, shall we?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f35889746f267ff80a2e2ac0f644b6072453681a/0_282_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c34b185870943e9b75045cbd2116404","title":"tour de france 2019 stage ten live","story":"36km to go: The gap from the six-man breakaway to the bunch is 1min 26sec. By my estimation, between Friday’s stage and today’s stage, I have now done 10 hours worth of consecutive Tour de France live blogging, in which precisely little or nothing of interest has happened for nine hours and 58 minutes.Fight! Fight! Fight! “Responding to John O’G’s anti-Bojangles slander on the Tour live blog,” writes Kyle Taylor. “Chicken and biscuits are great, whatever the elitist guy John O’G says. Bojangles biscuits especially are incredible. Definitely one of the better fast food restaurants in the US. “I hate Trump but sports stadium branding has literally nothing to do with where candidates have rallies. This particular coliseum is in Charlotte, North Carolina which is a very important place for campaigns to go.” Chicken and ... biscuits? Somebody is going to have to talk the rest of the class how that works. What kind of biscuits? Of course, here in Blighty, biscuits are what Americans call “cookies”. I’m guessing nobody is going to Bojangles for a feed of roast chicken and chocolate Hob Nobs or Custard Creams. 52km to go: Several teams take the opportunity to have unofficial feed zones in place for the peloton as they make their way up the final climb. I will take this opportunity to have a short, unofficial break of my own before we get to the business end of the stage. The gap is two minutes, I’ll be back in about five. 53km to go: The gap goes back out to 1min 34sec as the breakaway group hit the top of the day’s final climb. For the fourth time today, Natnael Berhane leads the escape party over the top. He’s in fifth place in the King of the Mountains standings. Behind them, the peloton is back together, although Ryan Zabel and Yeann Offredo have been dropped. 58km to go: The peloton splits up as Team Ineos up the pace at the front and the crosswinds buffet the bunch. A group of 30 or so riders - among them, polka dot jersey Tim Wellens - are now 30 seconds behind the yellow jersey group. The gap from our six-man breakaway to the yellow jersey is now a mere 40 seconds. An email: “On the subject of you looking up Deceuninck,” writes John O’G. “I used to watch Nascar and there was one race that was sponsored by Bojangles. I looked it up expecting it to be some sort of gentlemen’s club but it was, in fact, a fast food shop whose specialty was ‘chicken and biscuit’. Chicken and biscuit! Needless to say I did not frequent that establishment when I was in the States.” I think Donald Trump staged one of his rallies at a place called the Bojangles Coliseum, which is another reason not to patronise the restaurant of the same name. Gareth Thomas responds: “I have not attempted to throw a kettle over a pub while riding at 60 mph down the south side of the St Gotthard pass,” he concedes. “But I’m sure there are many reasons why this could prove unhelpful behaviour on Swiss roads.” 69km to go: Team Ineos are leading the charge in the peloton, as the teams of various GC contenders move to the front of the peloton, alert to the dangers of crosswinds on the exposed, narrow road they’re travelling along. The gap is 1min 07sec. 72km to go: Yoann Offredo is currenbtly struggling to stay in touch with the peloton. The Wanty-Gobert rider spent much of last week in breakaways, but has been feeling poorly for the past couple of days. Nearby at the back of the bunch, polka-dot jersey Tim Wellens has dropped back to his team car to get some ice to stuff down the back of his shirt. Some correspondence: “In response to Gareth Thomas clocking 60mph on a steel-framed racing bike with small touring panniers on the fast downhill run south of the St Gotthard pass some years ago,” writes Craig Fawcett. “I’ve got a mate who once threw a kettle over a pub.” “Re: the optimum point, due to drag, when Gareth Thomas cannot go any faster downhill,” writes Nic Clarke, who is a science teacher. “That would be, as my year 9 class could tell you, your terminal velocity. Well at least half of them. Probably.” A question: “What do you think is next for Cav?” asks Lloyd. “Do you think he can come back next year (and motivated as never) or is it the end of an era?” It’s a good question and a difficult one to answer, not least because he was suffering a debilitating virus for much of last year. He’s not getting any younger and there are some speedy young bucks in the ranks that are probably faster than him, but he may well have a couple more Tour stage wins left in his legs. He’d certainly have fancied his chances today, if he hadn’t been controversially dropped by Team Dimension Data the week before the Tour commenced. 86km to go: With six lots of points already snaffled, Sonny Colbrelli is the first man from the peloton to roll over the line, shadowed by Peter Sagan a few metres behind. The gap from the breakaway group to the bunch is now 1min 33sec. 88km to go: Odd Christian Eiking is first over the line at a decidedly uncontested intermediate sprint. Anthony Turgis is second and Mads Wurtz Schmidt is third. Intermediate sprint: The breakaway is approaching La Primaube, the secen of today’s intermediate sprint. While none of the chaps in today’s breakaway are in contention for the green jersey, there are cash prizes up for grabs for the teams of the first three riders over the line. First gets €1,500, second trousers €1,000 and third gets €500. Behind the breakaway, Peter Sagan already has his customary stranglehold on the green jersey and leads Michael Matthews by 60 points. Sagan has 204 points, Matthews has 144 poiunts, Sonny Colbrelli is third on 129, one point ahead of Elia Viviani.93km to go: The field passes through the small southern city of Rodez, which isn’t too far from Carcassone, Toulouse and Montpelier on the map.An email: “Cav’s got Quick Step in his house,” writes Matthew Trim, sending this report veering perilously close to Hello! magazine territory, as we step inside Mark Cavendish’s well appointed Tuscany villa. An email: “Max Richez was clocked at 96.7kph which sounds like a lot,” writes Gareth Thomas. “It is roughly 60.5mph. I clocked 60mph on a steel-framed racing bike with small touring panniers on the fast downhill run south of the St Gotthard pass some years ago. There is an optimum point, due to drag, when you cannot go any faster. Panniers don’t help either!”103km to go: The gap continues to hove between two and three minutes and is currently at 2min 37sec. Michael Schar (CCC), Natnael Berhane (Cofidis), Anthony Turgis (Total Direct Energie), Odd Christian Eiking (Wanty-Groupe Gobert), Mads Wurtz Schmidt (Katusha-Alpecin) and Tony Gallopin (AG2R La Mondiale) are the men in front and the intermediate sprint is next on their agenda, although they may pass through the feed zone first, if they haven’t done so already. 107km to go: And Quick Step make laminated flooring. I knew that already. 110km to go: Curiosity finally having got the better of me, I have discovered that Deceuninck, of Deceuninck-Quick Step fame, make sustainable PVC windows and doors. By their own account, their “heritage flush and sculptured sash windows look great in any surrounding, from country cottages to modern townhouses. Their subtle charm and elegance will transform your home. The collection is ideal for period properties and for those who want to add or restore character to their homes with its unique, unrivalled, aesthetics and sympathetic symmetrical design giving a property perfect balance and harmony”. Yep, it’s come to this. A new top speed: I’m going to go out on a limb and guess it was on a downhill, but it has emerged that Deceuninck-Quick Step rider Max Richez has set a new top speed for this year’s Tour, getting clocked at 96.7km per hour earlier in this stage. Crikey. 114km to go: The breakaway continue to pedal along at a fair old lick, 39.9km per hour, to be exact. The peloton continue to keep them on a tight rein, with the gap at 2min 47sec. An email: “As a teacher I would never have been able to attend even a stage of the TDF,” writes KG. |So when the 1994 route included Dover-Brighton I took my chance. I formed a cycling club, quite a good one as it turned out. Next I contacted a deserving local cycling charity and formed a link. Next I went to the boss with my plan to go from Manchester to Brighton, three days, on a sponsored ride in support of the charity.“Good publicity for the College. Good man, he agreed and we got to work. And it did work. A goodly sum was raised, the local paper featured it, we had a great time and there we were at L’arriveé of a stage. Everything into the back up van and home in time for Songs of Praise.The things you have to do!” 119km to go: I wasn’t quick enough to get a screengrab, but the camera just cut to Didi Senft, the trident-waving German super fan who dresses as the devil and is a regular on the roadside at the Tour and Giro. Aged 67, he was standing on a wall, gesticulating furiously as the peloton passed, risking life and limb with a drop of what looked like a couple of 100 metres behind him. An email: “Enjoying the coverage here in the Auvergne,” writes Andy Taylor. “Two points though - the site refers to today as a flat stage ... not much, when I went along it last year! Up and down, big vertical relief. Other point is that today isn’t a traditional day off. Ordinary working day here as are all the breaks when Bastille Day falls at the weekend. Holiday season, certainly. No ‘pont’ between the holiday itself and the weekend.” I was misinformed. 139km to go: The stage may be ostensibly “flat”, but the terrain is very hilly and the weather is hot, around 30 degrees celsius. Michael Schar (CCC), Natnael Berhane (Cofidis), Anthony Turgis (Total Direct Energie), Odd Christian Eiking (Wanty-Groupe Gobert), Mads Wurtz Schmidt (Katusha-Alpecin) and Tony Gallopin (AG2R La Mondiale) continue to pootle along in the breakaway, with a gap of 3min 03sec back to a peloton that is being towed along by Tony Martin.A few wheels back, race leader Julian Alaphilippe is out of his saddle and having a bit of a stretch. I’m about to do much the same thing, while going back to my team care for some sustenance. I’ll be back in five minutes or so. 150km to go: The gap remains just below three minutes on a stage that is very low on excitement. Because today is a national holiday in France, in the wake of Bastille Day yesterday, so the riders have been forced out of their beds to race on what is traditionally a rest day. They’ll have tomorrow off instead, although all of them will probably still do 100 kilometres or so just to keep their legs from seizing up. A lot of the main GC contenders and big name sprinters will also have media duties to attend to. For the journalists covering the race, it’s a low pressure day that brings with it a welcome opportunity to do some much needed laundry! 168km to go: On Eurosport, the commentary team are citing a previous example of when a group of riders in a breakaway, in a similar kind of stage to this, put the word out, via their sporting directors, that if the bunch didn’t allow them a gap of at least 3min 30sec and at least a sporting chance of winning the stage, they would all sit up and allow the peloton to catch them.This prompted panic from the teams of assorted sprinters in the bunch, who were worried about the prospect of having to defend attacks from other, fresher riders, so they acceded to the breakaway’s wishes. What chance the same thing happening today? Not much of one, by the looks of things, but our six-man escape party must be wondering what the point of their mission is beyond getting some publicity for their team sponsors. 169km to go: The gap from the six-man breakaway to the bunch is a shade under three minutes after almost 50 kilometres of “racing”. An email: “For me the Tour always signals the transition into the summer holidays,” writes Jason Humphreys. “Working at a university, July means the lectures are over and its exam time. For me that means long days in the office, correcting exams, and tying up as many loose ends as possible to try and make the return to productivity in September a bit smoother.“It also means more relaxed clothing, longer walks at lunchtime, and the daily companionship of the action from France via podcast, live ticker or a well-placed iPad on the desk – not to mention a spike in my Amazon activities. I was wondering what it’s like for you? You seem to get the gig every summer. Do you see it as a welcome break from football and the chance to get your teeth into something else, or do you find yourself returning a DHL parcel every other day?” A good question, Jason. I really enjoy doing these liveblogs of the Tour. It is an always welcome palate cleanser that affords me the opportunity to almost completely ignore football transfer speculation, meaningless pre-season friendlies, which seem to get a lot of football fans very exercised indeed but barely interest me at all. Having said that, stages like today’s and last Friday’s, where almost nothing happens at great length, are a bit of a drag. 179km to go: The gap from Natnael Berhane (Cofidis), Anthony Turgis (Total Direct Energie), Odd Christian Eiking (Wanty-Groupe Gobert), Mads Wurtz Schmidt (Katusha-Alpecin) and Tony Gallopin (AG2R La Mondiale) to the bunch is 2min 24sec as the escape party head up the second categorised climb of the day. Nobody’s working too hard in either group. Natnael Berhane is the best placed rider on GC in the breakaway - he’s 90th overall, 57min 13sec behind Julian Alaphilippe. 186km to go: The gap from our six-man breakaway to the bunch is 2min 35sec and Tony Martin is putting in the hard yards at the front of the peloton. As exercises in utter futility go, few can match being in an escape party that is being kept on such a tight rein. Back in the peloton, it’ll be another easy day for the GC contenders, while those unconcerned with the GC will be able to relax safe in the knowledge that we’re almost certain to have a sprint finish. Your breakaway: Michael Schar (CCC), Natnael Berhane (Cofidis), Anthony Turgis (Total Direct Energie), Odd Christian Eiking (Wanty-Groupe Gobert), Mads Wurtz Schmidt (Katusha-Alpecin) and Tony Gallopin (AG2R La Mondiale). The gap is 2min 17sec. 206km to go: Sagan and Matthews, first and second in the green jersey standings, return to the bunch. Team CCC rider Michael Schar has bridged the gap to the breakaway, which is now six strong and 1min 48sec clear. 207km to go: The breakaway riders are still being held on a piece of elastic and are not away safely from the bunch yet. Today’s stage has yet to settle. 208km to go: Natnael Berhane (Cofidis), Anthony Turgis (Total Direct Energie), Odd Christian Eiking (Wanty-Groupe Gobert), Mads Wurtz Schmidt (Katusha-Alpecin) and Tony Gallopin (AG2R La Mondiale) have escaped from the peloton and opened a gap of 19 seconds. Michael Matthews and Peter Sagan are trying to bridge the gap. They’re racing on stage 10: Today’s roll-out is complete and a strung out peloton, led by Marcus Burghardt, is chasing down an early attempt at a breakaway. Another withdrawal: Team CCC rider Alessandro De Marchi’s had a nasty crash yesterday and was taken to hospital in an ambulance. A key man in Saturday’s breakaway, the Italian suffered a broken collar bone, fractured ribs and a punctured lung after coming a cropper around 50 kilometres into yesterdays stage. De Marchi is the fifth rider to be forced out of this year’s Tour, leaving a field of 171. Mitchelton Scott’s stage nine diary: The Aussie team won the stage on Bastille Day, courtesy of Daryl Impey.

The script of early breakaway, late catch, scary sprint should be followed, but most of the riders will be just making sure they drink enough. All eyes will be on whichever sprinter has hit form early on, as Marcel Kittel did in 2017 and Mark Cavendish did the year before. The hilly route of this year’s first half of the Tour favours a lighter rider such as Elia Viviani."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e72b6d4b712a9c102912797938f16e77e748206d/808_993_3353_2012/master/3353.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f400e93dad47a6c21ba60d8ef451bf2b","title":"olga pericet and patricia guerrero flamenco festival sadlers wells","story":"At Sadler’s Wells’ flamenco festival, Olga Pericet and Patricia Guerrero took themes of transformation to another levelFlamenco is shifting away from its traditional roots at an accelerating pace to become a vivid, relevant theatrical force. In this year’s flamenco festival in London, two shows by female choreographer-performers take on themes of transformation with wildly different approaches.In The Thorn That Wanted to Be a Flower, Or the Flower That Dreamed of Being a Dancer (★★★☆☆), Olga Pericet tries on a host a characters, from football yob to gunslinger to clucking chicken. She is a comedian, drama queen and contrarian, at one point giving up dancing altogether to lie on a table while her fantastic band play on (including Antonia Jiménez, a rare female guitarist) with the fabulously snake-hipped dancer Jesús Fernández. But gradually Pericet sheds the artifice and the real dancer is revealed, and this is where she really captivates, her small frame a mighty presence, a dancer of compelling assuredness revelling in the spotlight as herself.So far so good, but then comes Patricia Guerrero, who steps things up to the next level. In Catedral (★★★★☆), Guerrero is not simply throwing some thematic ideas at a flamenco concert but embodying a fully realised concept, in this case the oppressive force of the Catholic church on women’s lives.On a stage of dark shadows, Guerrero, in black lace mantilla, is lit by a shaft of chiaroscuro. The dancer’s figure, and the air around her, is heavily infused with fear, tension, guilt and penance. Her arms move in an interrupted staccato, twitching like a hunted animal on high alert. Ordinary gestures take on ominous meaning: when Guerrero and her three fellow dancers gather their skirts in front of them, the practical matter of freeing up their feet turns into desperately clutching the fabric to their chests, the tension visible in their braced bodies.Guerrero’s dancing is both fearsome and afraid, yet there’s anger here and determination in purposeful phrases. The power of her foot striking the floor hits you with the shock and finality of a door slamming in your face. Catedral follows Guerrero’s journey to a cacophonous emancipation, a kind of exorcism – complete with the chilling song of a red-robed countertenor, injecting some Purcell into the flamenco score. It’s a powerful work from a startling young talent moving flamenco forward."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acc9ba97f8e13106146fc732004b0475bd3ba934/0_158_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5a9daf3a86da42e9b8d75d9e6ea1590","title":"locals guide to stockhom sweden 10 top tips","story":"Sweden’s capital comes alive in summer, with its archipelago of stunning islands perfect for boat trips and swimming, not to mention a buzzing food sceneThe Stockholm archipelago is surrounded by clean waters, so the wild bathing opportunities are numerous.

The latter is smaller and leaner, but also more complex in flavour. It is also the one used to make famously stinky surströmming – maybe the world’s foulest smelling fermented fish, mostly eaten by people in the north of the country. A better introduction to the world of Baltic herring is the kiosk at Kornhamnstorg in the old town, where it’s eaten fried on crisp bread – traditional poor man’s food that has become fast food (£3.50-£7.50).

Yes, that. What’s taking you so long?Perhaps you need to reply to an important-but-not-urgent work email, or pay an overdue utility bill. These tasks are straightforward enough, so why does alphabetising your books seem preferable instead?Procrastination is the pits. It leaves us feeling guilty and self-loathing. When contemplating, say, getting round to finally sorting out that life insurance quote that’s been on a Post-it note on the fridge for nine weeks, why does scrubbing the shower grouting with a toothbrush suddenly become more pressing?It cannot be that, as a species, we are inherently bone idle and appalling at managing our time, because the tasks we engage in rather than the ones we need to do often require focus and physical labour. In fact, laziness has very little to do with procrastination, which is, in simple terms, a form of self-punishment.Procrastination is not just about delaying. It is about engaging in something we know in our gut to be unhelpful – a painful level of self-awareness. We know that we’re avoiding what we need to do, which feels awful enough, but also that doing something else instead is not a great idea either. But we go ahead and do it anyway.The pattern is irrational. Yet when we start to consider how we feel, things become a little clearer. Procrastination is usually a habit rather than a one-off occurrence. It is unfair to label it as a character flaw (although it may be perceived as such by those close to us). Rather, it is an inability to manage uncomfortable feelings associated with a task.Particular jobs such as cleaning the toilet or unblocking the bath plughole are universally revolting because they involve matter we instinctively know could contaminate us. We’re wired to find them disgusting as a form of protection. However, deeper negative emotions – such as frustration, boredom, anxiety, resentment, confusion or insecurity – may be connected with other, less grimy tasks.If I am sitting in front of my computer trying to write a cover letter for a new job, I might start thinking: “I sound like a fool, they will surely think I sound terrible.” Replacing the task with something monotonous and engaging, such as vacuuming the stairs, is a way for me to cope with those difficult emotions.Research shows that procrastination can be explained as something we engage in as an urgent self-soothing technique, but the comfort is fleeting at best – once we start thinking about what we’re doing, more stress creeps in. There’s even a scientific name for this thought process: procrastinatory cognitions. In turn, this makes us procrastinate even more. We reward ourselves for procrastinating, while the negative emotions surrounding the task remain, as well as self-blame.Particular areas of our brain involved with self-perception interpret the tasks we’re procrastinating over as, essentially, not our problem – in the long-term, at least. As humans we aren’t wired to prioritise long-term needs. From an evolutionary perspective, we prioritise providing for ourselves in the present, because our ancestors never knew what was (or wasn’t) around the corner.So what can we do? Looking in the mirror and saying, “Stop procrastinating NOW” probably won’t work. Time management apps will only get you so far. Really, we need to think about the root cause of why we’re procrastinating. Identifying that it is about emotion rather than efficiency is a good start.Practically speaking, we can make our procrastination activities harder to do. If you habitually turn to social media, try deleting the apps from your phone and creating new, elaborate passwords. If you throw obstacles into the procrastination cycle, it takes longer to feel the reward and changes how your brain perceives the value of something – such as checking social media.Ultimately, loosening the grip of this existential habit comes down to self-compassion. Re-evaluate your tasks by creating a new “evidence base” for when you have done similar things well. Imagine the positive outcome. How will you feel in yourself? How will you – or others – benefit? Try writing that down. Presenting our inner dialogue to ourselves can be very powerful.Another potentially helpful technique is “defusion”. When the urge to procrastinate strikes, set an alarm for three minutes on your phone. Close your eyes. Bring your awareness to what is happening in your inner world – your thoughts about procrastinating (are they streams of words or images?) and the feelings in your body: where do you feel them? Are they familiar? Start noticing the way you’re interpreting what the thoughts and feelings around procrastination mean to you, and how that affects you in that moment. When the alarm goes, you may see your urge to escape your feelings for what it is.There is a robust evidence base to show that mindfulness exercises, if practised regularly, can improve our ability to accept and tolerate negative emotions without engaging in avoidance or actions that bring short-term relief. It might take a little time, but change is entirely possible. Your books can go unorganised for a while yet.For more information, visit avivalife"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a15e71155b5f3dc3bcdfe504c83fa36afe74b7af/0_0_3734_2241/master/3734.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ee015f6a96d280dea335177ed1f23d1","title":"asleep at wheel japanese rental cars used anything but driving","story":"Surveys shed light on unusual habits of drivers who return cars with zero mileage on clockCar rental companies in Japan have figured out why some customers are returning their vehicles with barely a mile on the clock.Rather than travel from from A to B, as many as one in eight “drivers” are using their rental cars to grab forty winks, catch up on work or even brush up their language skills, according to industry surveys.The unusual habits came to light after Orix Auto found a number of its 230,000 registered users were not driving their rented vehicles, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported.Other rental firms noticed similar anomalies in their customers’ mileage records and approached them hoping to get to the bottom of the mystery.Times24, which has more than 1.2 million registered users, found some clients napped, worked or even used their rented vehicles as storage space for personal belongings when nearby regular lockers were full.The Asahi quoted one respondent, a company worker in his early 30s, as saying: “I rented a car to eat a boxed meal that I bought at a convenience store because I couldn’t find anywhere else to have lunch.”The newspaper cited the ease with which cars could be reserved online, noting that Times24 cars cost as little as 400 yen (£2.95) for half an hour and were available for collection from more than 12,000 locations across Japan.NTT Docomo, which operates a similar service, found in a 2018 survey of 400 customers that one in eight did not rent cars to drive, with most of the non-motoring respondents saying they used them to sleep in or to talk on the phone to family, friends and business clients.Some preferred to take advantage of the peace and quiet to watch TV or practise their singing or spoken English.“Cars can be used as a private space,” a Docomo official told the Asahi. “People used our vehicles in more ways than we expected.”Orix appeared to disapprove of people using its vehicles for anything other than driving, and reminded customers of the environmental harm caused by leaving engines running to power the air conditioning or heating while they snoozed or sang karaoke.“Motorists should shut off their engines when they’re not driving, and we do not recommend that our customers rent vehicles for purposes other than traveling,” an Orix official said, according to the newspaper. “We believe it’s best for our cars to be used for driving.”Orix Auto is one of several companies that allow registered users to reserve cars online and unlock their chosen vehicle with a prepaid card. For a monthly fee of 2,000 yen, the firm offers a standard car for as little as 200 yen for 15 minutes.Anecdotal evidence suggests some users are taking advantage of the service’s low cost and convenience to nap while doing the rounds of client meetings on business trips or to escape bosses and other colleagues during lunch breaks.

Bewildered, he and others were rounded up and brought down to the local armoury.The police then descended on Ianetta’s house, where his wife, Antonia, and son, Guido, watched, frozen with fear, as officers rifled through the family’s belongings for evidence of his political sympathiesA naturalized Canadian citizen whose two brothers were serving in the Canadian military, Michele did not return home that night or the next he was eventually released four years later. He was never accused of any crime.“When something like that like happens, your neighbours look through curtains at what’s going on. There was a great deal of shame involved,” said Susan Iannetta, Michele’s granddaughter.The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, recently reopened bitter memories for Italian Canadians with a promise to formally apologize for what many consider a longstanding injustice: the detention and internment of hundreds of Italian Canadians during the second world war.“We have to face the dark chapter in our country’s history … Italian Canadians have lived with these memories for many years and deserve closure,” he told reporters. “It was a time when their patriotism was questioned and their lives thrown into chaos.”For decades, the Italian community has called on the government to recognize that it acted improperly when it detained hundreds of Italian Canadians, some of whom were Canadian citizens.Canada passed the War Measures Act in June 1940 after Italy declared war on the UK. The statute gave the government wide latitude to carry out surveillance on the estimated 31,000 Italians deemed “enemy aliens” in Canada, as fears of fascist sympathizers took hold.Police quickly cast a wide net: compiling lists of Italian men who were part of known fascist organizations – but also those whose only affiliations were to Italian social clubs.“There likely were some fascists with Italian passports in Canada,” said Raymond Culos, author of Injustice Served, a history of the internment. “The ones that really suffered where those who were just decent Italians living in Canada without any ulterior motive. But in 1940, the allies did not know what the future held.”In total, 634 men were picked up by the police. The average time in detention was 15 months, said Culos.Thousands more were forced to undergo a monthly registration process, checking in with the federal police to verify their address, said Culos. “In the words of one of the people I interviewed: ‘I was mortified.’ This woman she felt she was a Canadian and had been all her life.”Michele was eventually shuttled to Camp Petawawa in Ontario, and later to the city of Fredericton, where most of the men were held. He was unable to see his wife and three children for years – first because of restrictions, and later because of the cost.Michele only began speaking about his experiences in the camp in the two years before he died in 1973, said Susan.The internment of Italian Americans came nowhere near the scope of Japanese Canadian detention, in which the entire population of residents – many of whom were Canadian citizens – were rounded up and sent to detention camps.But Canada apologized to Japanese Americans in 1988 – and provided redress for internment and the seizure of private property – while successive governments have resisted formally apologizing for Italian internment, partly due to fears of liability. In 1990, the then prime minister, Brian Mulroney, offered a “full and unqualified apology for the wrongs done to our fellow Canadians of Italian origin”, but not in parliament. Trudeau’s government says it intends to issue a former apology in parliament, but has not offered a firm timeline.None of the people detained were ever charged with a crime, nor were they given access to a lawyer, said Culos. “Canadians of Italian origin, whose fathers and grandfathers were among those who were incarcerated, could be quite upset. Mr Trudeau’s statement will ease the pain for them, and I think they’re deserving enough of that kind of relief.”Susan Iannetta questioned the aim – and timing – of the apology.“It’s too late,” she said. “You can’t wipe away the shame. You can’t, you can’t do any of that. You can’t give them their lives back. You can’t make it right,” she said.Instead, she would rather the government work to educate the public about the legacy of internment. Years on, she still remembers feeling ashamed of her identity, and seeing neighbours change their names to sound less Italian.“I wouldn’t want anyone coming to this country to ever feel shamed for who they are,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a252b4686c8575708e1bf48a8d820403257e27bc/0_254_3849_2310/master/3849.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aad652e232206dad8cf26ba73b51431c","title":"ebola virus reaches congolese city of goma","story":"Officials in DRC say man taken to treatment centre and bus passengers have been tracedThe Ebola virus has reached the Congolese city of Goma, home to 2 million people and a transport hub for central Africa, for the first time since an epidemic began in the Democratic Republic of the Congo nearly a year ago.The DRC health ministry said a man who had arrived in the regional centre on Sunday had been quickly transported to an Ebola treatment centre.Authorities said they had tracked down all the passengers on the bus the man had taken from Butembo, one of the towns hardest hit by the disease.“Because of the speed with which the patient was identified and isolated, and the identification of all the other bus passengers coming from Butembo, the risk of it spreading in the rest of the city of Goma is small,” the health ministry said.The virus has killed more than 1,600 people in the DRC and two others who returned home across the border to neighbouring Uganda. About 700 people have recovered from infections.The latest official statistics list a total of 2,489 cases, of which 2,395 are confirmed. Twelve new cases were confirmed over the weekend and there were 10 deaths.The confirmed case announced late on Sunday in eastern Congo involves a pastor who became ill on Tuesday and sought treatment at a registered health centre. It is thought he was receiving care from a nurse at his accommodation in Butembo but decided to leave the city, and arrived at a health centre in Goma, North Kivu province, on Sunday showing symptoms of Ebola.The 46-year-old did not show signs of illness at three medical checkpoints on the 18-hour journey, though he gave different names, indicating a desire to hide his identity, officials said. He has now been sent back to Butembo for further care.While in Butembo, the pastor held regular services in seven churches, during which he laid his hands on worshippers, including people who were ill, the health ministry said.Officials called on local communities to take precautions such as washing their hands and avoiding physical contact with anyone suspected of contamination with the virus.The number of people moving around or through the zone worst hit by Ebola has been a big challenge for health services. Another problem has been attacks against health workers and treatment facilities. On Monday the health ministry said two Ebola awareness workers had been killed in the affected zone.Eastern DRC is home to a myriad of armed groups, and Mai Mai militia fighters are active near the hardest-hit towns. Health teams have been unable to access areas affected by violence to vaccinate people at risk of infection and to bring infected patients into isolation.At other times the violence against health teams has come from residents who do not want their loved ones taken to treatment centres or buried in accordance with guidelines aimed at reducing Ebola transmission.Health experts have long feared that the disease could make its way to Goma, which is located on the Rwandan border and is traversed by large numbers of travellers from across a vast area.The health ministries in DRC’s neighbours have been preparing for months for the possibility of cases, and frontline health workers have been vaccinated.While the experimental vaccine is believed to have saved countless lives, not all Congolese people have accepted it. Some falsely believe that the vaccine is what is making people sick, in part because people can still develop the disease after getting the shot if they already had been infected.Peter Piot, who co-discoverer of the Ebola virus and has been a leading authority on the outbreaks since, called for “improved coordination, high-level political support, and urgent unified action” in the handling of the DRC epidemic.Speaking before a high-level United Nations and World Health Organization meeting in Geneva, he said: “There is no evidence that the end of this devastating epidemic is in sight. Rather, there is a real risk that this epidemic could further expand.”Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said it much regretted the decision of the Congolese health minister to rule out the the WHO-recommended use of a second vaccine in North Kivu.“It is hard to understand why such a decision was taken, going so far as to ban any research on investigational Ebola vaccines in the country during this outbreak,” he said. “DRC has been a leader in innovation during Ebola outbreaks, and should remain at the forefront of research and innovation in this area.”LSHTM has been supporting the efforts in DRC to control the virus.Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54cd855fc7cf4698c78a290dc8958cab2026c346/0_414_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb9d811345b9d17174d8431613597727","title":"france demands access to academic fariba adelkhah held in iran","story":"Fariba Adelkhah was arrested in Iran in June for allegedly spying, media reports sayFrance has demanded immediate consular access to a Franco-Iranian dual national arrested in Iran.Fariba Adelkhah, an academic researcher, was arrested in Iran in June by the Revolutionary Guards for allegedly spying, according to media reports at the weekend.“The French authorities in this difficult context have taken steps with Iranian authorities to get information from them on her situation and the conditions of her arrest and asked for consular access,” the foreign ministry said.“No satisfactory response has been given to these requests.

Shortly afterwards, the Indian Space Research Organisation confirmed that the launch had been abandoned for the day.“A technical snag was observed in launch vehicle system at T-56 minute. As a measure of abundant precaution, #Chandrayaan2 launch has been called off for today,” the agency tweeted.A revised launch date will be announced later, it added.The mission has another 10-minute back up window in which it could launch on Tuesday. Chandrayaan-2 is India’s first attempt at a surface landing on the moon - a feat achieved by only Russia, the US and China. If successful, it would also be the first mission to conduct a surface landing on the little-explored lunar south pole region, where scientists hope to collect information about the moon’s mineral and chemical composition, and search for water.The four-tonne spacecraft is equipped with a lunar orbiter, a lander and a rover that is designed to spend two weeks analysing the moon’s surface.The mission comes amid a renewed global interest in moon exploration. In January, a Chinese spacecraft became the first to land on the far side of the moon, while in April, the Israeli spacecraft Beresheet, the first privately funded mission to the moon, crashed after an apparent engine failure.India’s space programmes have been hailed by nationalist prime minister Narendra Modi as a marker of the country’s rising status as a global power. In March, Modi announced the successful test of the country’s first space weapon, an anti-satellite missile. The missile test was criticised by Nasa, who warned it had created dangerous orbital debris.Monday’s attempted launch follows Chandrayaan-1, India’s first lunar mission in 2008, which helped confirm the presence of water on the moon, but did not land on the lunar surface.As well as Chandrayaan-2, India is developing a plan to launch a manned space mission by 2022."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d1f7e272e87aa315a00118f78a96b0dc299c0d7/0_207_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c8b63879952e1fa337e5f76f697b12e","title":"israelis demand education minister resign gay conversion therapy rafi peretz","story":"Hundreds protest in Tel Aviv after Rafi Peretz says gay conversion ‘therapy’ worksHundreds of demonstrators have called on Israel’s new education minister to resign after the far-right politician said he supported gay conversion “therapy” and had even attempted it himself.Ministers and other politicians also condemned Rafi Peretz, a former chief military rabbi who heads a religious nationalist party, who was asked by local Channel 12 news over the weekend whether he believed he could convert gay people to heterosexuality.“I think you can,” he said. “I can tell you that I have a deep knowledge of education, and I have done it too.” He said he had once worked with a student who had told him he was gay, whom he had tried to help “understand himself well and then decide on his own”.The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said he had spoken to Peretz, “who clarified his remarks and stressed the Israeli education system will continue to accept all of Israel’s children as they are”.“The education minister’s remarks about the gay community are not acceptable and do not reflect the stance of the government I head,” he said in a statement.The justice minister, Amir Ohana, the country’s first gay cabinet member, said: “Sexual orientation does not require therapy nor conversion. Preconceived notions and ignorance require therapy and conversion.”Following the outcry, Peretz later said his words had been distorted. “I did not say I support conversion therapy,” he wrote on Facebook.So-called conversion therapy has been widely discredited as unscientific and damaging. One recent survey found attempts to change someone’s sexual orientation led to high levels of mental health problems including suicide attempts, self-harm and eating disorders.Stringent anti-discrimination laws protect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in Israel, and hard-fought efforts for equality mean gay people can serve openly in the military and have adoption rights.Tel Aviv, where hundreds demonstrated against Peretz after his remarks were broadcast, boasts a global reputation as a gay-friendly travel destination and holds a popular annual Pride parade.LGBT activists, however, warn against complacency when same-sex marriage remains illegal, and homophobia and transphobia are widespread, especially in sections of the country’s conservative Jewish and Muslim communities.Netanyahu has publicly promoted LGBT rights while at the same time forging alliances with intolerant political factions. Last year he voted against surrogacy for gay fathers, a proposed law that had angered his ultra-Orthodox allies.The prime minister brought Peretz’s Union of Right Wing Parties into his coalition after 9 April elections in an effort to form a majority government. The attempt ultimately failed, and a second round of voting is due in September.Peretz, popular with Israeli settlers, has also been accused of anti-Arab racism and in the same interview called for Israel to annex the occupied West Bank but deny Palestinians the right to vote.He caused a separate outrage this month over reported comments in which he compared intermarriage between Jews and non-Jews to a second Holocaust.Demonstrators at the Tel Aviv protest carried signs calling him a “homophobic racist”.Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c8c45107feffe1a458436ec8aa36436c13e4f49/0_433_4464_2679/master/4464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f811fdc9640b739ccbe6adc836b4fbce","title":"jacob zuma south africa corruption inquiry","story":"Former president is appearing before committee investigating allegations that he presided over vast corruption networkSouth Africa’s former president Jacob Zuma has told a judicial inquiry into corruption allegations that he is the victim of a plot by foreign intelligence agencies to seek his downfall.Speaking on the first day of five days of testimony, Zuma denied he had presided over an immense system of corruption and patronage that drained billions from the country’s exchequer.Zuma was ousted last year after almost a decade in power, following a bitter internal battle within the ruling African National Congress party. He faces five days of questioning by Raymond Zondo, a senior judge, mandated to investigate allegations of “state capture” in South Africa during his rule.In his first hour before the inquiry, Zuma claimed two foreign intelligence agencies had recruited spies within the ANC as part of a scheme to control South Africa and that the inquiry was designed to smear him.The inquiry was set up after an ombudsman’s report uncovered apparent evidence of improper contact between three wealthy businessmen brothers – Atul, Ajay and Rajesh Gupta – and senior officials in Zuma’s administration.The report, which stopped short of asserting criminal behaviour, called for an investigation into whether Zuma, some of his cabinet members and some state companies acted improperly.Among the cases it reviewed was an allegation by the then deputy finance minister that the Guptas offered to secure him his boss’s job, as well as claims that Zuma directed state firms to award tenders to the Guptas. Zuma has said the three Gupta brothers are his friends but he denies any influence-peddling in their relationship.The inquiry has heard a series of further serious allegations from witnesses in recent months, describing massive bribes paid to officials by businesses seeking favours.Throughout the morning session, the 77-year-old Zuma continued to portray himself as a victim. “I have been provoked and provoked to the last degree … My own family suffers … people forget that I have a family who do not want to hear lies about me”, he said.There have been fears that the veteran politician and former ANC intelligence chief will use the hearings as a platform to attack his successor Cyril Ramaphosa, who forced Zuma from power last year.Ramaphosa led the ANC to a convincing electoral victory in polls in May but has so far been unable to fully assert his authority over the party.Observers say Ramaphosa needs to move quickly to root out entrenched networks of patronage and graft, often involving iniduals who owe senior positions within the party or public administration to Zuma.A quarter of a century after the end of the racist, repressive apartheid system, South Africa remains one of the most unequal societies in the world, with soaring unemployment, a flagging economy and high levels of violent crime. The ANC has been in power since the end of apartheid but is split by a bitter factional struggle.Zuma faces a separate corruption investigation involving 16 charges of fraud, racketeering and money laundering relating to a deal to buy European military hardware to upgrade South Africa’s armed forces in 1994. He denies the charges.The “state capture” inquiry hearings have been broadcast live and attracted large numbers of viewers. The former president’s lawyer, Dan Mantsha, told local TV networks last week that his client was “relishing the moment”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac39f164eeca2bea01e240d6c79cb8631140d799/64_282_4077_2447/master/4077.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5fbc2a62984bc254692a8d50393549e","title":"ursula von der leyen makes final pledges secure eu top job","story":"Candidate to lead European commission seeks to win over MEPs and seal knife-edge voteThe woman seeking to replace Jean-Claude Juncker as the European commission president has made last-minute pledges on the climate crisis, Brexit, an EU minimum wage and gender quotas for company boards as she faces a knife-edge vote on her candidacy.In leaked letters to the leaders of two of the EU parliament’s main political groups, Ursula von der Leyen, who was nominated two weeks ago by the heads of state and government for the top EU post, has sought to win over critical left-leaning MEPs at the risk of alienating some on the right.The German defence minister’s candidacy is facing opposition from the Social Democrats (SPD) in her own country, the greens and the hard left, among others, in the vote on Tuesday evening in which she needs to secure an absolute majority to become the first ever female commission president.Some are opposed to Von der Leyen on the grounds that she is not one of the spitzenkandidaten, or lead candidates, who campaigned ahead of May’s European elections to head up the EU’s executive branch.The Spitzenkandidaten process is a method by which the European Parliament seeks to influence who is appointed as President of the European Commission\u0026nbsp- a role held from 2014 to 2019 by Jean-Claude Juncker.Under the process, each political grouping in the European Parliament proposes one \u0027lead candidate\u0027 to take the role. The presidency subsequently goes to the political party winning the most seats, or the one that brings together the widest coalition of support for their candidate.However, this is not a formal process set out in any treaty or constitution. The candidate for the role is nominated by the European Council, made up of the leaders of the EU member states. They are able to ignore the Spitzenkandidaten nomination and to chose someone else. The appointment has to be subsequently ratified by the European Parliament though, and therefore choosing an alternative candidate risks provoking conflict between the institutions.Her patchy record as a defence minister has also been raised by the SPD in a dossier circulated among MEPs as a reason why Von der Leyen is “an inadequate and unsuitable candidate” to lead the commission for the next five years.Von der Leyen, a close ally of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who has the backing of the centre-right European People’s party, will make a speech to the European parliament on Tuesday morning before MEPs cast their vote in the early evening but it is far from clear that she will be able to secure the backing of the 374 parliamentarians needed for her to take the post from 1 November.Should she fail to win enough votes the EU would be left in uncharted territory, with the parliament pitted against the leaders on the issue of commission presidency, and with few easy fixes available.Von der Leyen’s selection, after 50 hours of negotiations among the 28 leaders, was just one part of a package in which candidates were also chosen as presidents of the European council and European Central Bank, in which political affiliation, geography and gender had to be balanced. Sources said an emergency summit for 23 July was being planned in case of her rejection.If Von der Leyen passed the 374 threshold but failed to receive the backing of 400 MEPs there would be questions over her ability to lead the EU’s policy agenda given the fragility of her majority.In letters to the Socialists and Democrats and the liberal group, Renew Europe, sent on Monday and obtained by the , Von der Leyen has pledged to give parliament a role in initiating legislation and says she will push forward on stalled progressive policies on climate change, wages and gender equality.She has committed to setting “quotas on gender balance on company boards”, a policy first proposed by the commission in 2012, and to establishing a “legal instrument to ensure that every worker in our union has a fair minimum wage that allows them a decent living in the country they work in”.She has backed the proposal from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for a “carbon border tax” which would hit companies that want to trade in the EU but are based in countries that do not live up to the bloc’s environmental standards.Von der Leyen, 60, who has previously spoken of her support for the idea of a “United States of Europe”, has also called for greater burden sharing when it comes to immigration, in a thinly veiled criticism of the failure of some central and eastern European states to take in asylum seekers.On Brexit she insists that the current withdrawal agreement – described as “defunct” by the likely next UK prime minister, Boris Johnson – is the “best and only deal possible for an orderly withdrawal”. On an extension of the UK’s membership beyond 31 October, she says she would be in support “if good reasons are provided”.Von der Leyen says in her letters that she hopes the “snapshot” on her positions, some of which are retreads of previous proposals from the commission, will reassure her critics, although there is a risk of putting off MEPs within the more Eurosceptic and rightwing European Conservatives and Reformists group, in which Poland’s Law and Justice is the largest party.Portugal’s socialist prime minister António Costa tweeted that Von der Leyen’s letter contained sufficient reassurance for left-wing MEPs to give her their support, describing them as “positive commitments”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Dubliner Damien Gray (35) pleads guilty to having drugs worth \u0026euro6,000 for saleThe legend of St Swithin would suggest a fine summer but forecasters are not convincedMichael Brady (54) found with drugs at apartment in Co Kildare in January 2017\u0026lsquoWe\u0026rsquoll grieve and we\u0026rsquoll laugh\u0026rsquo, chief celebrant Fr Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy tells mournersA cordon banning heavy goods vehicles has been in place since 2007Declan Brady pleaded guilty to storing a range of guns and ammunition in Co DublinIsland with centuries-old monastic settlement is on sale for \u0026euro1.25 millionTrial heard Keith Murtagh\u0026rsquos DNA was found on shotgun cartridge in car used by raidersUsually dignified members of the legal profession \u0026lsquolose absolute control of themselves\u0026rsquoBaroness O\u0026rsquoLoan and Lord Eames challenge attempts to liberalise legislationGovernment urged to cease \u0026lsquoharrowing\u0026rsquo practice of locking up people with severe mental illnessPatient advocate Lorraine Walsh says HSE and department are not being forthcomingWoman passenger seriously injured in separate motorcycle crash in Co DonegalGarda\u0026iacute investigating \u0026lsquosuspected criminal damage by fire\u0026rsquo at Castletymon RoadIrishman failed to secure residency in America over marijuana possession in IrishKeith Byrne detained by US immigrations officials on way to workEast coast growth and climate challenge supply system little changed since 1893T\u0026aacutenaiste says claims of disinformation on North and Brexit came from \u0026lsquoreputable\u0026rsquo body"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3957051.1563199380!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dubliners can now use app to check if trucks have permit to drive in city","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDublin City Council head of technical services Brendan O’ Brien and DMR Traffic Garda acting chief superintendent Tom Murphy with Lord Mayor of Dublin Paul Mc Auliffe at the launch of the HGV Permit Checker App. Photograph: Conor McCabe Photography.Members of the public can now download a smartphone app that allows them to report heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) for driving in central Dublin without having a valid permit to do so. The HGV Permit Checker enables the public and gardaí to see if vehicles with five or more axles are entitled to be in the city or are breaching a ban introduced more than a decade ago. Shortly after the opening of the Dublin Port Tunnel trucks with five axles or more were prohibited from passing through a city centre cordon, roughly bounded by the two canals, in an attempt to improve traffic flow and the environment in central Dublin. There is a prohibition on these vehicles travelling within the cordon between 7am and 7pm daily. A limited permit for vehicles that breach the rule but need to loadunload within the city is available for €10. Dublin City Council says it issues an average of 80 such permits a day. HGV drivers who enter the designated area without a valid permit can be fined €800. Brendan O’Brien, Dublin City Council’s head of technical services, said the HGV cordon had been “very successful” over the last 12 years but there were will still locations “where trucks are coming in that don’t have permits”. “We could put in an extensive camera network throughout the city but we’ll never cover every single road,” he said. Data“We’re part of an EU project called Be-Good which is all about opening up public data and making it available to the public. So we’ve opened up the data about what truck has a permit and the public are being invited then to use it and to help us with the overall enforcement which is good for everybody.”He said that since there had been an increase in construction work around the city and he saw “a lot of 5 axle trucks, cement lorries and that around” and that he would like to be able to check whether they have the permits or not. “Heretofore, the problem we had was that when we checked with our own communications whether a truck had a or a permit or not, if we got it back negative and pulled over the truck they would have had the facility to apply for the permit and it was issued immediately,” he said. “This new app has a built in delay so when we check the truck and pull them over, they won’t have that facility anymore and they face prosecution.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3956308.1563131963!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irishman held in us prepares to spend weeks behind bars says father","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKeith Byrne with his wife Keran.

He said he made a stupid mistake 15 years ago and he is paying for it now.”Keith (37) from Fermoy, Co Cork, was arrested by US Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) officers in Montgomery County, outside Philadelphia, while travelling to work - a painting and decorating business he has built up over the last five years - on Wednesday.The father-of-three’s family say he has been living and working legally in the US since 2007 but lost a recent appeal against a refusal to grant him residency because of two separate charges of personal use of cannabis on his record from when he was younger in Ireland.“It was only a stupid error he made - he got fined, for God’s sake,” his father Jim told The .“And, now, he is paying the ultimate price.”Officials asked Mr Byrne in prison to sign a form in recent days which would have him deported to Ireland within 48 hours, but he refused and will have to remain locked up until he is seen by a judge, his father said.He expects this could prolong the process by two or three weeks.“Keith has a hell of a lot to fight for - he has an awful lot to lose,” he added.Mr Byrne has phoned his father every weekend since going to the US in 2007 - “I’ve often cursed him on a Sunday for phoning me when the match is on.” - and was always “happy and jolly” about the life he had built for himself and his family, his father said.Being forced to return to Ireland would “devastate” his family and “destroy” his business.“He was getting on great. He gave his first party in his new house for the 4th of July this year - he was living the American dream really,” he said.“He had spent a lot of time on the house, he was sending me pictures of all the work he was doing to it. He didn’t expect this. He had high hopes he would get a Green Card. A friend of his who was there 15 or 16 years eventually got a Green Card and that really boosted Keith.”Mr Byrne’s father said he was worried about his son having to return to Ireland.Mr Byrne’s mother Mary was in a car accident late last year and is still getting hospital treatment for her injuries.“This is the last thing she needed. She is not taking this well,” he said.Mr Byrne’s family in Fermoy are to meet with local TD Sean Sherlock on Monday.Mr Sherlock has called on Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney as well as the Government to “urgently” intervene to seek Mr Byrne’s release and return to his family.“His case highlights the precariousness of Irish people who have settled in the US, who have no legal status but who are contributing to society,” said Mr Sherlock.“It is vital that his case is raised at the highest political level to seek to have him released on humanitarian grounds.“He poses no threat to anyone. His wife and children are beside themselves with worry. A political intervention by the Minister for Foreign Affairs would certainly assist matters at this stage. “Mr Byrne’s family contend that he was never an undocumented immigrant, and when his visa expired he alerted authorities with a view to regularising his situation."},{"url":null,"title":"salesman trapped as car driven into the sea","story":"A CAR salesman who became trapped underwater in a car after a customer drove the vehicle off a pier has told an inquest he only realised when they were “going over the side” that the man was “on a suicide mission”, an inquest heard yesterday.Richard Byrne (45), Chanel Road, Artane, Dublin 5, drowned after he drove a red Mini Cooper he was test-driving into the sea off the middle pier in Howth on July 13th, 2010.Jeremy Beshoff, owner of Beshoff Ltd car sales, Howth, was a front seat passenger in the car at the time and managed to escape from the submerged vehicle and swim to the surface.Recalling the episode at Dublin City Coroner’s Court yesterday, Mr Beshoff said Mr Byrne reversed the car on the middle pier in Howth before letting the clutch out and accelerating hard.“We went straight over the side between two boats,” he said.“This happened so quickly I only realised when we were going over the side that Mr Byrne was on a suicide mission.”Mr Beshoff made an attempt to push against the door with his body and the car began rapidly filling with water. He then made a second attempt to escape. “I knew I only had a couple of seconds before I would not be able to breathe. I then pushed the side of my arm and elbow and all my body strength against the window, and when the car was at the bottom the window broke,” he said.He got out through the door and swam to the surface, where a man, Joseph Caulfield, pulled him out of the water. “I was stunned and explained to Joe that the driver was still in the car and I felt it was deliberate and he tried to kill me,” said Mr Beshoff, who did not know Mr Byrne and had never met him before.The inquest heard Mr Byrne had pressed the control locking the doors before driving off the pier. When questioned by the coroner, Dr Brian Farrell, Mr Beshoff said he did not think this locking of the doors had been deliberate.He said he had had no concerns about Mr Byrne during the test-drive.The coroner commended Mr Beshoff for his presence of mind in escaping, and described it as a “really harrowing incident”.He said: “I’m really very sorry to hear what happened here. You could have lost your life and I hope you’ve been able to come to terms with this.”The businessman said he had “just about” been able to do so.Mr Byrne, who had a history of depression and who had issues with self harm and suicide ideation in the past, was taken from the water by a er.A postmortem found the married man, who had been separated from his wife for about a year, had died of drowning. He had two young children.Dr Farrell recorded a verdict of death by suicide. “What isn’t really explained is why Richard should have involved Mr Beshoff at all. It’s unusual to say the least – with this type of incident – to involve a complete stranger,” he said.Dublin City Coroner’s Court heard Mr Byrne took the red Mini Cooper for a 10-minute test drive on his own on the afternoon of July 13th, and then returned to tell Mr Beshoff he thought there was something wrong with the reverse gear and that he needed “to come down on the pier bit”.Mr Beshoff said he would go for a drive with Mr Byrne, and Mr Byrne could show him what was wrong with the gear.During the drive Mr Byrne told the businessman he was going to buy the car for his wife for her birthday.Mr Beshoff said he would be happy to hold the car for him until the day of her birthday.Garda Sgt Colm McConnell, now retired, said the deceased intentionally drove off the pier, but why Mr Beshoff had been involved was not explained.He said Mr Byrne may have forgotten someone was in the car with him. Mr Byrne was keen on cars and had taken cars on test drives in the past, he added.The inquest heard there was an incident a year earlier on Howth Hill where the deceased was in a car and had the idea of driving into the water. “It was a matter under investigation for us and was coming to a head for us,” Mr McConnell said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3956418.1563122902!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"maureen dowd alexandria ocasio cortez going after wrong target","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez: engaged in  a tangle  with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that poses a threat to the Democrats’ ability to beat President Donald Trump next year. Photograph: Anna MoneymakerNew York TimesI was feeling on edge. Writing a column that sparks an internecine fight among the highest-profile women in the Democratic Party is nerve-wracking.So I went to the gym. Alex Toussaint, the digital Peloton instructor inside the little screen on my spinning bike, had some wisdom for me – the kind of New Age bromide dispensed in spin classes everywhere:You climb the mountain to see the world. You don’t climb the mountain so the world can see you.I only wished AOC was cycling alongside me to hear it as well.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ensorcelled me from the start. I loved the bartender-makes-good Cinderella story, the shake-up-the-capital idealistic dreams, the bravado about how the plutocrat president from Queens wouldn’t know how to deal with a Puerto Rican girl from the Bronx.And I imagined the most potent feminist partnership in American history: Nancy Pelosi as sensei, bringing her inside game, and AOC, the Karate Kid with a wicked Twitter game.But instead, the 79-year-old speaker and the 29-year-old freshman are trapped in a generational and ideological tangle that poses a real threat to the Democrats’ ability to beat Donald Trump next year.Pelosi told me, after the AOC squad voted against the house’s version of the border Bill and trashed the moderates – the very people who provided the Democrats the majority – that the squad was four people with four votes. She was talking about a legislative reality. If it was a knock, it was for abandoning the party.That did not merit AOC’s outrageous accusation that Pelosi was targeting “newly elected women of colour”. She slimed the speaker, who has spent her life fighting for the downtrodden and who was instrumental in getting the first African-American president elected and passing his agenda against all odds, as a sexist and a racist.AOC should consider the possibility that people who disagree with her do not disagree with her colour.The young lawmaker went further, implying that the speaker was putting the squad in danger, asking why Pelosi would criticise them, “knowing the amount of death threats” and attention they get. Huh?‘Defensive posture’AOC pulled back and said she wasn’t calling Pelosi a racist. But once you start that ball rolling, it’s hard to stop. (You know how topsy-turvy the fight is when the biggest defenders of Pelosi, who has endured being a caricature of extreme liberalism for decades, are Trump and the Wall Street Journal editorial board.)The AOC crew threw down the gauntlet in a recent opinion piece in the Washington Post by the Intercept’s Ryan Grim. He wrote that when Pelosi and other Democratic mandarins try to keep the image of the party centrist, they are crouching in “the defensive posture” they’ve been in since the Reagan revolution.Corbin Trent, a spokesman for AOC and co-founder of Justice Democrats, the progressive group that helped propel her, told Grim: “The greatest threat to mankind is the cowardice of the Democratic Party”, with the older generation “driven by fear” and “unable to lead”.Message: Pelosi is past her prime.And then there’s the real instigator, Saikat Chakrabarti, AOC’s 33-year-old chief of staff, who co-founded Justice Democrats and Brand New Congress, both of which recruited progressives – including AOC – to run against moderates in Democratic primaries. The former Silicon Valley Bernie Bro assumed he could apply Facebook’s mantra, “Move fast and break things,” to one of the oldest institutions in the country.Wrong vs badBut Congress is not a place where you achieve radical progress – certainly not in ided government. It’s a place where you work at it and work at it and don’t get everything you want.The progressives act as though anyone who dares disagree with them is bad. Not wrong, but bad, guilty of some human failing, some impurity that is a moral evil that justifies their venom.Chakrabarti sent shock waves through the Democratic caucus when he posted a tweet about the border Bill comparing moderate and Blue Dog Democrats – some of whom are black – to southern segregationists in the 1940s.Rahm Emanuel told me Chakrabarti is “a snot-nosed punk” who has no idea about the battle scars Pelosi bears from the liberal fights she has led.“What votes did you get?” Emanuel said, rhetorically challenging AOC’s chief of staff. “You should only be so lucky to learn from somebody like Nancy who has shown incredible courage and who has twice returned the Democratic Party to power.“We fought for years to create the majorities to get a Democratic president elected and re-elected, and they’re going to dither it away. They have not decided what’s more important: Do they want to beat Trump or do they want to clear the moderate and centrists out of the party? You really think weakening the speaker is the right strategy to try to get rid of Donald Trump and everything he stands for?”In the age of Trump, there is no more stupid proposition than that Nancy Pelosi is the problem. If AOC and her Pygmalions and acolytes decide that burning down the house is more important than deposing Trump, they will be left with a racist backward president and the emotional satisfaction of their own purity."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3956960.1563174679!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us immigration raids begin on smaller scale than planned","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA protester holds a sign reading ‘Abolish ICE’ in front of the politan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles, California. Photograph: Etienne LaurentEPAA small number of coordinated federal raids targeting undocumented migrant parents and their children took place in the US over the weekend.It marks the beginning of the Trump administration’s plan to swiftly enforce deportation orders against some 2,000 recently arrived migrants who are not eligible to remain in the country.Only a handful of arrests appeared to take place, and they were reported in just a few cities. That was much different from the nationwide show of force that had originally been planned, in which immigration agents were expected to fan out in unison Sunday morning across immigrant communities in major cities. Authorities said more arrests would follow through the week.The plans for the operation were changed at the last minute because of news reports that had tipped off immigrant communities about what to expect, according to officials. Instead of a large simultaneous sweep, the authorities created a secondary plan for a smaller and more diffuse scale of apprehensions to roll out over roughly a week. Inidual Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field offices were given the discretion to decide when to begin, one official said.Though millions of people live in the United States without documentation and are periodically targeted for deportation, the latest raids are aimed primarily at families from Central America who have been arriving in large numbers since fall. With Mr Trump repeatedly thwarted in his attempts to slow the ongoing surge, the raids aim to deport parents and children who are not eligible to stay in the country - some within months after their arrival - as a way to deter others from coming.Immigration authorities planned to continue making arrests throughout the week in at least 10 cities. They had identified at least 2,000 targets for the raids, but may ultimately arrest fewer. Typically, only 20 to 30 per cent of the targets of ICE enforcement are apprehended. And because agents cannot legally force their way in to the homes of their targets, they rely on the element of surprise to be successful - suggesting that the current, highly publicised raids could result in even fewer arrests than usual.The operation was originally scheduled for late June, but it was postponed after harsh opposition from Democratic lawmakers and immigrant advocates. Mr Trump confirmed Friday that it would go ahead over the weekend. “They’re going to take people out, and they’re going to bring them back to their countries,” the president said. “Or they’re going to take criminals out, put them in prison, or put them in prison in the countries they came from.” Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, told “Fox \u0026amp Friends” on Sunday that the operation was intended to enforce the rule of law. “Those iniduals who remain here illegally, especially those who’ve received due process more than any other nation in the world would provide someone that came here illegally, to include those with final orders, that there are consequences to those that remain here illegally,” he said.Read more about the Donald Trump

ten students get less ddd a level leave university top","story":" 69 per cent of students with DDD at A-level went on to graduate with either a first class or upper second degreeUniversities have been warned over degree class inflation as an analysis reveals that seven in ten students who get less than DDD grades at A-level go on to graduate with top degrees.  Of the 3,025 students who went to university last year after achieving less than DDD, 69 per cent went on to graduate with either a first class or upper second degree.  This is seven per cent higher than the previous year, and a 73 per cent increase since 201011, according to a major report published on Thursday by the Office for Students (OfS).    Those who left school with less than DDD last year were four times more likely to graduate with a first class degree compared to seven years ago, the data showed.  The watchdog noted in its report that it had observed the “greatest increase in attainment” in degree outcomes for those who left school with less than DDD in their A-levels or the equivalent.  The Education Secretary urged universities to take “rapid action” so that degree class inflation is “stamped out”.  He called the figures “disappointing”, adding that they “risk compromising the public trust in the high standards of our universities”.  The Education Secretary urged universities to take “rapid action”Damian Hinds said that quality in higher education must be protected “at all costs” and called on the regulator to demand that universities with unjustified rises provide evidence of what they are doing about it.     The OfS analysed the degrees awarded by 148 universities in England between 201011 and 201718.  It found that four in five of all students (79 per cent) now graduate with either a first or upper second class degree, up from 29 per cent seven years ago.  Almost a third (29 per cent) are awarded a first class degree compared to 16 per cent in 201011. After controlling for factors such as students working harder and improvements in teaching, the OfS said that 13.9 per cent of the increase in first class degrees remained unaccounted for.  The higher education watchdog has previously threatened institutions with sanctions, including fines or even de-registration, if they fail to take action over the issue.Institutions found to be artificially inflating their grades can be hit with sanctions by the OfS, including fines or even stripping them of their status as a university. Secondary legislation will be passed later this year to beef up the regulator\u0027s powers and allow it to levy fines of whichever is greater out of £500,000 or two per cent of the university\u0027s income.   Susan Lapworth, director of competition and registration at the OfS, warned that concerns over grade inflation “threaten to devalue a university education in the eyes of employers and potential students”. She said that the OfS will contact universities with the most significant and unexplained increases in degree classification.A committee of vice-Chancellors and other sector leaders reviewed ways to tackle grade inflation and published a “statement of intent” in May which set out their plans to tackle the issue.They agreed that “strong and decisive action” was needed to tackle perceptions that degrees are being “dumbed down”.Chris Hale, director of policy at Universities UK, said: “It is important not to forget that students working harder, improvements in teaching, investment in academic support and widening participation initiatives are also all leading to legitimate grade improvement and such improvements are to be celebrated,” he said.Tory leadership latest: Jeremy Hunt warns voters not to assume Boris Johnson will be next

cancels launch second moon mission hours blast off","story":"A \u0026#34technical snag\u0026#34 in the launch system was blamed for the cancellationThe launch of India\u0027s second ever lunar mission has been cancelled less than an hour before its blast-off due to technical issues.The Chandrayaan-2 – which cost $150 million (£119 million) – was set to become the first satellite to land on the Moon’s south pole.It was scheduled to launch from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, which is situated on an island off the coast of the south-east state of Andhra Pradesh, at 2.51 am local time.  The ISRO is expected to give more detail about the issue and announce a new launch date in due course. A soft landing on the Moon refers to the touchdown and deployment of a device on the Moon’s surface which can be used to relay information back to the Earth.Only three nations have completed a “soft landing” so far.The former Soviet Union was the first country to successfully land a spacecraft on the Moon in 1966, followed mere months later by the United States.The two nations rivaled one another through their exploration of the Moon until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, in a period known as the “Space Race”.The Chandrayaan-2 as it prepared for lift off this morningRapid economic growth in China saw the country fund its first successful “soft landing” in 2013 and India has been keen to follow suit, seeing the landing of a craft on the moon as evidence that it has joined the global elite.An Israeli “soft landing” attempt in April was also unsuccessful.In total, there are now 72 different government space agencies - increasingly in developing countries like Algeria, Bolivia and Sri Lanka - as nations place more importance on establishing a presence in space and defending their interests, such as through spy satellitesThe Chandrayaan-2 contained two key research components. An orbiter was planning to circle the moon for around a year, taking pictures of its surface and sending back detail about its atmosphere.A solar-powered rover was then to explore the surface around the Moon’s unknown south pole, looking for the existence of water and other minerals.The Indian space programme has long attracted criticism since its inception in 1962. Yet, for many Indians the programme is seen as a great source of national pride with almost all of the Chandrayaan-2’s components built in India. In March, Modi announced that the country had become a ‘space superpower’ after his forces successfully shot down a low-orbit satellite. The Prime Minister also promised he would launch a manned mission into space by 2022 and land a probe on Mars.Tory leadership latest: Jeremy Hunt warns voters not to assume Boris Johnson will be next leader Council closes luxury £1m mansion used to host wild hen and stag partiesComment: Smug North Londoners who smoke weed with their kids are the most dangerous kind of snobComment: No, of course you shouldn\u0026#39t need a degree to show someone round a houseEngland celebrate winning the 2019 Cricket World Cup final at The OvalSolicitor in four year wheelie bin row with doctor is cleared of harassmentThe greatest British play of the century: why Jez Butterworth\u0026#39s Jerusalem is a masterpieceSainsbury\u0026#39s accused of \u0026#39devaluing house prices\u0026#39 in Kent village Dealer who sold chemsex drugs to serial killer Stephen Port convicted of Bond actor\u0026#39s murderFour children arrested after stealing parents\u0026#39 SUV and driving across Australian outbackBoris Johnson\u0026#39s Brexit plan – and what Europe might make of itWatch: Hong Kong protesters clash with riot police after more than a month of unrestNew £50 note design sees Alan Turing become first LGBT person on a UK banknoteBan the use of controversial gagging orders to silence whistleblowers, MPs demand Jeremy Hunt warns Iran could spark nuclear arms race in the Middle EastSt Swithin\u0026#39s Day 2019: How a Saxon bishop\u0026#39s ire supposedly led to 40 days of rainAu revoir to Les Miserables in the West End – there\u0026#39s still nothing like itEbola spreads to largest city yet in DR CongoPopulist China-friendly mayor to face President Tsai Ing-wen in Taiwan election clashComment: Better four good friends, Ed Sheeran, than 100 you can never get rid ofWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 15 july 2019","story":"Eoin Morgan of England lifts the Cricket World Cup Trophy during the Final of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 between New Zealand and England at Lord\u0027s Cricket Ground Tory leadership latest: Jeremy Hunt warns voters not to assume Boris Johnson will be next leader Council closes luxury £1m mansion used to host wild hen and stag partiesComment: Smug North Londoners who smoke weed with their kids are the most dangerous kind of snobComment: No, of course you shouldn\u0026#39t need a degree to show someone round a houseEngland celebrate winning the 2019 Cricket World Cup final at The OvalSolicitor in four year wheelie bin row with doctor is cleared of harassmentThe greatest British play of the century: why Jez Butterworth\u0026#39s Jerusalem is a masterpieceSainsbury\u0026#39s accused of \u0026#39devaluing house prices\u0026#39 in Kent village Dealer who sold chemsex drugs to serial killer Stephen Port convicted of Bond actor\u0026#39s murderFour children arrested after stealing parents\u0026#39 SUV and driving across Australian outbackBoris Johnson\u0026#39s Brexit plan – and what Europe might make of itWatch: Hong Kong protesters clash with riot police after more than a month of unrestNew £50 note design sees Alan Turing become first LGBT person on a UK banknoteIndia cancels launch of second moon mission hours before blast-offBan the use of controversial gagging orders to silence whistleblowers, MPs demand Jeremy Hunt warns Iran could spark nuclear arms race in the Middle EastSt Swithin\u0026#39s Day 2019: How a Saxon bishop\u0026#39s ire supposedly led to 40 days of rainAu revoir to Les Miserables in the West End – there\u0026#39s still nothing like itEbola spreads to largest city yet in DR CongoPopulist China-friendly mayor to face President Tsai Ing-wen in Taiwan election clashWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/opinion/2019/01/02/TELEMMGLPICT000179581235_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=","title":"shoddy unfinished sold powerful oligopoly britains new build","story":"New homes on a housing developmentBuying a new property is “less stressful than buying a second-hand home”, Persimmon tells prospective customers on its website. “We pledge to make the experience enjoyable,” says the UK’s second-biggest housebuilder. “We’ll take care of you, not just when you’re buying but after you’ve moved in”.The firm, however, has been widely criticised after repeated accusations of building sub-standard homes, as well as for the £75 million pay packet of CEO Jeff Fairburn, who left last year.

Equivalent to £98.Turing played a pivotal role in the development of early computers with his work cracking\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspEnigma code, and he laid the foundations for artificial intelligence. Despite his enormous achievements, he faced persecution during his life because he was gay. Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts after it was revealed\u0026nbsphe was in a same-sex relationship.Faced with the prospect of imprisonment, he accepted the alternative of “chemical castration” – hormone treatment supposed to suppress his sexual desire. He died of cyanide poisoning in 1954 at the age of 41. The mathematician’s housekeeper found him in his bed with a half-eaten apple on a table. His death was recorded as suicide but experts have since questioned the evidence presented during the inquest at the time.In 2009, then prime minister Gordon Brown made an official apology\u0026nbspfor\u0026nbspthe “appalling way” Turing was treated, and in 2013 he was granted a posthumous pardon by the Queen. In 2016 the government unveiled an “Alan Turing law” that posthumously pardoned thousands of gay and bisexual men convicted under outdated gross indecency laws.Alan Turing: Why was the codebreaker convicted and pardoned?The law effectively acted as an apology to those convicted for consensual same-sex relationships before homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales in 1967. It came after decades of campaigning from the LGBT+\u0026nbspcommunity and after the family of the Enigma codebreaker delivered a petition to Downing Street before the 2015 general election.The new note will feature a 1951 photo of Turing, a table and mathematical formulae from one of his most influential scientific papers.\u0026nbspIt will also feature a picture of the British Bombe code-breaking machine built at Bletchley Park, as well as a quote Turing gave\u0026nbspin an interview on 11 June 1949: “This is only a foretaste of what is to come\u0026nbspand only the shadow of what is going to be.”The full note design, including all the security features, will be unveiled closer to it entering circulation. The shortlisted characters, or pairs of characters, considered for the new note were Mary\u0026nbspAnning, Paul Dirac, Rosalind Franklin, William Herschel and Caroline Herschel, Dorothy Hodgkin, Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage, Stephen Hawking, James Clerk Maxwell,\u0026nbspSrinivasa\u0026nbspRamanujan, Ernest Rutherford, Frederick Sanger and Alan Turing.Sarah John, the BoE’s chief cashier, said: “The strength of the shortlist is testament to the UK’s incredible scientific contribution. The breadth of iniduals and achievements reflects the huge range of nominations we received for this note and I\u0026nbspthank the public for all their suggestions of scientists we could celebrate.”RBS £10 note with pioneering female figure to be released in OctoberNew £10 with tactile features hailed as ‘fantastic’ for blind peopleI helped judge the BBC’s Icons vote – so where were all the women?Icons review: Alan Turing crowned greatest figure of 20th centuryThis is why Alan Turing’s work could help improve tests for cancerThe new note will be printed on plastic rather than paper as is the current version.At the outbreak of the Second World War, Turing moved to the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park where he designed the British Bombe cryptographic machine. Turing’s team played a pivotal role in cracking the German Enigma code, previously seen as unbreakable. They decoded naval and U-boat messages, which revealed information about German positions and helped to shift advantage to the allies during the battle for the Atlantic. Turing was awarded an OBE for his code-breaking work.After the war\u0026nbspTuring worked on designs for pioneering early computers including the Automatic Computing Engine, one of the first electronic stored-programme computers, which was built in 1950 at the National Physical Laboratory in London. At Manchester University’s computing laboratory\u0026nbsphe developed programming for the Ferranti Mark 1 computer, the world’s first commercially available electronic computer.While at Manchester\u0026nbsphe explored artificial intelligence, proposing an experiment which became known as the Turing Test. A machine could be considered able to “think”\u0026nbspif a human interrogator was unable to distinguish a machine’s response from that of another human being. He also worked on morphogenetic theory, looking at the mysteries of patterns in nature, for example trying to explain the existence of Fibonacci numbers in plant structures. His paper, “The chemical basis of morphogenesis”, has since been recognised as pioneering work.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As soon as they dropped down onto the surface, they had to carry out one of their most important missions: scooping up bits of the Moon and bringing it back down to Earth.The difficulty of doing so was one of the things that occupied the scientists and the astronauts that carried out the mission.But the fact they were able to was a discovery that helped inform discoveries about the origin of the solar system and perhaps one day of life. Those rocks help inform research even to this day.When Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin arrived on the Moon, picking\u0026nbspup the rocks in the first place proved very difficult. The astronauts were wearing huge pressure suits, which made it very difficult to move around at all and even harder to bend down.To solve those problems, they were given special tools, not unlike the tongs used to pick up litter back on Earth, as well as rakes . That meant they could scoop up and pick up the rocks without having to contend with the difficulty of getting near the floor.Created with Sketch.Apollo 11\u0027s historic first moon landing - In pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Edwin \u0027Buzz\u0027 Aldrin walking on the moon in an iconic image taken by \u0027Apollo 11\u0027 commander and first man on the moon, Neil Armstrong, on 20 July 1969. 2019 marks the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing, an event seen as the peak of the United States\u0027 space program of the 1960s which put an end to the so-called \u0027Race to Space\u0027 between the Cold War rivals the US and the Soviet Union.

The photographs were taken next to another tool that was carried up to the moon, which was placed next to the rock and so allowed anyone looking at it to understand what size and colour it was.As well as the photographs, astronauts had to go through a detailed checklist that was attached to their arms. It reminded them to take full details of the samples, ensuring the scientists on Earth had as much information as they could when the rocks were returned.The places on Earth that look like the moonThe astronauts then took the samples and loaded them into boxes in the lunar module, ready for its ascent stage to take them all back to the Apollo command module and head back down to Earth.After they came back, scientists got to work examining the rocks. Among other things, they found that the new samples might be the oldest ever held by humanity: some of them are nearly 4.5 billion years old, much older than the rocks on Earth.Some of the samples are still sealed up, lying untouched and exactly as they were the day they were taken from the Moon.But they also proved a useful diplomatic tool, too. The US sent out samples of the rock to dozens of different countries, creating 250 lunar sample displays that could be sent around the world to various countries.Each of them had a tiny amount of Moon dust – some 0.05 grams – which came as four little pieces. The presentation boxes also included the flag of the nation that had been sent to them, and included a flag that had been carried to the Moon on board the lander.They each bore an inscription that made clear that they had been given to the people of the country by Richard Nixon, President of the United States of America.This Flag of Your Nation was Carried to the Moon and Back by Apollo 11 and This Fragment of the Moon\u0027s Surface was Brought to Earth by the Crew of That First Manned Lunar Landing, it said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

US President Richard Nixon (right) welcoming the \u0027Apollo 11\u0027 astronauts (left-right) Armstrong, Collins and Aldrin confined to the Mobile Quarantine Facility aboard the USS Hornet.They were worried about the black market in moon rocks and so they had these rules about storage facilities and they also had very careful legal contracts so that we couldn\u0027t sell them, Dr Turner told PA.They sent security people round to check how you\u0027re looking after them and a lot of my samples were held in glassware.How Apollo 11 astronauts got Moon rocks that could show our originsWe had to have a safe and I had an alarm system on them.When the first ones arrived I spoke with a local safe person to lend me a safe and fix it up so that it would contact the police if someone tried to break into it but we just did that until we got our own safe.We had to keep a very strict list of when samples were split into different amounts one way or another and we had this great long table of the sequence of events.That wasn\u0027t a problem until you had to send things back and you had to fill in all these forms.They weren\u0027t difficult, they just wanted to make sure that there wasn\u0027t a black market.I think there have been examples when some have been sold and they have got onto it pretty quickly.Dr Turner was in his 30s when he enlisted to work out the age of rocks taken from the moon by astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin during the Apollo 11 landing in July 1969, a moment that propelled his career and led to him being elected to the prestigious Royal Society in 1980.The thing I was measuring was the age, he explained.The basalts which are from the mare regions, the so-called seas, they range from 3.2 billion up to 3.8 billion, but this was a major period of volcanic activity on the moon and after that the amount of volcanic activity decreased.The scientist, who believes he is only one of two original principal investigators from the UK still living, decided to put the soot-like moon dust that he had also received on display in a Sheffield museum, attracting more than 34,000 people.I wasn\u0027t interested in the soil, that would just screw my equipment up, he explained.All I did with the soil is put it on display for a short time in the local museum, I didn\u0027t have it on for very long because it was a pain collecting it every day and putting it into the safe.The crowd was absolutely astonishing, people trailed all the way around the inside the museum and out onto the street and around the park next to the museum, waiting to see this bit of dirt... it just looked like soot.After keeping hold of the samples for several years, Dr Turner had to eventually return them to Nasa.It\u0027s nice to look back and think that you were a part of it, he said of Apollo 11\u0027s 50th anniversary.I really started to make a name for myself after that, because I had been doing some work on meteorite measuring, meteorite ages, but the community of people who analyse meteorites is actually quite small but then working on the moon and working on a new technique that nobody else has used.Additional reporting by Press AssociationBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22.

A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.Endgame’s gross has been assisted by the recent release of Spider-Man: Far from Home, which directly follows up on lingering plot threads teased by Endgame, as well as Endgame’s recent re-release at the end of June. Unveiled in selected cinemas across the US, the re-released version featured a deleted scene and a new introduction from director Anthony Russo.Spider-Man: Far from Home breaks Avengers: Endgame milestoneAvatar sequels delayed a year because of new Star Wars trilogyIn May, James Cameron congratulated the Endgame team for outgrossing his 1997 epic Titanic, which was previously the second most successful film of all time. “An iceberg sank the real Titanic,” he wrote in a tweet. “It took the Avengers to sink my Titanic. Everyone here at Lightstorm Entertainment salutes your amazing achievement. You’ve shown that the movie industry is not only alive and well, it’s bigger than ever!”In the UK, Avengers: Endgame remains some way off from becoming the most successful movie in UK box office history, currently sitting beneath Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Skyfall, Spectre and Avatar.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He was listening to music on his phone using Spotify, and watching films on Netflix, but he was struggling to buy textbooks or find them in the library when he needed one. Surely, he thought, it must be possible to access books in the same way I access music, film or data? Easily and cheaply, anywhere, any time. But, he realised, there was no subscription service for books. Thus was born Perlego (Latin for “I read through” or “I scan”), the Spotify of textbooks. Van Malderen even went on to write his thesis on the subject, “Why the Old Textbook Model is Broken”.There is a scandal, verging on a scam, in the realm of textbooks. Since 1982, the price of textbooks has risen at three times the rate of inflation. Some figures depict a tenfold increase. As if students didn’t have enough trouble already with tuition fees. They would be justified in feeling it’s a rip-off, up there with secondary ticketing for gigs and flights to Madrid when there’s a Champions League Cup Final on. Perlego aims to make learning accessible, without perhaps killing off libraries completely. “Students can still go to the library to study,” says its CEO and co-founder Van Malderen.Gauthier Van Malderen, 26, was born in Belgium, lived in Henley-on-Thames as a kid, and was an undergraduate in economics and management at Bocconi University in Milan. His dad is in banking and his parents expected him to go into finance. “They nearly had a heart attack when I mentioned textbooks online.” They’ve swung around since. Van Malderen the younger is really responding to student need. When he was still an undergraduate he noticed that most students were using notepads so he set up a business producing very classy notepads, called\u0026nbspIconic Matter (“made by students for students”) with advertising from big companies at the bottom of the page, selling them in Belgium, Switzerland and Morocco. He made enough money out of that scheme to launch Perlego, together with backing from the founder of Zoopla, Alex Chesterman.There are a couple of open access websites where you can download books for free, such as OpenStax, funded by Bill Gates – but it’s non-profit, and Van Malderen is on the side of writers as much as readers.\u0026nbsp“If you’re going to produce high quality work, then it would be nice to get paid.” Van Malderen is sympathetic towards professors. “They don’t want students to have to pay through the nose. They don’t ‘adopt’\u0026nbsptextbooks anymore” (ie\u0026nbspmaking them required reading). In the context of universities trying to open up access, the question of affordability becomes more crucial than ever.We see ourselves as complementing rather than replacing traditional institutionsThe other possible avenue for impecunious students is, of course, theft, not so much nicking books from the library, more using piracy websites. Sitting at a laptop in his offices in Holborn, Gauthier showed me how he could illicitly download the pdf of a classic textbook, Corporate Finance: Theory and Practice, entirely for free. “No wonder publishers are having a hard time,” says van Malderen. “There is a vicious spiral effect. They lose 28 per cent\u0026nbspto piracy, 30 per cent\u0026nbspto second-hand sales.” In short, at present, publishers, authors, and students all end up feeling ripped off.Apparently 88 per cent\u0026nbspof students don’t see piracy as a crime. Van Malderen thinks legal can be cooler. “We can show them the convenience of having one space – a one-stop shop – where you can get all your books. And no one gets ripped off.” The average spend on textbooks in the UK is £439 (medicine will cost a lot more than English) in the US it’s $1,200. The cost of subscribing to Perlego is £12 a month.Perlego also hosts all those public domain books, like The Odyssey and Das Kapital. “The culture has changed,” Van Malderen says. “It’s like music – you don’t want to own the book anymore.” Perlego is a streaming service. You don’t download, you read the book page by page online, on your phone if you like. It’s a “mobile-first learning experience”, as Van Malderen describes it. You can create your own library, like a playlist. And unlike the books in the university library, you can legitimately scribble in the margins and underline sentences, personalising the text.You can become part of a network of readers, with input from other students, so you can compare notes, and get comments from professors too. It’s a virtual seminar that feels like it could make the real, traditional learning environment redundant. “We see ourselves as complementing rather than replacing traditional institutions,” says Van Malderen. “We’re just aiming to make learning more efficient.” It’s like reading, plus social media, where you can “follow” other readers if you like. There is potential for “lifelong learning” too. 25 per cent\u0026nbspof Perlego subscribers are not students, but professionals (or would-be professionals) seeking to upgrade.How do you plan Wimbledon? It’s all about attention to detail‘If we get one person to give up cow’s milk, we’ve made a difference’Why women don’t need a science degree to be successfulAccording to the aggregate data Perlego has collected, psychology is the biggest growth area in higher education, which is good for psychology professors\u0026nbspand publishers to know. But the main intellectual advantage of the online system is that, whatever subject you’re studying, you can always dabble in something else – you’re not restricted to the books specified in your course. “For example,” says Van Malderen, “I was doing economics, but say I wanted to branch out into political science or philosophy, it’s right here”. It’s a whole online library rather than just a bunch of textbooks.A declaration of interest: I teach at Cambridge. I know from personal experience that one thing that always drives students mad is how to put in references at the end of their essays. I’m not one for making recommendations, but I think the next time a student asks me how to do it (and I know it’s going to go wrong somehow), I might say, “Have you tried Perlego?”. All you have to do is skip to the references section, highlight, copy, then paste. Full marks.

Despite his enormous achievements, he faced persecution during his life because he was gay. Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts after it was revealed\u0026nbsphe was in a same-sex relationship.Faced with the prospect of imprisonment, he accepted the alternative of “chemical castration” – hormone treatment supposed to suppress his sexual desire. He died of cyanide poisoning in 1954 at the age of 41. The mathematician’s housekeeper found him in his bed with a half-eaten apple on a table. His death was recorded as suicide but experts have since questioned the evidence presented during the inquest at the time.In 2009, then prime minister Gordon Brown made an official apology\u0026nbspfor\u0026nbspthe “appalling way” Turing was treated, and in 2013 he was granted a posthumous pardon by the Queen. In 2016 the government unveiled an “Alan Turing law” that posthumously pardoned thousands of gay and bisexual men convicted under outdated gross indecency laws.Alan Turing: Why was the codebreaker convicted and pardoned?The law effectively acted as an apology to those convicted for consensual same-sex relationships before homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales in 1967. It came after decades of campaigning from the LGBT+\u0026nbspcommunity and after the family of the Enigma codebreaker delivered a petition to Downing Street before the 2015 general election.The new note will feature a 1951 photo of Turing, a table and mathematical formulae from one of his most influential scientific papers.\u0026nbspIt will also feature a picture of the British Bombe code-breaking machine built at Bletchley Park, as well as a quote Turing gave\u0026nbspin an interview on 11 June 1949: “This is only a foretaste of what is to come\u0026nbspand only the shadow of what is going to be.”The full note design, including all the security features, will be unveiled closer to it entering circulation. The shortlisted characters, or pairs of characters, considered for the new note were Mary\u0026nbspAnning, Paul Dirac, Rosalind Franklin, William Herschel and Caroline Herschel, Dorothy Hodgkin, Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage, Stephen Hawking, James Clerk Maxwell,\u0026nbspSrinivasa\u0026nbspRamanujan, Ernest Rutherford, Frederick Sanger and Alan Turing.Sarah John, the BoE’s chief cashier, said: “The strength of the shortlist is testament to the UK’s incredible scientific contribution. The breadth of iniduals and achievements reflects the huge range of nominations we received for this note and I\u0026nbspthank the public for all their suggestions of scientists we could celebrate.”RBS £10 note with pioneering female figure to be released in OctoberNew £10 with tactile features hailed as ‘fantastic’ for blind peopleI helped judge the BBC’s Icons vote – so where were all the women?Icons review: Alan Turing crowned greatest figure of 20th centuryThis is why Alan Turing’s work could help improve tests for cancerThe new note will be printed on plastic rather than paper as is the current version.At the outbreak of the Second World War, Turing moved to the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park where he designed the British Bombe cryptographic machine. Turing’s team played a pivotal role in cracking the German Enigma code, previously seen as unbreakable. They decoded naval and U-boat messages, which revealed information about German positions and helped to shift advantage to the allies during the battle for the Atlantic. Turing was awarded an OBE for his code-breaking work.After the war\u0026nbspTuring worked on designs for pioneering early computers including the Automatic Computing Engine, one of the first electronic stored-programme computers, which was built in 1950 at the National Physical Laboratory in London. At Manchester University’s computing laboratory\u0026nbsphe developed programming for the Ferranti Mark 1 computer, the world’s first commercially available electronic computer.While at Manchester\u0026nbsphe explored artificial intelligence, proposing an experiment which became known as the Turing Test. A machine could be considered able to “think”\u0026nbspif a human interrogator was unable to distinguish a machine’s response from that of another human being. He also worked on morphogenetic theory, looking at the mysteries of patterns in nature, for example trying to explain the existence of Fibonacci numbers in plant structures. His paper, “The chemical basis of morphogenesis”, has since been recognised as pioneering work.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesAccording to the Which? High Street survey 201929 8. House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesIt said: “The reasons for the delay are the complexities of the integration into the company of the House of Fraser business, and the current uncertainty as to the future trading performance of this business, together with the increased regulatory scrutiny of auditors and audits.“These factors have led to a need for the company to compile more information than in previous years for the audit of period ended 28 April 2019, and has therefore impacted on preparations for and responses to increased challenges in connection with this audit.“Sports Direct would also note that increased regulatory scrutiny is leading to longer lead times generally for the completion of audits.“Sports Direct believes its accounts and their audit to be at an advanced stage. However, there are a number of key areas to conclude on which could materially affect the guidance given in Sports Direct’s announcement of 13 December 2018.”Mike Ashley makes bid for Patisserie ValerieInvestors and analysts were shocked at the decision, branding House of Fraser a “disaster area”, and said Sports Direct should avoid creating more uncertainty.Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, said: “There may be something in what Sports Direct say about company audits generally taking longer because of increased regulation (Superdry’s results were delayed by the complexity of its onerous store impairment provision), but the company hasn’t updated the City since its interims in December and House of Fraser is clearly a disaster area, so this is a serious situation.”Mr Ashley has been on a serious spending spree across the high street in recent years, buying up Evans Cycles, sofa and Game Digital.But his biggest purchase – House of Fraser – from administrators last year, has proved tough to turn around at a time when the high street is struggling to bring customers into stores.Earlier this year, House of Fraser already revealed an underlying pre-tax loss for the first six months of the year of £31.5m on revenues of £70.1m.Bosses had previously said it could break even in the new financial year.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A needy child latches on to him, thawing the misanthropic alcoholic only slightly, but Zwigoff makes no compromises, and leaves no yuletide convention unscathed. One can only guess at how many unsuspecting families have had their festive celebrations scarred after innocently viewing just a smidgen of this disgusting but hilarious monument to bad taste.Hugely controversial on release, the hostile reception garnered by Monsieur Verdoux helped precipitate Chaplin’s eventual exile to Europe. The years between 1940’s The Great Dictator and Chaplin’s most polarising film hadn’t been kind to Chaplin thanks to scandal in his private life and the increasing perception of his supposed communist sympathies. Chaplin’s subsequent feelings of isolation and alienation informed this pitch black tale of a bluebeard who woos and murders a series of wealthy women so that he can support his own family. Chaplin’s satirical social commentary and his character’s defence that his crimes paled into insignificance in comparison with the horrors of the real world found no favour either at the box office or with critics, and the little tramp’s journey from the world’s most loved entertainer to public enemy number one was complete. Forget the wretched Ben Stiller remake and try and view a (very rare) copy of this superb comedy of embarrassment and while you’re about it, go for a double header of the oft overlooked Miss May’s work with 1971’s A New Leaf. A Jewish boy (Charles Grodin) marries a gauche young woman in haste (Jeannie Berlin) and decides to end the marriage when he falls for and woos alluring blond goddess Cybill Shepherd whilst on honeymoon, to the uncomprehending disbelief of Shepherd’s Wasp father, Eddie Albert. There are superb performances all round, with Oscar nominated Berlin (May’s daughter), a stand out. In other hands the whole premise could have dissolved into bathos, but May and screenwriter Neil Simon produced a film that is wise, funny and true, and in the restaurant scene when Grodin dumps his new bride, well... heartbreaking.  410 Withnail and I (Bruce Robinson, 1987)A British movie that inspired a student drinking game and has its’ many hilarious lines quoted verbatim by fans (“Don’t you threaten me with a dead fish!” etc.) must have something going for it, and Withnail and I certainly does. Paul McGann and a marvellously wasted and acerbic Richard E Grant make the most of Robinson’s terrific semi-autobiographical script in this hilarious tale of two base, out of work actors living in squalor who drown themselves in a diet of booze, pills and lighter fluid on a disastrous holiday in the country circa 1969. The whole movie is basically one long bender followed by the mother of all hangovers, (“Look at my tongue, it’s wearing a yellow sock.”) and stands as a perfect farewell to the flip side of the so-called swinging Sixties.510 Harold and Maude (Hal Ashby, 1971)A cult favourite dismissed and panned by critics on its’ release, Harold and Maude’s reputation has grown immeasurably over the years. The story revolves around the tender romance between Harold (Bud Cort), a death obsessed 20-year-old and 79-year-old Maude (Ruth Gordon), a holocaust survivor whose joie de vivre stems from that experience. Critics and cinema goers couldn’t get past Harold’s elaborately staged fake suicides and the love story between the pair, (If it had been a 79-year-old man and a 20-year-old woman, would there have been so much resistance?), but beneath the gallows humour  lies a rather warm and moving film.Mackendrick was soon to depart for America to make the very dark Sweet Smell of Success and The Ladykillers was his final film at Ealing and a fitting swansong. Mackendrick himself viewed the film as an ironic joke about the condition of a decaying post war England and the breakdown of the old order. A gang of thieves rent a room in a sweet old lady’s house (a scene stealing Katie Johnson), and masquerade as musicians while they plan and execute their latest caper. When the indomitable old lady threatens to reveal all to the police, the gang decide they have to kill her. The gang, a marvellous gallery of grotesques played by Alec Guinness, Peter Sellers, Cecil Parker, Herbert Lom, and Danny Green then have to decide who’s going to do the dirty deed but only end up offing each other in a series of gruesome but highly amusing vignettes. The movie’s plot supposedly arrived fully formed to screenwriter William Rose in a dream, and The Ladykillers remains one of Ealing’s greatest works.One of their finest achievements, and one of the standout films of the 1990s, Fargo put the Coen brothers in the major league, winning a best screenplay Oscar. Frances McDormand lifted the best actress award for her role as the heavily pregnant Minnesota police chief who hides a razor-sharp mind behind her congenial, homely persona. This quality allows the chief to piece together the convoluted tale of a kidnapping for ransom that goes disastrously wrong. Jarringly violent in places and with an other-worldly ambience, Fargo is shot full of the brothers’ trademark dark humour and lives up to its’ blurb: “a lot can happen in the middle of nowhere”. MASH fully deserves its’ exalted status as the landmark antiwar film of its’ time or indeed of any time. Made at the height of the Vietnam War but set during the Korean War, the parallels between the two conflicts couldn’t have been clearer. The audience was left in no doubt about MASH’s intended targets – the horrors and absurdities of war which in real life were being beamed from Vietnam into a weary nation’s living rooms, bungling military bureaucracy, the head nurse who is immune to the suffering around her, Uncle Sam, God, the whole nine yards. The outrageous practices and cruel capers perpetrated by Trapper, Hawkeye, et al on their victims, the jokes and ad libs in the operating theatre while the surgeons are covered in blood and gore, are a coping mechanism, a way of staying sane in an insane world. In other words, we laugh, lest we cry.910 Kind Hearts and Coronets (Robert Hamer, 1949)Alec Guinness famously played eight roles in this very dark comedy of manners and is of course, brilliant, but he is matched all the way by a marvellously urbane and detached Dennis Price as the serial killer who calmly murders his way to a dukedom. The film takes barbed pot-shots at the aristocracy and the class ide and the talented but troubled Hamer directs with a sureness of touch that does full justice to the billboards declaring the film “a hilarious study in the gentle art of murder”. Price’s exquisite voiceover and the savage twist in the tail are the icing on the cake in a film with no room for sentiment or remorse, the pinnacle of Ealing’s wonderful body of work, and one of the greatest British films ever made.1010 Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (Stanley Kubrick, 1964)A deranged US general deliberately launches a nuclear bomb on the Soviet Union and the hapless American President (“Dimitri, we have a little problem...”) has to deal with the fallout. Possibly only Kubrick would dare make a film about a nuclear attack on the USSR while the Cuban Missile Crisis was still fresh in many people’s minds, but he created an instant classic in this justly famous and celebrated example of his dark art. Dr Strangelove boasts a wonderful screenplay by Kubrick and Terry Southern that aptly sums up the warped rationale of the so-called nuclear deterrent and has a uniformly brilliant cast, including Peter Sellers playing three roles. It is a film that has to be watched time and time again to marvel at how Kubrick finds humour in an unthinkably horrific situation and if anything, this devastating and timeless cold war satire has improved with age and is just as relevant today.110 Bad Santa (directed by Terry Zwigoff, 2003)The perfect antidote to the usual Christmas slush-fest, Bad Santa has an outrageously profane and debauched Billy Bob Thornton using his seasonal job as a shopping mall Santa Claus to rob the mall’s stores.

I did it because I thought I was going to die.“I got anxious that I’d switched from sherry to Pernod as a breakfast drink. The sherry never bothered me — I had five or six years of sherry for breakfast. But Pernod, that was getting out of hand.”Frank Skinner Live will run at Assembly George Square in Edinburgh from 31 July – 18 August and his Showbiz tour starts on 12 September.Have I Got News For You\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Jake went down again and again and she just remained still for him\u0027Click to followThe IndependentA giant manta ray has been filmed appearing to beg a professional er for help saving her life.The three-metre-wide sea creature is shown swimming up to snorkelling guide Jake Wilton and flipping over in the water – apparently to show him fish hooks embedded in her right eye.The footage, caught near Ningaloo Reef off Western Australia’s north west coast, seems to show the manta ray then staying perfectly still as Mr Wilton gently removes the potentially deadly spikes.The animal – well known to locals and affectionately nicknamed Freckles – then swims away with a flourish as the er emerges triumphantly with the hooks.Monty Halls, a British marine biologist aboard the boat at the time, said: “That manta absolutely understood what was going on. Jake went down again and again and she just remained still for him.”Created with Sketch.Underwater Photographer of the Year Show all 45Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Winner: Behaviour and overall winner. I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality. That\u0027s a very rare combination in one image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: Wide Angle. The first moment I viewed this image I knew it would be a strong contender. For me it\u0027s the symmetry of the Humpback and the balance between the er and calf. Everything about it is in perfect alignment. The shape of the tail in relation to the four corners of the frame, not to mention the position of the free er and calf. Superb imagery at its very best.  Many congratulations Francois. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Winner: Macro. Fabio’s use of long exposure and panning has turned a classic portrait of a Sepiola into an unforgettable one. The sharp and ghosted images of the bobtail squid balance pleasingly in the frame and combined with the outstretched tentacles give the feeling of the cephalopod lunging for its prey. An innovative and most deserving category winner. - Alex Mustard (Judge) It is hard to imagine what it must have been like to have experienced such a large scale natural spectacle as this but this image, perfectly composed and timed, gets close. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: British Waters Macro. A mantra of mine is \u0027It\u0027s not what it is. It\u0027s where it is\u0027 and this long clawed Squat lobster is in a perfect position to make a memorable image. The author, instead of \u0027blasting\u0027 it with light, has gone in the opposite direction by restricting the strobe into a snooted spotlight in order to illuminate just the features of the lobster and the dainty sea loch anemones. It\u0027s an example of \u0027Isolation lighting\u0027 at its very best. A great deal of uw photographers invest their time in what they want to illuminate. This is an example which in my opinion illustrates features that they do not want to illuminate, hence the punchy black background and the soft delicate hues of dark sand, facial features topped off by the sea loch anemones. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Marine Conservation. The problems of plastic pollution and ghost fishing are both illustrated by this struggling loggerhead turtle. I am happy to learn this inidual was lucky enough to survive this deathtrap thanks to the photographer - Alex Mustard (Judge)What a chin, what a forehead, what a character. This picture has portrait written all over it, and such a fascinating species ideally suited to this close focus wide angle approach. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Portrait. Superb impact from the very first moment it was presented. Perfect composition within the image frame and the understated colours. To top it off the authors comments above say it all... a Smiling Happy Angel\u0027s Face. One of my favourites from the entire competition. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Winner: Up \u0026amp Coming. Beautiful split shot with both a perfect under and over split. A very strong favourite with all the judges and one of the best examples I have seen of this type of image for some time. Just Superb! - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Black \u0026amp White. It must be 11 out of 10 for this groundbreaking image. Conception, interpretation and perseverance coupled with black and white’s ability to concentrate on the key elements. It gets better with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Grey seals are a perennial favourite in UPY as one of the UK\u0027s star wildlife attractions. This upside-down portrait is quirky and cute and easily won the affections of the judging panel. Great to see an overseas photographer coming to the UK to show us how it\u0027s done! - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: Compact. This image was a very popular choice between the panel. Ideal for a split rendition. What makes this a winner for me, not withstanding the double exposure is the sympathetic balance of light \u0026amp colour connected  between the top half and bottom of the image frame. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: British Waters Compact. Does British ing get any better than a fun encounter with a grey seal pup? This youngster’s relaxed and curious face is captured perfectly by Martin, making us all want to be there too. - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: British Waters Living Together. Images tell stories but well thought out and executed ones speak volumes. This is such an example which feeds the eye with tales of the seaside on summer days, lively marine spectacles and excited human interaction. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)1545 Isles of Scilly, UKWinner: British Waters Wide Angle. Photographers often feel competition shots must be packed with new tricks to win. At UPY we always appreciate classic technique when it raises the bar of what has been done before. Rob\u0027s full technicolour wide angle scenic reveals the richness of UK seas with an elegant simplicity that is incredibly challenging to pull off in British conditions. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Wrecks. So simple yet so powerful the additional lighting of the turret and the main er perfectly positioned. This was a very strong category this year with a deserved winner and it\u0027s refreshing to read the acknowledgement to Leigh Bishop\u0027s pioneering work. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) The iconic silhouette of a seahorse is a graphically powerful picture. Here Zarina has raised that to another level with the addition of a red filter to her snooted strobe, reminiscent of a rim-lit animal at sunset. - Alex Mustard (Judge) All the judges found this to be probably the most distressing image to view but its uncompromising message must be seen by as many people as possible. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)As a subject we have seen our fair share of these colourful characters but this one shone through and the eggs almost look as if they have been inidually lit! - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Superb image with a perfect line across the split. Good exposure both above and below the water line and such an ideal subject to cap it all off. Excellent work. - Martin Edge (Judge)This is an excellent example for this category. It takes a tried and trusted angle but completely lifts it by using the fabric. It becomes more than an image a concept, a transition, a rebirth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)2245 Isles of Scilly, UKThis image stood out on many levels. Composition, colour vibrancy and contrast combined with an unusual angle kept us coming back to it and helped it rise in the rankings with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Perfect control of angle, light and focus. This was always up there with all of the judges. A clear favourite just like Nick Park’s genius creations. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I\u0027ve seen many images of eel and shrimp around Indonesia, however you have taken this two steps forward. 1) With your excellent idea to snoot the eye and 2) with your backlight on the shrimp. You can expect many photographers to practice your technique in the months to come. Congratulations for your vision. Very well thought out and executed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    It’s not what you’ve got, it’s what you do with it. The split may have been elusive but well worth the effort. This is a deceptively subtle excellent delivery. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)I have witnessed this behaviour from the surface with its high velocity \u0027testosterone and tonnage\u0027 and I remember thinking how happy I was to be in the boat. To have the presence of mind to time this shot whilst one\u0027s senses are being bombarded is heroic in my view. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) What an amazing moment. From the expression on the face of the unicornfish fleeing for its life, to the hunting pack of sharks, especially the leader with its mouth snapping open that fan out diagonally across this composition. And that is without considering what a great challenge it is to shoot these images of split second action, in the dead of night, underwater. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  There is so much energy in this image. If you look at it long enough you can begin to see just a hint of movement of all the fish around the coral. The colours are realistic and this top down shot works well.  - Martin Edge (Judge)A jaw-dropping wide angle scene with sharks, rays and mountains. A winning combination in the Up \u0026amp Coming category. - Alex Mustard (Judge)3045 Loch Long, Argyll and ButeThis is a subtle image with light and detail that are a delight to explore. The sunset, trees and underwater scene combine to create a wonderful feeling of the place. We particularly like how the composition allows the line of the shore to be continued underwater by the seaweeds.  - Alex Mustard (Judge)Photographing pike underwater is one thing but finding your own underwater artistic stamp is quite another matter. With this particular image the author has done just that! By using a slow shutter speed of 18th sec and a panning technique from right to left gives the impression of movement whilst the pike is pin sharp. - Martin Edge (Judge)Arthur’s image scores with both its foreground and background. The deadman’s fingers soft coral make an attractive foreground, enhanced by the crab sheltering within, and the striking sunbeams create beauty and atmosphere in the background. I also love the feeling of depth created by the legs of the jetty reaching up for the surface. - Alex Mustard (Judge)In recent UPY competitions UK macro images have lacked their overseas counterpart\u0027s flair and imagination but this magnificent shot raises the bar for everyone else to follow. World class from the UK at last. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Memorable photographs of people underwater are deceptively difficult and require both the photographer and model to be at the top of their game. The simplicity of the composition works to highlight the delicious details in the girl\u0027s pose. - Alex Mustard (Judge) This is a timeless scene that communicates a detailed story. The cavern, the silversides sheltering, the tarpon hunting and the er kneeling reverentially, taking it all in. It is a fabulous use of black and white to tell this story of shadows and light. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Sometimes it is the small detail which contributes so much. The white of the eye and the row of teeth in what could be construed as a smile convey mischief and menace in equal measures. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Once again Tobias you have succeeded in capturing one of the most photographed wrecks in the Red Sea and photographing it in a completely different way. You push the boundaries of wreck photography and I congratulate you for your vision and forward thinking of new ideas. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Perfect composition and framed against the stark black background. However it\u0027s the contrast of white on black which attracts the eye again and again every time this particular image popped up to greet us. The colour of the nudibranch was sufficiently bright enough to raise our senses again and again as it proceeded through the competition.  The soft delicate treatment of the snooted flash is also very well managed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    This shot puts you right in the picture and records a special encounter in a very special place. Every element contributes and the lucky or intended curve of the split creates great spatial depth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Symmetry, graphic simplicity and for once in UK waters a black background which contributes to a positive outer worldly delivery. A mould breaker. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I see and judge many images of the sockeye salmon but this is one of the best. The alignment of the two salmon not to mention the composition within the frame.  The surgy peak of the action is in perfect symmetry with the window which provides the viewer with topside influences of the trees against a vivid blue sky. There is so much image depth in this example. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Such a delicate image yet so full of emotion. There are times when there are no more words needed. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)UPY loves seahorse photos! Especially when they capture a fleeting behaviour, such as this. But we hadn\u0027t realised during judging that this was a new species of seahorse, nor did with know the incredible backstory behind this picture, we just loved the moment. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  Whether or not you like fashion photography underwater you would be hard pressed to see a more beautiful combination of complimentary colours and a very elegant pose. A very well executed image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)A portrait must leave you in no doubt. Simple lighting, illuminating all that is needed, captures this character. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Winner: Behaviour and overall winner.

Simple lighting, illuminating all that is needed, captures this character. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)The footage was released on Thursday by Ningaloo Marine Interactions, the tour company which Mr Wilton works for.The hero himself suggested it was all in a day’s work.First known nursery for giant manta rays discovered in Gulf of Mexico“I’m often guiding snorkellers in the area and it’s as if she recognised me and was trusting me to help her,” he said.“She got closer and closer and then started unfurling to present the eye to me. I knew we had to get the hooks out or she would have been in big trouble.

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesIt said: “The reasons for the delay are the complexities of the integration into the company of the House of Fraser business, and the current uncertainty as to the future trading performance of this business, together with the increased regulatory scrutiny of auditors and audits.“These factors have led to a need for the company to compile more information than in previous years for the audit of period ended 28 April 2019, and has therefore impacted on preparations for and responses to increased challenges in connection with this audit.“Sports Direct would also note that increased regulatory scrutiny is leading to longer lead times generally for the completion of audits.“Sports Direct believes its accounts and their audit to be at an advanced stage. However, there are a number of key areas to conclude on which could materially affect the guidance given in Sports Direct’s announcement of 13 December 2018.”Mike Ashley makes bid for Patisserie ValerieInvestors and analysts were shocked at the decision, branding House of Fraser a “disaster area”, and said Sports Direct should avoid creating more uncertainty.Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, said: “There may be something in what Sports Direct say about company audits generally taking longer because of increased regulation (Superdry’s results were delayed by the complexity of its onerous store impairment provision), but the company hasn’t updated the City since its interims in December and House of Fraser is clearly a disaster area, so this is a serious situation.”Mr Ashley has been on a serious spending spree across the high street in recent years, buying up Evans Cycles, sofa and Game Digital.But his biggest purchase – House of Fraser – from administrators last year, has proved tough to turn around at a time when the high street is struggling to bring customers into stores.Earlier this year, House of Fraser already revealed an underlying pre-tax loss for the first six months of the year of £31.5m on revenues of £70.1m.Bosses had previously said it could break even in the new financial year.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the past, reconnaissance planes such as the U-2 and\u0026nbspF-117 have been developed and flown from there.It is likely that it does much the same now, though anything giving any details on current operations is entirely secret.US military ‘ready’ to stop alien-hunters raiding Area 51That secretiveness has led to suggestions that Area 51 is actually focused on alien operations, either instead of or in addition to what has been more officially revealed.Those conspiracy theories encompass a wide variety of possible uses: some say the base is storage for crashed UFOs, others suggest it might serve as a home for aliens that have made it to Earth. Others still suggest it is being used for technology that is secret though not necessarily alien, such as time travel or teleportation technology.The base sits in a remote part of Nevada. The nearest large city is Nevada, but it\u0027s not very near – nothing much is, since it is located deep in the desert.Around Area 51 are a series of alien-themed attractions. It\u0027s one of those where the people supposedly participating in the event are told to meet, at the Alien Center that\u0027s just one of the tourist attractions accessible from the nearby highway.As you\u0027d expect from a top-secret government facility, nobody really knows what\u0027s going on. And as you\u0027d also expect, trying to find out is a difficult and dangerous endeavour.If you don\u0027t storm Area 51, but instead try and walk in, you won\u0027t get very far.The area is rigged up with a variety of motion sensors and CCTV cameras, which immediately trigger a response from very real armed guards. As numerous signs around the base make clear, those guards are allowed to use deadly force to repel people.Flying over the base is impossible, too, since it and the area around it is completely off-limits to civilian and even military aircraft.In short, it stressed that those same deadly measures will be used against anyone trying to enter.The US Air Force always stands ready to protect America and its assets.Most likely not. The event was created satirically, as can be seen in all of the discussion surrounding it, including the event\u0027s description, which makes reference to a manga series.We will all meet up at the Area 51 Alien Center tourist attraction and coordinate our entry, it reads.\u0026nbspIf we naruto run, we can move faster than their bullets. Lets see them aliens.But there is of course no way of knowing what will actually happen when 20 September comes around. Plenty of things, especially in recent years, have been created as jokes and then come true, and with a million people committing to head to the base it would only take a tiny proportion of those people to form a fairly significant protest.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It doesn’t have clear targets it doesn’t have the same ministerial interest it doesn’t have the funding and it’s not prioritised so it doesn’t necessarily have the resources, so I think that’s the department’s challenge.“That’s why outsourcing is part of its modus operandi. That’s one way in which it can try and manage all this capacity – to give the task to somebody else.”Mr Bolt raised concerns about difficulties for visa applicants and for other\u0026nbspimmigrants to access the services of private firms who have commercial contracts with the Home Office, such as Sopra Steria, a French firm that took over\u0026nbspin-country visa processing\u0026nbspin November.The Independent revealed last month that the company had raked in millions for providing what lawyers branded a “substandard” service, which had forced some applicants to pay high fees and travel hundreds of miles to submit\u0026nbspapplications on time.\u0026nbspMPs and lawyers subsequently called for an independent investigation into the outsourced system, raising “extreme concerns” about Sopra Steria’s “capacity and ability” to run the service.Speaking after an event\u0026nbsporganised by the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Visas and Immigration on Thursday, Mr Bolt said: “When you hear that people have difficulty accessing Sopra Steria or any of the other outsourced commercial contracts, what is the Home Office doing to ensure that what they’re providing is actually\u0026nbspmeeting the terms of the contract?“In earlier contracts, one of the challenges was whether the contract had been properly funded, so there’s been an attempt to try and do things slightly on the cheap. And then it always feels rather reluctant to press the provider, because they realised they’ve got the provider over a barrel.“The question is, does it retain sufficient visibility of what’s going on and sufficient control over it? And to what extent is it accountable for what’s delivered?”A report published by Mr Bolt\u0026nbspin 2016, which aimed to understand how the Home Office was going to assess the effectiveness of the\u0026nbsphostile environment policies, found there were “no real measurements in place to collect, analyse and evaluate” the measures.But the chief inspector questioned whether the department had “the capacity to do anything about it” because they were “short of resource generally, meaning everything is under pressure” – likening the situation to “changing a tyre as you’re driving down the motorway”.“Across all of the Home Office, its business is bigger than its capacity to manage. It’s constantly having to make decisions about priorities, and getting dragged off to do things. That for me is one of the key issues – whether it’s got the bandwidth to cope with everything,” he added.A Home Office spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“We welcome the independent scrutiny of the chief inspector and take his comments, criticism and recommendations very seriously.\u0026nbsp“We are committed to delivering an immigration system that is fair and delivers value for money for the taxpayer and the inspector is a crucial part of that work. It is only right that the department and ministers give full consideration to the recommendations made in ICIBI\u0026nbsp(independent chief inspector of borders and immigration)\u0026nbspreports, which can be complex and wide-ranging.”Asylum and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They had written to her to ask her to spell out her programme to win their votes.“I want to explain my thinking on Brexit,” Ms von der Leyen concludes the letter obtained by The Independent.\u0026nbspNo-deal Brexit will leave UK at mercy of France, Hammond warnsNo-deal Brexit set to hit business for £22bn a yearBrexit has sent ‘not as important’ Britain into decline, says Irish PM“This was an issue that was raised by several members from your group. I very much regret that the United Kingdom has decided to leave the European Union. But I fully respect this decision. Brexit creates uncertainty for citizens’ rights, for economic and territorial actors, and for the stability and peace on the Island of Ireland.“The Withdrawal Agreement negotiated with the United Kingdom is the best and only possible deal for an orderly withdrawal.\u0026nbsp“If elected I am ready to pave the way to the ambitious and strategic partnership we want to build with the United Kingdom. Should more time be required, and should there be good reasons provided, I will support a further extension if good reasons are provided.”The suggestion that talks under Article 50\u0026nbspcould be extended will give heart to remain campaigners, who believe more time would be needed to organise a second referendum.But some EU national leaders think the bloc should cut Britain adrift and not grant an extension, to end the disruptive affair. The period has already been extended twice and was supposed to expire on 29 March 2019.Leo Varadkar said last month that EU leaders had run out of patience with Britain and would only support an extension for a general election or second referendum.The confirmation from the the nominee that she would not re-open the withdrawal agreement – a longstanding EU position – clashes with the views of many Tories in Westminster who think the EU can be forced to renegotiation. The Sun newspaper reported on Monday that Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told Michel Barnier five times in a recent meeting that the deal is “dead”. It has been rejected by MPs three times.Whether any extension would take place would be decided be EU leaders, and Ms von der Leyen is set to take office after the decisions is made, on 1 November when Jean-Claude Juncker\u0027s mandate expires.Boris Johnson has said he would take the UK out of the EU on 31 October “do or die” but leaks from the civil service suggest that it has warned that the UK is not prepared for a no-deal exit on that date.

First of all, the pound is likely to drop significantly against other major currencies, as happened in the aftermath of the 2016 referendum.‘Many thousands’ of jobs lost in no-deal Brexit, minister warnsThis will rapidly increase the cost of imported raw materials and components at the same time as businesses have to deal with disruptions to their supply chain as the free movement of goods and services ends abruptly.Additional tariffs will further add to the cost of doing business as will non-tariff barriers such as customs checks, additional paperwork and quotas.Some businesses, such as those which rely heavily on sourcing parts from across the continent, will become unprofitable and inevitably have to lay off staff or even shut down completely.We have a number of forecasts of what this might mean for employment.In December, academics at the University of Sussex predicted that a no-deal scenario will cost 750,000 UK jobs, including 150,000 in London and over 80,000 in the northwest of England.Analysis by Cambridge Econometrics commissioned by the mayor of London forecasts 87,000 jobs lost in the capital by 2030 out of a nationwide total of half a million.Across the EU, around 1.2 million jobs would be lost, according to a recent paper from the University of Leuven. It concluded that Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands would be the worst affected by a no-deal Brexit, with Dublin losing 50,330 jobs or 2.6 per cent of its entire workforce.This week the Northern Irish government sounded the alarm with a warning that the country would lose 40,000 jobs after a no-deal Brexit, primarily as a result of disruptions to trade with the Republic.While there is considerable variation in the predictions, all certainly support the business secretary’s assertion.The Bank of England’s Gertjan Vlieghe pointed to a further problem on Friday: that British workers,\u0026nbsphighly indebted and with low levels of savings, are ill-equipped to deal with the sudden slump in the labour market that Brexit may bring.“I remain concerned about the vulnerability of households to a downside surprise in income or employment, given the very low savings rate,” said Mr Vlieghe, who sits on the BoE’s interest rate-setting committee.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The socialists did not rule out voting for her, but have basically laid out a programme of things she needs to agree to to get their support.\u0026nbspTheir demands – it’s a very long list – include an investment programme, opening accession talks with Albania and North Macedonia in 2019, and reform of EU foreign policy. It’s not quite clear how serious they are about all the policies, many of which have been knocking around for ages.The liberal group, which is now called Renew, has also sent a similar letter.Von der Leyen needs 374 votes in the 751-member parliament to win: without the support of the socialist and the liberals – the latter of which have kept quiet for now – she has to rely on Eurosceptic groups to vote for her.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Japan\u0027s Megumu Yoshida and Yukiko Inui compete in the duet technical artistic swimming event during the 2019 World Championships at Yeomju Gymnasium in GwangjuHot air balloons fly over the city of Igualada during an early flight as part of the European Balloon Festival in Igualada, Spain.

There’s no shame for me. There’s no shame for any of us,\u0027 says Mounir BaatourClick to followThe IndependentMounir Baatour’s office is cool, the steady thrum of the air conditioner offering a welcome break from the blistering summer heat that has descended upon Tunis. Past noon, little moves outside. The streets are empty and even the city’s ubiquitous cat population has slinked off to the shadows.Despite the temperature, Baatour, the first openly gay man to run for president in a Muslim country, remains focused upon the task ahead.The road leading to the November poll is unlikely to offer a smooth ride. Homosexuality itself isn’t illegal in Tunisia. However, practising it is. This distinction has allowed Baatour, a lawyer, to register the pressure group\u0026nbspShams. Along with others, the group campaigns for a repeal of the colonial French\u0026nbsplaw\u0026nbspproscribing sodomy.Likewise, legal\u0026nbsprestrictions criminalising\u0026nbsp”outrages against public decency” are often used to persecute the country’s LGBT+ population – these\u0026nbspremain firmly with the sights of Baatour and other rights campaigners. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOn top of this, the police force appears eager to exploit existing edicts allowing, for instance,\u0026nbspenforced anal examinations to be used as evidence of sexuality. This is buttressed by a judiciary and political establishment long practised in the art of looking the other way.Created with Sketch.Best photos from Pride 2019 around the world Show all 45Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In February, a young man from the coastal city of Sfax received an eight month\u0026nbspsentence for engaging in homosexual acts after reporting being raped by two other men. Other stories of official abuse are legion. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“I am openly gay,”\u0026nbspBaatour\u0026nbspsays. “I came out 20 years ago. I was jailed for three months for sodomy in 2013. There’s no shame for me. There’s no shame for any of us.”Baatour, his association and his relatively fringe Liberal party are children of Tunisia’s revolution. In the years immediately following 2011, a number of gay rights groups emerged, led by Baatour’s own Shams, calling for a repeal of\u0026nbspanti-homosexual laws.However, even here, Shams’ tactics have given rise to ision, with a coalition for LGBT+ rights issuing a statement\u0026nbsplast year distancing themselves from Shams and its president. Baatour attributes this schism to his openness to potentially normalising relations with Israel, a suggestion considered anathema to many on Tunisia’s left.Perhaps ironically, the same period during which many of these groups arose also witnessed an explosion in Islamism across Tunisia, with the moderate Islamist Ennahda party vying with the radical\u0026nbspAnsar al-Sharia\u0026nbspfor the political souls of Tunisia’s religious majority.When you put gay people in jail for three years, what, do they come out straight? No\u0026nbspAnsar\u0026nbspal-Sharia was outlawed in 2013, and support for Ennahda appears to have ebbed since the groundswell of popular support that saw them achieve a plurality vote in the country’s first free elections in 2011.But across many sections of Tunisian society, values typically bend towards the traditional. In August, conservative demonstrators of both genders took to the street to protest a\u0026nbsppresidentially mandated report\u0026nbspurging greater inidual freedoms and equality across the genders. \u0026nbspAs far as homosexuality is concerned, those conservative sentiments cut deeper. A June 2019 survey by the polling institute Arab Barometer reported that just 7 per cent of Tunisians condoned homosexuality. It’s a sentiment reflected within the rhetoric of some of Baatour’s populist rivals for the presidency. Law professor Kais Saied\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspa close second in the polls – he has\u0026nbspsuggested\u0026nbspthat encouraging the spread of homosexuality within the country is a foreign plot. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspAlleged rape victim imprisoned for homosexual acts by Tunisian court“I think we need to have a debate about homosexuality in Tunisia,” says Baatour, who identifies as Muslim but doesn’t practise.“I’m not talking about promoting homosexuality, just about decriminalising it. Gay people don’t do anyone any harm. They should be free to do what they want with their bodies. If, as Kais Saied has said, homosexuality is a sickness, then – even if I accept that – I have to ask, why are you putting sick people in jail?“When you put gay people in jail for three years, what, do they come out straight? No. So they must return to jail for a further three years and then for the rest of their lives.”Though what Baatour is proposing might seem radical, it is not without precedent. In arguing his case, Baatour points to the country’s first post-independence president, Habib Bourguiba, who in 1956 introduced landmark laws outlawing polygamy and introducing a code of women’s rights that stands to this day.LGBT activists arrested at unauthorised pride march in Cuba“All of that at the time was controversial, a lot of people said it was against Islam. However, Bourguiba had the political will to impose it. In 1956, Tunisia was more conservative than it is now, but people came to accept it and still do.” \u0026nbspHowever, while accepting that much of the attention on him focuses upon his stance on LGBT+ rights, Baatour is keen to stress that his candidacy is about more.He wants to address many of Tunisia’s underlying ills, from the state enterprises that continue to haemorrhage money, to the vast scale of the country’s informal economy, to the environment, which remains a priority.But above all, he says, is his commitment to promoting civil liberties and the rights of the inidual.Whether or not he is successful remains to be seen. However, for Baatour, the fight alone is worthwhile. If anything, he says, his campaign forces the other candidates to address the lack of progress on civil liberties and inidual rights within Tunisia.Baatour leans forward, “I will place this at the very heart of my campaign.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But in  the CIA officially acknowledged its existence and its location was revealed.Declassied documents reveal it was originally somewhere for the Army Air Corp pilots to practise their aerial gunnery.During the Cold War experimental aircraft and weapons systems were tested here.This included the high altitude U- spy plane.Its current use is unknown and remains a top secret.The so-called Roswell incident is one of the most discussed and controversial UFO theories in history.In July  the military sensationally announced in a press release it had found the remains of a crashed flying saucer in the desert.But the following day it retracted the statement, saying it was in fact a damaged US Air Force air balloon.Yet as reported, Sherf Jess Slaughter and Deputy Sherf Charles Fogus were on duty in a patrol car on the night of the alleged incident. Suddenly they heard reports of a crashed aircraft on their police radio.In the interview Mr Fogus claims he saw a flying saucer smash into the side of a river bed and that the flying object was “ft across”.Describing the scene, he said: “When we got there, the land was covered with soldiers. They were hauling a big, creature.“The bodies must have been  feet tall.“I saw the legs and feet on some of them. They looked like our feet.”The exact purpose of the air base is not known publicly, and the area is heavily restricted.Trespassers can face huge fines and y prison sentences for setting foot in the zone.Purchased by the US government in , evidence suggests the site is used as a testing area for experimental aircraft and weapons.But the secrecy surrounding it has led conspiracy theorists to suggest the area is holding extra-terrestrial secrets.Theories suggest engineers examine crashed spacecrafts — and even hold meetings with aliens from across the galaxy.The crash of a weather balloon at Roswell, New Mexico in  sparked wild theories of an alien ship crash.Some have suggested Area  is still storing parts of the crashed ship — or even its alien inhabitants.As well as assessing alien technology it is often suggested that it is a place where meetings or joint undertakings with extraterrestrials occur.Other theories suggest it has served as a research site for a range of exotic weapons and technologies.This includes the development of time travel or teleportation technologyAnother theory is that the much rumoured Aurora stealth plane is being tested here.The most outlandish idea is that Area  is a base for a one world government.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As he himself said, his job had become “impossible”.But this whole episode has been utterly depressing, and there is plenty of blame to go around.Perhaps Sir Kim was a little loose in his language, but no diplomat could ever expect his confidential notes to senior figures in London to end up on the front of the papers.The tributes since his resignation certainly suggest that this was the first time he’d put a foot even slightly wrong in his entire career.And the President — who is a friend of Britain — should have realised that when it comes to diplomacy, the shoot-from-the-hip style he uses on social media can have consequences.No newspaper complains about a leak, but whoever undermined Sir Kim by releasing his not-quite-diplomatic cables should reflect on the damage it has done to not just our international standing but to the Foreign Office’s ability to do its job.As for the Boris “row”, it’s unedying to see his detractors weaponising this sorry saga against him.Whatever he had said on the TV debate, Sir Kim’s position was already sadly untenable.Moving forward, the Special Relationship must remain special.Our links with America are stronger than one ambassador, from security to our shared culture.But we must never be complacent about the ties to our closest ally.YOU can see why Labour has turned on the journalists behind last night’s Panorama investigation into the party’s dreadful handling of anti-Semitism in its ranks.The programme was damning from start to finish. It details the most extraordinary levels of racism in all corners of the party and a total refusal of the leadership to do anything about it.Indeed the party appears to have actually tried to strangle worthwhile investigations at birth, and to have actively interfered in the disciplinary process.Corbyn’s useful idiots have predictably turned on the whistleblowers – ironic, considering Labour’sShadow Chancellor once handed a petition to No calling for better protection for those brave enough to call their employers out for bad practice.Hypocrites, the lot of them.It may not be the case that Corbyn himself is a racist, but goodness, he does seem to attract an awful lot of them — and be too thick or ignorant to notice they’re there.The party’s rotten, from top to bottom.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One Lord was described as a “notorious bullying pervert” by a Westminster worker.The verdict was that the prevailing culture and behaviour in the House of Lords “has not been conducive to an open and supportive culture to ensure all those working there are treated with dignity and respect”.Worse, the report concluded those staff on the receiving end of bullying and harassment generally did not complain because they thought nothing would change, or feared reprisal.Clearly, the House of Lords has issues. But it’s nowhere near as bad as the House of Commons. The second report, by Gemma White QC into inappropriate conduct in Westminster, concluded MPs’ staff face “unacceptable risk of bullying and harassment”.It found sexual harassment in Parliament is seen by young staff as a “necessary evil”they want to progress. Witnesses describe speaking out against any abuse as “career suicide”.Even though both reports state only a small minority of MPs or Lords behave in unacceptable ways, this has been tolerated for too long and shining a light on it will bring about change.What’s clear to me, both from reading the report and working at the House of Lords, is that this is a generational issue. The House of Lords is full of older people stuck in a time warp.Many of them live in a world where it’s still acceptable for women — often females of a lower status to them — to be patted on the bottom or on the head.The House of Lords can feel a bit like a boys’ boarding school, or Hogwarts. It’s populated predominantly by old white men, many of whom lead a le insulated from the real world.That said, the worst behaviour I witness is usually in the library, where Lords often retire after lunch and which rings with the sound of ear-deafening snoring and, I am sorry to say, farting.The only time I’ve ever seen anyone being actively rude was when one Lord commanded a member of canteen staff to get him a bag of crisps. He was so close he could have reached out and got it himself.I’ve also been on the receiving end of the odd condescending comment, such as when a Lord looked me up and down and said: “You’re dressed rather casually.” I was wearing Stella McCartney trousers at the time, so not exactly jeans.Crucially, though, I wasn’t wearing a dress. So I looked him up and down and said: “Dressing casually is better than dressing badly” — and that was the end of that.It must be horrible to work in an organisation where you feel inferior and can’t speak your mind — and,you do, people either shrug or shut you down. The report about the House of Lords suggested it should be mandatory for all employees to go on a “how to value people” course. Some people might see it as unnecessary — but we send West Ham staff on them and they are good.But that’s not the only change required. There’s neither enough women, nor cultural ersity. The only way that will change is by electing a more erse chamber.In the meantime, I hope this report does not diminish, in people’s minds, the important legislation work the House of Lords does and the role it plays in holding the Commons to account. I hope these reports don’t stop people from remembering what an important institution it is.As Spider-Man said: “With great power comes great responsibility” — and as one who sits in the House of Lords, I know I am not the only one who feels it is a great responsibility.BIG news.

Poll after poll suggests No Deal Boris would win with an outright majority — at their expense.The public is sick to the back teeth with Theresa May’s dreary defeatism and Brussels’ bullying. Remain voters want this sorted, too.Elections are always risky. But a Tory Party still dithering and paralysed on the biggest issue of the age is the greatest risk of all. Right now, the omens are promising. Labour is committing ritual suicide, shedding voters in droves.Millions of Tory defectors would flock back to a party committed to a final, irreversible Brexit taking us past the October  dead-line and sucking support from Nigel Farage and his Brexit Party.In the intervening weeks, a Boris regime could recruit voters abandoned by both major parties over crime, low pay, high taxes and housing.According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, blue- collar voters on less than £, a year, are “up for grabs like never before”.If Boris Johnson has one proven gt, it is for winning against the odds.

Shes the absolute jigger queen.”In stomach-churning scenes Cilian, who remains unflinching, digs out the worm with sharpened wooden stick as Livia explains it has been in her foot for a few days and “its managed to gnaw right through me and create a great big sack of eggs.As the white egg sack oozes out of her skin, she exclaims, “Look at the size of that beast. She [Cilian] absolutely loved that though.”Despite her medical skills, Cilian will not train to be a doctor as the Pygmy children never leave the village for formal education.The wealthier Bantu tribe consider themselves a superior race and have historically kept Pygmies as slaves.A report in  found that the Pygmy tribes were subject to constant discrimination from the Bantus, being made to work for nothing and are “considered by Bantu people as property in the same way that pets are.Livia explains: [Their village] Bonguinda used to be inhabited by the Pygmies and the Bantus.The Bantus moved down to the river to the neighbouring village of Munbalu but this is still Bantu land so they still feel like they have a bit of a hold on [the Pygmies].The relationship between them is really dark.Extreme Tribes: The Last Pygmies airs tonight at pm on Channel .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

currently in the race to face Donald Trump in the USs next presidential election in .He also said there were records suggesting his maternal great-great-great grandfather, Frederick Williams, most likely owned slaves in the s.We are not certain that the Frederick Williams who is my ancestor and the Frederick Williams who owned slaves are the same person, wrote ORourke.But there’s enough circumstantial data to lead me to conclude that it’s likely.He added that records show his we Amy had an ancestor who owned slaves and another who was a member of the Confederate Army.Despite having gained a lot of attention near the start of the race, ORourkes campaign has struggled to build momentum, and Real Clear Politi aggregated polling data currently has him in sixth.ORourke continued: “Something that we’ve been thinking about and talking about in town hall meetings and out on the campaign — the legacy of slavery in the United States — now has a much more personal connection.That those enslaved Americans owned by my ancestors were denied their freedom, denied the ability to amass wealth, denied full civil rights in America after slavery also had long term repercussions for them and their descendants.”“I benefit from a system that my ancestors built to favor themselves at the expense of others.The majority of slaves were transported along the so-called Middle Passage, a triangular trade route between Europe, Africa, and the Americas.Europe traders would depart Europe with manufacture goods which could be traded in Africa for kidnapped Africans.The Africans would then be transported across the Atlantic as slaves.Once on the American continent, they could be sold or traded for raw materials, which would then be transported back to Europe.It is estimated that between  and , . million slaves were shipped to the New World, with . million surviving the journey.The trading of slaves was abolished in the British Empire in , with ownership not outlawed fully until .In the early s, the United States fought a civil war partly over the question of whether slavery should be allowed to continue.In December , the Thirteenth Amemndment to the US Constitution officially outlawed slavery throughout the country.ORourke has previously expressed support for the payment of reparations for African American descendants of slaves, who still today experience lower incomes, worse health outcomes, and higher rates of incarceration.He wrote in the post: “We all need to know our own story as it relates to the national story, much as I am learning mine.It is only then, I believe, that we can take the necessary steps to repair the damage done and stop visiting this injustice on the generations that follow ours.”ORourke says thatelected president he would support a bill that would create a commission to study the question of reparations, and begin “an important national conversation on slavery and racial injustice.”A version of this story

Labour chiefs said the programme, which carried allegations key aides to Jeremy Corbyn interfered in anti-Semitism complaints, was heavily slanted and inaccurate and should be removed. The statement prompted a stand-off as the BBC refused to remove the show - which still has  months left to air on online media service. It comes despite Emily Thornberry urging Labour to end the soap opera and focus on the message, not the messengers yesterday. The Shadow Foreign Secretary said it was wrong to be going for former officials, who gave evidence to Panorama but were disowned by Labour as disaffected critics with axes to grind. Meanwhile Jeremy Corbyn is set to face fresh criticism tonight after dozens of Labour MPs launched a new push for an independent complaints process. The Tribune Group of MPs, which includes Yvette Cooper, Stephen Kinnock, Dan Jarvis, Debbie Abrahams, Owen Smith and Justin Madders, will make the demand at a weekly meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party tonight. Yet a Labour spokesman said: The Labour Party is making a full complaint to the BBC about the heavily slanted and inaccurate Panorama programme, which had no political balance of interviewees, invented quotes and edited e-mails to change the meaning.    Labour will call for the programme to be removed from BBC iPlayer until basic facts are corrected, full and unedited quotes are used, and an apology is issued. Two of the ex-officials who featured in the show now plan to sue the Labour Party for libel over its official response. Sam Matthews, who said he had considered suicide by walking off the roof of Labouraposs London HQ, and Louise Withers-Green are being represented by prominent media lawyer Mark Lewis. Mr Lewis said: If these employees had been at a retail organisation rather than a political party, Labour would have been speaking out.  But when Labour is attacking its own employees and former employees, it reverts to the exact hypocrisy of saying aposwe are the bosses and we are going to crush the workersapos.” Labour denied the comments were defamatory and said it would contest any legal action. These are justied statements of opinion. Any claims will be vigorously defended, a spokesman said.  Meanwhile the row has itself fuelled a spin-off crisis over deputy leader Tom Watson after he wrote to general secretary Ms Formby about anti-Semitism in Labour. He said key evidence being submitted to the Equality and Human Rights Commission was withheld from him and Ms Formby had questions to answer about e-mails she deleted. But she refuted the claims and attacked Mr Watson for criticising her while she undergoes cancer treatment - leading Unite union chief Len McCluskey to brand the leader a f***ing disgrace. Ms Thornberry also criticised Mr Watson saying his personal attack on the general secretary was a mistake. A Labour spokesman said: Despite a record of public hostility to Jeremy Corbyn and his politics from presenter John Ware and several of those interviewed, analysis found that in the  minute programme, the party’s position was on screen for just  minutes and  second.

United political parties do better than ided ones. And with a general election potentially around the corner, Corbyn’s rallying cry was embraced at a huge brass-bands-and-banners Durham Miners’ gala, dwarfing the crowds at royal weddings or Glastonbury. Yet until the Labour leader devises a way to pull his party together, should a unity strategy be possible under Corbyn, vicious backbiting throws a leline to Johnson.  Even though voters view him as a self-serving, irresponsible, untrustworthy buffoon, rather than the Churchillian figure that this vain, preposterous huckster admires in his mirror. Labour’s European injuries are temporarily patched until any election. By belatedly embracing a fresh referendum, the party committed to demanding a people’s vote to block a damaging Tory Brexit shambles or the catastrophic no-deal nightmare of Johnson’s fevered fantasies. Anti-Semitism is the gaping wound still to be cauterised. Bitter disputes over how deep the poison runs and the action to cleanse Labour of the racist stain is pitting one-time allies against each other.  Unite leader Len McCluskey launched a loudly cheered assault in Durham on Tom Watson. Mr McCluskey did not mince his words in branding the Deputy Leader an effing disgrace for publicly criticising a party general secretary, Jennie Formby, enduring chemotherapy for breast cancer.

He knows which way I go to work. He obviously knows where my friends live. “I have no idea why he did this. I think he can’t accept it and needs to be in control. “He was quite a controlling person which is one of the reasons why I ended the relationship.” Before she finished things the woman was feeling under closer and closer scrutiny from her -year-old partner, who tried telling her what to wear. “His behaviour was getting worse and worse, she continued.

Grandparents Ron and Wendy Long were devastated when they found workmen chopping down a hedge between their home and neighbour Diana Lambethaposs. Ron, , claimed the fence posts they half-installed were on his land, and wrote letters asking her to consult with him on the plans. But instead she took the elderly couple to court, in pursuit of an injunction to stop them interfering with the hedge, in Swanage, Dorset. An independent expert decided the boundary was in the middle of the old hedge - and the Longs agreed in a bid to end the matter.    But despite the Longs representing themselves in court, the judge ordered Ron and Wendy pay Mrs Lambethaposs court costs - £,. Without any money to pay, they were hauled back to court and the charge was placed on their £, three-bed home. Last month they were told Mrs Lambeth intends to take them to court for an order of possession and sale of their home to sell it herself to get the cash. And her lawyers have warned Ron and Wendy theyaposll ask the judge to make the couple pay the legal costs incurred. Retired flooring contractor Ron, said: Weaposve done nothing wrong, we broken no laws, and we followed all the advice we could find - yet we find ourselves in this situation.    When you say all this is over a garden fence, people canapost believe it. Iaposm not out to get revenge. I donapost want to give my neighbour grief. I donapost want to shame my neighbours, but I want to make people aware of what can happen to you. We never thought this could happen to us. We never thought someone could take our home over a hedge. I just want to show people what can happen when solicitors get involved and things go to court. All I want is some help to bring this to a close. We donapost want someone  to sell our home. We feel like we have been stepped all over and nobody has heard our side of things. Ron and Wendy, a housewe, bought their three-bed home in . On friendly terms with neighbour Mrs Lambeth, keen gardener Ron happily maintained his side of the hedge between their homes, he said. But he came home in May  from a morning out to find three workmen in his garden, he claims.    They had cut down half the hedge and piled it in the middle of his garden and were replacing it with fence posts, some of which he said were on his side, he said. I hadnapost given permission for anyone to come on my garden, said Ron. There were great big roots left. Instead of the new fence posts being straight, they were taking the posts around the roots. It looked a mess. Iaposm fond of gardening and I like it to look neat and tidy. Andshe was putting up a fence to keep her dog in, it wasnapost the right sort of fence to do that anyway. It was only a metre high. I told them to stop. He went inside, did some research online and penned a letter to his neighbour, telling her they should have been consulted on the fence location. He said the new fence posts were on his property, but apologised for the letter, assuring his neighbour we hope we can resolve this amicably. But in the coming weeks, the Longs woke up to find someone had removed the rest of the fence while they were asleep. He sent her another letter urging her to sort this out in a civilised fashion.  But after months of letters, the couple were named as the defendants in a County Court boundary dispute claim. According to court documents from June , Mrs Lambeth claimed they were preventing her from putting a fence up. She asked the court to seek a declaration of the boundary, an injunction stopping the Longs from obstructing the fence building, going on her property, or altering any fence. The Longs claim the judge urged them to sort the case outside of court. Fearful and unable to afford a solicitor, they said they agreed in court to the fence, in May . I just didnapost want to take it any further - we never wanted it to get that far, said Ron. But their solicitor just took over. Every time I tried to say anything I got told to sit down. We just didnapost have a chance. I said aposput your boundary wherever you likeapos. They were astonished when the judge ordered all the claimants costs - £,. - were to be covered by them. They hired a solicitor and they hired an expert, but in this very brief hearing itaposs ordered that we have to pay for it all, he said. I could barely take it in. I didnapost - and we still donapost - know what itaposs all for. Their solicitor presented this huge bundle of paperwork and we were handed the bill.  But they werenapost able to pay in full, and were hauled back to court and the charge was transferred to their home in November last year. The couple were already selling their home before the saga started, but took it off the market when the dispute went to court. With it back on the market, they thought the ordeal was behind them. We thought weaposd have to pay back the money when we sold the house, he said. We had a brief moment of calm and thought it was all over. But earlier last monththey received a legal letter from their neighbouraposs solicitors. It states they have been instructed to apply to the court for an order for possession and sale of the Longaposs home, in order to enforce the courtaposs charging order for the debt. The Longs said they canapost get a loan due to the CCJ they incurred by not paying the costs on time. They said they havenapost been able to get help from the Citizens Advice Bureau and solicitors have been reluctant to take on the case.

Tourists visiting the UK are choosing to stay in properties further out of town as opposed to forking out for expensive hotel rooms, according to research. In Manchester, the council recently commissioned a report to assess the impact of Airbnb on the city. They found the Calornia-based company is by far the biggest in the cityaposs short-term rental market, accounting for at least % -with many properties in residential suburbs such as Moss Side, Benchill and Beswick. Although the city centre remains the most popular place for people to stay, growth is quickly expanding into more unexpected places. Council estates that are close to some of the biggest attractions, such as Old Trafford and the Etihad, are fast becoming Airbnb favourites in Manchester, reports the Manchester Evening News. In some cases, Airbnb hosts are benefiting from the regeneration of once-dilapidated estates that have been rebuilt into family homes offered on the open market at favourable rates.    The full impact of the phenomenon is still being assessed by officials, but their initial findings make for a remarkable insight into how some of Manchesteraposs working class neighbourhoods are being transformed. Moss Side has seen Airbnb listings rocket from around  in  to almost  in .  In fact, the neighbourhood has the second highest number of listings on Airbnb in Manchester, way ahead of more affluent suburbs such as Didsbury. When the  Manchester Evening News  searched for places to stay in Moss Side later this year results included two on Quinney Crescent. At the height of the aposGunchesterapos days, the street and surrounding Alexandra Park estate often found itself caught up in gangland feuds. But now tourists are paying to spend the night in properties close to the city centre and the home of Manchester United . One listing on Quinney Crescent costs £ a night and is described as a aposcharming and chicapos apartment. The host, Bayan, adds: A perfect little home in the City for your city break. From here you are well placed to see all that Manchester has to offer - from city centre shopping and restaurants to music venues, sports stadiums and museums and galleries.    Recent guests have left overwhelmingly positive reviews. Nice flat in good location, convenient parking facilities. Would stay again, wrote Clive this month. Hosts communicated well, lovely space in a good location and good amenities nearby. Would highly recommend for a short or longer trip - any queries were resolved quickly, added Gabrielle. The other on Quinney Crescent is described as a aposcomfy and trendy Manchester houseapos and costs £ a night. Host Sam says: Our house is perfect for someone wanting to stay close to the city centre but not right in the middle of it. We have a nice open planned kitchen and living space, with a sizeable back garden and a room perfect for a couple to share. Anyone at all is welcome to stay with us, we love meeting new people and making new friends! Reviews of the area are equally positive.

The council report also identied areas of east and north Manchester where there is aposhigh demand for visitor accommodation, property type and management.apos    Officials highlighted a modern housing estate called aposThe Wayapos in Beswick. Developer Lovell first began working with the city council in  to replace rows of run-down terraced properties owned by the New East Manchester urban regeneration company. The result is hundreds of new homes that have transformed Beswick and brought le back to an area that had been experiencing signicant unemployment and depopulation. The £million project was only completed last year. However, most of the homes were sold on the open market and it appears a signicant number have been bought up for the purpose of short-term rental. The council report found there are now a staggering  Airbnb listings within one-mile radius - all on the aposThe Wayapos estate. Most hosts advertise their proximity to the Etihad Stadium and city centre and offer accommodation for large groups of up to  guests. The M.E.N found one listing for a -bedroom aposholiday homeapos that could sleep  guests available for £ a night on the weekend of July .  aposHenryapos the host says: This property is close to Manchester city centre, Etihad City Stadium, National Cycling Centre, MEN Arena, University of Manchester. You’ll love my place because of the neighbourhood, the light, the comfy bed, the kitchen, and the cosiness. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travellers, families , and big groups.  Such is the success of the flexible, short-term rental market that Manchester is adding new Airbnbs at a rate of more than one every day, the council report found. There are currently around , listings in Manchester, marking a spectacular increase in the past five years - as recently as  there were only a few hundred. In the last two years alone, the city has added a further  Airbnbs. Nevertheless, Manchester remains well behind other big European cities in terms of Airbnbs - there are around , listings in Madrid, , in Rome and , in Paris. Council officials hope that means they have time to get a handle on how it is affected the housing market and what kind of regulation is necessary to curtail the problems that comes with Airbnb. The councilaposs spokesperson for the city centre Pat Karney said: We are not opposed to home owners who let out rooms and homes occassionally. We are totally opposed to the big business Airbnb operators who distort the housing market and cause problems for local residents. We are looking at regulations in cities across the world.

The mother of the boy, who wished to remain anonymous, said: My son was left in tears. He was terried and wondering what these big men would do. Children shouldnapost have to sit through that, nobody should. A couple of elderly people were visibly shaking. Iaposve never been so disgusted and intimated in my le.

The mum added: We first saw them at the airport. They were wearing T-shirts with his name on, along with a picture of a man appearing to perform a sex act on another man. My nine-year-old son asked what the picture was and we just told him it was a funny picture. At first they just seemed to be having a good time. As soon as we stepped on the plane it was obvious they were going to get rowdy. I felt sorry for the cabin crew who dealt with the incident very well.  The group was warned over the Tannoy before we left the gate that it wasnapost too late for them to be offloaded, but they cheered at the announcement. They couldnapost care a less. The language being used was disgusting and disgraceful. There was no awareness of other pasengers. At one point one of the men started hammering on the side of the plane. He was punching the wall. I was worried and then he said aposIaposm going. aposIaposm getting off the planeapos. He walked down towards the cabin crew and I thought he was going to open the door. It was horric and I was terried. The crew pleaded with him to sit down.    Another passenger, who was flying with her husband, told how quick-thinking cabin crew stopped him. His friend said aposdonapost be an idiotapos and cabin crew used the drinks trolley to block him. He was falling over. He picked a can from the trolley and went back to his seat and just fell asleep. Passengers have praised the Ryanair cabin crew who remained calm and composed on Flight FR. The crew were fantastic. We thanked them. They were very good. From what I understand the stag group said they had come down from Aberdeen. They were loud at the airport. Iaposm not a prude but their language was quite shocking. They were using F-words and the C-word. It wasnapost directed at anyone but they got louder and and louder. We were boarding and were hoping that we were sitting a long way away from them but when we got to our seats we were right in the middle of them. I fly a lot but I almost got off the plane.  They were getting increasingly aggressive. They refused to take their seats when asked and were bragging about taking d*** pics. This was before we had even taken off. It was intimidating. The cabin crew made an announcement that it wasnapost too late to get them off the flight. It appeared that they had smuggled their own alcohol on the plane. They kept needing to use the toilet even when the seatbelt sign was on. They didnapost do anything they were told and the pilot in the end kept the seatbelt sign on in an attempt to try and keep them in their seats. In the end the cabin crew moved us. One of the group then started verbally abusing a male member of staff and kept calling him a aposnonceapos. He was screaming in the manaposs face. He was directed back to his seat but kept coming back. At one point he sat in the lap of a woman. It was offensive. Everyone was saying it was the worst flight ever. It was frightening and deeply uncomfortable. I was scared. It was really, really scary. It was the worst kind of disorder you can imagine apart from the fact it was happening ,ft in the air and there was nothing we could do. When the flight landed passengers were told to remain in their seats so police could come on the plane. The police met us when we landed. One of the group thought he would just ignore the instruction and saw his opportunity to get off the plane quickly, said another passenger. But when he walked down the steps he was met by officers.

When he asked her on a first date last month, Erica was honest and said she was too strapped for cash so he offered to pay. On the date, Phillip told her she owed him a beer but two days later he demanded she pay him back for the drink - so Erica transferred for the beer and the tip, she claims.  When the relationship failed to blossom Phillip turned nasty and branded her a half Jew for only paying  towards the date - and sent aposnoseapos emojis as a racial slur. Professional er Erica blocked Phillip and later got her own back by sending him a bill for for gas, wasting my time and burdening me with the knowledge of your existence. Erica, from San Diego, Calornia, said: I donapost knowhe can even admit to himself what happened, but itaposs not my problem. The trash took itself out, as I like to say.  I am half Jewish. It comes up in conversation a lot because I am adopted and found my birth father when I was  and I learned I was half Jewish then. I also did andme and I am .% Ashkenazi Jewish. It tells people a lot about me so when Iaposm getting to know someone it comes up. The fact that I am Jewish must have really struck him. Despite it being a problem that he lived far away, Erica claims she had fun on their initial date and continued chatting to Phillip for five more days. However she claims he was insecure and constantly fretted that she was going to aposghostapos him.  The final straw was when he revealed he owned a aposno fat chicksapos t-shirt, which left Erica annoyed - sending Phillip into a rage. He wrote to her: Lol you really are half Jew I spent  on Sunday and you send me . Erica replied: Okay. You can f off. [ghost emoji]. Phillip wrote: Youaposre joke responses of lol and pretending to be broke @  basically says that anyway haha [sic]. Know what Iaposm saying  [three nose emojis]. Upset and angry at the blatant anti-Semitism, Erica blocked Phillip and sent him the tongue-in-cheek bill via mobile payment service Venmo asking for him to cover her petrol and wasted time.  Erica said: The nose emojis made it even worse. I had not said anything rude to him other than that I hated the [no fat chicks] shirt but it was a rude comment on his part to make before that. I definitely feel like the Jewish comments were very rude of him. I definitely feel like I have a distinctive nose but I donapost have that big a nose. I like my nose. He shouldnapost attack part of me, especially a bit I like. When I was younger I was self-conscious of my nose but as an adult I realised I liked it. Luckily it wasnapost a huge insecurity point for me but it was shocking that he could go that far. Although she claims she never expected him to pay the Venmo bill, she found the response cathartic. Erica said: The text I got on the final day was a picture of him in the aposno fat chicksapos t-shirt. He hadnapost mentioned it at all and I had no idea he owned a shirt like that or anything like that.  He was already annoying me because he was texting me so much and harassing me about ghosting him even though I never ghosted or rejected him, so when he sent the picture of that shirt I was already frustrated. I told him I hated the shirt. I just think heaposs really insecure so the second he saw something negative - that was the first time I texted something negative - he just lashed out immediately. I was just like, ok, Iaposm not going to tell you I like your shirt when I donapost. It was very bizarre. Then he said that comment, which was very anti-Semetic and I was not expecting that. I was surprised at how much it affected my emotions even though I didnapost know him very well. Iaposm not usually a very sensitive person but he sent that text at  oaposclock in the morning and I was at work. I was thinking about it all day, just, wow, that hurt. I didnapost know him at all but I just told him to aposf offapos and sent him the ghost emoji and blocked his number. I blocked him right then.

win over Finns RoPS in the first leg of the Europa League first qualying round.Ferguson played in a deep-lying midfield role last week and the versatile Gallagher operated in front of him in a more advanced central midfield position for much of the game.In the second period the -year-old spent more time on the left wing.But throughout the game Gallagher was a threat for the Dons due to his pace and willingness to take on defenders.He set up the Reds’ second goal with Sam Cosgrove turning in his pin-point cross.Ferguson was impressed with the summer addition and said: “He’s all over the park and he’s so quick and athletic.“Jon slotted straight into position on Thursday and I thought he was excellent.“He had so much energy and was driving forward with the ball and even in the last  minutes he was still driving forward and showed he was a real good ball carrier.“He could have added a goal which would have topped it off – but he was excellent.”Aberdeen were in command against RoPS, leading - at Pittodrie.But Tommi Jantti’s stoppage-time strike took the shine off the performance for Derek McInnes’ side.It also means progression to face either CS Fola Esch of Luxembourg or Georgians Chikhura Sachkhere is not yet assured.However, Ferguson believes a similar display in Thursday’sleg in Lapland to the one the Dons produced in the Granite City should be enough to see them through.The -year-old added: “I thought we controlled the game very well and I thought the standard of football was excellent.“We played really good stuff, especially in the final third.“We created more than enough chances to come in at - or -.“There wasn’t that clinical finishing to put more of the chances away and sadly we’re talking about slack defending at the end that cost us a goal.“I’m pretty confidentwe go over there and play the same type of football with that intensity that we’ll come away with a victory.“They’re a good side and they’re in this competition for a reason.“Their goal was a quality bit of football and that’s what happens in Europe, a split-second can cost you.“ we play with the intensity and energy of Thursday I’m confident we can get through the tie.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/07/GettyImages-959250288.jpg ","title":"i saw the city and saw how big the club was and i thought this was the right step ojo","story":"Dons new boy Funso Ojo has hailed boss Derek McInnes’ powers of persuasion.The midfielder has joined Aberdeen on a three-year-contract from Scunthorpe United.The Reds paid the English League Two side £, for the -year-old Belgian.He becomes Aberdeen’s eighth signing of the summer following the arrivals of Ryan Hedges, Ash Taylor, Curtis Main, Craig Bryson, Jon Gallagher, Greg Leigh and James Wilson.However, the Dons were not the only club chasing Ojo.Scottish Premiership rivals Hibs also had a £, offer accepted by Scunthorpe, but the former PSV Eindhoven, Dordrecht and Willem II player chose Aberdeen.After coming to the Granite City on Friday for discussions with McInnes Ojo was convinced to join the Reds.When asked about his reasons for choosing the Dons, Ojo said: “All the effort they put into it. At first I did my research online and spoke to certain players.“I didn’t really want to come up at first based on what people told me, but that’s another lesson I’ve learned.“I’m , but I’m still learning, and you have to come up and see things for yourself and get your own impression.“When I came up I spoke to the gaffer. Russ Richardson also had a big part to play.“I saw the city and saw how big the club was and I thought this was the right step for me in my career.“Hewas influential because I was in Edinburgh and he was still ringing me.“He wanted to come and get me from Edinburgh in the middle of the night.“I said: ‘I’ll come up, I’ll drive myself, don’t worry about it.’“I came up and he spent a full day with me which made me feel welcome.“We had talks about football and not only about football because there is more in le than football.“He touched something in me and was influential in my decision.”Ojo was also shown Aberdeen’s new training complex at Kingsford which is scheduled for completion in October.He added: “That was impressive.“I’ve been at some nice training grounds. But I’m looking forward to this one because everything is going to be new.”Aberdeen boss McInnes is delighted to have landed Ojo.With Bryson recovering from an ankle ligament problem and Stephen Gleeson out after knee surgery the Pittodrie gaffer felt he needed to strengthen the central midfield area.McInnes said: “I couldn’t be more pleased to get Funso. He is a player who will fulfil a key position within my squad.“He is a very talented player and I am delighted he has decided to come and work with us at Aberdeen.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead golf club champions","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowRoss Sinclair, pictured above left, is the  Lochgilphead Golf Club men#s champion.The handicap champion is David Sinclair, above right, and "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Front line staff are working hard to provide care in very dficult circumstances, but care in the community can only workproperly resourced by senior management.It is hard to avoid the conclusion that many of the decisions to sht care away from centres such as hospitals are as much to do with saving money as the genuine best interest of patients.In times of recession it is, once again, the most vulnerable in society who bear the brunt.The rain is teeming down as this is being written, but last weekend saw sunshine and crowds in Tarbert.The atmosphere was fantastic for the seafood festival, and there is no doubt the weather helped in a big way.Congratulations to the small band of organisers for another great weekend."},{"url":null,"title":"cruachan returns to ardrishaig birthplace","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA yacht has ed to her birthplace for the first time,  years after being built in an Ardrishaig boatyard.The graceful -foot #Cruachan# was designed and built by Donald Munro and Sons boatbuilders in  for J D Campbell and J  G Wingate.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

Apart from the cones on the street, we never had any issues with bad parking or disturbance from people attending the event.ldquoI could hear some music on the evenings but I liked the atmosphere and it certainly wasnrsquot a nuisance. We did attend the family ride on the Sunday, and while there was plenty of mud, I thought theyrsquod done a great job creating such a big event in its first year in Innerleithen.With the proposed plans to redevelop the old mill to create the Mountain Bike Innovation Centre, Tom added: ldquoI think its exciting times to be a resident in Innerleithen and I hope events like these continue to grow and do well here.ldquoI remember when Innerleithen was a poor cousin to Peebles and Glentress as an MTB and tourist destination, and I think itrsquos the hard work of local people who have brought Innerleithen to the fore. Most people are excited about the prospects and possible future developments here, and Irsquod hate people to get the wrong impression of the overall community support based on the reported views of a few people who were disturbed in the eventrsquos first year.ldquoHaving said that, I hope the organisers take on board the negative feedback and incorporate improvements into any future events. I know they were in touch with the community council earlier this year before the event, hopefully theyrsquoll keep up this close relationshipthey come back.Meanwhile, Allan Graham who has lived in the town all of his le said without events such as Transcend, the Innerleithen community has nothing.He added: ldquoThe mills have all gone and what we have is biking, walkers etc. Letrsquos embrace whatrsquos coming to us and make the most of it.Jamie Birks echoed this sentiment adding: ldquoThe town has a real and deserved opportunity to be a national hub for outdoor events such as this. So much talent and experience from so many organisations, coupled with truly amazing natural resources that could make such a positive impact on the town ndashwe all want it.Innerleithen Community Council has promised to pass on the complaints raised at the meeting to event organisers, Scottish Borders Council and Police Scotland.But Chairman Marshall Douglas said the community council ldquostrongly supports the Transcend Bike Festival and will continue to work closely with event organisers to ensure the future success of the event."},{"url":null,"title":"cops-ask-help-catch-boy-racers-galashiels","story":"POLICE in Galashiels have called on a local supermarket to help them catch boy racers.For months there have been reports made about young drivers gathering at the Tesco car park.And now officers have asked the firm to take down registration details to help them track down the culprits.PC James Harrison said: ldquoWe are still receiving calls about boy racers in the car park at Tesco on a Saturday night.ldquoIt seemed to get better for a while, but the problem is still there.

The beds are trimmed neatly with green paths of grass and only the odd weed or two can be seen to peer through the burgeoning beetroot and beans.Often yoursquoll also come across one of the volunteers, the gardener oryoursquore very lucky, one or more of the children who help to tend the plants.The Edible Garden is a community garden nestled in the beautul Tweed Valley at Innerleithen and run by a steering group and volunteers.Its aim is to inspire, motivate and build confidence in adults and children of all ages and abilities to learn how to grow their own food to promote a healthy lestyle, to encourage the community to prevent food waste, reuse recycle to reduce landfill and to reduce their carbon footprint.The St Ronanites are horticulturists turned eco warriors, providing a range of workshops for the community in how to grow, harvest and recycle.Lessons include guidance on composting, propagating, soil preparation, solar power for growing, food preservation, seasonal planting, and bugs pests in the garden, carbon footprint and food waste recycling.The vibrant goings-on have recently stepped up a gear with the efforts of the steering group of Shirley Spence, Lisa Kurowski Leslie and Alex Smithson to win a share of the Tweeddale Localities Bid funding.This has secured the future of the garden for years to come and means that the sht of responsibility from the climate change group lsquoYou Can Cookrsquo to the independent body known as lsquoThe Edible Gardenrsquo is now complete.Shirley Spence said the support of the public and the staff and children of St Ronanrsquos Primary School have been crucial to this success.ldquoIt will allow the steering group to provide a part-time gardener, Alex Smithson, serve the schoolrsquos Eco Group with practical experience of environmental issues and fund the supply of equipment, compost and building materials for the foreseeable future.However, for those of you who have yet to find the garden, perhaps it would be helpful to whet your appetite with some details of what the project has accomplished so far.Firstly, as well as offering expert gardening advice to the supporters, Alex plans and prepares the crops and liaises with school staff to provide classes for the children to teach them about their environment and carbon footprint.The classes look at areas from recycling and horticulture to microbes and ecology. This educational programme and the informal weekly gardening clubs allow both adults and children to experience a connection to nature in a supported environment and take home some of the produce theyrsquove grown too.Shirley explained: ldquoAll of the children at the school benefit from the fruit and vegetables grown in the enclosed garden but also from the orchard and the fruit bushes at the schools entrance. They can pick their own five-a day where the food hasnrsquot ever met a plastic tray or a supermarket checkout.The gardenrsquos outreach doesnrsquot stop at the food though.

Niels resides in Calornia where he plays golf on the college circuit but he was raised in Campbeltown where his mum still works in the local hospital.He has been a member of Machrihanish Golf Club for  years since the age of four. Always a very promising junior, Niels announced his arrival in style at the championship on Saturday.His round began rather innocuously with a bogey five at the world-famous first hole. However, he followed that bogey by birdieing the second, third and fourth holes to take him to two-under-par through four.Another birdie on the eighth took him out in  shots, three under par. Turning for home, his round really caught fire with a fantastic eagle three at the par-five th.He then birdied the th and th to take his score to seven under par after  holes.The course record at Machrihanish is held jointly by George MacMillan and Stuart Campbell at seven-under-par s and Niels had the record firmly in his focus as he came down the home stretch.The disappointment of a bogey five at the tough par-four th was soon extinguished with a birdie two at the short th as Niels continued to blaze a trail over the magnicent Old Tom Morris-designed links.His sizzling round continued with assured pars at the th, th and th holes to finish with a course record equaling seven-under-par .A club spokesperson said: #This is an incredible achievement by the young golfer, whose record will take pride of place on the wall beside the cards of great champions, Stuart Campbell and George MacMillan, in the new clubhouse once it is ready.#George started his round early on Saturday and was the leader in the pro-shop after his own fantastic round of two-under-par .

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"letter open letter to dog owners","story":"While responsible dog owners take care to ensure their dogs are under control at all times, there are still a number who do not # and seem unaware of the potential consequences of their actions.There has been a disturbing rise in the number of sheep and other livestock attacks, and we are hoping to enlist your help in raising awareness of dog #worrying# which will, in turn, assist the authorities, farmers and land-users.If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land the owner, or person in charge of the animal at the time, is guilty of a criminal offence.Section  of the DogsAct  defines #worrying# as:Such incidents cause distress to the animals and often lead to them being injured and or killed.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child. They were the answer to the riddle rule, and so made the race possible.What were those two words If you havenrsquot already worked it out then re-read the story carefully. If you still donrsquot know, and want to know the answer, then I will give it next week.Or perhaps you could ask a child.

History is the way we view and see things that happened in the past. That view is limited by a number of factors. The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-school-bus-operator-change","story":"Families whose children attend two secondary schools in East Lothian were stunned to discover that local firm PrenticeCoaches would no longer be used to transport the youngsters when schoolsafter the summer.The news was broken to them by Prentice, which is based in Haddington, last week, sparking a furious reaction from a number of parents.Now a petition has been launched calling for Prentice to have the contract, which has allegedly been awarded to a rival firm, given back.One mother whose children attend Knox Academy in Haddingtonand are bussed in from Gford said that she was shocked by the news.She said: ldquoPrentice have been looking after our children for  years and they are being replaced with no consultation or discussion.ldquoParents know the drivers and trust them to look after their children.ldquoIt is beyond belief that the council would simply put a dferent company in place without even consulting with the families affected.A petition calling for theof Prentice has collected more than  signatures since it was launched online.It says: ldquoPrentice provide a community service where parents feel reassured and comfortable putting their children on the buses.ldquoWe believe East Lothian [Council] has chosen to put cost over service and safety.ldquoThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the current service.ldquoThis is simply a cost-cutting exercise which could potentially put our children at risk.Prentice provided bus services for Knox Academy and North Berwick High School but has now lost the contract for those services.Ross Prentice, the company boss, admitted that he was ldquodisappointed by the councilrsquos decision.The company said: ldquoIt is a sad day.

A truly disruptive person indeed.:Catholic Church and Orange Order move to ease tensions on Glasgow Orange WalksOn these thankfully rare occasions, when officers of the law cross the line and let vile sexual crudities slip, I believe we must put our shock to one side and attempt to understand the context of such outbursts.

At least it wasnrsquot a Catholic priest this year!Although there was a distinct lack of reportage on this exuberantannual celebration in the mainstream media ndash even in the so-called unionist press ndash I can confirm this was a rousing, joyous, inclusive, family parade. This was evident in the child-friendly aesthetic of Disney-like toy soldier unorms, comedygoose-stepping and Les Dawson-style musical timing ndash performed by men all clearly in robust health despite their advanced years, with the beetroot hue on their faces indicative of a burning internalpassion.Indeed, the jubilant onlookers could have lit cigarettes off the marchersrsquocheeksthey had so wished, an act perhapssymbolicof the undying torch flame of unionist fervourpassed on through countlessfuture generations.On the evidence of this annual celebration of inherited reality tunnels, it will surely not be long until Orangefest ndash first and last held in  ndash makes a triumphantto George Square.

Is it the thin end of a wedge  Municipal neglect has a habit of creeping outwards like a bad stain.And so wersquore heartened to see some benign citizen development up on the Gallowgate at the old Bairdrsquos Bar next door to Barrowland. This is the cleverest, the most respectful of renovations. Residues of Celtic green paint cling to the ceiling. The materials- dark wood , brick, sandstone, clunking Victorian iron, obscure glass- encapsulate Glasgowrsquos vernacular architecture for me. Whatever was sound has been kept along with the odd bit of evocative whimsy. The old tenement stairs that now lead to nowhere have been kept above the bar. You pass a deep ceramic sink for washing clothes, the sort that was once commonplace in old ldquosteamies\". Such artacts are on display at the Peoplersquos Palace, and  Gallowgate only adds to the collection.In other ways  Gallowgate marches to its own tune, eschewing copycat menus. Its offering manages to be original, yet it fits its setting and location: simple, unfussy dishes, forgotten classics, such as corned beef hash, at reasonable prices that are realistic for its neighbourhood.Everything that reasonably can be is made in the kitchen, apart from the sourdough bread from the Freedom Bakery, and only ace bakers could better that. But the kitchen cures its own salt beef, we discover, as we kick off with the meaty, peppery salt beef fritters perched on frills of amiably mild sauerkraut, napped by punchy Reuben sauce and melting cheese.  Gallowgate clearly isnrsquot immune to cooking trends though. On todayrsquos specials menu therersquos caullower, pale-roasted, in a tumble of mint leaves, pea shoots, soft soaked raisins, toasted pine kernels, and grated Manchego cheese with perhaps a bit of sherry vinegar in its dressing, an idea I intend to steal for home cooking purposes.Boiled gammon and buttered cabbage with spring onion mash  Itrsquos got to be well done, or itrsquos dull. But this ham is a dream, not too salty, with a pale pink blush, it disintegrates in the mouth. The scallions, and a generous dosage of butter, make the mash unctuous the cabbage, Savoy Irsquod say, glistens with even more butter. No complaints from me on that last point.For pound, our hot salt beef sandwich is a steal. Our second chance to taste the succulent, well balanced cured beef, to appreciate just how well that Freedom Bakery bread with its tangible, but not overly chewy, crust works brilliantly in this context. Pickled cucumber spikes the meat and bread with vinegary sharpness while creamy horseradish lubricates it. Out of curiosity we have ordered a side of vinegar peas, another historical homage: back in the day they used to be sold to the Barrowland crowds from a whole in the wall eatery next door. Actually, these are broad beans, and a couple is enough for me, but they come with more sourdough and a pat of French butter. For pound, wersquore not complaining.Our servers are jolly and their enthusiasm for the deep fried custard, which turns out to be more like a doughnut with a custard core, is infectious. But wersquore more smitten with the rhubarb and ginger crumble, its deep layer of stem ginger-spiked fruit, its knobbly, crunchy topping.The people who opened  Gallowgate seem to get old Glasgow, its mood, its character, it value.

Thats what we noticed first,\" she said.Some shows like Frozen were among the Broadway shows to announce it had cancelled performances.When the lights went out early on Saturday evening, thousands of people streamed out of darkened Manhattan buildings, crowding Broadway next to bumper-to-bumper traffic.People in Hells Kitchen began directing traffic themselves as stoplights and walking signs went dark.Ginger Tidwell, a dance teacher and Upper West Side resident, was about to order at the West Side diner on Broadway and West th Street just before pm.\"When the lights started flickering, and then were out,\" she said.\"We got up and left, walking up Broadway with all the traffic lights out and businesses dark.\"But once they got to West nd Street, they found another diner that was open and had power.\"It was still sunny and everyone just came out to the street because they lost power and air conditioning - it was super-crowded,\" she said.\"Everyone was hanging out on the street on a nice night.

Lting it out, he can see the damp in his housersquos earthen sump.He can smell it too. ldquoItrsquos like walking by a river, ldquo he says, ldquoitrsquos like fresh water . It attracts flies, itrsquos not very nice.Since  Mr Wilson, a gas engineer, has been regularly lowering himself in to the hole under to house to check he is not being flooded.FULL STORY:Thousands of Scots in legal limbo as roads unadoptedHe has a couple of pumps - one of which switches on automatically when the usual damp turns to full-flow cascade of rainwater. And Mr Wilson always knows when it is going to get bad, a day or two after the heavens open.There had been no history of flooding on the property on Eastfield Avenue, where Mr Wilson has lived for  years. What changed  The Hawthorn Estate was built.Murray Wilson in his cellar, picture by Colin MearnsJust up the a brae from his semi are neat rows of tightly packed new-build white homes. This used to be a grassy, partially wooded hill. Now it is asphalted over.Everybody knows this is where the water comes from. Mr Wilson, clutching a small plastic container, explains how. ldquoThis is dye, he says. ldquoWorkers came and poured in to drains up in the Hawthorn estate. And, sure enough, it eventually turned up here.The hill acted ldquolike a sponge, Mr Wilson says. ldquoIt was a natural green belt. I never thought there would be houses on it because it was a slope.Barratt was the builder. They have been trying to fix snagging on their drains for years. Things, Mr Wilson says, are getting better. The flooding is not as extreme was it once was.FULL STORY:Thousands of Scots in legal limbo as roads unadoptedThe local council, South Lanarkshire, has not been, so far, impressed. Officials have sucked their teeth and told Barratt they will not ldquoadopt the roads until the drainage problems are solved.How Mr Wilson pumps out his cellarWhich means that a decade after the white houses went up, the roads, Hawthorn Way and Hawthorn Avenue, are still the responsibility of the builder, not the council.These streets are among hundreds in Scotland stuck in a legal limbo between developers and councils.Mr Wilson is also in a kind of limbo. He does not want to sell his home. But he could not do so evenhe did.ldquoThere would need to be a home report and they would see all this, he says, waving at goods stacked on pallets to keep them dry. ldquoThe floor has all eroded through the water. ldquoThe new Hawthorn EstateBut Mr Wilson has sympathy for neighbours whose streets are not adopted. In England similar issues have hit house prices and left whole communities with substandard services. In Scotland - where there are thought to be some , new homes on streets still to be adopted - the issues has barely been recognised.Mr Wilson says: ldquoThroughout Scotland there are lots of people who buy a house and think everything is fine, the drainage is fine and the road is adopted.ldquoBut then - lo and behold - it turns out they are not because they have not submitted the proper drawings or it is not fit for purpose.FULL STORY:Thousands of Scots in legal limbo as roads unadoptedThere is hope of a resolution in the Cambuslang case. Gordon Mackay, Head of Roads and Transportation at South Lanarkshire Council, told The Herald ldquoWe are in dialogue with Barratt Homes and Scottish Water in an attempt to have them resolve the outstanding deficiencies in the drainage system that would allow Hawthorn Way and Hawthorn Avenue to be adopted. We are currently awaiting confirmation that necessary remedial works have been satisfactorily completed.Hawthorn EstateDavid Scott, managing director, Barratt West Scotland said: ldquoWe are working with Scottish Water and South Lanarkshire Council to resolve offsite works to improve the drainage, which will hopefully be completed by year end, allowing the local authority to take ownership of the roads affected. We are sorry for any inconvenience this has caused.Mr Wilson, in his cellar, has been waiting a long time. ldquoMyself and my neighbours are still not happy, he says.ldquoAll the modications they have done have really helped but I am still using gallons of disinfectant to take away that smell.ldquoAnd I have had years of worry. Rain is not like it used to be. The climate is changing. Now you get a monsoon any time.And that, for Mr Wilson, means pumping out his cellar."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/1392808.jpg?type=article-full","title":"thousands-scots-legal-limbo-roads-unadopted","story":"As many as , new-build houses are on roads which have not been \"adopted\" by local councils because they are substandard, previously unpublished figures suggest.That means many residents are living for years on defacto \"private\" roads while developers unsnag problems with drains, lighting and surfaces.In England, campaigners believe such problems are forcing house sellers to offer discounts on price.:The perils of living close to one of Scotlandrsquos new but unadopted streetsLabour MSP James Kelly believes the scale of the issue means Scottish authorities need to get on top of it.Mr Kelly has been supporting constituents affected by a decade-long saga in Cambuslang, where the local South Lanarkshire Council has refused to adopt a new Barratt scheme after people in nearby streets suffered flooding.He said: \"The experience of locals in Cambuslang shines a light on the issue of how lsquounadoptedrsquo roads can disrupt the lives of people in neighbouring streets in established communities.\"It is clear the problem is becoming more widespread and houses are being erected without proper consideration being given to the surrounding infrastructure.\"The issue needs to be carefully examined by councils and the Scottish Government. \"The current regulations are clearly inadequate and a proper process for housing completions needs to ensure that new and existing residents are not adversely affected by new developments.\"James Kelly MSPThe Scottish numbers have been calculated by an architect and retired senior strategic planner who has peppered local authorities with Freedom of Information requests.:The perils of living close to one of Scotlandrsquos new but unadopted streetsDave Sutton, who is also a former Labour councillor in Bristol, reckons there are now some , new homes which are not on adopted road.He added: \"My summation is that some % of these will move through the adoption process - but which can often take  to  years. So more than ,likely to be with an adoption problem.\"Ever since  Scottish councils have taken over privately built roads from housing developers - as long as they meet standards.Public sector insiders stress that adoption can be a long and drawn-out process as roads officials pressurise developers to get their streets up to scratch.Cash-strapped councils already have a huge backlog in roads and lighting repairs and do no want to take on extra work and costs that should have been done by private builders.Getting precise figures on how many people or homes are affected by non-adopted roads is almost impossible.That is because dferent councils count the issue in dferent ways. Glasgow, for example, as of , had  development sites were roads were not adopted. Neighbouring East Dunbartonshire had  developments with around  homes. Falkirk, again as of , had one road that was still to be adopted  years after it was built.This is on top of the many pre- private roads already scattered across Scotland - where homeowners are expected to pay the upkeep.Stewart Turner, of the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, chairs the Society of Chief Officers of Transportation in Scotland. He said: \"Owners of private roads may request that their road be adopted by the roads authority and provided this road joins the public road and it is to a standard acceptable to the roads authority, then it would be adopted.\"Also roads authorities may ask the frontagers of private roads to make improvement and they may,they consider appropriate, contribute to this cost. \"Throughout Scotland the ious Roads Authorities have a dferent approach to this power.\"However taking into account the Roads Authoritiesrsquo primary responsibility to maintain the public roads then it is considered important that the available resource is directed to the public roads. Additional financial resource would be required to improve the extensive private road network.\"Mr Sutton has been in a y correspondence with the Scottish Government over what he sees as its failure to keep track of the scale of the issue.A spokesman for the government said: \"We do not collect information on roadsrsquo adoption status, as that is a matter for local authorities, who are responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of roads they have adopted.\"Un-adopted or private roads are the responsibility of housing developers or private home owners, who should consult their relevant local authority on adoption arrangements.\""},{"url":null,"title":"sophy-ridge-andrew-marr-sunday-politics-scotland-review","story":"First to come a cropper was Sky News journalist Niall Paterson, standing in for a holidaying Sophy Ridge. The Scot, from Alloway, had clearly not read Sunday Breakfast Show Presenting for Dummies.We know this because at ., an hour before the show was due to start, he had spilled ketchup down the front of his trousers. How did we know  Because a helpful colleague had posted a video of Paterson frantically trying to clean the stain.The lesson of the story was: thou shalt not have breakfast while wearing your on air outfit. It was his birthday, too. Happily, there was a change of fortune on the way with guest Gina Miller gting Paterson a scoop. Miller was the businesswoman who ensured the UK parliament had its say before the Brexit process could begin. She was now ldquoreassembling her legal team, which made them sound like The Avengers, to fight any attempt to prorogue parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit.A letter had been sent last Thursday to Boris Johnson, she revealed, telling him that suspending parliament would be an abuse of a Prime Ministerrsquos powers and as such would provoke legal action.The face on which egg had been liberally smeared belonged to Neil Basu, the assistant commissioner of the politan Police, who suggested journalists could be prosecuted for publishing leaked documents. The Sunday papers were outraged, and television then picked up the baton, with almost every guest asked to choose a side between the plucky, freedom defending media or the police. No-one chose the latter.The weekrsquos other main story, the continuing row over antisemitism in Labour, was chewed over again. On Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Dame Margaret Hodge said she felt ldquodevastated on watching the Panorama programme featuring eight whistleblowers from the party. Why not just quit, Paterson asked. Dame Margaret said her relationship with Labour had been like a marriage: while the last three years had been terrible, she had had  years of complete happiness.Paterson continued the marriage theme by saying that finding out your other half was antisemitic might be considered reasonable grounds for orce.Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry was in a similarly mournful mode on The Andrew Marr Show. ldquoNobody can pretend that there isnrsquot an ongoing problem within the Labour Party about antisemitism, about our processes for dealing with it, she said.: Scottish Labour attackedLike Dame Margaret, she thought it was wrong to set lawyers on the whistleblowers. ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be going for the messengers, we should be looking at the message.On Marr, the editor of The Spectator, Fraser Nelson, said Labour was in a state of civil war, split between Jeremy Corbyn and the membership on one side and Tom Watson and MPs on the other. ldquoThey are going to go at each other all summer. It is just going to get worse.Marrrsquos main guest was Amber Rudd, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. Given she had now accepted no-deal Brexit as an option, having previously voted against, Marr wanted to knowthis was an elegant pivot towards reality or a screeching careerist U-turn. In the dayrsquos most unsurprising answer, Ms Rudd said it was the former. She had changed her mind because the circumstances had changed. Marr then reminded her that she had once said another referendum was preferable to a no deal. Did she still believe that  Turned out she no longer agreed with herself on that point, either.: Minister told to get a gripMs Rudd will be remembered for saying during the EU referendum campaign that Boris Johnson was the le and soul of the party but not the man you would want to drive you home at eveningrsquos end. Could Marr take it that she would not serve in a Johnson cabinet ldquoIrsquom fighting for a Cabinet for Jeremy Hunt. While that is still the case I donrsquot think we should speculate on the alternative candidate.Marr then teased her with a Tweet from MP Nick Boles, which said: ldquoSo she will let Boris Johnson drive her home after all ndash so long as itrsquos in a ministerial limo. Mr Boles had later softened, saying that Ms Rudd brought ldquohumanity to government and that he hoped she stayed, whoever won. ldquoHersquos a generous spirited fellow, Marr agreed.It was left to Gordon Brewer on Sunday Politics Scotland to cut through the static and find out something that mattered to the majority of people watching.: Supplies cannot be guaranteedHis main guest was Michael Russell, Scotlandrsquos Constitutional Relations Secretary, who said that in the event of a no deal Brexit he could not guarantee the supply of essential medicines.Arrangements had been in place for a March  departure, but London had yet to finalise its preparations for October , he said.Not that he wanted that to be the major takeaway from politics this weekend. The real headline message, according to Mr Russell, was that the two candidates for the Tory leadership were trying to normalise the notion of no deal.ldquoWersquoll decide the headlines, Brewer replied.Freedom of the press is still alive and well.

Itrsquos too much. I know that now but itrsquos a bit late.He is, though,chairman of his hometown football club, Cowdenbeath FC, but admits there is ldquono pleasure in the role, adding: ldquoIf you look to see the record of Cowdenbeath... you will see that this is another burden I have to carry around with me.He also says that everyone is entitled to a defence, but admits there is a downside to his position: ldquoIf you believe in the legal system, you believe that everyone is entitled to a defence. Then you canrsquot pick and choose.ldquoYou canrsquot say, lsquoWell, Irsquoll defend somebody who does this, but Irsquom not going to defend somebody who commits a sexual offence or a mass murder, or whatever, because thatrsquos just not right.\"You take on somebody whorsquos accused of crime and you defend them in respect of that crime.But he admits to finding it ldquodficult sometimes due to how up-close-and-personal his position takes him to mans inhumanity to man.One of his most successful defences was that of former gangster Paul Ferris, who in  was found not guilty of all seven charges against him, including that of murdering Arthur Thompson Jr.He also defended Mitchell, who in  was sentenced to le imprisonment for murdering his -year-old girlfriend, Jodi Jones, and Tobin. Now , he will die in jail, having been convicted of the murders of Angelika Kluk in Glasgow in , Vicky Hamilton in  and Dina McNicol in .Tobin also features in the Crime Files series, in which Professor Wilson, who grew up in Carluke, maintains the killer is also infamous Barras dance hall murderer Bible John.:How Craig Whytes QC Donald Findlay had the fraud trial jury laughingFindlay says: ldquoI do worry. I worry about what is happening during a trial. I tend to take work home with me, and after a trialthe client has been convicted then I worry that perhaps I could or should have done better.\"But during a trial you do see some pretty horrendous things. Manrsquos inhumanity to man is pretty endless and you just have to harden yourself and look as it as best as you can as a piece of evidence.ldquoBut some things I have looked at can be quite distressing, involving dead children and so on.As a seven-year-old in the s, it was reading about Manuel that lead him toward his career. The US-born serial killer, who moved to Uddingston, Lanarkshire, was convicted of murdering seven people across Lanarkshire and southern Scotland between  and his arrest in January , but is thought to have murdered two more.Earlier this year, Findlay narrated an audiobook detailing the le of Manuel, who was taken to the gallows at Barlinnie in  after one of the most sensationalist trials in legal history that saw him sack his lawyers and conduct his own defence.When the -hour audiobook, Manuel: Portrait of a Serial Killer, was released, Findlay said: \"The Manuel case fascinated me since I was a child. As a seven-year-old, I read every word that was reported.\"The challenge of representing someone faced with so many serious charges is one of the reasons I became a defence lawyer.\"Findlay also says during the programme that the increasing use of science by prosecutors in court cases is a \"very real concern\", in part because some can form views by watching TV.He says: ldquoOne problem is, members of the public get a lot of their science from CSI: Miami and New York and all these kind of things. And thatrsquos not real. But thatrsquos the impression you get.ldquoPeople think itrsquos as simple as that but, of course, itrsquos not. So you really have to understand science, you have to be wary of science because therersquos a lot of junk science out there.\"Crime Files begins on Sunday on BBC Scotland at pm."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-s-scots-school-uniform-maker-lochaven-scotland-bans-cashmere","story":"Now the Scottish knitwear firm which dressed Harry Potter and his wizard chums has announced it is casting aside the use of cashmere ndash because of the risk of animal cruelty.Lochaven of Scotland, the original supplier of school unorms in the Harry Potter film series, has made the decisions following discussions with the charity Peta, which has campaigned against the use of cashmere.The company supplies all the replica cardigans, scarves, tank tops and jerseys sold in theme parks and merchandising shops around the world, even as far away as Japan and the Far East. And it could soon be that would-be wizards wonrsquot be clothing themselves in wool at all as the company looks to make a switch away from animal fibres to plant-based or synthetic wools.Cashmere wool is a fibre obtained from special types of goats, rather than wool from sheep and lambs. Company director Keith Murray said that it was becoming increasingly problematic to source high-quality strands as much of the wool which claims to be cashmere is too poor quality to be sold in the UK.:Harry Potter revealed as most inspirational character in childrens literatureThe firm has been cutting the amount it uses for a number of years, and now agreed with Peta that it was time to phase it out entirely.Mr Murray said: ldquoPeta get a bad rap, but they are decent enough people. They showed us their research and we have made a conscious decision that we wonrsquot go back to using cashmere.ldquoWe use British wool and it has to be the best quality possible, so it doesnrsquot make sense to use low-quality wool claiming to be cashmere any more.Lochaven, which is based in Stewarton, was set up by the Red Cross after the Second World War for employment of disabled former servicemen and over the years it has became part of the Haven products charity. But it lost its charitable status and the loss of a major customer saw it enter receivership in .Mr Murray, who previously specialised in helping distressed companies, noticed signed photos of the cast of Harry Potter during a visit to the factory, and found out Lochavenrsquos connection to the series. The firm had never marketed the products, and after a takeover, which saw all jobs saved, Mr Murray proceeded to take them down that road.Now Lochaven supplies garments to Warner Bros, which sells them via its website, and in upmarket retailers throughout Europe and Japan.:Row over ten day closure of Harry Potter-featured West Highland LineThe official Wizarding World theme park in Orlando began stocking Harry Potter knitwear in  ndash and dressing its staff in their outfits ndash and the Harry Potter studio tour at Leavesden studios in London followed in , then Diagon Alley Orlando and the Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Osaka, Japan, opened in . One of Lochavenrsquos busiest Harry Potter outlets is Platform frac at Kingrsquos Cross Station in London.A spokesman at Lochaven added: ldquoApart from the Harry Potter products we also work with some of the best-known clothing brands in the world and later this year will be launching a range with a hugely popular Japanese brand made from  per cent animal-free fibre. A recent Peta Asia video investigation conducted on cashmere farms and in abattoirs in China and Mongolia ndash the two countries responsible for  per cent of the worldrsquos cashmere production ndash showed workers pinning down crying goats as their legs were bent and their hair was torn out with sharp metal combs.In China, goats deemed no longer profitable were slaughtered after workers hit them on the head with a hammer in an attempt to stun them. And in Mongolia, workers dragged them by one leg on to the abattoir floor before slitting their throats.ldquoGentle goatsrsquo hair is torn out and the animals are hit with hammers and hacked to death, all for cashmere sweaters and scarves, says Peta director Elisa Allen.ldquoLochaven International of Scotland has just stood up to cruelty to animals in a huge way, and Peta is urging all other clothing companies to follow its compassionate, business-savvy lead and go cashmere-free."},{"url":null,"title":"poldark-series-5-episode-1-review","story":"BBC****NO more of Rossrsquos smouldering peepers, farewell the soft tumble of Demelzarsquos titian curls.

So how can we try and change our culture to a more cycling-friendly one Therersquos no quick solution to this one, but after infrastructure and enforcement, education is a key element of an effective road safety strategy because misconceptions and myths about cycling contribute to a culture of conflict on the roads.ldquoCyclists donrsquot pay road tax is a statement often used to explain why some people feel they, as drivers, have more rights on the roads. The reality is road tax ended in the s, and we all pay for the roads through general or local taxation. Vehicle Excise Duty is based on vehicle emissions .A second myth is that there isnrsquot cycle proficiency training in schools any more. In reality, Bikeability Scotland cycling training is giving children the skills and confidence to cycle safely. At least , children are trained each year and all children are able to receive free training.Another common misunderstanding is over road positioning. You should cycle away from the gutter. Itrsquos legal to cycle in the middle of the lane and sometimes itrsquos the safest place, For instancethe road is narrow and itrsquos unsafe for a car to pass, when approaching a junction or to avoid potholes or doors of parked cars being opened in your path.We often hear the argument that bad behaviour, or perceived arrogance, from people cycling provokes careless or dangerous driving and that safety would improveldquocyclists behaved better. Red-light running, to take an oft-cited example of cycling behaviour, is wrong, whether cycling or driving, and too many people do it. But itrsquos not acceptable or logical to hold all people cycling responsible simply because they use the same mode of transport. ldquoCyclists are not a homogenous group but inidual people, just as drivers are.The fact is that many people who cycle are being intimidated, injured or worse, while cycling correctly. And are we really suggesting that someone who is cycling irresponsibly deserves a near-death experience Ultimately, resentful attitudes towards ldquocyclists shouldnrsquot influence actual driving behaviour. People on bikes are undeniably more vulnerable on roads than people in vehicles. Driving too close is a careless or dangerous driving offence because it can kill or seriously injure someone.Almost everyonersquos behaviour ndash including some people who cycle ndash has room for improvement to create a cycle of acceptance, and remove the perception of two tribes going to war on the roads or shared use paths.ldquoWhat about them  Deal with their behaviour first  is never an excuse for careless or dangerous behaviour by anyone. Myths and misconceptions about people cycling need to be banished and enforcement has to focus on the behaviours with greatest potential for harm, just as the Police Operation Close Pass does. Expanding cycling infrastructure is the key priority, creating dedicated space for cycling, to the benefit of everyone.We have a long way to go but quick change is possible. With the increased investment in cycle infrastructure, an increased focus on access to bikes, and greater education and understanding to create a cycle of acceptance, a cycling-friendly nation is no longer an impossible dream."},{"url":null,"title":"alan-roden-tensions-london-edinburgh-going-get-far-worse","story":"Discovering how well this had gone down with the easily pleased hacks, Scottish Secretary Jim Murphy tried to outdo him the following year by providing a slap-up curry at his own festive bash.This was before austerity started to bite and relationships soured: by the time Mr Salmond left office, journalists were treated to bowls of crisps in the basement of St Andrewrsquos House.:Marianne Taylor: The SNP is right to back abortion in Northern IrelandBut during the three years when Scotland had an SNP government in Edinburgh, and a Labour government in Westminster, there was a newfound rivalry between the Scottish Government and the Scotland Office.Until Mr Murphy took over, the job of Scottish Secretary had ndash literally ndash been part-time.When the future Scottish Labour leader was appointed by Gordon Brown, it became the full-time role it is today.According to SNP figures, communications staffing costs for the Scotland Office have soared from around pound, in - to over pound, a decade later, and yesterday there was a fresh row about the departmentrsquos spending on overseas travel.The Nationalists have said this is justication to abolish the department, complaining that itrsquos spending public money \"pumping out propaganda\" promoting Scotlandrsquos place in the UK.The reality, of course, is that this is what governments do. The Scottish Government is also spending public money promoting Scotland with its effective \"Scotland is Now\" tourism campaign ndash ostensibly aimed at a global market, but clearly serving a dual purpose by suggesting to the domestic market that Scotlandrsquos values are distinct.The political tensions that started under Salmond and Murphy have continued, with present incumbent David Mundell facing near-weekly calls from the SNP to resign, often without much of an explanation as to why he should fall on his sword.Intergovernmental relations between the UK and Scottish governments are \"under pressure like never before\", according to SNP MP Pete Wishart.Mr Wishart acknowledged that work between civil servants is \"conducted perfectly well\", and that is certainly what those behind the scenes insist is the case.If there is a problem, then, itrsquos among the politicians, and thatrsquos hardly surprising ndash and not really anything new.It takes two to tango.:Scottish Government cannot guarantee medicine supplies under no-deal BrexitThe SNPrsquos well-worn narrative about a dysal Westminster system doesnrsquot stand up to scrutinythe political leaders work in harmony together. There is every reason for the SNP to be perfectly happy that intergovernmental relations are considered \"under pressure like never before\".After all, the Scottish Governmentrsquos stated aim is independence and the abolition of intergovernmental relations with the UK.But the UK Governmentrsquos stated aim is to preserve the Union, so it is unsurprising that the role of the Scotland Office has steadily increased over the years.Andtensions are strained now, itrsquos only going to get far worse.One of Theresa Mayrsquos final acts of her premiership was to announce a review of the way the UK Government handles the current devolved settlement.That doesnrsquot mean a shake-up of powers as some initially thought it means a sht in mindset for every single UK Government department.Today, Whitehall civil servants are told to ensure their work fits in with the devolution arrangement ndash is the Scottish Government kept engaged  How does the Sewel Convention apply In the future, the questions will be: Does our work strengthen the Union  Or does it potentially advance the case of independence ndash andso, letrsquos think again.Will it make the UK civil service more politicised  Probably.But that happened long ago here in Scotland.Last year, the Scottish Tories complained that civil servants were contacting witnesses ahead of appearances at a Holyrood committee, and highlighted graphics being tweeted by Government accounts which \"used the SNPrsquos party political language\".Valid concerns at the time, but such complaints are likely to appear hypocritical in the near future.And itrsquos not just civil servants who are being told to change their mindset ndash Cabinet ministers are too.The message is clear:the Union is to be saved, the UK Government needs to loosen its purse strings in Scotland, as The Herald exclusively revealed last week.That includes splashing the cash in both reserved and devolved areas ndash the Edinburgh City Deal for example has delivered cash for the capitalrsquos university and the UK Government is helping fund Edinburghrsquos new concert hall, even though culture is devolved.The argument is that such a venue is of cultural importance for the entire UK. Expect much more of the same to follow.Current Chancellor Philip Hammond has been a bulwark against this ever since he moved into Number , arguing that itrsquos unfair on English taxpayers as Scotland already receives its share of funding through the Barnett formula.It means spending money twice over north of the Border, he complains, with some justication.But the order has now gone out loud and clear that this is the price to pay to save the Union.And nobody has done more to achieve this mindset change than David Mundell.He has spent years quietly and effectively persuading his Cabinet colleagues of the risk to the Union and explaining to Whitehall departments they must learn to understand devolution.Next week, just moments before Theresa Mayrsquos final PMQs before she heads to the palace will be the last Scottish Questions before summer.No fan of Boris Johnson, it could be Mr Mundellrsquos last appearance at the despatch box.ButPrime Minister Johnson wants to avoid going down in history as the man who lost the Union, he would be well advised to consider keeping Mr Mundell in post.He should ask himself who does Nicola Sturgeon want as Scottish Secretary  The assured David Mundell or a maverick like Ross Thomson  The First Minister would surely prefer the latter.But whoever is Scottish Secretary, the role is now crucial to Scotlandrsquos constitutional future.Itrsquos a far cry from the part-time job it was before the SNP stormed to power.There will be more money to spend in Scotland far greater UK Government involvement in Scotland ndash and more explosive political rows with the SNP as a result.The great unknown is which government will emerge as the political winner in this latest constitutional battle."},{"url":null,"title":"worst-airline-uk-flight-delays-revealed","story":"The Spanish carrierrsquos UK departures were  minutes late on average in , according to analysis of Civil Aviation Authoritydata by the PA news agency.Thomas Cook Airlines was found to have the second worst performance with flights typically  minutes late, followed by Wizz Air , Norwegian Air UKand Eurowings .:Holidays from hell: your consumer rightsNorwegian Air UK is a British subsidiary of Norwegian Air Shuttle, operating transatlantic flights from Gatwick Airport.Cathay Pacic Airways is the most punctual airline, with aircraft typically taking off just eight minutes behind schedule.The average delay across all flights was  minutes.The ranking features the  airlines with more than , flights from UK airports last year.Average delay figures take into account every flight that operated, including those that were on time.

This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmSerco NorthLink has announced plans to enhance accessibility onboard its vessels, with the introduction of fully-equipped #changing places# toilets.

And I understand that it is very unfortunate that this problem, while unrelated to the air traffic controllers’ industrial action, has coincided with it. However, that is not much consolation to frustrated users of the service.“The issue here is that this is a leline service and there are no alternatives for people who simply have to fly. Local people and businesses in the Northern Isles need a reliable service, and we simply cannot afford local service-levels to be reduced. We accept that we have to live with unavoidable weather events, but the recent disruptions have been workforce-related.“HIAL is a Scottish Government-owned organisation and one of the reasons for that is a recognition that it provides a strategically critical part of our transport infrastructure in the Highlands and Islands. It’s way past time for ministers to take a long hard look at the situation and reassure us that they are prepared to intervene on behalf of the travelling public.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The move is a result of a partnership with the organisation PAMISwhich campaigns for these facilities, and has been supported by Transport Scotland.The move comes as a result of research highlighting that , people in the UK need such special assistance and facilities. Users include people with profound and multiple learning disabilities and people with a range of other disabilities including Cerebral Palsy, Motor Neurone disease, Multiple Sclerosis, stroke, some older people and other specic disabilities.The requirements are set out in British Standards, and include:The new toilets are already open on deck six of MV Hjaltland and MV Hrossey, and will be available on board MV Hamnavoe by the end of the year.“This investment is another sign of our commitment to making our facilities as welcoming as possible to everyone in the community,# said Stuart Garrett, managing director at Serco NorthLink Ferries.#It will open up opportunities for many people with disabilities and their familes to visit some of the most beautul parts of Scotland. It also supports those living on the islands when travelling to and from the mainland for leisure and essential healthcare.”The move is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving journeys for all travelers. Earlier this month the company became the first Scottish transport operator to introduce the pioneering Neatebox support service. This followed improvements to the NorthLink website, disability awareness training for staff, and a new partnership with a sign language interpreting agency.Mum and carer Jenny Whinnet, who helped to start the PAMIS campaign  years ago, said: #This is an exciting development for families and carers.#It permits people who need these facilities to travel further afield confidently and with dignity. This is very dferent to the early years of this campaign, when it was so dficult for me to travel with my son Craig because there were no Changing Places toilets available.”Jenny Miller, Chief Executive Officer of PAMIS added: “We’ve been very impressed with the commitment and consideration shown by Serco NorthLink Ferries in developing changing places toilets on their ferries.#They have really listened to the stories from the families and people we work with and who feel excluded from so many activities that we all take for granted. We’re delighted that the Orkney and Shetland ferries will be the first in the country, and possibly the world, to have a Changing Places toilet.”Paul Wheelhouse, minister for energy, connectivity and the islands is pleased to see the new facilities up and running.He said: #This type of improvement is exactly why we set up the Ferries Accessibility Fund.#We know accessible travel not only enables people to enjoy equal access to our beautul country, but it also enables people to fully participate in society and improve the quality of their lives, so we want to continue to identy and remove any disabling barriers which prevent people from making journeys or lead to them having an unpleasant time on board.#It’s very important that Scotland’s ferry services are fully accessible, offering the best passenger experience possible to everyone and this targeted investment marks very welcome progress on that journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Dr Gerome Breen, from the National Institute for Health ResearchMaudsley Biomedical Research Centre and the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology  Neuroscience, at Kingrsquos College London, said: ldquoMetabolic abnormalities seen in patients with anorexia nervosa are most often attributed to starvation.ldquoBut our study shows metabolic dferences may also contribute to the development of the disorder.ldquoFurthermore, our analyses indicate that the metabolic factors may play nearly or just as strong a role as purely psychiatric effects.Another finding was that the genetic basis of anorexia overlaps with other psychiatric disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia.Genetic factors associated with anorexia also influence physical activity, which could explain the tendency for people with anorexia to be highly active, the research indicates.Led by researchers at Kingrsquos College London and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the study is published in Nature Genetics.Eight genetic iants linked to anorexia were identied in the large-scale genome-wide association study. Anorexia is a serious and potentially le-threatening illness, and symptoms include a dangerously low body weight, an intense fear of gaining weight, and a distorted body image.It affects between % to % of women and .-.% of men. It has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness.Researchers combined data collected by the Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative and the Eating Disorders Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium.The dataset included , cases of anorexia and , controls, from  countries across North America, Europe, and Australasia.Professor Janet Treasure, also from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology  Neuroscience, Kingrsquos College London, said: ldquoOver time there has been uncertainty about the framing of anorexia nervosa because of the mixture of physical and psychiatric features.ldquoOur results confirm this duality and suggest that integrating metabolic information may help clinicians to develop better ways to treat eating disorders.The study concludes anorexia may need to be thought of as a hybrid ldquometabo-psychiatric disorder and that it will be important to consider both metabolic and psychological risks factors when exploring new avenues for treatment.copy -.

Not surprisingly, with the majority of the UK’s political focus concentrating on the final stages of the Conservative leadership election, scant attention is being given to how the EU leadership faces its own challenges that should signicantly weaken its hand in dealing with Britain’s departure. Much of our media coverage is exceedingly introverted, displaying an inverted chauvinism that likes nothing better than doing our own country down, especially suggesting the end of our world is nigh. This is counterbalanced only by patriotic sports coverage always looking for new British heroes.This confusing concoction can give a  political perspective and a tendency to underestimate the signicant influence our country has, how popular it is and how our politicians might have a better hand in any negotiations than we appreciate. When confronted by a new British prime minister – most likely to be a bullish Boris Johnson who will be thinking, let’s get the job done or I’ll be out on my ear tout suite – I expect him to highlight the EU’s own problems so the British public’s expectations can be reset.Theresa May never made any attempt to talk up the UK’s strengths and put over the EU’s weaknesses, instead she went down the diplomatic route of pleasantries and platitudes which led inevitably to her making all the concessions on the agenda, timeline, costs and liabilities – never mind the trading arrangements. I expect the new British prime minister to be dferent and to expose how the EU is on the horns of many dilemmas that means co-operation with the UK will be in Brussels’ interest.The EU desperately needs the UK’s money as it already faces huge public deficits and is bizarrely planning to increase spending. Those members that are net contributorsdo not wish to pay more than they have to. The proposed £ billion separation bill will come in handy before they adjust to living without the UK’s annual net contribution of £-£bn – but it is not a fixed figure and is open to modication. While the UK will want to operate under the rule of law and honour past commitments, there is little in the £bn that rests on legal agreements, meaning even going to international arbitration is highly risky for the EU.The EU wants and needs our money, end of. It says it will not reopen negotiations on the now dead Withdrawal Treaty. These two positions are not compatible.A recent report by City banking specialist Bob Lyddon exposed how the UK remains on the hook for at least £bn of EU contingent liabilities, possibly rising to £bnBrexit is extended further, were there to be a banking and credit crisis in the eurozone. The possibility of this event coming to pass rises daily. Lyddon identied a black hole in eurozone finances of one trillion and how “zombie” loans and misleading accounting practices keeps the bad debt from being called in. Just last week Deutsche Bank, one of the banks carrying a horrendous £bn book of toxic assets, announced , redundancies globally, with , of those predicted in London. That will be worse than any single loss of jobs due to Brexit in the Cityand betrays the hood of continuing CBI and Bank of England scaremongering. The EU claims it is solving the eurozone debt crisis but the debt total grows and the bad practices continue. The two positions are not compatible and our new prime minister must ensure the contingent liabilities are removed the day we leave the EU, not least because we were never members of the Eurozone anyway.Thanks to the behind-closed-doors horse-trading at the recent council of ministers, we can also see how the EU’s democracy is a sham. Nominations for presidents of the commission, the council, the Parliament and the European Central Bank resembled musical chairs between the favoured elite rather than elections. The obvious answer is to democratise the process but that means going fully towards a federal Europe Union that has no demos – and against the reviving belief that the nation state is beautul and optimal. The two positions are opposite and incompatible. If EU nations want “more Europe” then that’s up to them but it goes against the tide of sympathy in the UK. If the new prime minister declares May’s Withdrawal Treaty as dead – as he should do –the solution of using GATT Article XXIV that would continue trade from Brexit Day forward without tarfs and quotas becomes more attractive than ever. True, it requires the EU to sign off an outline free trade agreementand critics of this approach argue it will refuse. But wait – it has already offered such a deal to Great Britain . Now that the Republic of Ireland has admitted there will be no customs checks at the Irish border, surely the EU’s offer of an FTA could be extended across the whole of the UK  The EU’s past offer and refusal to extend it is not compatible with the Lisbon Treaty that requires co-operation with departing members. The EU would look in the wrong to the eyes of the whole world. If the EU refuses, it is Brussels that is moving towards a hard Brexit. Such a disrespectful and abrasive approach will play into the hands of the new prime minister, Leavers and the Brexit Party while eating away at support for remaining, finishing off any prospect of a second referendum or the need for a general election.Thanks to all these dilemmas, the EU power brokers have fear in their eyes. Last week the normal conventions of sharing out committee chairs in the European Parliament among all political groupings was abandoned with a cordon sanitaire erected to ensure no European eurosceptics were elected as should be expected. Gentleman’s agreements were ungentlemanly torn up. The fisheries committee anointed as president Chris Davies, a British Liberal Democrat who believes all British waters belong to the EU. Its vice-president is Dutchman, Peter van Dalen, who is responsible for ensuring electric pulse fishing continues in the North Sea.Our new prime minister must change the media mood music by airing these EU dilemmas to put them on the back foot – and change the dynamics of the Brexit debate. -Brian Monteith MEP is Chief Whip of the Brexit Party©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"adventurer to follow in footsteps of trailblazing nature writer nan shepherd","story":"Nearly eighty years after Nan Shepherd wrote her seminal and sensual exploration of the Cairngorms, a young adventurer will tomorrow begin to retrace her steps, using the same piecemeal provisions the author relied on. Shepherd, a modernist writer and poet who spent the majority of her working le as a teacher, wrote The Living Mountain in , only to keep the manuscript hidden away in a drawer for more than three decades. However, thanks to its publication by Canongate, the poetic, almost metaphysical meditation on her beloved Cairngorms is nowadays regarded as a cult classic.Nearly forty years after her death, Shepherd, a self-professed ldquopeerer into nooks and crannies, is regarded as one of Scotlandrsquos most important women writers - not least because of her foray into a genre traditionally dominated by men - and nowadays has pride of place on one of Royal Bank of Scotlands £ banknotes. For Elise Wortley, the discovery of Shepherdrsquos trailblazing journeys through the Cairngorms came at an opportune time in her le. Last year, the -year-old recreated part of Alexandra David-Neacuteels celebrated trek into India, an endeavour which saw her journey through the Himalayas for a month using no modern equipment. Kicking her heels over how to emulate the feat and shine a light on the neglected legacies of other empowering female adventurers, her mother recommended she read The Living Mountain to find some inspiration. Now, she is steeling herself to follow where Shepherd once travelled, and scale the six highest peaks of the Cairngorms in five days, before spending a further  days ldquojust living in the mountains as Nan would have. The aim, she says, is to raise awareness and celebrate a ldquogroundbreaking woman who never formed part of her lessons at school. In turn, she will raise money for Scottish Womenrsquos Aid, and hopes her adventure will inspire a new generation in the way Shepherd has motivated her. Ms Wortley, from London, told The Scotsman that when she first picked up a copy of The Living Mountain, she was spellbound and ldquotransported into Nanrsquos world. ldquoIt wasnrsquot what I was expecting. Itrsquos like one long poem, and the way she describes elements like water and a mountainrsquos plateau are just beautul, she recalled. ldquoShe was writing at a time when eastern religions were starting to have an influence in western le, and you can sense that otherworldly nature to it.ldquoI hope that by really immersing myself in the Cairngorms the way she did, I can understand what she was writing about a deeper level.True to Shepherdrsquos era, Ms Wortley will forego her smartphone and all other modern day comforts, and instead make do with a wooden backpack containing tweed clothing, war rations, and a canvas tent. It will, she hopes, be a transformative experience. ldquoYou get such an amazing sense of the place reading the book, but itrsquos important I think to be there with no distractions and try and unravel what it was she was feeling when she wrote it, and why she put it in a drawer for  years, she explained. ldquoShersquos someone who was overshadowed by her counterparts at the time, and so Irsquom really excited to go where she did and celebrate her achievements. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"climate activists use 25ft boat to block road in glasgow city centre","story":"Extinction Rebellion Scotlands vessel was placed in Trongate on Monday, covering the intersection of Gallowgate and High Street, by the Merchant City clock tower.The boat carries a message from the group which says Act Now, understood to be a demand for the UK Government to do more to tackle the climate crisis.A message saying \"The future you fear is already here\" is on the other side of the vessel.Scores of campaigners attended the protest, surrounded by a heavy police presence.Elliot Blaauw, , of Inverness, was one of the protesters ready to risk arrest by gluing themselves to the boatnecessary.: Activists plan to unleash summer uprising He said: \"Waters are rising, we are rising too.

Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well.

One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”. The people of Japan and Chernobyl have had a taster and I suspect they arenot eager for a repeat. .However,Shetland is####..Hmm.Rock on.Haydn, Thorium reactors, not Uranium! no atom bombs, no long term isotopes decaying for millennia. Almost infinite clean energy with really cheap fuel.Where would your preferred site be for the Shetland nuclear power station be Dr Tinkler  Aith  Bigton  Would bring plenty work to the west side. You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here. Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or Oh dear Dr Tinkler, it seems you’ve come down with a nasty case of whataboutery. I didn’t ask you about the undoubted benefits of x-rays and radiotherapy I asked you where you would build a nuclear power station in Shetland. Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example. Peat disturbance alone. over  kilometres of tracks, the ground footprint of over  square kilometres. A fair amount of COreleased there. Then tens of thousands of tons of concrete basses.emissions, Chatham House.  kilometres of the interconnector, Copper plastic!!! Now just imagine the peat is so unstable that helicopters are being used, just to move survey teams to reconnoitre the site. Tracked vehicles to damaging for the peat!! . Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. Things are far more precarious than you think.David Wallace Wells. I would rather believe scientic specialists in ious fields than blindly take the word of a Journalist, Brian. He appears to hold no scientic qualication of any type.

We still haven#t founda proper way of storing spent nuclear fuel, i can seethe repository at Sellafield being under miles of snow through the many ice ages to come before it issafe again.The nuclear nonsensewas never about cheap and safe electricity it was of course about weapons grade plutonium tons,produced here in Scotland alone,why that amount when a few tons could polish off the entire planet does anyone know Do we trust Boris and fruitcake farm with this ,aye right- their record speaks for itself! Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green .

The Loch Ewe farm has failed the required environmental standards for nearly  years. Mowi, despite virtually unlimited resources, were apparently unwilling or unable to make the necessary changes. broadcast in May.In January , the Scottish Parliament#s Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee agreed to undertake an enquiry into the state of salmon fishing in Scotland and in November  the regulatory body SEPA published proposals for a revised regulatory regime for the finfish sector. Within these proposals, SEPA said it would begin a programme of work to #modernise the regulation of existing sites#.Mowi#s head of environmental management, Stephen MacIntyre, said that the company wanted to #align its growth# with recent recommendations. The company had plans to sustainably grow their fish production levels over the next few years by #expanding into new high-energy farming areas located further offshore#.Bill Whyte, convener of the Wester Ross Area Salmon Fishery Board, said he welcomed Mowi#s recognition of the wild salmonid habitats and added: #We will expect further clarity about the process of biomass relocation. However,Mowi can provide evidence through EIAplanning and SEPA regulatory structure that the relocated biomass will have reduced potential impact on wild migratory fish, then we would be prepared to support biomass relocation on a conditional basis.#*A spokesperson from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency , said: “It is really encouraging to see that industry is proactively choosing to consider more sustainable locations for fish farms, away from more sensitive waters where pressures on the marine environment are greatest. “SEPA’s new regulatory framework for marine cage fish farming, launched on  June, , combines more accurate modelling and enhanced monitoring to encourage a more sustainable approach to the siting of fish farms. “In practice, we anticipate this will lead to fewer fish farms in shallower, slow-flowing waters and more fish farms in offshore locations where the environment capacity can better assimilate wastes. The new framework is designed to actively support operators who are seeking to relocate to more sustainable locations, and through improved practices and the innovative use of new technologies, reduce their impact on the marine environment.#They went on to add: “Indeed, our new framework provides exactly the type of flexibility and outcome-focus Mowi outlines it is looking for.Within this new framework, we will consider each inidual proposal on its merits against the legal standards.We encourage Mowi and other operators to work with us and other interested parties to explore their innovative proposals under our new framework.We look forward to doing so."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Kara-with-100m-IM-Gold.jpg","title":"inspirational western isles swimmer kara hanlon wins four gold medals at international island games in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine July.And the -year old was not the only WesternIsles athlete to celebrate a podium place in the shadow of the famous rock, asmore joy followed in the pool and in the athletics stadium.Isla Budge won bronze in the -metres freestyle event, while in Thursday’s triple jump final Mary Macleod won silver and Heather MacKinnon took bronze.Eriskay jumper MacKinnon had won gold in the event in Gotland two years ago with a shorter jump than it took to win third this time around.Hanlon’s week of glory began on Monday whenshe retained the  metres breaststroke title she won in Gotland in .

His brother, Lance Corporal James Herbinson, Royal Irish Fusiliers, is serving at the front. A letter received from the Rev. A. Gibson, Chaplain to the Central Antrims, states that Sgt. Herbinson was killed while out on duty in no-mans land. He states:He was a most excellent soldier and a very good NCO and the regiment will miss him very much.

He was buried in a little cemetery near the firing line.Lt. W.B. Stuartwrote: Dear Miss Herbinson, I cannot tell you with what regret it is hat I am writing to tell you of the death of your brother. He was killed by a bullet passing through his brain so that I am glad to say that he suffered absolutely no pain. I have known your brother personally for nearly two years and I feel that I have lost a real friend as well as an excellent sergeant. I have never met anyone whom I trusted more than your brother. He was absolutely fearless and could always be depended upon to do anything.“Perhaps you have heard that he was recommended for bravery at the battle of the Somme, when, after three attempts had been made, he collected eight men of his platoon and was going to make another attack, when, luckily, he was stopped as the chance was hopeless. I was present at the funeral and he has been laid in a British cemetery just behind the firing line so there will be no dficulty in locating the grave after the war.

If you or a young person you know is faced with the habitual struggle to fill those days with excitement, then look no further than the New Lodge Art’s packed programme of summer events.The inimitable arts group will once again host a range of activities in the coming weeks including drama, sports, comedy, music and dance. The programme will culminate in the jam-packed Festival of Fun in Lepper Street on August  and there will be no shortage of events and activities along the way, such as a local production of Disney’s High School Musical.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Anne Delaney, Arts Programme andOperations Manager at New Lodge Arts, said: “For a lot of the young people that we work with they may not be going on summer holidays, or they may not be getting out of the area. These types of activities are ersionary activities for them to take part in.“It brings young people from ious communities across North Belfast together. We work with kids from the Lower Shankill right up to Rathcoole. It’s about the personal and social development of young people, but also the good relations is really important in the work that we’re doing. It also provides ersionary activities around the time of unrest related to the internment bonfires. We see these projects as bringing a positive outlook to these areas during these times.”She continued: “We have our festival of fun event, which is on the th of August on Lepper Street. It’s our headline event, so it will be full of comedy, street theatre, music, dance, amusements, a roller disco – there is loads happening that day. Over the last few years there has been a lot of negativity around the bonfire so we’re working with Féile on this event as part of their wider Belfast ersionary programme.“It’s a good opportunity for young people to meet new friends, it gives them something outside of their school le and it helps to improve confidence and self-esteem. It’s brilliant for the young people themselves, but also then you see parents coming along who are so proud of what their child has achieved. I think bringing the likes of High School Musical to the Mac, which is one of Belfast’s best theatres, is brilliant. It’s a great opportunity for young people to be involved. It’s on our doorstep and a lot of young people might not have the chance to use it. Tickets are £, so they’re affordable for local families – no other tickets at the Mac are that price. We really want to encourage people to come and support their local young people.”"},{"url":null,"title":"checks at border avoidable even if nodeal brexit claims irelands man in brussels","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He insisted that a no-deal result is far from inevitable. The former Fine Gael minister said the entire island of Ireland was already treated as one entity for animal and public health issues.\"Wed like to continue that arrangement and I dont see any dficulty between the UK and the EU in respect of this,\" Mr Hogan said.He said the UK has published  pieces of legislation, and the EU  draft laws, to allow a smooth transition dealing with border issues on a \"pragmatic basis\".Mr Hogan said animal health issues on the island of Ireland were the joint responsibility of the Dublin authorities and the Northern Ireland Office, which reported to the EU in Brussels.\"Even in a no-deal situation, we can put in place the necessary protocols so this would not be a problem,\" he said.He said that % of products coming from Britain to Northern Ireland went via Dublin Port, where they can be checked.There could also be a system of checks at point of origin and at point of destination.The commissioner said that the EU and UK could also enter into negotiations on protocols allowing the UK authorities, as a non-EU member, to conduct checks on behalf of the Brussels authorities.Finally, the EU could itself carry out spot checks to reinforce control systems.\"These are all proposals which are on the table. But for political reasons - particularly due to objections from the Democratic Unionist Party - they have not been treated as reasonable and pragmatic,\" Mr Hogan added.This is a reference to the DUPs insistence that there can be no special treatment for Northern Ireland as Brexit happens.Last week Taoiseach Leo Varadkar had suggested checks at entry ports across Ireland.DUP MP Sir Jeffrey told the Sunday Times that he would urge the Taoiseach to talk to London directlywants a \"pragmatic and sensible\" customs solution to agroods in the face of a hard border.\"We want to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and are prepared to work with the Irish Government to deepen north-south co-operation so that this can be achieved,\" the Lagan Valley MP said."},{"url":null,"title":"10k for northern ireland civil servant offended by portraits of queen and philip peer","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The portraits were removed and the offended party, a Mr Lee Hegarty, was consulted on what should replace them.”“He suggested that the portraits of Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh should be replaced with photographs of, at best, the Queen meeting people during engagements in Northern Ireland,\" said Lord Maginnis.“One such photograph features Her Majesty the Queen shaking hands with the former deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, at the Lyric Theatre in Belfast.“I do not mind that what I mind is that the case brought by the complainant was settled secretly and that the sum of £, was handed over, presumably for hurt feelings and distress.“This settlement was signed off by the then secretary of state, Theresa Villiers MP, on the recommendation, I am informed, of her permanent secretary Jonathan Stephens.“I have been told to look at the annual accounts to find out where the money came from – but it is not to be found. That should concern us.”After some time had passed after the issue of compensation was settled, Lord Maginnis said that last year Mr Hegarty was promoted to become accounting officer of the Parades Commission.He said this contrasted with what he described as the years of delay in compensating victims of historical institutional abuse in Northern Ireland. He said they had been “shamefully left out in the cold when it comes to their justiable claims for compensation”.“This is scandalous. It is an indictment of the Northern Ireland Office and of this government,\" he said.“We have lost all sense of reality when a portrait of Her Majesty can cause offence to a civil servant but we do not bat an eyelid when we deny closure and justice to unfortunate people who have been abused in the most outrageous manner imaginable.“I urge the Northern Ireland Office not only to restore the original portraits of Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh but to expedite payment of the comparatively paltry compensation due to the people who are more deserving than this opportunistic civil servant who, surely, must now be compromised in his position in the Parades Commission because of his bigoted stance over the Royal Family.”The Northern Ireland Office said in a statement: “We will not comment on inidual personnel matters.”"},{"url":null,"title":"former ira bombers group to get proceeds from lyra mckee book","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Ms McKee was shot dead by a New IRA gunman during rioting in Londonderry in April.As per Lyras swishes, some of the money from the book will go to Paper Trail, which works closely with human rights and victims groups that represent families affected by the conflict.The organisation is registered with the Charity Commission and Companies House, and lists Mr McClenaghan as being on the charity trustee board and being a company director. Paper Trails activities are funded by the EUs Peace IV programme.  Mr McClenaghan revealed in a  documentary that he was \"immensely proud\" of joining the IRA and said it was his \"daily job\" to plant bombs around Belfast. As a result of the admission Jackie Nicholl resigned from the forum after he was made aware of Mr McClenaghans past.

That’s what Paper Trail does.”Mr McClenaghan told the newspaper that he believes the \"Orange State\" had to be destroyed by armed action.“I believe the Orange state was never going to give up its power and privilege and the whole sectarianism they perpetrated for  years before they were brought down in ,\" he said.  \"So you had to destroy the Orange state in my opinion.”Asked whether that task could only be accomplished by bombs, guns and killing people, he replied: “Unfortunately yes. It had to be destroyed. There’s no easy way. But that was in the ‘s. Now we’re in a completely dferent era politically, where you don’t need any type of violence from any quarter and specically the group who killed Lyra.”He said the dference between the killing of Ms McKee and the actions of the Provisional IRA was that there is was now a \"political alternative\".\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A new mural of Lyra McKee in Belfast city centre Askedit was ironic that proceeds from the work of Lyra McKee will go to a group he is helping to run, he said: \"She was a lovely human being.

And she wouldn’t. She didn’t. We got on very well ... Lyra was a person who would understand people. I don’t think you can.”Ciaran MacAirt, secretary of Paper Trail, told the News Letter that Ms McKee had supported the organisation \"at every stage\", helped launch its research and pilot group and sat on a steering group for the charity. He said he was \"humbled\" Paper Trail will get proceeds from her work.

Even in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar, frequented by many traditional women, most female shoppers wore these casual hijabs. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Youngsters outside a shopping centre in northern Tehran Still, a sizeable minority of women were covered head-to-toe in black robes and tightly pulled headscarves, the so-called chador.The struggle against compulsory headscarves first made headlines in December  when a woman climbed on a utility box in Tehran’s Revolution Street, waving her hijab on a stick. More than three dozen protesters have been detained since, including nine who are currently in detention, said Masih Alinejad, an Iranian activist who now lives in New York.Despite attempts to silence protesters, public debate has intensied, amplied by social media.Last month, a widely watched online video showed a security agent grab an unveiled teenage girl and violently push her into the back of a police car, prompting widespread criticism.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Women take a picture at the Persian Gulf Martyrs’ Lake in Tehran President Hassan Rouhani and Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have supported a softer attitude towards women who do not comply with the official dress code. However, hardliners opposed to such easing have become more influential as the nuclear deal is faltering.They have called for harsh punishment, even lashes, arguing that allowing women to show their hair leads to moral decay and the disintegration of families. The judiciary recently urged Iranians to inform on women without hijabs by sending photos and videos to designated social media accounts.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Veiled Iranian women attend a ceremony in support of the observance of the Islamic dress code for women in Tehran “The more women dress in an openly sexual way, the less we’ll have social peace, while facing a higher crime rate,” Minoo Aslani, head of the women’s branch of the paramilitary Basij group, told a rally last week.Another gathering was attended by several thousand women in chadors. One held up a sign reading: “The voluntary hijab is a plot by the enemy.”Reformist politician Parvaneh Salahshouri said coercion does not work. “What we see is that the morality police have been a failure,” said Ms Salahshouri, who wears a headscarf out of religious belief.Changing hijab rules through legislation is unlikely because of the constraints on parliament, she said.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Reformist Iranian politician Parvaneh Salahshouri Instead, women should engage in non-violent civil disobedience, Ms Salahshouri said.She cautioned that it is a slow, dficult road, but that “Iranian women have not given up their efforts”.The hijab controversy goes back to the mid-s when police forced women to take off their hijabs, part of a Westernisation policy by then-shah Reza Pahlavi. Under his son and successor, women could choose. Western apparel was common among the elite.A  survey by a parliament research centre indicates that most women wear a casual hijab and only % opt for a chador.Attitudes have changed. In , two-thirds believed women should wear hijabs. Today, fewer than % approve of government intervention in the issue, the research said.Iran has seen waves of anti-government protests, including an outcry after a  election many contended was stolen by hardliners. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A head-to-toe veiled woman walks in the courtyard of the shrine of St Saleh in northern Tehran Those with economic grievances frequently protest.Ms Alinejad argued the campaign against forced hijabs carries symbolic weight, saying that mandatory headscarves were “the symbol that the Iranian government used to take the whole society hostage”.In recent years, she has posted videos and photos of activists, including of women filming themselves as they walk in the streets without a headscarf.Ms Alinejad said she receives more than  images a day, but posts only some.The activists in Iran take risks.In March, human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh, who has represented female protesters, was sentenced to -and-a-half years in prison, of which she must serve , according to her husband.In April, activists Yasaman Aryani, her mother Monireh Arabshahi and Mojgan Keshaz were arrested after posting a video showing them without headscarves in the Tehran metro. In the video, they distributed flowers to female passengers and spoke of a day when women have the freedom to choose.Amnesty International said Iranian authorities have used incommunicado detentions, prolonged solitary confinement and threats against family members to coerce detained activists to retract their opposition to forced veiling in video-taped “confessions”.The group said it had detected such a pattern in six cases since April.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Iranian women take a selfie outside a shopping centre in northern Tehran Some activists manoeuvre carefully.The -year-old fire safety consultant said she tries to avoid policemen when she walks the streets without a hijab. She said she grudgingly complies with the dress code when she delivers lectures or sings in a mixed choir – activities she would otherwise be barred from.At the high-end Palladium Mall in northern Tehran, several shoppers casually ignored a sign reminding customers that the hijab is mandatory. One woman only pulled up her scarf, which was draped around her shoulders, when she stepped into a lt and found herself next to a security guard.Nearby, -year-old Paniz Masoumi sat on the stone steps of a plaza. She had dyed some of her hair blue, but kept it hidden under a loose scarf.Ms Masoumi said police recently impounded her car for two weeks, fining her amid claims that a traffic camera snapped her with a below-standard hijab.If hijabs were voluntary, she would throw hers off, Ms Masoumi said. But for now “I am not looking for trouble”, she added."},{"url":null,"title":"cllr durkan council pursue zero waste europe membership","story":"SDLP Cllr Mary Durkan has welcomed Derry City and Strabane Councils endorsement for membership to the Zero Waste Europe Network, making them the first member Council on these islands.The Foyleside Cllr said: “I am delighted that the Zero Waste Europe membership application has received cross-party backing.“As the first members on these islands- subject to approval- this membership establishes Derry City and Strabane District Council as climate action leaders within Europe.“Our council already adopted a Zero Waste  Circular Economy Strategy and has championed other climate-conscious initiatives in recent years.

This crisis affects everyone and as such we all have a duty to act to protect our planet, our communities, our citizens and our economy for future generations.”CAPTION: SDLP Councillor Mary Durkan."},{"url":null,"title":"council progress circular economy strategy applying join zero waste europe","story":"Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Environment and Regeneration Committee have endorsed Council’s bid for membership of Zero Waste Europe - a network of communities across the continent where learning and experiences of reducing waste and improving recycling rates are shared.The application is the latest move in Council’s adoption of a Circular Economy   Zero Waste Strategy in December  which aims to keep resources and products in use for as long as possible, extracting maximum value before recovering and regenerating them at the end of their le cycle.Zero Waste Europe have developed a Masterplan that incorporates a toolkit and a set of roadmaps setting out the actions that communities should take in order to achieve zero waste status.Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor Michaela Boyle, welcomed Council’s application to join the network.“A lot of key actions have already been implemented to move Council towards a Circular Economy Zero Waste District making us a prime candidate for membership of Zero Waste Europe,” she noted.“The application is in keeping with a key element of the strategy to engaging and sharing practices with other municipalities who have adopted a similar position and have begun the process of transforming their areas into Zero Waste communities.“The Strategy is a key objective identied in the Strategic Growth Plan and points the way towards achieving sustainable waste management practices while also creating economic activity by linking job creation to waste recovery and treatments.”Chair of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Environment and Regeneration Committee, Councillor Brian Tierney, said the move was the latest in a series of positive initiatives to progress the strategy.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Our Council has been one of the leading regions in the UK and Ireland in progressing the transition to a Zero Waste Circular Economy, improving recycling rates and building a more sustainable region,” he noted.“We were one of the first public bodies to endorse the strategy and now have food waste collection services in almost all households while just this week we rolled out a Green Waste Pilot scheme to almost , households.“Earlier this year Council hosted a high level workshop in Belgium where  other regions from the island of Ireland joined five expert cities in Belgium, Flanders and the Netherlands to share experiences of good environmental practice as we transition towards an all island circular economy.”A circular economy is about moving away from the ‘extraction-production-consumption-throwaway’ culture and closing the loop so that the resources that go into our products are reclaimed, recycled and valued forever.It aims to foster a new attitude to design in manufacturing as well as new attitudes among consumers.For more on Council’s Waste and Recycling Services visit derrystrabane recycling.CAPTION: The Brown bin that has been delivered to , households in the city as part of the Green Waste Pilot scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"department confirms bogside parking scheme faces another lengthy delay","story":"The long-awaited Bogside parking scheme has been delayed for at least another year, the Derry News has learned.Last week the paper reported frustration given the Department for Infrastructure’sinsistence that no additional schemes will be progressed until a final decision has been made regarding the Rossville Street area Residents’ Parking Scheme.A Departmental spokesperson said: “Depending on the outcome of consultation with the residents, a pilot residents parking scheme in the Rossville area could be in place by mid . If successful, it is intended that the parking scheme will remain in place.“The Department will monitor and review the outcome of the pilot scheme at Rossville before embarking on any further residents parking schemes within the city.“Further schemes will be prioritised and focus on areas where on-street parking poses the greatest dficulty to local residents. “In response, SDLP MLA Mark H. Durkan questioned “what impediment exists that is stopping the department at least commencing the process in other areas ”He added: \"Its ridiculous doing nothing while the situation in lower Rosemount around the university area and around Bishop Street just gets worse.\"Meanwhile. they need to take on board the concerns raised by residents about the Bogside scheme and design a solution that addresses them, rather than just take their ball and go home.\"The parking scheme issue stretches back a decade, with ious public consultations having taken place in that time.

The Inquest hearings took place over a twelve-day period last year.The British Army have claimed for the last  years, that Mr Bradley a -year-old IRA member, was armed when they opened fire on him close to the Bishop’s Field area of Creggan. This claim has consistently denied by the Bradley family over the decades.Danny Bradley, brother of the deceased man told the Derry News: “At the end of the day this is good news. It has taken  years and caused a lot of hurt for so long.“I am hoping that the findings will come out the way that we want it and we will be travelling together as family to Belfast next month to hear the outcome.“It destroyed our family, but I had to get the answer about what happened and I am certainly looking forward to that.

Soldier B, the man responsible for both incidents will also face a charge of wounding with intent in relation to Christopher Hegarty.The decision to prosecute the soldier represented the reversal of a decision taken in  not to prefer charges against the former British serviceman.

Durkan come after the latest public consultation attracted over  objections which he now believes will scupper plans for similar schemes in areas such as Rosemount and Bishop Street.Mr Durkan said the Department for Infrastructurehas been “extremely ham-fisted” in its handling of the consultation process.The parking scheme issue stretches back around ten years, with ious public consultations having taken place in that time. At one stage, it was expected to be introduced in  but had to be pushed back until .In  then Roads Minister Danny Kennedy gave assurances that, “in the absence of signicant objections”, the scheme would be in place no later than Spring .However, this week, after a consultation ended last April and a further information session was held in November, a spokesperson for the Department explained that the proposed Rossville Street Residents’ parking scheme received a large number of objections from the residents.Of the  responses received, there were  objections to the scheme.The DfI told the Derry News that key areas of concern coming out of the consultation included the number of permits allocated for visitors, access for family carers and concerns over costs.The Department has since confirmed that the resident and visitor permits would be free and that a special permit would be available for family carers, also free of charge.The DfI spokesperson added: “The Department acknowledges that there is still a need to manage car parking in the Bogside and is now considering how to progress matters.“Consideration is being given to advancing a smaller scheme within the Rossville area to include Abbey Park, Glenfada Park and Columbcille Court, possibly as a pilot. The Department would hope to commence consultation for a smaller scheme in September.“The Department will write out to all residents living within the limits of the original Rossville scheme as soon it is confirmed how an alternative scheme will be progressed.“The Department is not in a position to consider other schemes at this time.”StaggeringMark H. Durkan is worried that delays to the Bogside parking scheme will now hamper the roll-out of similar schemes.“The fact this is happening will now block progress on any residents’ parking scheme where in the city.“Bogside residents want a parking scheme so it must be the design of it that people are objecting to. It’s staggering that a much-needed parking scheme in an area where residents struggle and have been crying out for a solution to the problem of getting parked outside their homes during the day has been scrapped.“This scheme has been deliberated over for ten years and the department has brought proposals forward that have been met with such opposition. It begs the question, was enough done to liaise and interact with objectors, and could they respond in turn to these objections.“Bogside was identied as a key area, as was Bishop Street and the next was the lower Rosemount university area. But now it seems asthe department has pulled the plug on those schemes and there is no chance of progress.”Parallel schemesThe SDLP representative had enquired about the possibility of a similar scheme in other areas which are badly impacted by students such as Rosemount, and Abercorn Place and Terrace which are both affected by city centre workers.“These could have been done in parallel so that at least one scheme could be advanced. People in Rosemount are frustrated that they’ve been put on the back burner while this other scheme was being progressed, but they’ll be even more frustrated to see it isn’t being progressed.“Rosemount and Bishop Street will now be way down the line, the handling of this by the Department of Infrastructure seems extremely ham-fisted,” Mr Durkan added.The Rossville Street area Residents’ Parking Scheme would be the first such scheme for the City and involves over  residential properties mainly in the Rossville Street, Fahan Street, Little Diamond, Creggan Street and Chamberlain Street areas.A DfI publication in March stated that, proposals for the Scheme were first announced by the previous Minister for Infrastucture, and following informal consultations “there has proven to be signicant support from residents who are experiencing increasing dficulties parking outside their homes.”The Department wrote to all residents within the area and encouraged all interested parties to formally respond to the proposals before  April.If introduced as proposed, the scheme would have designated free of charge parking places for residents only between the hours of . am and noon and between . pm and . pm from Monday to Saturday inclusive.Visitors would have been able to park within areas designated for residents provided a valid visitor’s permit is displayed on the vehicle.

There needs to be swt action as an enhanced facility could alleviate the problem people are currently facing.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said the current Driver and Vehicle test centre network was built around  years ago.ldquoMuch has been done to maintain and modernise the test centres in that time, particularly to meet the growing demand for vehicle tests. However, present and future legislative requirements, coupled with increasing and changing demands for testing services, mean that the current network is no longer sustainable, he said.ldquoAs such, we have been reviewing the network with a view to determining the most appropriate network of test centres to meet our future needs. To date, with the exception of a new test centre being built at Hydebank in Belfast, no decisions have been taken on the size of any other specic test centres within a future network.The spokesman said the new test centre at Hydebank and will provide additional testing capacity for the Greater Belfast area.He added: ldquoOur plans for a new network are continuing to be progressed, specically in terms of the design for the new test centres and the acquisition of land.ldquoHowever, in the absence of the NI Executive there is currently no means to progress proposals beyond the construction of the new test centre at Hydebank..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Carryduff man honoured with major accolade  ","story":"A CARRYDUFF country sports enthusiast has been honoured with a major award.John Leighton, who is the president of the Ulster Gundog League, has been presented with The Great Game Fairs of Ireland letime achievement award.The awards, made each year at the Irish Game Fair at Fine Food Festival held at Shanes Castle, Antrim, are designed to recognise and reward outstanding iniduals who devote themselves to nurturing rural heritage.Announcing Johnrsquos award, Albert Titterington, managing director of The Great Game Fairs of Ireland, said: ldquoIt is an absolute pleasure each year to have the opportunity publicly to recognise some of the outstanding members of the game show family who commit their time, talents and enthusiasm to preserving rural traditions and promoting country sports.ldquoThese people work tirelessly behind the scenes and without any thought of reward mdash and John epitomises that blend of modesty and high achievement.ldquoOver the years John has enjoyed considerable sporting success with the dogs he trains and we have been proud to have enjoyed his support and insight as he served as spaniels directorrsquo with our fairs, shaping competitions and ensuring top quality entries.Mr Titterington said Mr Leightonrsquos  years of gundog competition experience commanded ldquoinstant respect in gundog circles and described him as a ldquopopular figure across this island and beyond..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Cormac delivers at Irish Open  ","story":"ARDGLASS golfer Cormac Sharvin has just had the biggest week of his le.The  year-old was the top Irish finisher at the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open at Lahinch.He finished joint th place on nine-under par to earn the biggest payday of his le, pocketing a cheque for euro,.It was almost three times the amount he has earned on the European Challenge Tour so far this season.Unfortunately, he missed out on securing a dream spot at next weekrsquos Open Championship at Portrush.After signing off with a final round  on Sunday he said: ldquoI felt I didnrsquot play much dferent from the first three days.

He crossed the finish line in ., in sixth place overall, but first U-, a real eye-catching performance out of  finishersMeanwhile, Dee was not letting the side down as he again proved best in his age group, clocking yet another sub  time, his clocking of . was also good enough for overall seventh out of the  finishers.Ford kNewcastle was the venue for a nearer home race on Friday night and several East Down men and women took advantage of the opportunity to warm up for the action in Delamont the next day.Gordy Graham took third place overall in . a mere  seconds behind winner, Newcastlersquos David OrsquoFlaherty, while Catherine OrsquoConnor was second female in . to Gordyrsquos cousin, Laura Graham, who won in .. Paul Lloyd was st in . and Donal Smith placed th in  minutes on the button, out of a total of  runners.DelamontAs Van Morrison once said: ldquoMy momma told me therersquod be days like this,Thus was described East Downrsquos fantastic day out in Delamont on Saturday in the  X k relays, a new and exciting event organised by the Daye Brothers aka Atlas Running, which required teams of five runners each, with each one running a klap as the hot and hilly trails and paths around Delamont were described.At one point we thought we wouldnrsquot have enough runners to fill three teams so to get four teams of five representing East Down was pretty damn impressive.Some pretty impressive performances from the East Down gang as well with victories for the menrsquos A team and the mixed team and third in the all female team.Massive well done to all involved especially the team captain, Deirdre Weatherall who rallied the troops with carrots and sticks and a promise of ice creams, that did not materialise.All agreed that she did a fine job of getting  names in the hat and in the right place at the right time. It was great to see also that several relative newcomers to the club, Gillian and Gerard Grant, Donal Smith, Michael Morrissey and Alison Graham are happy to get involved with some of the older hands and the younger ones to enjoy the delights that a team relay can bring.Performances of the day have to be shared by Gavin Hynds whose third leg run for the EDAC male B team, which effectively hauled them up from last place to th.His time of . for the leg was only bettered by runners from the top two teams on the day, and by Neil Curran, the anchor leg runner for the EDAC A team.His final leg of . only put paid to the battling St Peterrsquos AC quintet during the final lap. The Lurgan team, which had held the lead from the start were understandably disappointed, but the EDAC squad deserved their win.Track and fieldOn to Sunday and it was our juvenile members who had to make the long journey to Tullamore in Co Offally to take part in the All Ireland T F Championships.Spread over two weekends, it therefore means that, for some, there are two journeys to the heart of Ireland on consecutive weekends.Thank you to all the parents for driving all these miles. Your efforts are greatly appreciated by everyone in the club and especially by the athletes themselvesNevertheless, it proved a great day at Tullamore at the first of three days of action with the sun shining for a nice change.East Down had four athletes taking part all in the m, but in two dferent age groups. In the U- race Anna Gardiner and Lucy Foster both ran in separate heats with both finishing in sixth position.The top three in each heat qualied automatically for the final later in the day along with the fastest two finishers outside the top six.Unfortunately, both EDAC girls missed out on qualication, but they ran super races with Lucy gaining a PB of .. and Anna running ...Lauren Madine and Kirsti Foster both competed in the U- race with both winning their heats and automatically qualying for the final later in the day.A last minute change of time table meant the final was brought forward by an hour so that meant quick warm-ups and back on the track was not the ideal preparation that would normally take place before an All-Ireland final.Nonetheless, the two girls put their minds to it and gave it their best shot. Having two out of eight from one club in an All-Ireland final is an achievement in itself.Kirsti came fourth overall in .., just missing a medal by tenths of a second. Lauren had to settle for seventh in . as she was hampered by ankle issues which had developed after her heat.Well done to all four for their efforts.

These are two key elements of Delamontrsquos future success.Cllr Walker said he hopes that the public will be given time to view the content of the master plan when it is completed and that money to provide a raft of new facilities can be secured to allow work to potentially start next year.ldquoThe Education Authority stuck to its promise to invest in Delamont and I hope that the local authority will honour its commitment and start planning to provide more facilities at the country park which offers huge development potential, he said.ldquoWhile already a signicant tourism attraction, there are not that many facilities apart from a childrenrsquos playground, stunning walks and the hugely popular Steamerrsquos cafe and miniature railway.ldquoWhile I am not advocating that the beauty of the area is spoiled in any way, there are hundreds of acres of space which could be used to boost the parkrsquos tourism offering.Cllr Walker said the availability of finance to enhance the park is critical to its future development, providing new attractions and creating a boost for nearby businesses in Killyleagh.He added: ldquoThe eagerly-awaited master plan is the key to unlocking Delamontrsquos future development and can also pave the way for much-needed investment. This is something I and many others are looking forward to..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Delight after new family walking trail opens at Saul  ","story":"A NEW walking trail for all the family to enjoy has been opened in Saul.The Saul Family Trail was officially opened last Wednesday by Newry Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey.Just under km in , the new route is at Saul GAC, which was behind the project.Club officials attended last weekrsquos launch and along with representatives of ious support organisations and members of the local community.Saul GAC is located at the foot of Slieve Patrick, a popular walking area for locals and tourists alike due to its beauty and historic interest.The current walking routes around the mountain are quite challenging and are not suitable for all levels of ability.The new trail is fully accessible to allow and encourage everyone to participate in outdoor activities.It offers Saul and Raholp a hub from which local people and visitors can enjoy the beauty of the local environment.

If Fascism hadnrsquot been beaten we would be living in a very dferent world today. ldquoWe would be living in fear of a regime which would not tolerate any descent. We are very lucky and should be thankful to those veterans who risked all and gave their tomorrow for our today.Cllr Hanna said the districtrsquos surviving veterans were small in number and well into their nineties, and that society owed a debt to them for their part in the battle to secure the freedom people enjoy today.He said he included the Merchant Navy in his proposal because many risked their lives on merchant ships to ferry supplies which helped win the war.ldquoThis was a cruel war where many lost their lives and I really hope we never have to face anything like this again. Those from Northern Ireland who fought and served during World War Two came from all sections of the community.ldquoBefore it is too late, I believe this council should acknowledge what these brave people did for us all by presenting surviving veterans with a silver poppy at a cross community service in November, said Cllr Hanna.He added: ldquoI hope that the council will support this motion as a mark of respect for the generation which has given us freedoms we take for granted.The SDLPrsquos Declan McAteer said he was ldquosomewhat dubious about the suggestion for the council ldquoto go out on a limb and procure silver poppy medals.ldquoI fully respect the sentiment of those wishing to identy with what is essentially a British symbol which wonrsquot by endorsed by all Irish men or women. The poppy, for better or worse, is associated with all conflicts that Britain was involved in from the First World War right through.ldquoI would say that perhaps thatwe do anything around this we

district planners mdash has revealed in its annual audit committee report that the current number of live planning applications in the system is just over ,.The confirmation comes after local politicians recently pointed to what they described as ldquoserious problems at council management level for not taking the planning backlog seriously enough.Politicians have expressed concern that planners are not responding to their telephone calls and emails, with people who lodge applications also concerned that they are not getting any information from officials.Elected representatives say while all the fault does not rest with planners, they are firmly of the view that there are simply not enough staff to deal with the huge volume of work.Concern has also been expressed that the planning department is having problems retaining staff to work in a department that receives the second highest number of applications across the Provincersquos  councils.Politicians say there is a need to ensure the planning department is running properly which the council explains in the new report is exactly what it aims to do.A major review of planning has already been undertaken and amendments made to the so-called scheme of delegation which is a set of rules which determines whether a planning application will be decided by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee or planning officers.A critical look has also been taken at staffing structures in tandem with the arearsquos chief planner, with council officials conceding that while there are issues with staff turnover, positions are filled as quickly as possible.In addition, the council has admitted there is a communication issue within the planning department with the change that needs to happen something that cannot be achieved overnight.Signicantly, the new council report warns that failure to deliver timely planning decisions is a ldquorisk within the corporate risk register, with the number of live planning applications increasing, not decreasing, with the figure standing at , at the end of May.The report says an internal audit of the planningrevealed that there are a number of key controls absent from the local authorityrsquos planning system, in particular, its performance against legislative targets, the completeness and validation of documentation supporting applications and enforcement actions.The audit also points to a lack of clarity in respect of key performance indicators within the planning department and the lack of non-compliance by the local authority with its own planning and enforcement procedures.The report says senior council management is considering ways forward to ensure compliance with policy and legislative targets, while maintaining the number of live cases to an acceptable level.Council officials say that over the coming months they intend to take steps to address the ious issues within the planning department to further enhance governance arrangements and are satisfied that these steps will address the need for improvements..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Plans for new

It may not have been their intention to convey the impression that they were involved in some sort of showdown with an element of loyalism unionism in east Belfast, but that’s certainly the impression that was given almost every time one of their representatives had a microphone placed in front of them. And quite why the ‘problem’ – which is clearly how some councillors saw it – was allowed to rumble on until the Eleventh Night is beyond me. I use the Avoniel swiming pool quite regularly and the pyre had been under construction for weeks. So why was it left so late in the day for supposed ‘decisive action’ from the council  Again, it conveyed the impression that there were elements – on both sides as it happens – who were prepared to use the countdown as a way of pursuing a particular agenda one that had nothing to do with potential damage to property or the safety of local residents..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p The fact that the pyre remained and the fire was lit has been described as a ‘momentous and truly signicant victory ... for the people of Avoniel and loyalism’. Hmm. I’m not sure how reducing a stack of pallets to ashes in the grounds of a leisure centre is actually a victory for unionism or loyalism. What I wanted to hear is why the fire was so important to the people in that area. I know why. I live in east Belfast and I know some of the people who would have been there on the Eleventh. But I’m pretty sure that most people who aren’t from a unionist background were none the wiser on Friday morning and remain none the wiser now.Too many have portrayed the events of last week as a showdown between loyalists in part of east Belfast and the ‘pan-nationalists on the city council’ , but that wasn’t the full story and shouldn’t have become the main story.Bonfires are an important part of loyalist culture and the opportunity should have been taken to explain why. If we are not to see this saga continue next year then it is vital that the loyalists in the area tell their own story: not as a supposed political propaganda battle between them and the city council, but as the broader story of their own history and culture. Who they are and why their culture, history and identity matters to them and why it deserves to be recognised and accommodated. If it is true that there is an agenda by elements on the council to ‘stamp out loyalist unionist identity and culture in east Belfast’ then there has to be a coordinated, coherent response to the agenda. It should begin with a detailed analysis of the voting figures. Why are only  out of the  councillors from unionist parties  Is it the case that unionists loyalists aren’t voting  Is it the case that there is no party which truly represents their interests  Is it the case that too many unionist parties contesting electionsis leading to the loss of seats  Is it simply the case that a signicant and continuing narrowing of demographicsmeans that the numbers game is now stacked too heavily against them There also has to be an equally detailed analysis of how the anti-loyalist unionist agenda manests itself. Simply repeating the mantra – for that it what it is in danger of becoming – that Sinn Fein SDLP Alliance are involved in a pan-nationalist front isn’t enough. How does the front operate  What is the end goal  Why was stopping a bonfire in Avoniel of such interest to the front  How can the front be thwarted  What role do the unionist political parties play in all of this: and I only ask because the lead at Avoniel came mostly from people connected to the East Belfast Cultural Collective and East Belfast Community Initiative.As part of the overall analysis it is only right to ask about the EBCC and EBCI . Who are they  What is their mandate  What is their goal agenda  What is their role  What is their relationship with the unionist parties and loyal orders Who are their key players  What matters most, of course, is the direction of travel for unionism loyalism in Belfast, particularly in what would once have been considered their strongholds. If they are in a minority position politically and electorally in Belfast how do they protect their interests  Is there any point in picking fights that can only end, as Avoniel did, in what one person described as a ‘symbolic’ victory  It was actually fairly quiet over the Twelfth this year, but doesn’t that mean that increasing numbers of loyalists unionists Orange have recognised that the era of stand-offs and showdowns didn’t deliver  Which raises the question of what was or will be delivered as a consequence of what happened in Avoniel  Once the debris has been swept away, what remains  In what demonstrable way have the lives of those who attended the Eleventh Night bonfire been changed Avoniel ended well in one particular way: it ended without violence. But , as some suggest, this is only the beginning of ‘taking the fight to the pan-nationalist front,’ then what comes next One thing I do know is that picking a fight with elements of Belfast Council is a tricky strategy when there aren’t the unionist numbers on the council for follow-through at the monthly meeting and assorted committee meetings.

Across the Irish Sea, it is necessary for a claimant in a libel case to show that they have suffered serious harm to their reputation in order to be successful.This requirement strikes a sensible compromise between the essential right of iniduals and organisations to be able to protect their reputations,that reputation is worthy of protection, and the right of everyone  to free commentary and free expression and free inquiry.Tensions between these two competing rights have evolved over centuries, particularly since newspapers became a major source of information in the s ..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p The requirement that a litigant show that they have suffered serious harm was introduced in the rest of the UK when there was broad political agreement that the balance had moved too far in favour of complainants.This meant that scientists, for example, were sometimes being silenced in their essential work by big businesses. This essential libel reform was not extended to Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, financial pressures on small media outlets across Britain and Ireland have increased, making them particularly vulnerable to bullying or vexatious litigants.This week there will be attempts to extend overdue reform to Northern Ireland. The DUP will be aware that supporters of terrorism, among others, can take advantage of that vulnerability. Papers would not have dared to report the widely known violent records of some of the republican leaders who have recently died when they were still alive.The DUP is now in a position of considerable influence over the UK government, which we sincerely hope will result in defamation law reform, perhaps this very week.Alex Kane: More than a symbolic victory needed from the ashes of AvonielMotorists must be made to think twice before speeding Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingTributes paid to Northern Ireland road racer Darren Keys following fatal crash at WalderstownThe Twelfth  -

I had hoped to work constructively with them and take their concerns on board.ldquoThose who were elected as Conservatives but have chosen to betray the faith that was shown in them by their constituents should have the courage to resign and face by-elections. They should defend their decisions at the ballot box.ldquoAn establishment stitch up between these councillors and Labour is not in the interest of residents of the Vale of Glamorgan. They have explicitly argued that they know best and that the public should be ignored.ldquoI will be proposing a minority Conservative administration at the Vale Councilrsquos AGM with a plan that delivers on the priorities of local people. I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I also had the pleasure of meeting campaigners from across the UK as part of the Extinction Rebellion protests in Parliament.And I recently bumped into some students from Stanwell School who have been taking part in the climate strike movement and standing up for action on climate change and the climate emergency. I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dr Gerome Breen, from the National Institute for Health ResearchMaudsley Biomedical Research Centre and the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology  Neuroscience, at Kingrsquos College London, said: ldquoMetabolic abnormalities seen in patients with anorexia nervosa are most often attributed to starvation.ldquoBut our study shows metabolic dferences may also contribute to the development of the disorder.ldquoFurthermore, our analyses indicate that the metabolic factors may play nearly or just as strong a role as purely psychiatric effects.Another finding was that the genetic basis of anorexia overlaps with other psychiatric disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia.Genetic factors associated with anorexia also influence physical activity, which could explain the tendency for people with anorexia to be highly active, the research indicates.Led by researchers at Kingrsquos College London and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the study is published in Nature Genetics.Eight genetic iants linked to anorexia were identied in the large-scale genome-wide association study. Anorexia is a serious and potentially le-threatening illness, and symptoms include a dangerously low body weight, an intense fear of gaining weight, and a distorted body image.It affects between % to % of women and .-.% of men. It has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness.Researchers combined data collected by the Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative and the Eating Disorders Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium.The dataset included , cases of anorexia and , controls, from  countries across North America, Europe, and Australasia.Professor Janet Treasure, also from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology  Neuroscience, Kingrsquos College London, said: ldquoOver time there has been uncertainty about the framing of anorexia nervosa because of the mixture of physical and psychiatric features.ldquoOur results confirm this duality and suggest that integrating metabolic information may help clinicians to develop better ways to treat eating disorders.The study concludes anorexia may need to be thought of as a hybrid ldquometabo-psychiatric disorder and that it will be important to consider both metabolic and psychological risks factors when exploring new avenues for treatment..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Genetic study reveals metabolic origins of anorexia article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

Entries are now open for the  Deloitte Technology Fast  programme. The awards, now in their th year, rank Ireland’s fastest growing technology companies and recognise the indigenous technology companies that have demonstrated outstanding growth in turnover over the previous four years. Among the Northern Ireland firms making the last in previous years include First Derivatives and Novosco. A total of  firms from Northern Ireland made the list last year, with Belfast-based Repstor the highest-ranking Northern Ireland business at number  in the rankings. Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives.

Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says.
