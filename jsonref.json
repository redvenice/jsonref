(Picture Getty)Fifty-six million years ago, the Earth warmed far above the temperatures we experience today – and ice at the poles melted.Torrential rain sees waterfalls form inside flooded New York subway stationsCould the event – the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) – be evidence of global warming caused by an extinct civilisation which ruled Earth before mankind?It sounds like the kind of crackpot conspiracy to be found on ‘ancient alien’ UFO sites, but scientists have seriously investigated the idea.Professor Adam Frank of the University of Rochester writes in The Atlantic that the investigation could offer insight into how to find alien life – or about our impact on our planet.Frank writes, ‘There is a conundrum here. If an earlier species’s industrial activity is short-lived, we might not be able to easily see it.‘The PETM’s spikes mostly show us the Earth’s timescales for responding to whatever caused it, not necessarily the timescale of the cause.Could we be one of several civilisations to have lived on Earth? (Picture Getty)‘So it might take both dedicated and novel detection methods to find evidence of a truly short-lived event in ancient sediments. In other words, if you’re not explicitly looking for it, you might not see it.’Frank says the researchers thought about what our civilisation might leave behind in rocks for future civilisations to find – plastics in the ocean, evidence of fertiliser use, and (most of all) evidence of fossil fuel use.Frank says that civilisations might – through their collapse – trigger the conditions to create more fossil fuels, for future civilisations to use.Frank says, ‘Our work also opened up the speculative possibility that some planets might have fossil-fuel-driven cycles of civilization building and collapse. If a civilization uses fossil fuels, the climate change they trigger can lead to a large decrease in ocean oxygen levels.Donald Trump\u0027s porn star \u0027ex\u0027 Stormy Daniels trips as she attends court hearingMother filmed kicking two year-old son to the ground before shaking and smacking himGas station robber shoots man in buttocks before stealing his $8,500 gold chain‘These low oxygen levels (called ocean anoxia) help trigger the conditions needed for making fossil fuels like oil and coal in the first place.

She said she wasn’t aware of any specific cases where people had been deported but urged people to contact her if they knew of any.Immigrants from the Caribbean were invited to come to Britain with their families to help rebuild the country after WWII, but many don’t have documentation as bureaucracy was less rigid at the time.They are here totally legitimately, but have suffered consequences because they can’t prove it.If you lay down with dogs, you get fleas!This is a day of national shame: the PM and Home Sec must apologise! pic.twitter.comgxqoSErU3oTottenham MP David Lammy, whose own parents came from Guyana, was praised for a passionate speech in the Commons today.He said: ‘It is inhumane and cruel for so many of that Windrush Generation to have suffered so long in this condition, and for the Secretary of State to only make a statement today.‘Can she explain how many have been deported? It’s her department – she should know the number.‘Can she tell the house how many have been detained as prisoners in their own country?‘How many have been denied health under the NHS? How many have been denied their pensions? How many have lost their jobs?‘This is a day of national shame.’David Lammy said their treatment is ‘inhumane and cruel’ (Picture: BBC)He accused the government of pandering to far-right rhetoric on immigration leading to awful human consequences, saying: ‘When you lie down with dogs, you get fleas’.Ms Rudd told MPs she was ‘concerned’ that the Home Office had ‘become too concerned with policy and strategy, and sometimes loses sight of the inidual’.‘This is about iniduals, and we have seen the inidual stories, and they have been, some of them, terrible to hear, and that is why I have acted.’She added: ‘I am not aware of any specific cases of a person being removed in these circumstances.‘That is why I have asked the high commissioners if they know of any, that they should bring it to me.‘And I would ask anybody here if they know of any such circumstances, they should bring them to the Home Office.’She earlier apologised for the way the Windrush generation had been treated, telling MPs during Home Office questions: ‘Frankly, some of the ways they have been treated has been wrong, has been appalling and I am sorry.’The  ‘Empire Windrush’ arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica with 482 Jamaicans on board, in 1948 (Picture: Getty)The Windrush Generation has been described as the people who arrived in the UK from the Caribbean between 1948 and 1971. It garnered its name from the ship MV Empire Windrush which was the first to carry workers over from Jamaica in 1948.People were moving over from the Caribbean after a call from the UK for more workers in industries such as agriculture and mining – in short, they were invited to help the country which was struggling after WWII.The Windrush Generation ends at 1971 as that is when the Immigration Act came in. The immigration before this was poorly documented and the Home Office did not keep accurate records or issue paperwork to those with the right to remain in the UK. This has not been a problem for years, but those without documents are now being told that they are necessary if they want to work, use public services or just live in the UK.We explain more here.Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the Government must ‘consider the question of compensation’ and said: ‘We have to acknowledge when the Commonwealth heads of governments are gathered in London, what a disgrace it is that this Government has treated Commonwealth migrants in this way.’Ms Rudd said there would be no removals or detentions: ‘In accordance with my wishes today, there will be no removals or detention as part of any assistance to help former Commonwealth citizens get their proper documentation in place.’MORE: Protester insists Bashar al-Assad is a good man because ‘he’s a doctor’MORE: Jeremy Corbyn claims Donald Trump ordered Theresa May to bomb Syria"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/hipster-865295_1920.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"norwich liverpool hipster london reckons new study","story":"Oh, hipsters. (Picture: PixaBayCC)UK city Brighton And Hove has been crowned as the ‘most hipster’ city in the world, a new study alleges.In its research of 446 cities across 20 countries, it worked out a formula for what constitutes ‘hipster’ because that’s apparently really easily quantifiable now.The fascinating thing here is that London does not even get a look-in to the top 100 cities.As a comparison, New York didn’t get into the top 100 either, despite the contemporary use of the word ‘hipster’ originating in Williamsburg, Brooklyn so we’re taking this study with a pinch of Himalayan salt.According to MoveHub, which conducted the study, despite London and New York being well-known hipster hideouts, it’s almost impossible for them to rank highly because of population densityThe method, which we’re also reading with more pinches of fleur de sel, relies on a lot of different places being in an area for it to ‘qualify’ as hipster.Coffee makes you a hipster. Who knew?But Brighton has 37 vegan eateries, 125 coffee shops and nine record shops per 100,000 people in the British seaside spot, so it’s rammed full of telltale hipster signs, just beating Portland, US, into second place.Across the world, a large number of places at the top of the list were by the sea.The next British city on the index was Manchester in 27th, then Edinburgh in 32nd globally.We’ve written about that in more detail elsewhere.When you single out just UK cities, it shows Norwich and Liverpool with a significantly higher density of hipsters than London.In fact, London is just below average in how hipster it is, according to the index.

I then got hair loss, fatigue, memory loss, brain fog. There was a list of symptoms that goes on and on.’Hannah and her boyfriend Adam appeared on ITV this morning (Picture: REX)Hannah said she and boyfriend Adam Thomas knew something was up and attempted to seek further medical advice, but hit a brick wall when she was told she was ‘crazy’.‘I went for every test out there, everything came back negative,’ she said. ‘I was told I was crazy and put on medication, and that got me through certain periods.’Hannah was on the S Club 7 reunion tour at this point and said the medication merely ‘masked’ what was truly going on.She went on to break up with boyfriend Adam as her illness came between them.‘I was more a carer than a partner,’ Adam said. ‘It was difficult because I had to separate the two. She was behaving in a way I didn’t recognise, and had to remind myself it was symptomatic. I had to remind myself it was her implants.’It turned out that although implants are under warranty, as Hannah couldn’t establish a link between the implants and her illness she wasn’t covered.Hannah was a part of pop group S Club 7(Picture: REX)But after Adam spoke with a doctor in America, who explained she might be suffering from Breast Implant Illness, they suddenly realised what might be wrong, and that there was a solution.‘That gave me the confidence to go with the explant,’ Hannah said, revealing she instantly started feeling better after having the fake books removed. ‘My energy came back in bucketloads, the low grade fever went, the anxiety went down, and then it was just a journey of detoxification and getting the immune system back up.’When asked by Phil how she feels about herself since she had the implants removed, she said: ‘I love them!

I was only 16 years old and working on eight-inch steel pipes, welding thousands of yards of steel pipes at that age, it was absurdly dangerous.\u0027After one year at RPF in LA, I got transferred to finish off at Flag. I was remodeling a lot of the hotel rooms, but then was handpicked to make all the specialty furniture for Cruise\u0027s penthouse.\u0027To this day, Cruise, 55, still has his own suite on the top-floor of the Scientology-owned Osceola Inn, which is dedicated to his own personal taste.Tighe says: \u0027On every other floor at the Osceola, there were seven or eight hotel rooms, but he had the whole floor. It was British colonial style. There were two four-poster beds, all African mahogany, hand made plantation-style shutters 8ft tall.           At 12 years old Tighe (pictured in 2005) signed a billion-year contract with the Sea Org and endured 18-hour days of hard labor and studying  Brendan was punished and sent to the Rehabilitation Project Force (RPF) - a Scientology prison - and forced to do hard labor           After one year at RPF in LA, Tighe was transferred to finish off at Flag and then was handpicked to make all the specialty furniture for Cruise\u0027s penthouse (pictured) \u0027Built-in, custom-made, floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, two giant 8ft by 12ft wide entertainment systems and bead-board ceilings.

The penthouse had triple the amount of cameras than anywhere else, often disguised as smoke alarms.\u0027After Tighe had finished RPF in 2002, he was approached by the deputy security chief who gave him a position at The Sandcastle, a Church-owned hotel mostly used by public Scientologists, who were visiting Clearwater HQ for courses and auditing, and Scientology VIPs.The Sandcastle security control room, where Brendan worked, monitored most areas where Scientology VIPs studied and lived, including Travolta and Cruise\u0027s personal quarters. From 2004, Brendan became the head of security at The Sandcastle until he left five years later.The Top Gun actor would often stay for months at a time, along with his huge entourage, and complete the \u0027Operating Thetan Levels\u0027, the highest of Church studies.\u0027I wasn\u0027t his personal bodyguard, that was a guy called Algar, but for seven years in a row, I was doing his security detail, such as guarding him when he walked down the street and would be checking all the cameras in his living area. I was a top priority with the dentist, I always had to have my teeth whitened and regular check ups. You had to have a good smile for Tom Cruise,\u0027 says Tighe.\u0027Five of us were ordered to get gun licenses out of 47 security, we\u0027d have a gun strapped to our legs, it was specifically for Cruise and Miscavige. It was amped up when the protester group called Anonymous started in the early 2000s.\u0027In all those years, I think he said hi to me three times, even though I\u0027d be in the hotel every single day. When you see him glad-handing everyone in videos, he never did that at Flag, he kept to himself. Even if he was on a course with 200 people, he\u0027d have a three-person security buffer from anyone.     Brendan doing security at an International Association of Scientology Gala circa 2007          Sea Org Day in 2005           Flag Building, the global headquarters for Scientology in Clearwater, Florida\u0027You\u0027d hear that he would travel to obscure Scientology Orgs and shake their hands, but it\u0027s just photo occasions, he\u0027s not like that. He had to have everything private, every detail. I found that odd.\u0027His routine would be - wake up, gym for an hour, then breakfast of all kinds of \u0027shakes, lots of food and protein, all sent to his room by his personal chef, who was one of my close friends called Nico. He just liked bacon and eggs and protein shakes. Then he\u0027d gym again before the day is out. When he would go to exercise, he would want the entire gym wing all to himself.\u0027He\u0027d then go to study, including auditing sessions and refresher courses, he\u0027d be constantly in the classroom. Cruise was a perfectionist and would hang around for several weeks even after being allowed to go, as he wanted more auditing, more courses.\u0027It was beneath Cruise to have his own hotel card, so we had to make sure that he could go through all these doors and they would open and close perfectly. There\u0027s hundreds of doors, with magnetic locks and punch codes. If it took him 30 seconds to go down a hallway, no one else was allowed to use it, same with any public areas and even the urinals. If anything was out of place, like someone had pissed on the floor, Cruise would tell the security. Sometimes it would get back to Miscavige, then someone would really be in trouble.\u0027He had his own private jet so he could go in and out without anyone seeing, Miscavige also got granted use of it. We\u0027d know weeks, if not months, in advance if he was coming, he never just popped in for a day or two.\u0027There were times where he\u0027d have to do movie reshoots during his coursework, but he\u0027d be straight back, or they\u0027d even do it locally very secretly, where directors and producers would meet him at Flag. All his movies fitted around Scientology. The only person he did have time for is Miscavige, and the pair would ride around Clearwater on their motorbikes or go to the movies.     Brendan had befriended Cruise\u0027s mother Mary Lee, who converted in the mid 2000s           While working as the PR officer for a fundraising unit he invited Mary Lee to an awards banquet. Above is her thank you letter to Tighe          Invitation to Brendan to start the Operating Thetan Level 2 - there are eight levels in Scientology, which followers study and it costs a lot of money\u0027When I witnessed it for the first time, I thought I was going to have a heart attack, they were putting on their motorbike gear on a public street, in full view of everyone. They\u0027d then drive to the movies, which they\u0027d do a lot, I don\u0027t know how no one ever noticed them. They\u0027d then ride back, talk for an hour by the road, then go their separate ways,\u0027 says Tighe.\u0027Cruise emulates Miscavige in every way.\u0027But it was his relationship with children Isabella and Connor which stuck with Tighe. Nothing got in the way of his studies, family was second to Scientology, The kids would even stay in different lodgings.\u0027Although he was at the Osceola, he\u0027d rent a few rooms at The Sandcastle for his staff, Isabella and Connor, and their teachers and caretakers. I never, ever saw him with his kids apart from one time in 2007 when it was his birthday on the 4th of July. I don\u0027t want to paint a bleak picture, but I was watching hundreds of cameras and I never saw them with him. They\u0027d even be making faces into the cameras.\u0027 \u0027They would be taken to amusement parks, do schooling in their hotel rooms. I heard staff talk about how they constantly had to make sure that the kids were on Cruise\u0027s side. By the mid-2000s, Cruise, who came from a strict Catholic upbringing in Louisville, Kentucky, had converted his mother Mary Lee to Scientology, and his three sisters - Cass, Marian and Lee Ann - they were all working for him in some capacity.          Cruise is the only one with a \u0027direct line\u0027 to leader David Miscavige (pictured), Tighe claims \u0027Cruise\u0027s mom was always there at Flag, she was a lovely woman, we would talk for hours sometimes, she was so nice. His mom always remembered my name. I would feel safer talking to her when Cruise wasn\u0027t in town, I wouldn\u0027t want to get caught by him. \u0027She was getting lots and lots of auditing and was very happy about it, she was so proud of her son, she was the sweetest woman in the world. My take on it was that he was still a mommy\u0027s boy, but his sisters were under his thumb.\u0027After I left security in 2009, I was the PR officer for a fundraising unit and organized an awards banquet and show. Mary Lee was personally invited by me and sent me a thank you letter.\u0027The two-sided letter said: \u0027Beings of this universe, The entertainment was great, the food was great, the table decor was great could have danced all night. Much love, Mary Lee South.\u0027Yet Tighe tells a different story about his sisters and Cruise\u0027s attitude to them. \u0027He wanted all his sisters and their children at the same super high level as him, being super dedicated Scientologists and not dragging him down in anyway. \u0027They would work for him either in management or housekeeping, but, in talking to his family, it was always about making him happy.\u0027Nothing was left to chance with Cruise and when he orced from Nicole Kidman in 2001, it was leader Miscavige\u0027s chief aim to find him a girlfriend.          Tighe said he had met church member Kirstie Alley several times. He also claims to have helped Kelly Preston get a birthday gift for TravoltaTighe would also accidentally get the reports on Cruise\u0027s latest brainwaves, who would then make handler Davis fire off a note to Miscavige. In a Scientology promo video from 2008, Cruise was interviewed about what the Church means to him, and he\u0027s seen laughing on camera. The clip went viral and Tighe says Cruise wanted the clip played continuously on Scientology TV, which he wanted created just for him.\u0027Tommy would get slapped around for the littlest thing that Cruise was not happy about. Tommy was the buffer between Cruise and Miscavige, Miscavige would never directly deny any Cruise\u0027s requests, but usually they\u0027d go through Tommy, who\u0027d then have to handle it delicately,\u0027 says Tighe.\u0027For example, after he got the Freedom Medal, in one of the reports, it said that Cruise wanted to create a TV network on Scientology. He was so pumped up about his medal that he wanted them to create a video of the ceremony, then play it 247 on some new channel he wanted. \u0027He wanted the full interview, the one where he\u0027s laughing his a** off, on the TV network, he thought it was the best thing ever. Tommy had the worst task of having to tell him we couldn\u0027t do it.\u0027When Cruise eventually settled down with Dawsons Creek actress Katie Holmes, 39, and they had a daughter Suri, now 11, security proved even more difficult. \u0027Cruise and Katie would be super competitive, they\u0027d race down opposing stairwells to get to the gym, silly things like that to see who could run there faster.\u0027Scientology and him was always first, without a doubt.\u0027Katie was always nicer to us than Cruise. Cruise never said: Hey, I know you work hard behind the scenes for us. Just never happened. Whenever she was there, she\u0027d get giant amounts of Cold Stone ice cream for us, she wanted to make sure all the staff got something behind the scenes."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/15/10/4B14CE4600000578-5617539-image-m-2_1523784441050.jpg","title":"Meghans family left dark royal wedding invite","story":"    A 19-year-old Meghan Markle is pictured on her paternal grandmother Doris\u0027s 85th birthday in Florida, USA           Meghan Markle on her high school graduation day, accompanied by her father Thomas MarkleOne of Meghan\u0027s uncles reportedly said: \u0027I talked to Thomas last week and he didn\u0027t seem to know what the problem was.\u0027He told me he hasn\u0027t heard anything and he didn\u0027t even know if he would be walking Meghan down the aisle.\u0027 The newspaper says the family are waiting to find out if the \u0027controversial behaviour\u0027 of some of Meghan\u0027s relatives has left them frozen out of the wedding. Meghan\u0027s nephew is a CANNABIS farmer who is planning a new...Did Meghan and her ex split up over a pasta dish?

Konstantin, from Moscow, said: \u0027So our team has been in many different places - I\u0027d say we have come through both ice and fire, but this trip to Baikonur was the toughest in all the senses of this word.\u0027 Pictured: His team standing at the base of the rocket in Baikonur, with metal platforms rising to the top on either side           The ageing spacecraft are kept in the enormous Baikonur Cosmodrome, which is based in a Russian enclave deep within Kazakhstan\u0027s desert steppe. Baikonur was the world\u0027s first and largest space launch facility, with both Sputnik 1 (the first artificial Earth satellite) and Yuri Gagarin\u0027s Vostok 1 (responsible for the first manned spaceflight) launched from it. Now the facility is home to two shuttles that sit gathering dust after the termination of the Buran Space Program in 1993. Pictured: Two members of the team stand on one of the abandoned craft, which is literally gathering dust           Konstantin said: \u0027I hope our story will be interesting for everyone and I will be invited to work in Roskosmos - I like to photograph spaceships. Also I need to say that as a result of this trip we decided to build our own rocket - which is what we are actively dealing with now. It was a long way ahead - only a little bit shorter than to Paris. There were a lot of interesting things to see (with no tickets, special tours, approvals and so on) and of course adventures.\u0027 Pictured: A small doorway at the spaceport           His five-man team journeyed 15,500 miles in total from their Moscow starting point and had to turn off their headlights to avoid being seen by guards. Konstantin said: \u0027Baikonur is 2500km from Moscow. Going there by car is the cheapest and easiest way. The plan was as easy as the following: using offline maps - we wanted to get by car as close as possible in the desert then leave a car and walk through the sand towards the buildings of cosmodrome\u0027. Pictured: The spaceport, photographed from the long grass on its periphery           Describing his journey, the photographer said: \u0027We didn\u0027t want to be seen from the cosmodrome - that\u0027s why we drove with the lights off, sometimes using portable torches to light the way. But soon the car got stuck and we had to continue walking - we still had about two days before the launch. We were heading towards the biggest workshop on the territory of the cosmodrome.\u0027 Pictured: A rocket they found at the base           Konstantin said he used many of the old buildings to hide from detection. He explained: \u0027All those abandoned buildings were just a perfect place to hide. There were many places not to be noticed or found by the cosmodrome workers\u0027          Two large buildings at the base were photographed at night, with the starry Kazakh desert sky bright overhead. Konstantin described the secret mission as an adventure           During the final leg of the journey - a walk - it was hard to remain hidden, he said, explaining: \u0027It took us about 6 hours to walk 22km - and it was a point when we saw the buildings of the cosmodrome, then we had to move like partisans in order not to be seen and we still had to walk 4-6 km to get to the point.\u0027 Pictured: Their prize, an abandoned shuttle           The team of adventurers also climbed into the space shuttle and took photographs of the cockpit, which contained many of the original dials and toggles           The audacious snaps were taken by Konstantin Kosmodemiansky, a blogger and photographer from Moscow who trekked 17 miles through the desert with his friends in order to capture the bizarre scene          The ageing shuttles reside in a massive spaceport that sits alone, miles from any other settlements.

But now he\u0027s been told to pipe down because he\u0027s too loudFollowing a single complaint, Wayne has been ordered to keep quiet. \u0027The council said they had a phone call from a woman saying we were making so much noise shouting. The official said it was under some sort of noise pollution regulation.\u0027Originally, they told him he couldn\u0027t shout until after lunch, but now the ban has been extended all day.Wayne, who pays £340 a month for his pitch, is understandably livid. \u0027The market has been there for hundreds of years and now someone moves into the High Street and decides they don\u0027t like the noise. It\u0027s part and parcel of street life. It\u0027s part of the atmosphere.\u0027If stall-holders cannot shout, then you lose part of that tradition. If I don\u0027t shout out I\u0027m going to be at least 30 to 40 per cent down on profit.\u0027Market traders are already struggling, like so many small shops today. Town centres are dying, not just because of online competition and out-of-town superstores, but as a result of extortionate rents, sky-high business rates and draconian parking regimes.Lymington is fortunate still to enjoy a vibrant market culture. So why the does the council seem hell-bent on destroying it?                             It\u0027s part and parcel of street life. It\u0027s part of the atmosphere.

They could have said to the woman who objected: \u0027Thank you, madam, but the market has been central to life in Lymington for the past 800 years and traders shouting is an integral part of that. We\u0027ve got better things to do than hang around the market with a decibel meter measuring the cries of fruit and veg sellers to see if they breach noise pollution regulations. Have a nice day.\u0027Not every complaint has to be taken seriously and acted upon accordingly. Just because someone objects to something, it doesn\u0027t mean it should be banned.This isn\u0027t the first time a market trader has fallen foul of an inidual with a grievance. Last October, I brought you the saga of Tina Gayle, a stall-holder on Loughborough market, in Leicestershire, who had her licence to trade withdrawn by the local council.Her \u0027crime\u0027 was to refuse to stop selling coffee mugs depicting the ancient order of the Knights Templar. Enforcement officers moved in after someone complained that the mugs celebrated the murder of Muslims by Knights Templar during the Crusades and were therefore \u0027offensive\u0027.Corner shop owner nicknamed Arkwright who has worked at his...\u0027I wish he would just shut up\u0027: Fruit and veg seller, 53, is...Share this article    Wayne, who pays £340 a month for his pitch in Lymington, is understandably lividHeaven forfend that anyone should have their sensitivities offended. A council spokesman said: \u0027We want the public to have a safe and enjoyable experience when visiting our markets and we have a duty to ensure that items sold do not cause public offence. It\u0027s not for us to comment on why the mugs were offensive to the complainant.\u0027Yes, it is. Why should a single complaint — whether about \u0027offensive\u0027 coffee mugs or a stall-holder shouting too loudly — be sufficient to threaten someone else\u0027s right to earn a living, or end a centuries-old tradition?And while councils are only too willing to dance to the tune of aggrieved iniduals, they have no compunction in ignoring wider public opinion, especially when it comes to market traders. The reason that vendors such as Wayne Bellows now sell their fruit and veg in £1 \u0027bowls\u0027 — and not the pounds and ounces most of their customers would prefer — is because of the war on imperial measures pursued with Stalinist zeal by Town Halls all over Britain.Councils started persecuting market traders 20-odd years ago, forcing them to adopt metric weights and measures to \u0027bring us into line with Europe\u0027.Fishmongers, greengrocers and butchers were all charged with criminal offences because they wouldn\u0027t use kilograms.One fruit and veg merchant, Steve Thoburn, from Sunderland, was dragged through the courts for the heinous offence of using imperial scales.Public opinion was firmly on his side, but that didn\u0027t stop the authorities fighting him all the way to the European Court of Human Rights.Mr Thoburn died of a heart attack soon after losing his final appeal, aged just 39. He was hounded to death by officialdom.The Brexit vote was motivated not just by a desire to regain control of our own laws and borders. It was a rejection of the political class at every level, from Brussels right down to parish pump.That includes the jumped-up jobsworths who think they have the right to micro-manage our lives and stop market traders doing something they\u0027ve been doing for 800 years simply because of a single complaint from someone who finds it \u0027offensive\u0027.Wayne Bellows should tell them all to go to hell. At the top of his voice. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/17/00/4B38226900000578-0-image-m-14_1523919752529.jpg","title":"Collars pets ELECTRIC SHOCKS help SAFE humane vets say","story":"    Pictured: One of the shock collars modelled on a dog Collars which give pets mild electric shocks to help keep them safe in gardens are humane and in the animals’ best interests, vets say.The collars are used by 40,000 pet owners in the UK and buzz before sending a mild electrical pulse to the animal if it crosses a boundary.Others, known as remote training devices, allow an owner or trainer to deliver a shock to the animal at the push of a button if it misbehaves.Last month the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs announced a ban on both types of collar after pressure from the RSCPA and other animal rights campaigners. It could come into force as early as the end of this month.

Like everything else he touched, it became a totem drenched in personal meaning, the symbolic headgear of a self-appointed shaman. In reality, according to those who knew him, the hat covered scars from a Stuka crash, in which rear gunner Beuys was seriously wounded, on the eastern front in 1944. That much is true. Probably. Yet the story Beuys later made up about his wartime experience has been discredited since his death in 1986 by people who bothered to check the Third Reich documents. Beuys claimed he was rescued, barely alive, from the burning Stuka by Tatar nomads and swathed in fat and felt to resurrect him. It was a tale that explained not just his survival but his rebirth as a radical visionary out of the ashes of his youth in the Nazi era. The trouble was, it was a lie. Does that matter? Is it still a useful fable, part of his crazy vision, or should we suspect that his entire artistic output is similarly dishonest, or even that it is tainted by a past he never truly rejected or explained? It’s not as if you can escape the image of the burned Beuys saved by fat and felt in the Thaddeus Ropac Gallery’s ambitious survey of his art and ideas. These symbolic substances are everywhere. There’s a cello covered in grey felt, emblazoned with a red cross. Nearby hangs a felt suit in the same muted colour, as well as a camp bed swathed in felt. As for fat, here it is in the form of 41-year-old margarine in cardboard trays in a glass case. Take away Beuys’s myth and what does this stuff actually mean?  When I walked in and saw that felt suit, what I saw was despair. It has the look, to me, not of a shaman’s garb but the ersatz clothing of a totalitarian state. Far from escaping the past, the art of Beuys reenacts it. What about his “Feldbed”, or Campaign Bed – a day bed from his studio that he later turned into a sculpture? It is explicitly military, a camp bed from a long-ago war. But this exhibition made me fear I am giving Beuys the benefit of the doubt in seeing tragic depth in works that are glib symbols of redemption. These are the meanings I prefer to see in Beuys’s art. With its old, worn and organic materials it has a loamy, disturbing taste of history. On a rusty tripod, for example, stands a dark cube of matted earth with smashed pieces of terracotta buried in it. This layer of broken pottery looks like the remains of an ancient civilisation. It is tremendously suggestive, an image of the archaeology of human life in all its violence and tragedy: the barbaric ages, the brief and vanished golden ages. Thaddaeus Ropac – one of Europe’s top art dealers, who represents the Beuys estate – explains that this piece, Boothia Felix, symbolises a human. That arrangement of stones and an ironing board over there, that’s a stag. As for the turd-like excrescences of clay all over the ground, these are “lemmings” or “primordial animals”. All are components in Beuys’s Stag Monuments, a series of expansive installations he devised in 1982 out of the detritus of his studio. The biggest Stag Monument of all, with its lightning-like cascade of melted iron, is on permanent view at Tate Modern. Listening to the gallerist, I am uncomfortably reminded of how I recently tried to explain Beuys to a group of Guardian readers at Tate Modern. Beuys movingly portrays the tragedy of modern history, I said – but then found it hard to explain just how he did. So perhaps my desire to see history in his art is just an attempt to rationalise the power it exerts on me. Ropac’s exhibition suggests we really should take Beuys at his word. It draws on the Beuys estate to show how seriously he himself took all his mystic symbolism. In a group of early sculptures he made in the late 1940s, he portrays a suffering gothic Christ, makes a Celtic cross, and imitates an ice age Venus. He is reaching back for the roots of symbolism, the ancient mythic past. The most haunting of these works is an unfinished sculpture of a horse. He set out to make it using the ancient lost wax process – where molten metal is poured into a mould created with a wax model – but never got as far as casting it in bronze. Years later, at the very end of his life, he found this forgotten piece, split open the mould and put it in a vitrine. The wax horse is yellow, as if it were made of butter. On a wall hangs Thor’s hammer, emanating curly bits of bronze. You can’t get much more Teutonic than that. Beuys may, after all, be an artist it’s best not to think about too much. He helped save European art after the second world war and inspires some of today’s most admired artists, such as Anselm Kiefer. Yet he was also a bullshitter, a fake prophet and a Wagnerian poseur whose overblown myths are as daft and empty as the Aryan nonsense he imbibed – without any choice – in his youth.

However, they acknowledged that the market had reacted to uncertainty over succession planning at WPP, compounding a performance that has resulted in shares in the group declining by a third over the past year. One of WPP’s largest shareholders, Harris Associates, said it was “regrettable” to have a leadership transition without Sorrell’s involvement. “It highlights the apparent lack of detailed succession planning that has troubled us and many other observers for some time,” Roddy Davidson, an analyst at investment group Shore Capital, said. “We are not overly concerned about the immediate impact of Sorrell’s departure on the group’s flagship agencies as these are major international enterprises in their own right, with strong performance track records and independent management structures. That said, the resultant vacuum at the top of the company is not ideal.”It may not seem like it but Sir Martin Sorrell had a career before WPP. His affair with advertising began as Saatchi \u0026amp Saatchi’s first finance directorSorrell made his first step toward global domination at the age of 40, investing in a small Kent-based maker of wire baskets called Wire \u0026amp Plastic ProductsSorrell announces himself on the global stage by buying J Walter Thompson, the world’s oldest ad agency and an iconic US brand for $566m.

He stepped down on 14 AprilSorrell, 73, has “unreservedly denied” the misconduct allegations and WPP’s board has said it will not be publishing the outcome of the investigations into them by an independent law firm. The decision not to publish was criticised by the Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Vince Cable, who said there was a “real lack of transparency” and “any investigations done by the company should be made public”. The company said it had concluded the investigation and had no further comment to make. After years of above-par performances WPP put out two growth warnings last year – before reporting its worst financial year since the 2009 ad recession – as clients pulled budgets and investors started to question the future of the global holding company model in the increasingly digital age.“Whether WPP should survive in its current form is a more challenging question,” Davidson said. “Particularly as an increasingly complex and dynamic media landscape, and growing competition from more focused players will, in our view, require a degree of flexibility and agility that large holding companies could struggle to deliver.”A number of names have emerged as potential runners and riders to succeed Sorrell, including the chief executive of publishing and exhibitions group Informa, Stephen Carter, who has worked at Ofcom, the cable firm NTL and at WPP’s ad agency JWT Adam Crozier, whose pedigree includes running ITV, Royal Mail, the Football Association and Saatchi \u0026amp Saatchi the Sky chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, and Andrew Robertson, chief executive of WPP rival Omnicom’s global BBDO ad network.The frontrunning internal candidates are Mark Read, the chief executive of Wunderman and WPP Digital, and Andrew Scott, a top executive at WPP’s European operation, who were appointed WPP’s joint chief operating officers following Sorrell’s departure on Saturday.“We believe Sir Martin will be hard to replace with one person,” Paul Richards, analyst at Numis, said. “The succession has led to questions over the size and scope of WPP. Our base case is for a new management team to continue and refine the existing strategy, though we acknowledge that any group without a chief executive is vulnerable to a bid approach in the interregnum.”Alex DeGroote, analyst at Cenkos Securities, puts the break-up value of WPP’s parts at about £17 a share, valuing the group at £22bn. WPP’s current share price is £11.50, a market capitalisation of £15bn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb4977df3c64b8f5e4e757e1481cefd2d12196ee/0_0_2427_1456/master/2427.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=420ce6a15e495d77d7eec72dcea2bda4 2600w","title":"london fields lido did saving a pool mean losing a community","story":"When campaigners successfully reopened the open-air pool in Hackney, they had no idea it would turn their community into something unrecognisableOne summer day in 2003, the local residents of Hackney, north-east London, were invited on a tour of the abandoned site of London Fields Lido. Although closed since 1988, the pool was not empty. Squatters had moved in, and held raves in the old pool tank – much to the annoyance of campaigners, who had cleaned it up for community events. The tour was to introduce locals to a bold new redevelopment plan for the lido: to reopen the pool, install a cafe and evict the squatters.As the locals were shown around, the squatters sat in front of the changing rooms, where purple buddleia had begun to grow above the doors, and watched them. One woman on the tour, meanwhile, enquired whether she would have to swim if she wanted a coffee. It was a moment that seemed to capture the extremes of life in Hackney: young homeless people facing eviction, and an affluent new resident who saw an opportunity for a latte.Campaigners, however, remember the 18 years spent trying to resurrect it. When the pool closed for refurbishment last year, it stayed closed for four months longer than expected, causing locals to anxiously recall the fate of Haggerston Baths a mile away. The grade-II listed building closed in 2000. Despite a 16-year battle, it did not reopen: an unhappy ending for local campaigners.Indeed, you could write an alternative history of Hackney through the story of its pools. As well as London Fields and Haggerston Baths there was the catastrophe of Clissold Leisure Centre, which cost £45m –nearly seven times the original budget – and closed in 2003 for four years following a flood, just 18 months after it had opened. There is also the furore over Britannia Leisure Centre, which despite a £300,000 facelift in 2016 is to be demolished as part of a major redevelopment that will include a leisure centre with three swimming pools, a school and 480 new homes – only 80 of which will be classed as affordable. Victoria Park was once home to the largest modern lido in London. It was demolished in 1990 to make way for a car park.The closure of pools has been disastrous for Hackney schoolchildren. In 2006, a feasibility study on Haggerston Baths found that four out of the five secondary schools surveyed did not provide any form of swimming, due to lack of funding or facilities. At one point in the mid-noughties there was only one swimming pool with lanes to serve a population of more than 200,000.In the last decade and a half, the gap has grown more visible, as Hackney has become one of the hippest destinations in London, with its chic restaurants, boutiques and cafes. On a hot summer weekend, there are so many people in the park that it looks as if there’s a festival underway. And at the heart of it all is London Fields Lido.Caroline, who serves freshly baked croissants and toasties at a kiosk in the lido, has lived in the neighbourhood for 33 years and has seen the new arrivals flood in. Her flat overlooks the park and she complains about the impact of the crowds – the shortage of toilets and the noise. She regrets the loss of community spirit, and feels that, with rare exceptions, the incomers don’t know how to be good neighbours. ‘I think they’re afraid, they don’t want to mix,” she says. “People walk past you as though you’ve got green wires coming out of your head.”The original Lido is an island beach resort in Venice. It became the popular name for open air pools in the 1930s, bringing continental holiday glamour to gloomy British summers during a boom for building outdoor pools. It was with this ambition that London Fields Lido opened in 1932.As Janet Smith reveals in her very enjoyable history Liquid Assets, the fashion for lido-building was driven by an egalitarian ethos. When Morecambe’s open air pool opened in 1936, Sir Josiah Stamp, a director of the Bank of England, declared: “Bathing reduces rich and poor, high and low, to a common standard of enjoyment and health. When we get down to swimming, we get down to democracy.” London County Council (LCC) was particularly zealous in its lido-building programme. Herbert Morrison, leader of the LCC in the late 30s, wanted London to be a “city of lidos”, with every citizen within walking distance of an open air pool.Margaret Thatcher signalled the end for public swimming with her war on local government spending. London Fields Lido was just one of the many casualties in the 1980s as councils cut their budgets.Mike Martin remembers standing in front of the bulldozer at 7am. He was part of a campaign to save London Fields Lido, which had halted the council’s plans to demolish the pool – but he and his fellow campaigners were then tipped off that the demolition team had somehow not got the message and had turned up to do the job anyway. The lido was saved in the nick of time.In their determination to resurrect London Fields Lido, campaigners including Martin joined forces with architects and the Environment Trust, and presented plans for the pool to the community in 2003. Hackney council finally agreed to fund the renovation in 2004.The transformation that has taken place in the neighbourhood since was initially driven by campaigners seeking to regenerate the borough – not only at the lido, but also a few minutes away on Broadway Market, a street below London Fields that was once a drovers’ route into the city. It hosts a hugely successful Saturday market launched by local residents and traders in 2004, two years before the pool reopened. Time Out calls the street “a promenade for the East End fashion set”.Many people are boosters of the newly revitalised area. “What does it say about the last 30-odd years of government in this country that people from other parts of the country are travelling down to London to spend the weekend in a park?” asks Hackney councillor Jon Burke, who is responsible for energy, sustainability and community services, including lidos. “Where have we gone so badly wrong that Liverpool, Sheffield, Leeds, Newcastle, Hull, don’t offer this standard of living to everybody?”For some of the campaigners who kickstarted the regeneration, however, there is a rueful recognition of the role they may have played in changing the character of the neighbourhood. Liz Veitch, a retired teacher, says that when she first moved to London Fields 25 years ago, she could almost see the tumbleweed blowing down Broadway Market, a street that had once been home to a popular East End market. Hackney council made a number of failed attempts to revive it, but it was only when local residents took on the challenge that the market succeeded. Her late husband, journalist Andrew Veitch, played an instrumental role in the market’s success, setting up a community interest company that he ran for 10 years. The revival of the market was a catalyst that helped transform London Fields into a destination for hipsters, swiftly followed by the reopening of the lido.“In the beginning it was local people trying to make what was a beaten up area a bit more attractive,” says Veitch. “People who moved in here, like us, felt they ought to do more in the community. I would say that the people buying into this area do not seem to share the same sense of community. The youngsters buying or renting these flats are too busy trying to live, but also there is an air of entitlement amongst amongst some of the more affluent members of the next generation. Thatcher’s children if you like. They don’t get involved here. When we were growing up, it was a mantra that was part of our upbringing - if you’re in a community you join in and do what you can.”When Hackney Council began selling off properties in Broadway Market at the start of the millennium, resulting in the eviction of popular local independent businesses, there was a huge campaign to stop the demolition of Cafe Francesca, run by Tony Platia for 30 years. Gentrification became a very dirty word, as Hackney council was accused of betraying the neighbourhood and getting into bed with the property developers.“The lido does not reflect the demography of Hackney,” says Josephine Bacon, who runs the lido user group. “It’s very white, it’s very middle class, it’s quite young. Hackney and Better’s advertisements promote swimming for everyone, saying come and join in, and they have photographs of black people on their posters and banners. Of course there are some black people there, but hardly any. And probably not very many unemployed or low income swimmers either. And I’m not really sure why - whether because it’s too expensive or because London Fields has become a chi-chi area. I don’t know what can be done to make it more inclusive.”It’s a problem that goes beyond Hackney. Swim England’s research in 2015 revealed that ethnic minorities are half as likely to know how to swim as white members of the population. The closure of Hackney’s pools in the noughties may also have had an impact on the next generation of swimmers. It may, however, be true that the number of options is increasing: London Fields Lido is dwarfed by the London Aquatics Centre in Stratford, a legacy of the 2012 Olympics that is home to three pools. The once run-down neighbourhood of Hackney Wick, on the edge of what was the Olympic Park, is now touted as the next London Fields – but that has also meant the demolition of Vittoria Wharf, forcing out a community of poorer residents and artists.London Fields Lido “is not a country club for the affluent,” Burke insists. “It’s important that this facility is able to be accessed by people irrespective of their socioeconomic, ethnic, religious backgrounds.” He says he hopes that the new refurbishment of the changing rooms – which includes the introduction of internal cubicles and internal lockers – will broaden its appeal, as well as satisfying those who have previously been concerned about modesty or security.So far, it’s hard to tell. The newly-refurbished lido reopened in January many of the swimmers are young and white, more typical of newcomers to the neighbourhood than longtime residents. This may not be the classless vision of lido culture that its great political advocates imagined in the 30s when they built the pools in London and across the UK. It may not be the community that the campaigners imagined either, when they fought to revive the lido and what was then a run-down market street. But it’s now a fixture and a landmark – even if that’s as a symbol of ision as much as transformation.A version of this article appears in Tales of Two Londons, edited by Claire Armitstead Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/868df3251f60c7f0fe71cd49a179e83ddfeb27ff/112_592_2756_1654/master/2756.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7c5b3c438ae0dbe93ded39a57ac89b36 1240w","title":"landlords social parasites last people should be honouring buy to let","story":"The landlord of the year award is announced on Monday, bestowed by the home insurance provider Home Protect. “Landlords often get a bad rap,” the CEO explains on its website, and I’ll stop him there. They don’t get a bad enough rap.When they do make the news, you already know the story. Tory landlords dragging their absentee, ancient arses into parliament solely to vote down a bill that says rented properties should be “fit for human habitation”. “Lockdown” landlords bleeding councils dry, installing vulnerable people in micro-units, with inadequate fire provisions, so they can soak up treble the housing benefit. Who can forget the competition in the Daily Mail that offered up a buy-to-let property as top prize? This, from a paper that crucifies scroungers. Scroungers being people who live off others, and shirk their responsibilities. But back to landlords, eh?Landlord of the year. Lol! Rofbhawuild! (Rolling on the floor, banging my head against the wall until I lose my deposit.) Who is it going to be? One who lets you have a pet? Some of my friends are landlords, and I’m sorry to say it, but they are going straight to hell too. Imagine how satisfyingly overcrowded the underworld must be with landlords partitioning the seventh circle into seven more circles, charging each other extra for underfloor heating. The best thing you can say about them is that they are better than letting agents. But that’s like giving Stalin a humanitarian award for massacring fewer people than Genghis Khan. The fact is, they’re all rogue. Whether your landlord is a genial profiteer or an actual psychopath is the luck of the draw. Anyone can be one, if they have made enough money or inherited property, and those are two of the worst qualifications imaginable. Like anyone who thrives off the housing crisis, they are social parasites.I wonder what is meant by a “good” private landlord, worthy of recognition. Someone who charges below insane market rates, purely by choice? Who pays for top-quality repairs, when they could get a mate to do a botched job on the cheap? Who offers long-term secure tenancies, despite the fact there is no legal minimum? Who refrains from revenge evictions? Who isn’t Fergus Wilson? Someone who displays basic human decency, in an unregulated sector that encourages its opposite? Who acts, in other words, not like a landlord at all?If you are an oldster with a lodger, I’m sure you’re fine. But it’s the buy-to-let vampires, monopolising new builds, setting social inequality in stone, who define the term today. Try to understand these characters, so money-driven that they view people’s need to sleep indoors as the chance to turn a tidy profit. (Having said that, the main cause of homelessness in the UK is, by a long way, the termination of short-term tenancies, so maybe they’re not that committed to it.) No pets, no posters, no parties. That’s their mantra. No repairs. Don’t wear down the crap carpet. Just sit on a damp mattress and cough up the cash. All so they can keep expanding, squatting over lives like feudal incubi. If you’re one of these people, you can shove your property portfolio up your arse. And make sure you leave room for your award.The notion of houses as investment opportunities of any sort has been a cancer. Here’s a radical idea: buy a home if you can, then live in it, and do something else with your time. Something that isn’t about exploiting the less privileged. Apologies for taking a Daily Mail-sounding stance on this, but landlords: get a proper job.A University of Kansas professor studying friendship has concluded that it takes more than 50 hours of shared time to become anything more than an acquaintance, 90\u0026nbsphours\u0026nbspto develop a friendship, and more than 200 hours of time together to become close friends.

The types of experience matter, too – hours spent working together don’t count for as much, he has decided.

Narrowly targeted missile strikes against chemical weapons facilities were a direct response to what was almost certainly the Assad regime’s chemical attack on the town of Douma, which left dozens dead. Parliament should have been consulted before the missiles were fired, but now that they have fallen we must hope their intended message gets through.Unfortunately, there are good reasons to doubt it will. The strikes were calibrated with competing goals in mind. They had to be tough enough to deter Syrian president Bashar al-Assad from using chemical weapons again, but not so tough that they would provoke Russia, which backs the Syrian regime, into retaliatory action that might escalate the conflict. This may prove too narrow a strategic window to be truly effective. With ample warning of a strike, the Syrian regime had plenty of time to move stockpiles and soldiers away from the target areas before the bombing started. Mr Assad maintains the capacity to use chemical weapons against his own people and the willingness to prop up his tyranny at the cost of any number of civilian lives. The weekend’s bombing was less a message than a gesture – and a gesture that fails in its effect sends the opposite message to that intended. That may have been the message received by both sides in the war: “The American strikes did not change anything for Syrians on the ground,” Osama Shoghari, an anti-government activist, said afterwards.Mrs May’s claim that “we have not done this because President Trump asked us to do so. We have done it because we believe it was the right thing to do” is difficult to take seriously. Had Mr Trump not gone ahead, France and the UK would not have bombed Syria by themselves. This is essentially a US military operation. That leaves the UK and France pinning their hopes on the White House. We know that President Trump is impulsive, abrasive, crude and thin-skinned. The former FBI director, James Comey, has branded him “unethical, and untethered to the truth and institutional values”. We also know that Mr Trump is consumed by a variety of scandals at home that will leave him at best distracted and, at worst, seeking distraction. There are no easy options in Syria and the international community should be ashamed that our interventions, be they military or diplomatic, have failed to bring peace. Mr Trump is not the man to repair the consequences of earlier mistakes.We hope Assad, Russia and Iran take this latest attack as proof that the international community is prepared to buttress its diplomacy with force when necessary, even as we fear that they won’t. There will not be a military solution to this conflict. And while a diplomatic solution has proved elusive, it is the only one that will stop the bloodshed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfc0e92114371c5dd51356832fc28bae3357d1ea/0_64_3865_2319/master/3865.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=23fc962a45b216ad545c866c85f7a284 1240w","title":"kendrick lamar pulitzer prize weinstein new york times","story":"The most famous names of American journalism were honoured on Monday with Pulitzer prizes for investigating Donald Trump and exposing endemic sexual harassment in Hollywood.And in a dramatic cultural breakthough, 30-year-old rapper Kendrick Lamar won a Pulitzer for music in a category long reserved for classical works.The New York Times and New Yorker were jointly awarded the Pulitzer prize for public service on Monday for investigating accusations of sexual harassment and assault made against one of the most powerful men in Hollywood, Harvey Weinstein.Reports on the allegations, which Weinstein has denied, led to a cascade of accusations and admissions of sexual misconduct in Hollywood, Silicon Valley, politics and beyond as the #MeToo movement made 2017 a year of reckoning for powerful men. The Times also shared the national reporting Pulitzer with rival the Washington Post, in recognition of each newspaper’s dedicated coverage of Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential election. But in a year when the media has been galvanised by digging into Trump’s chaotic presidency, Lamar’s award for his album Damn also stood out as the rapper from Compton, California became the first rap artist to win a Pulitzer in music. It is the first piece of popular music to receive the music award since it was introduced in 1943. The music award was the last to be announced at the Pulitzer prize ceremony on Monday afternoon at Columbia University in New York City. Pulitzer administrator Dana Canedy, the first woman and person of color to announce the award, smiled while reading Lamar’s name.Before announcing the journalism winners, Canedy explained why these works were selected: “Their work is real news of the highest order, executed nobly as journalism was always intended, without fear or favor.”Her reference to “real news” was a subtle rebuke to Donald Trump’s constant badgering of journalists, which has helped make the phrase “fake news” part of the cultural lexicon. The two national newspapers to take home the most awards, the New York Times and the Washington Post, have been subjected to repeated attacks by the president. Trump has called for the Post to be registered as a lobbying group and frequently complains about reporting done by the “failing” New York Times.The New York Times, however, won the most Pulitzer prizes with three awards. Its final award was in the editorial cartooning for a series profiling a real-life family of refugees in the US. The Times’ rival, the Washington Post, secured two awards. The second was the investigative reporting prize, handed down for the newspaper’s examination of the Republican nominee for the Alabama’s special Senate election, Roy Moore. He lost the race after six women said Moore pursued them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. He denied dating anyone underage and that he had sexually assaulted anyone. Marty Baron, executive editor at the Washington Post, said in a statement: “In the end, the work of these Post journalists stands as a case study in why we need a free and independent press in this country.”The allegations made against Moore also helped drive the commentary award, which was given to John Archibald, an Alabama Media Group writer and longtime Birmingham News columnist, for his writing on state politics.He was one of several regional journalists and newspapers to be awarded a Pulitzer.The Press Democrat, in Santa Rosa, California, earned the breaking news award for its coverage of the wildfires that devastated the state last year.The Arizona Republic, with the USA Today Network, was awarded the explanatory journalism award for a series on the border wall between the US and Mexico.And the Cincinnati Enquirer took home the local reporting award for a package on how the region has been affected by the opioid addiction crisis.Andie Dominick, of the Des Moines Register, received the editorial writing prize for “examining in a clear, indignant voice, free of cliché or sentimentality” the consequences of Iowa healthcare laws.Photographer Ryan Kelly, of the Daily Progress in Charlottesville, Virginia, won the breaking news photography award for capturing the moment a car struck demonstrators during a clash between white supremacists and their opponents.Persistent racism in the US also marked the feature writing award, which went to Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah, for her reporting on Dylann Roof, who killed nine black people at a church in South Carolina, for GQ magazine in the piece A Most American Terrorist.The international reporting prize went to Reuters for its coverage of the Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte’s drug war, which has seen thousands killed. The wire reporting service also won the feature photography award for following the plight of Rohingya refugees fleeing Myanmar.And the New York magazine art critic Jerry Saltz won the criticism prize.Along with Lamar’s Damn, the other winners outside of the journalism categories were Andrew Sean Greer’s Less, for fiction Cost of Living, for drama The Gulf: The Making of An American Sea for US history and Prairie Fires: The American Dreams of Laura Ingalls Wilder, for biography.Poet Frank Bidart won the award for his collection Half-Light and the nonfiction award went to James Forman Jr for Locking Up Our Own: Crime and Punishment in Black America."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc84cf2c4b4cd512659f4c4192bf9c9febf4ead5/0_0_4740_2844/master/4740.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=70a29fa5216f511e991c3863e9c012af 1240w","title":"thousands of children miss out on preferred primary school england","story":"Pressure on places shows signs of easing in areas of England including London and BirminghamAfter an anxious wait documented by many parents on social media, more than half a million families across England were informed on Monday which school their child will be attending in September.Early analysis of local authority data suggests that, in many areas, higher proportions of children gained places at their first choice of school this year. Many disappointed parents will now be considering an appeal others will be wondering how to negotiate new challenges. One father tweeted: “So our littlest has been given a place at primary school. It would have been a lot easier had it been the same primary school as her sister. Looking forward to working out how to be in two different places at the same time.”Some London boroughs claim demand for places is also down because of welfare changes and high property prices, which have forced some families to leave the capital. In other boroughs, however, demand remains high and success rates for securing places at preferred primaries are the lowest in the country.The school standards minister, Nick Gibb, said: “We’re investing £5.8bn to create even more good schools and good school places – building on the 825,000 we’ve created since 2010 – resulting in nine out of 10 pupils securing one of their top three choices of schools.”"},{"url":null,"title":"the way some pigs are reared is upsetting and wrong say shoppers","story":"Most people willing to swap to supermarkets trying to improve farming standards, survey findsShoppers around the world overwhelmingly support high animal welfare standards for pigs, and most would also be prepared to change their supermarket habits in response, an international survey on pork consumption has found.Seven out of 10 people questioned said they found the manner in which pigs are reared for slaughter on some factory farms “upsetting”, “wrong” or “shocking”, after being shown photographs of some pig-keeping conditions in the online poll. The survey highlighted practices such as sows kept in small cages, antibiotic use, as well as tail-docking, teeth-grinding and castration, sometimes without pain relief.Eight out of 10 shoppers surveyed in more than ten countries agreed that high welfare for pigs was important, and nearly nine of out of 10 in three key countries said they could be persuaded to shop at a supermarket committed to improving the lives of pigs. However, fewer than one in three shoppers in most countries polled said they actively looked for labels on pork products indicating the animals had been reared in high-welfare conditions, and the great majority of those surveyed globally cited price, quality and appearance as more important in choosing which pork products to eat.The survey was carried out on behalf of World Animal Protection, and involved interviews with nearly 10,000 consumers worldwide, including the UK, the US and China, all major consumers of pork products, by the polling company Voodoo. About 1,000 interviews were conducted in each country in the report.World Animal Protection, a campaigning organisation, called on major supermarkets to pledge higher pig welfare in sourcing their meat, and urged consumers to demand change from retailers. Steve McIvor, chief executive, said: “Supermarkets hold the power to create better lives for pigs. We are encouraging customers of leading supermarkets to let them know they expect higher welfare standards for pork products, with the guarantee that pigs are raised right.”The group wants pigs to be allowed to live in social groups in comfortable environments, with opportunities to express natural behaviour, and an end to practices such as those highlighted in the survey: sows in small cages, pigs kept in “dark, squalid warehouses and cramped, stressful conditions”, piglets having their teeth ground and tail docked without anaesthetic, and the overuse of antibiotics.Consumer concerns over poor conditions for many pigs was outlined in the UK recently in the BBC programme Countryfile, in which a farmer showed pigs being reared in cages, provoking furious responses on social media both from those shocked by what they saw and defenders of intensive farming for enabling cheaper meat.Changing buying habits among consumers may be a challenge, as most surveyed do not currently base their consumption on welfare considerations and many showed little awareness of key aspects of pig-rearing.Minimum standards such as the space in which sows are kept and basic restrictions on antibiotics are enforced in countries such as Europe but are not enough, according to campaigners, while the rearing of pigs in “mega-farms” in which they rarely have access to the outdoors is on the increase.We want to hear from people working in the farming and food production industry around the world as we begin a new investigative series.Share your views and experiences using our encrypted form here.

From July, for instance, the Co-op in the UK will source all of its own-brand fresh pork, bacon, sausage, gammon and ham from outdoor-bred pigs on RSPCA-assured farms.Jo Whitfield, the retail chief executive of Co-op, said: “The highest animal welfare standards should not just be the preserve of top-tier products and we want to ensure that the very best-quality British pork is available at everyday affordable prices.”On outdoor-bred farms, piglets and their mothers have access to the outdoors for about four to six weeks from birth. After that, they can be reared indoors. In outdoor-reared systems, the pigs have access to fields for about half their lives.Contact us with your stories and thoughts at animalsfarmed@theguardian.com"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57bd7191cda62c7ab723f13fbfa631496d9bfc97/0_0_1920_2880/master/1920.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1ae4ad9e6c2abac3cd5b6c38ccbc67ca 1440w","title":"jose mourinho manchester united paul pogba bournemouth fa cup semi final","story":"• ‘What is the criteria to choose a team?

This has nothing to do with age.“I have met players of 30 years old who were not consistent at all and I found boys of 18, 19, 20 who were real men, real pros.

You can do it if your team is not losing the ball, but our team was losing the ball so everything was complicated.

He believes elements of that display showed Spurs can compete but that his team must start next season strongly if they are to have a hope of becoming champions.“I want to congratulate Pep, the coaching staff and of course the players – they deserve the title,” he said. “In football, after a whole season, it is the most consistent side that has the capacity to win.“If we want to win and challenge for big things, we need to start from day one in pre-season. If you analyse how we started the last three seasons, they began after four, five or 10 games. That is a thing to improve. We are going to be focused on starting better.”One of the factors that has impeded Spurs’ starts in previous seasons has been recruitment, with the club often completing deals in the final weeks of the transfer window. This summer the transfer window will close as the season begins, but with a World Cup also in the offing Pochettino feels they will have to act earlier.“It’s not all about money in football, that is true. But it helps. As a coach you can have ideas about football but then you need the principal actors to deliver this idea. We are competing in a different way to Manchester City.

This was another personal ordeal for the man who has just lost his place as England’s first-choice goalkeeper. Southgate was here to witness it and, at this rate, there has to be a serious possibility that Hart will be cut adrift from the England squad that goes to Russia for this summer’s World Cup.What other conclusion can be drawn when the goalkeeping error that led to Peter Crouch, one of Stoke’s substitutes, opening the scoring can hardly be described as a one-off? Indeed, Hart did something very similar in the 3-0 defeat at home to Burnley last month, on the day he was recalled to the side after a long spell in the wilderness. It is becoming a recurring theme and West Ham’s fans were not in the mood to be sympathetic after his latest lapse. There were ironic, unforgiving cheers towards the end whenever Hart gathered the ball without making a mistake.At least Hart was spared the ignominy of his mistake being the game’s decisive moment and West Ham’s equaliser, courtesy of the fit-again Andy Carroll, helped David Moyes’s team edge another point further away from the relegation places. Stoke, on the other hand, remain in 19th position, having passed up a glorious opportunity to register their first away win since October. Paul Lambert’s side now have only four games to save themselves and still have to play Liverpool after they have hosted Europa League-chasing Burnley on Sunday.Lambert looked crestfallen afterwards but Stoke’s manager was stretching the truth when he said all the luck had gone against his team. On the contrary, there were three disallowed goals for West Ham in a chaotic second half for the referee, Michael Oliver, in his first game back since the now-infamous Champions League tie between Juventus and Real Madrid, Gianluigi Buffon’s red card and all the unpleasantness that has followed.Marko Arnautovic had strayed offside before directing in his 55th-minute header and the same player was flagged again when Edimilson Fernandes fired in a shot from 20 yards. This time, Arnautovic was standing directly in Jack Butland’s line of vision and, though Moyes seemed aggrieved at the time, he accepted afterwards it was a fine piece of officiating. West Ham’s manager was less impressed with the decision, in stoppage-time, to penalise Carroll for his challenge on Ryan Shawcross just before another substitute, Javier Hernández, fired in what would almost certainly have been a winner.It was a dramatic finale to a game that had taken a long time to ignite and, for Carroll, a personal triumph given that he had not played since 4 January and, at one point, was not expected to feature again this season. His goal was expertly taken: he guided in a controlled left-foot volley from Aaron Cresswell’s cross and shifted the mood just as the West Ham fans were preparing, undoubtedly, for another show of loud dissent at the final whistle. Carroll returned to full training only five days before this match and there was an irony that it was two of England’s forgotten men who came up with the goals on the night Southgate was in the crowd to keep tabs on the two goalkeepers.Moyes made a point afterwards of not being too hard on Hart, restricting himself to saying it was a “surprise” to see the former England No\u0026nbsp1 fumbling Xherdan Shaqiri’s shot into Crouch’s path. Moyes also made the point, legitimately, that Hart had made some fine saves in their previous game at Chelsea. Yet this felt like a manager trying not to damage Hart’s confidence any further. The truth, however it is dressed up, was that it was a wretched error from an increasingly accident-prone goalkeeper.For Stoke, the disappointment was their inability to hold on once they had put themselves in a winning position. The game lived down to expectations during the opening 45 minutes – two ordinary sides huffing and puffing without any real wit or creativity – and it was easy to see why Stoke were averaging under a goal per game this season. Stoke have not managed two goals in a league fixture since January. They have the worst goal difference in the league and it is a problem that needs to be fixed if there is to be a dramatic feat of escapology in the next few weeks.Lambert argued afterwards that if Stoke had played this well throughout the season Mark Hughes would still be their manager and the team would not be in the bottom three. There was a fair amount of top-spin on that assessment but in one respect it was an improvement – Stoke had lost their previous seven fixtures in London, conceding 26 goals in the process. Ultimately, though, it needed a goalkeeping mistake for them to take the lead and that, for Hart, made this a night that could have serious ramifications for his hopes of going to the World Cup."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81135c50613b29f8a104e475e350618029aa9d98/0_0_1280_1024/master/1280.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fdbb19d66bb537952dea3c52bca1aea 700w","title":"anna jones broad bean recipes","story":"Whether tranformed into a herby pesto or a rich stew, broad beans bring a unique brightness to a springtime tableThe 100 denier tights and woolly jumpers have been moved to my top shelf, and the spring vegetables are here at last.

Broad beans are a labour of love in my kitchen – I love the neat green beans, but not the bitterness of their opaque cases – so it’s a double podding affair.

It’s joyous, uplifting – and about as subtle as a sledgehammerVaginas don’t get the best press. They are either being grabbed by future US presidents, trolled on social media, en route to a labiaplasty, mistrusted for their monthly capacity to shed blood or weaponised in the endless debates over gender-neutral toilets. So when Janelle Monáe, a black, queer, working-class star, shows up in her latest music video sporting a giant pair of juicy vagina pants, it’s joyous and uplifting.The video of Pynk, Monáe’s new single, directed by Emma Westernberg and featuring the equally bonkers Grimes, is a queer, arch and deliciously sexy ode to the vagina. Those pants are essentially chaps reconfigured as hot-pink labia – and it doesn’t get gayer than that. In the video, Monáe and her gang of women romp around the desert, drive pink convertibles and wear knickers bearing slogans such as “I grab back” on them. We really need to come up with a female equivalent of “phallic” to do all this justice. Vulvic?So this is what pussy power reclaimed by black women in the 21st century looks like: fun and inclusive. The whole thing is, happily, about as subtle as a sledgehammer at one point Monáe’s rumoured girlfriend, the actor Tessa Thompson, pops her head out from between her billowing vagina legs with a saucy grin. And there are lots of, erm, vulvic shots of dripping ice lollies and manicured fingers pushing through doughnut holes. But the point is serious. Not all the women are wearing vagina pants because, well, not all women have vaginas. Or as Monáe put it on Twitter, “No matter if you have a vagina or not.” Thompson’s response to being thanked for “giving black girls their own Vagina Monologues” was: “to all the black girls that need a monologue that don’t have Vaginas, I’m listening”. Here’s the thing: vaginas can be enjoyed and celebrated by anyone, but everyone should respect them.It wasn’t that long ago – when I was growing up, in fact – that Whitney Houston’s skin was allegedly being lightened by her label in publicity shots and black artists were routinely expected to “cross over”. To be more white, in other words, if they wanted success. Monáe’s video, which has caused quite a ruckus online, is an unashamed celebration of black female sexuality. Frankly, whether you have a vagina or not, this is progress worth celebrating."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e27d48c78a8b83f24f10fcfecfb06c3921bd5641/492_589_2939_1764/master/2939.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=826ef07224ed099c4e2f58b4ef2e2a2c 1240w","title":"kendrick lamar has brought pop to pulitzer","story":"By becoming the first non-classical or jazz winner of the Pulitzer prize for music, the rapper has created US history – appropriate, given his unwavering gaze at American lifePerhaps the most obvious question provoked by the news that Kendrick Lamar has been awarded the Pulitzer prize for music for his 2017 album Damn is not “why?” but rather “what took you so long?”It has been 60 years since the birth of modern pop music, a period of time during which said modern pop music has established itself, in its multifarious configurations, as being an unquestionably important art form. Clearly no one expected an august institution like the Pulitzer to start handing out gongs to the Backstreet Boys or Motley Crue, but the notion that not a single work by any American pop artist over the last seven decades has been thought worthy is a pretty mind-boggling one. They gave an “additional citation” to Bob Dylan in 2008, and to Hank Williams in 2010 – a mere 57 years after the latter’s death – but the actual prize itself has remained almost exclusively the domain of classical music. In its entire history, there has only been one jazz winner, Ornette Coleman, who had to wait until 2006 to be considered worthwhile. Then again, the Pulitzer has a longstanding reputation for being quite extraordinarily stuffy. The most celebrated example of its snobbery may have come in 1965, when the jury decided that no current music was worthy of an award, and attempted instead to give a special citation to Duke Ellington, in recognition of the groundbreaking body of work he had amassed over the preceding 50 years. Not, one would have imagined, a particularly controversial decision: by 1965, Ellington was rightly regarded as a straight-up, no-further-questions genius who had elevated jazz to an orchestral art form worthy of comparison with more “respectable” musical genres decades before. But the Pulitzer board refused to give out the award – indeed, it wasn’t until 1996 that an African American, George Walker, won the prize itself. In 2004, then Pulitzer administrator Sig Gissler said they would be “broadening the prize a bit” so that it could be awarded to music that did not come from the European classical tradition: it no longer became obligatory for entrants to submit a score. Even so, there was no mention of pop music in their idea of what constituted “distinguished American musical compositions”. The official announcement of its new policy involved everything but: “The contemporary classical symphony to jazz, opera, choral, musical theatre, movie scores and other forms of musical excellence.”This clearly makes Kendrick Lamar’s achievement all the more striking in its break with the prize’s dusty traditions: this year’s award hasn’t gone to some rarefied piece of electronica with classical pretensions, but a vastly successful double platinum-selling hip-hop album by an artist who packs out arena venues. Still, if you were going to pick a contemporary pop artist to storm the Pulitzer’s barricades, Lamar is an obvious choice.They’ve chosen someone both at the top of his game and at the forefront of a post-Ferguson renaissance in righteously angry, politically engaged black music that genuinely bears comparison to soul music’s revered early 70s golden era. Furthermore, he’s proved that it’s possible to make a huge mainstream impact with music that never panders to the lowest common denominator, and never underestimates its audience’s intelligence. It is frequently complex, knotty, contradictory, claustrophobic and disjointed it regularly nods towards black music’s history – referencing everything from the lusciously soft soul of the Chi-Lites to Outkast’s psychedelic take on rap – but never feels comfortingly familiar. Perhaps the commercial success of such ostensibly uncommercial material is down to the fact Lamar makes music that perfectly reflects its era. He may have claimed that Damn represented a step back from the sociopolitical fury of its predecessor To Pimp a Butterfly, an album that ended up being lauded by the outgoing president of the United States – it even contained a backwards message complaining of “the pain in my heart carrying the burden for the struggle” – but Damn never shies away from addressing serious issues: black empowerment, protest, the Trump presidency, violence, inflammatory rightwing punditry. Anxious, scattered and disquieting, the musical backing sounds like living through 2017 frequently felt. You could argue long into the night about whether or not the approval of an institution like the Pulitzer prize is antithetical to the messages contained within Damn, but an award that’s frequently courted accusations of rarefied, snooty irrelevance could hardly have picked a more relevant and impactful album to give its approval to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5809413639e2a035028130105e888cfb6985d6ea/349_256_3322_1993/master/3322.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f6e6c0174358b474329dddc7e5101314 1240w","title":"lady macbeth of mtsensk review searing and unsparing shostakovich","story":"Royal Opera House, LondonEva-Maria Westbroek’s performance in this vivid revival keeps you rooting for her to the very endIt’s one of the great if-onlys of opera: if Stalin hadn’t found Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk so objectionable when he saw it in 1936, we might now have a trilogy of Shostakovich operas about gutsy Russian women – which is what the composer had planned. As it is, we have only the one – and Richard Jones’s 2004 production, returning to the Royal Opera House for the first time in 12 years, has been away far too long.Revived by director Elaine Kidd, it is blackly funny, unsparing, sometimes shocking and often tasteless, but always on point.

Suddenly and violently, out go the two men of the house in come deafeningly loud wallpaper and a blingy chandelier. Yet what’s more striking is how acutely observed all the relationships are within the high yet claustrophobic walls of John Macfarlane’s multi-roomed set – walls that finally find a grim echo in the towering sides of the pantechnicons in the final scene, transporting prisoners as if they’re livestock. The score sounds searing. Antonio Pappano’s conducting again weaves together the music’s satire – the on-stage brass bands, the tumescent trombones – with its moonlit beauty, and never lets the tension slacken. John Tomlinson also returns to the work, leering and bellowing brilliantly as father-in-law Boris, with John Daszak tenderly wimpish as his son.

Piety can be a hard-won virtue and sometimes a prime minister has to fake it to make it. Especially when she’s not entirely certain she’s done the right thing.May began more in sorrow than anger. She hadn’t wanted to get involved but the Syrian regime’s use of chemical weapons on its own people had left her no option. So far so good. It was when she got on to the reasons why she hadn’t recalled parliament to sanction her military intervention that she struggled to maintain good faith.Think of it this way, she said. It was only a teeny-weeny airstrike. One that had been carefully calibrated as a token gesture to make everyone feel as if Britain was doing the right thing, while guaranteeing that the Russians did nothing beastly to us in return. So under the circumstances, she had decided not to disturb MPs while they were on their hols. She knew how exhausted they all were and she didn’t want to bother their pretty little heads about something so trivial. And, besides, there was always a chance they might make her look stupid by voting against her.Jeremy Corbyn remained unconvinced. He started by pointing out you can get lawyers to say almost anything – he had found one who agreed with him that the airstrikes were legally questionable – and wondered why the prime minister was limiting her humanitarian efforts to Syria when there were so many other flashpoints around the world equally deserving of her attention.The Labour leader was heckled loudly by the Tories throughout, while the opposition benches sat glumly in silence. The problem wasn’t so much what Corbyn was saying as what he wasn’t. Most Labour MPs believe there is nothing that could persuade their leader to take military action of any kind. Especially when the Russians are involved.Thereafter the Tories queued up to praise May. Ken Clarke declared she had behaved like a “real prime minister” by taking decisive action without consulting parliament only to then say it would have been better if she had first consulted parliament. No one picked him up on this bizarre contradiction, but then it wasn’t that kind of day.Rather it was a day for being tough, sounding tough and hanging tough. On these occasions there is no room for nuance. The moral high ground is to be found in acting first and thinking later. Anyone who dared suggest the prime minister had put a foot wrong was a traitor. Tories Andrew Percy and Steve Double took this to extremes. They sobbed their gratitude to Theresa for saving them the hassle of making decisions they were too stupid to make for themselves.Labour was more ided. Hilary Benn and Yvette Cooper made it clear that while they backed the prime minister’s actions in principle, she would have been better advised to have consulted parliament. Part of living in a democracy was trusting its elected representatives to make the right decisions. And accepting the possibility that – just as the executive might occasionally get it wrong – so might MPs.Others were less guarded. Chris Leslie openly attacked Corbyn by saying that inaction had its own consequences and those that advocated doing nothing should be held to account. Ben Bradshaw went further, demanding the prime minister do some more bombing if the Syrians relapsed on chemical weapons and though he’d rather she consulted parliament first he would find it in his heart to forgive her if she didn’t. Bomb. Bomb, bombety, bomb.Among all this self-righteousness and self-congratulation, the fate of the Syrian people and what successful military action might look like rather got overlooked. Only Stella Creasy raised the possibility of taking more refugees, an idea instantly dismissed by the prime minister on the grounds that the Syrians would hate the British weather and were much happier where they were. No one really demurred. But then the three-hour statement had never really been about Syria. It had been about making parliament feel better about itself. Big. Important. Caring. And in that it had been time well spent."},{"url":null,"title":"syria strikes may tells mps uk could not have waited for un approval","story":"Delay would effectively give Russia a veto on foreign policy says PM, as Corbyn calls action ‘legally questionable’Theresa May has warned that waiting for the United Nations to authorise military action in future would effectively give Russia a veto on British foreign policy as she defended her decision to join international air and missile strikes against the Syrian regime.The prime minister accused Moscow of preventing inspectors from reaching the site of the chemical weapons attack on Douma and suggested that Bashar al-Assad’s forces, backed by the Russians, were attempting to destroy evidence of the attack.She faced down her critics in a heated debate in the Commons in the wake of the atrocity, which she described as “a stain on our humanity”, insisting the UK had needed to act rapidly to prevent further attacks. May faced widespread recrimination for launching strikes before consulting parliament – although many of those MPs said they would have given her their support – but she suggested the “security” of the operation could have been compromised.“I am absolutely clear that it is parliament’s responsibility to hold me to account for such decisions – and parliament will do so,” she told MPs. “But it is my responsibility as prime minister to make these decisions. And I will make them.“This was a limited, targeted strike on a legal basis that has been used before. And it was a decision that required the evaluation of intelligence and information, much of which was of a nature that could not be shared with parliament.”However, Jeremy Corbyn said the strikes were “legally questionable” and that parliament should have been given the chance to approve the action, which he suggested was at “the whims” of the US president, Donald Trump.The Labour leader called for a renewed diplomatic effort by the UK government and its allies to bring peace to the region - although the prime minister attacked his suggestion that diplomatic efforts had not been exhausted.May warned: “The leader of the opposition has said that he can ‘only countenance involvement in Syria if there is UN authority behind it’. The house should be clear that would mean a Russian veto on our foreign policy.”May, who spent more than three hours at the dispatch box, denied that Britain had joined the US-led airstrikes at the request of Trump, insisting it was the “legally and moral right” thing to do in response to the onslaught which killed up to 75 people.She told the Commons: “Let me be absolutely clear: we have acted because it is in our national interest to do so. It is in our national interest to prevent the further use of chemical weapons in Syria – and to uphold and defend the global consensus that these weapons should not be used.“We have not done this because President Trump asked us to do so. We have done it because we believed it was the right thing to do. And we are not alone.”The prime minister pledged there would be a further diplomatic push to bring the Assad regime back to the negotiating table as well as a “full range” of political and economic levers, to strengthen the ban on the use of chemical weapons.May denied Corbyn’s claims in a Guardian article that the attacks had just demolished empty buildings in Syria. She said the targets included a scientific research centre developing chemical weapons, a chemical weapons bunker and command post and a missile base, assessed to be a location of sarin gas.“Very careful scientific analysis was used to determine where best to target these missiles to maximise the destruction of stockpiled chemicals and to minimise any risk to the surrounding area,” she said.The statement marked a new low point in diplomatic relations with Russia, already poor in the wake of the Salisbury attack, with the Kremlin reacting furiously to claims that it was hindering the Douma investigation.It comes after Ken Ward, the US ambassador to the Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons, expressed concerns that the Russians had tampered with the attack site with the aim of thwarting the weapons inspectors’ fact-finding mission.May told MPs: “The problem is they are being stopped from their investigation. The regime and the Russians are preventing them from doing that. Moreover, the regime has reportedly been attempting to conceal the evidence by searching evacuees from Douma to ensure they are not taking out of the region samples that could be tested elsewhere.”She cited intelligence which showed that a “wider operation” to conceal the facts of the attack was under way, supported by the Russians. Moscow strongly denied interfering with the work of inspectors, suggesting the international missile strikes in response had made it difficult for the OPCW to travel to the scene.Corbyn again suggested that it was not yet confirmed the Assad regime had launched the attack and OPCW inspectors should be allowed to do their work. “While suspicion, rightly, points to the Assad government, chemical weapons have been used by other groups in the conflict,” he said.May, however, pointed out that the 2013 agreement in which the regime had committed to dismantle its chemical weapons programme had not worked. “It did not stop the Syrian regime from carrying out the most abhorrent atrocities using these weapons,” she said.As several hundred Stop the War activists protested outside, Corbyn said there was a need for a war powers law to force the government to seek the approval of parliament before launching military action in future. “There is no more serious issue than the life and death matters of military action,” he said. “It is right that parliament has the right to support or stop the government from taking planned military action.”He was backed by other opposition parties over his demands for a future parliamentary debate on military action. Corbyn has been granted a debate on Tuesday that will allow MPs to consider the rights of parliament to debate and approve military action by British forces overseas.The SNP’s Ian Blackford said the timetable meant a vote had been “perfectly possible” while Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said he regretted May had not sought MPs’ approval.After the PM’s Commons statement, there was a further lengthy debate on the Syria action. It ended in a wholly symbolic vote called by the SNP on the motion that the house “has considered the current situation in Syria and the UK government approach”, which the government won 314 votes to 36.

There are also “concerns about the extent to which inaccurate polls might be shaping the ‘narrative’ during election campaigns, and therefore how they might be affecting the democratic process”.As a result, the Lords recommend expanding the role of the British Polling Council, the self-regulatory body of the public polling industry, to go beyond simply ensuring transparency in how pollsters operate. In the future, the report says, the BPC should “work with the Electoral Commission, the Market Research Society and media regulators such as Ipso and Impress to ensure that the best methodologies are used, that sources of poll funding are declared, that polls are better reported and that polling performance is openly reviewed after each general election”.Lord Lipsey, the chairman of the committee, said: “The polling industry needs to get its house in order. Otherwise the case for banning polling in the run-up to elections – one we for now reject – will become stronger. “We heard compelling evidence that polls influence the narrative around elections and thus go to the root of our democratic debate. This makes it vital they are conducted properly and held to the highest standards of accuracy.”The committee also examined the role of social media during elections. It backed calls to require disclosure on online campaign material, requiring an imprint – similar to printed pamphlets – stating who has published it. “This will be crucial in helping to ensure that public confidence is maintained in the electoral system,” the report says. It notes, however, “that this will do little to address the challenges posed by international actors who try to operate below the radar”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c11a438df90db330832f2c35c0617a7e9fd71a71/0_549_8348_5009/master/8348.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=310650b99a3816ddf7f1ff9d7aa4357f 1240w","title":"janet mock id never seen a young trans woman who was thriving in the world i was looking for that","story":"The 35-year-old activist and bestselling author tells her remarkable story – and explains why she’s working on a new drama about trans women of colour that will be nothing like TransparentJanet Mock is talking so fast I can’t keep up. One moment we are in Hawaii and she is living, desperately uncomfortably, as a little boy called Charles. The next she is 10 years old and has created the alter ego Keisha to enable her to talk to boys on the phone. Then she is living happily as a transgender girl, a star pupil and captain of the school volleyball team. Now she is 16, doing sex work and stripping at a local club to earn enough money to pay for her operation – or bottom surgery, as she calls it.It is an astonishing story – and we have barely started. There is her move to New York at 21, a master’s in journalism, two bestselling memoirs, a groundbreaking drama she co-scripted and two marriages – and, along the way, she has become the world’s most prominent trans activist. Phew!Mock used to call herself the great pretender. When she left Hawaii to go to New York, she decided to keep her past to herself. “I had to pretend, or withhold parts of myself. Specifically my trans-ness. I had to pretend I was any other 21-year-old. Most of them had not transitioned or had to work the streets or in a strip club, and most of them were not already married. So much had happened by the time I was 21 that I just wanted to be normal and regular, whatever I thought that was.” She finally takes a breath. “Right?”Blimey, I say, do you always speak so quickly? She laughs and apologises. “Oh, I’m so sorry. I’ll slow down. Yes, I do talk fast when I’m excited. And I’m excited because this is a new space in my career.”Her sentences are regularly punctuated with the word “space”, perhaps not surprisingly for somebody who has had to fight so hard to claim hers.Mock is fastidiously polite. At times, she sounds like an old-fashioned southern belle dreamed up by Tennessee Williams. In fact, she grew up impoverished in Honolulu. Her father, Charlie, is African-American and was a drug addict (she had no idea and was devastated to discover when she was young that neighbours knew him as “Charlie the crackhead”). Her mother, Elizabeth, is Hawaiian. The family was broken and dysfunctional, but loving in its own chaotic way. As a seven-year-old, Mock went to live with her father in Oakwood, California. Her father called young Charles a sissy. Mock says she was called all sorts when she was growing up – freak, faggot, tranny, the N-word.She did not see her mother for five years until, at the age of 12, she returned to Honolulu, where she flourished. Her mother never discouraged her from becoming Janet (a name she chose after a friend told her she looked like Janet Jackson). “There were bigger issues in our family. My mom didn’t have the luxury of time and resources to micromanage any of her children’s lives.” It was a blessing, she says – wealthier parents might have paid for therapy to “right” her.Mock was helped by the fact that gender is relatively fluid in Hawaii. The word “māhū” denotes a third gender. It is a pejorative for gay men and drag queens, but it can also have a sense of the sacred attached to it.“My mom, growing up in Hawaii, saw trans people existing every day. She didn’t know they were trans. She was just like: ‘Oh, that’s such-and-such who lives on the street.’ It was the norm to have people who were not male or female people who may be in the middle somewhere.”Mock, now 35, splits her time between Los Angeles and New York. We meet for lunch at a stately hotel in West Hollywood. Mock is gorgeous – tall, curvy, with brown, almond-shaped eyes, a perfect smile and cheek-bones so high you could hoist a flag on them. Despite her sing-song voice, she is fierce and forensic in her arguments.She orders a super-strong cold brew (coffee brewed for hours in cold water) and a steak dish and we return to her past. At 15, she began hormone treatment without telling her mother. Soon after, she started selling sex and stripping to pay for her $7,000 (£5,700) surgery. The only thing she regrets, she says, is doing a\u0026nbspporn shoot to earn the final $1,500. “The sex work was private, but this was on record for the rest of my life.” In her first memoir, Redefining Realness, she wrote that she was “immortalising the one part of my\u0026nbspbody that brought me so much\u0026nbspanguish”.I ask when she started thinking of herself as Janet and she says it is a false premise she always thought of herself as a girl who was cursed by biology. She knew she wanted sex-reassignment surgery, but that was not going to determine her gender. “I believed I was, and knew myself as, a young woman, even when I had a penis. It wasn’t as if I needed the surgery to confirm that for me.”Was there any point at which she felt she could be complete without surgery? “I did not, but that’s just my experience. I know a lot of people who do, and that’s where the burden of representation comes in. I’m sitting here telling my specific story, but though I wasn’t comfortable with that, there are thousands of people who are, or thousands who don’t have access to the funds to have surgery.”Mock often talks about the burden of representation. She might be regarded as a spokeswoman for trans women, but she does not pretend her experience is representative. For one thing, she was fortunate enough to be able to choose whether to disclose she was trans. Many trans women do not have that privilege – their appearance gives them away.She has said that without her smile and her MA in journalism, nobody would have listened to her. “The ‘pretty privilege’ can give you access to spaces, just like your able body gives you access. But it makes impossible beauty standards for many other trans girls who are struggling with that right now.”She argues that trans women obsess too much about being able to “pass”, but she knows it is easy for her to say. She, too, obsessed about that in the past – ironically, one of the things she found validating was one of the things she most despised: men objectifying her.She drains her cool brew, and our main course arrives – steak, brown rice, vegetables. “Oh, my God! This looks really good.” She examines one of the vegetables curiously, and calls over Wayne, the waiter.“Wayne, is this like a sweet potato?”She has a way of engaging with people and dismissing them with self-assured charm.Mock says so much has changed in the trans world since she was young. She hopes few people today need to go to the lengths she did to fund surgery. Would she swap her story for a more sober version? “No. I would have my story,” she says instantly. Is there any time she would have swapped it ? “When I was living it yeah. Che-che-che-che!” She laughs loudly and uninhibitedly, as if clearing her throat. “I wanted a genie to pop up and grant me three wishes – to get all this over with, to have a financial safety net and to be comfortable. But I wouldn’t take anything from my experience because it built my resolve my core.\u0026nbspI fought for every single thing I\u0026nbsphave now.”Actually, Mock says, there was a great support network among sex workers. “The girls felt safe there. We took care of each other. You showed up, you knew who was there and how long she’s gone. We weren’t doing it in isolation. Now sex work had gone online so you’re by yourself all the time.”When she left Hawaii for New York, three years after surgery, Mock chose not to reveal that she was trans. She embarked on a new life experience, described in her second memoir Surpassing Certainty. “If I had disclosed, it would have made people judge me, made them not want to be with me, made me an object, a freak show. I would have been the trans girl in the room. To reveal to a class of strangers the heaviness of my past was just too much. It’s inconvenient. The inconvenient truth! And I didn’t want to be inconvenienced. It would get in the way. I just wanted to go to school to get a job, and move on.”She felt both freed and imprisoned. “The secrecy was hard to cope with,” she says. Mock also became aware of her blackness in a way she had never been before. In Hawaii, she was primarily identified as trans and “everybody was at least brown or tinted in some way”. At New York University, she was one of a handful of black students. “So, in Zora Neale Hurston’s words, I was thrust against a white backdrop.” She pauses. “I love Zora. She is THE\u0026nbspQueen!”Her progress in the publishing world was seamless. Before long, she was an editor and writer at People magazine. But she became bored. She realised she had a better story to tell than the celebrities she was interviewing. And she wanted to own that story. In 2009, she met photographer Aaron Tredwell, who was to become her second husband. “I started telling the people in my life and I was like: ‘Oh, this story is interesting because I’ve never seen it before. This is pre-Orange Is the New Black, pre-Caitlyn Jenner.’ And I was like: ‘I think I should tell my story.’ I’d never seen a young trans woman who was living and thriving in the world, and I was looking for that.”Throughout the Obama years, she says, transgender rights improved considerably in the US, but now Donald Trump is determined to reverse that progress. Last July, he attempted to introduce a blanket ban on transgender people joining the military.“There is a lot of rowing back on protections that the Obama administration put through: the guidelines for trans children in schools trans-specific affordable healthcare the military ban.” She says it is part of a wider general clampdown on rights for minorities.Trans women have been questioned from more than one side of the political spectrum. What does Mock make of the continuing opposition from some feminists?“I think it is rooted in the same thing they say they’re fighting against – biological essentialism. So, it’s saying that if you don’t have these specific biological experiences as a woman you cannot be a woman, you cannot be in our struggle. I would argue that for women to say the only identifying factor of a woman is a pussy is misogynistic. If we’re saying that to be a feminist is to eliminate barriers and alleviate marginalisation based on gender, then how could you not want to include the persecuted trans women\u0026nbspor non-binary folk so you have more comrades to fight against gendered oppression?”She looks me in the face. “My grandmother gets who I am, so when you ask me about people who don’t understand, or people who are on their bully pulpits saying you shouldn’t accept people, I’m like: “What’s happened to you that, of all the things you can talk about, of all the injustices in the world, the one thing you want to concentrate on is trans people living their truth? How is that harming you and your identity? How I identify has nothing to do with you, and how you identify has nothing to do with me. Right? So live your life and let me live mine.”She chews on her steak, decisively. I hope that is not directed at me, I say, cowering. She stops in her tracks and bursts out laughing. “Che-che-che-che. Nonononoo.”Mock has spent much of the past year as part of the writingproducing team on Pose, the new trans drama devised by Glee creator Ryan Murphy. She is also directing one episode. I ask her what she thinks of Transparent, the US comedy-drama about a middle-aged father who becomes a trans woman.“I don’t watch it, so I don’t know,” she says.But it is one of the few dramas featuring trans characters, I insist.“It was never really for me. Just because there’s a trans character doesn’t mean it’s a show I would watch.”But I persist. Surely, if you are making a drama about trans people, you would want to watch what has gone before. “You’re really stuck on\u0026nbspthis Transparent thing, which is interesting to me,” Mock says, smiling. But, now, it is a hollow smile.She quietly but firmly puts me in my place. “It’s about somebody way older than me, who was a professor. Transparent is about a white, middle-class, liberal family, so there\u0026nbspare no intersections that interest me.”What makes her so excited about Pose is that it is about the very people she knows and cares about. “Our show is centring on trans women of colour in a way they’ve not been centred on ever. What’s so radical to me is that, unlike Transparent, where there is one main character who is trans and played by a man, we have five main characters who are trans played by trans women. That five black and brown trans women will be the centre of a show on a network drama in primetime is huge. And they’re going to be on billboards. It’s\u0026nbspamazing this is going to exist in the world.”I tell Mock I have one final question, from a trans friend of my elder daughter. She asked: “How can a nice trans girl like me find the perfect husband like Aaron,” I say.Mock roars with delight. “That is so sweet! What is her name?” Charlie, I say.“To be in a relationship is an incredibly vulnerable space to be in, so you have to be willing to be open, to not be afraid of that intense gaze on you. Aaron was intense he really wanted to know me. And I chose to show up as myself, and I chose to be vulnerable and tell him my story, and that has been the foundation of our relationship. We’re going to challenge one another by telling the truth to one another, then be strong enough to stick around when that truth is not exactly what we thought we were going to hear. I hope that helps Charlie.”I’m sure it will, I tell her, and\u0026nbspexplain that Charlie is also an\u0026nbspactivist.“What is her second name?” Charlie Craggs, I say.“Oh, I know that name,” she whoops. “I’m not kidding. I follow her on Twitter.” Within seconds, she is searching her Twitter account. “Craggs? Cr … Cra … See, I told you,” she shouts, triumphantly.Two cold brews down, and having just discovered Charlie, she is talking faster than ever. “I love that! It’s a small world. Shows how deeply connected we are! Che-che-che-che.”This is who she has written her books for, she says – the next generation. Mock says she has done her bit: she can now go off and write screenplays and be a boring old binary trans woman. It is up to people like Charlie to take up the cudgels. “There are trans girls who are still navigating these spaces and wanting to learn and grow and they need something fun to look at when they see themselves. They don’t just need to know the tragedy and trauma of being trans. They also need to know how to better be, how to better live, how to better dream.”Surpassing Certainty, Mock’s memoir will be published worldwide on 1 May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bc02900b1907fcbf61529ccd20eb0562d42af86/1050_116_1288_773/master/1288.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c6bd69b46164f4ed104bd27e5d5228e5 1240w","title":"ben stokes ipl t20 england cricket joe root captain","story":"It’s 6pm at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore. A drowsy sun has already slunk below the stands, kites glide overhead and after three hours of intense training in the heat, where he has batted twice, thundered in with the ball for the first time in weeks and stayed late to work on his flying boundary catches, Ben Stokes strolls over for a chat.There is of course one almighty elephant in the ground. We both briefly acknowledge this but it remains just that. This is his first in-depth interview since the incident in Bristol on 25\u0026nbspSeptember last year but regarding events that night Stokes must wait to have his say in court this summer after he and two other men pleaded not guilty to affray. For now it is only cricket, both England and Indian Premier League, that can be on the agenda in the Garden City.The Indian Premier League first, where the 26-year-old is in his second season and at his second side, Rajasthan Royals. Eoin Morgan, one of his two international captains, has recently credited the all-rounder’s MVP-winning stint with the runners-up Rising Pune Supergiant last year for “breaking down barriers” and causing the English invasion that has a record 12\u0026nbspplayers spread across six of the eight franchises.Stokes appreciates their presence in Twenty20’s great tamasha, rather than with their counties, is not to everyone’s taste back home. The subject of his £1.7m deal with Pune last year – a record for an overseas player – and new price tag at just a shade under, is one at which he squirms. “Last year there was so much said about me and the money. I just shy away from it. I don’t want to come across as arrogant. I don’t know how to answer it. It’s just weird,” he says.Stokes is clearly enjoying his time with the Royals. The inaugural IPL winners in 2008, they are now trying to rebuild public trust in their first season back as the result of a two-year ban for the spot-fixing scandal that cost three players their careers. He has struck up a particular rapport with Shane Warne, the team’s mentor, while Jos Buttler is a familiar face in the ranks. But as is the case with England, all team‑mates tend to gravitate towards him.His only off-field struggle in India has come from some of the commercial demands that pack out the schedule on non-match days. “They ask you to do things that are so far out of your comfort zone – it’s just not me,” he says, perhaps in reference to some lively Bollywood-style dancing of his that can be witnessed during the IPL’s numerous TV ad breaks.The feet are moving better on the field even if the returns do not yet jump off the page. His third match against Royal Challengers Bangalore – a high-scoring 19-run win on the day after the interview – is the most impactful yet, with a 21-ball 27 from No\u0026nbsp4, his first wicket of the campaign and a leaping boundary catch to remove Brendon McCullum that kickstarted the RCB struggle in their pursuit of 218.While the latter was a classic case of Stokes making the ridiculous look sublimely simple – his extra training 24 hours earlier leapt to mind as he sprung high – it is likely the bowling will have given Stokes most satisfaction, purely for the fact he was charging in at full tilt for the first time in a long time.A pre-Christmas spell in New Zealand with Canterbury notwithstanding, the general lack of action leading into his return for England in February had affected his body. Bowling in the one-day series saw wickets follow but he found his legs seized up after spells. Then, just before the Tests that followed, some historical stress fractures in his lower back suddenly began to cause him grief and injections were required.Just 10 laboured overs were sent down in the two Tests that followed the jabs but Stokes says he is feeling himself again to prevent a recurrence he is remodelling his bowling action. The late step into the crease that pointed him to fine leg and left him needing to twist in order to straighten up is being eased out. He is happy with the results but the true test is in the middle.The return to the England camp – he has been restored to the side until the end of proceedings – was probably as smooth as he and his employers could have hoped. Stokes says the squad’s response felt no different to before from his perspective – “it’s not like we hadn’t stayed in touch” – but admits watching his Test colleagues among them go down 4-0 in Australia was tough. “I lived every moment of the Ashes. I’m sure it was nowhere near the emotions of the guys out there but I was just as gutted.”Readjustment batting-wise took little time either, with one low-key score of 12 in the first one-dayer at Hamilton – “I was anxious. I was guilty of thinking too far ahead and trying to make an impression. It was like I was at the start of my career,” – before a less flustered unbeaten 63 steered Morgan’s side to a series‑levelling win at Mount\u0026nbspMaunganui.“I was really emotional after getting man of the match in that second game back. It was such a relief to perform and be there at the end. I had five minutes to myself after getting back to the dressing room, sat in my bubble and taking it all in. The lads appreciated that and gave me space. It was a great feeling.”“It’s all about what I’m going to do in the future. I just want to get us back to playing the way we want to play. We were so close to being one of the best teams in the world. We’ve slacked off in the past two years but knowing how close we were gives you that desire to get back there.”That slacking off, as he puts it, bottomed out with the 58 all out in Auckland – “It was like the pins in a bowling alley falling down in slow motion” – from which a 1-0 series defeat followed. From being one Test win away from holding all nine bilateral Test trophies in 2016, only for Pakistan to win at the Oval and square the series, England have five in the cabinet to match their world ranking of fifth.Root, Bayliss and the as-yet reformed selection panel have a job on their hands. The former is battling to turn half-centuries into three figures, too – his last nine have gone unconverted – and it is a topic Stokes has been discussing with one of his new friends in India.“But the thing about Joe is he doesn’t bat for himself. If he thinks it is time to take a team down, he will go for it. That’s how he wants us to play as a team and as captain, he feels he has to set the standard. People can have a go at him but the bigger picture, that’s what he is trying to build. When it clicks – and that is coming – those scores will become 150s and 200s. Hopefully when people read what I have said here they will understand a\u0026nbspbit\u0026nbspmore.”Doubtless much of the heat from the end of England’s sorry Test travails this winter was drawn by Australia’s ball-tampering scandal and before Stokes heads up to the dressing room at the Chinnaswamy, before his new team’s departure from the ground, his views on the topic are sought.“I’m keeping my mouth shut. Certain people said some things and it then comes back to get you\u0026nbsp…” he says, before stopping himself from elaborating on who and what he means. Given the aforementioned elephant, it is probably for the best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5974e54e22510bc0c5db1aaed8016c0dbbcc0205/218_225_4659_2796/master/4659.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7ce3618633b1cdc369384e7207c4141d 1240w","title":"gold coast commonwealth games finale birmingham 2022","story":"The organisers of Birmingham 2022, possibly daunted by following an event so well received on the ground, may have felt some relief as the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games ended on a bum note.Furious spectators and even the host broadcaster condemned a closing ceremony that barely paid a passing mention to the athletes. Usain Bolt, paid to be here by a telecommunications company and still the biggest draw even eight months into retirement, was on the DJ decks and a Kylie Minogue impersonator featured.But the athletes had already been seated before the show began, an outrage which reached the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk. “I’m just as disappointed as anyone else,” she said. “We wanted to stand there and celebrate our athletes and it didn’t happen. Whoever was responsible for making that decision should hang their head in shame.”A mea culpa followed from the Commonwealth Games chairman, Peter Beattie. “We wanted to get the athletes in early but we made a serious error of judgment by not having them in the broadcast,” he said. “It was driven by concerns about the welfare of athletes but they should have been involved. There were too many speeches, I shouldn’t have spoken because it bored the athletes silly.”A potentially more serious oversight unfolded on the marathon course when the Scottish runner Callum Hawkins collapsed with heat exhaustion and was left on the road for several minutes without medical attention as spectators snapped selfies. He was released from hospital on Monday.These were rare errors from an organising committee which delivered 11 days of slick operations, mostly full stadiums and a notable absence of traffic jams, helped by the exodus of locals scared off before the Games began by regular warnings of impending chaos.Where Birmingham could struggle to compete is with the stunning vistas, particularly the sandy beaches and turquoise waters that provided the backdrop to the open-air aquatics centre and the volleyball stadium. The venues for the gymnastics, cycling and netball were sold out for almost every session, pumping with music and entertaining sport.The only disappointment was that many of England’s leading names failed to perform. The Brownlee brothers arrived slightly injured and left without medals. Max Whitlock was outshone on the pommel horse by the 17-year-old Rhys McClenaghan from Northern Ireland. The world indoor champion hurdler Andrew Pozzi and the Olympic medallist hammer thrower Sophie Hitchon faltered, and Adam Peaty was beaten in the pool for the first time in four years.But at least they showed up. Bolt was bemused that some of England’s best sprinters, including CJ Ujah, who had every chance of winning a 100m medal, did not travel. Sebastian Coe, the president of athletics’ governing body the IAAF, was also surprised. “My gut instinct is try to not sit out championships because they are important at the end of your career,” he said. “When you turn your cards over it’s medals that people judge you on, not fast times in the Diamond League.”These Games will be recalled in England not for the medal table but for the netball team, who provided the most thrilling and unexpected result by beating Australia. The tales of perseverance and triumph against the odds also cut through. The weightlifter Zoe Smith, who has battled injury, funding cuts and worked as a waitress between training, won silver, just days after having an epidural to ease agonising pain.No stranger to heartache was the 400m hurdler Kyron McMaster of the British Virgin Islands, who won gold only months after his coach was killed by Hurricane Irma.Tom Daley produced a performance which will live longer in the memory than any perfectly executed back 3½ pike. “There are 37 countries in the Commonwealth where it’s illegal to be who I am hopefully we can reduce that number,” he said, calling on the 37 of the 53 countries where homosexuality is illegal to change their laws.Given that number was 43 four years ago in Glasgow, it is not a hopeless plea. Where other sporting bodies scarper at the mere mention of politics, the Commonwealth Games Federation chief executive, David Grevemberg, actively promotes discussion of human-rights issues.The Rwanda women’s beach volleyball team were encouraged to wear black armbands to mark the 24th anniversary of the genocide, while Australia’s indigenous culture, which it still wrestles with, was a major part of the opening ceremony.The question which pervades every Commonwealth Games is “do they really matter?” From a sporting perspective it is impossible to argue they compare with the Olympics or a world championships. But the Games has shown once again that they offer something wholly, often wonderfully, different."},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

To walk around her garden and talk about trees “and whatever else takes our fancy”, says Attenborough, tantalisingly, on The Queen’s Green Planet (ITV). Oh go on, ask her if she has been watching The Crown.She has always loved trees, we learn. To prove it, there is some footage of her a long time ago with a tree. Now she has put her name to a splendid project, the Queen’s Commonwealth Canopy, to create a global network of protected forest.Two fine plane trees in the garden at Buckingham Palace were planted by her great-great-grandparents, Victoria and Albert. Sometimes they get crows nesting in them, she tells Attenborough. “We have to get people to remove them, because it’s not nice to have them outside your window,” she says. Oh. Couldn’t you get earplugs? Are you allowed to remove crows nests? I guess you are if you are the Queen. Diplomatically, Attenborough doesn’t pursue the subject.There are family trees planted for her children, although they have problems establishing which is whose. Is that one Edward’s or Andrew’s? They are all oaks. It would have been more fun if they had planted trees to match their characters. Maybe a weeping ash for Charles – not just weeping, but all fuddled and tied in knots. Anne? Holly – cold and spiky … That said, if they did it when the children were born, I guess they wouldn’t have known how they were going to turn out.Speaking of spiky, the Queen’s dogs don’t like the prickles on the horse chestnut husks, she says. Perhaps they get people to remove them, too. Wasn’t it ridiculous when someone tried to ban children playing conkers, they agree, health and safety gone mad. “Seems to me quite a harmless sort of battle thing,” says the Queen. You can do your own William I gags.James I planted mulberry trees as food for silkworms, but he got the wrong kind of mulberry and the silkworms didn’t make any silk, she says, giggling. Bloody idiot. It is nice, a tiny split in her own slightly prickly husk for a glimpse of the conker within. There is more evidence of humour. “It sounds like President Trump,” she says, when a helicopter disturbs their chat. “Or Obama,” she adds, quickly, remembering diplomacy.Attenborough, deferential to his fellow nonagenarian in person, is ever so slightly arch in his narration. “A sort of royal I-was-here,” he calls her tree-planting sprees. “There’s something life affirming about it. One, two, three shovels and people clap.”“It’s what our family does,” says Prince Harry. “We travel the world planting trees.” Yes, the grandchildren are on board with the QCC project. Here, the roles do appear to have been matched to their personalities. William is in Canada, making a worthy speech in the rain. (And then bothering a salmon, grabbing it and hauling out of the river. Kate, too. Leave the wildlife alone!) Harry, meanwhile, is in the Caribbean, playing with kids, drumming and shaking his booty with the locals, before planting his tree. No sign of Meghan, but I feel her presence. I think she is responsible for all this – not the tree project (that was Labour MP Frank Field), but the fact that you can’t keep the new, less prickly Windsors off the telly at the moment.Namibia doesn’t have many trees left. Angelina Jolie is there with all her children (not all of whom look happy about it), trying to do something about it. She has opened a nursery – the tree kind, not the children kind. I suppose Jolie is royalty of some kind that is why she is involved.Back in London, now inside the palace, the Queen is having a reception, presenting certificates to the high commissioners of the countries that have signed up, gently encouraging those who have yet to do so. Exercising soft power, Attenborough calls it.Boris Johnson is here. He is also a tree enthusiast, apparently. “I, in an almost sort of teutonic way, rejoice when I get into a glade or a bosky nook of one kind or another,” he says. “I won’t say that in a teutonic way I disrobe …”Eurgh, horrid image. Enough of your piffle, Johnson, this isn’t about you. It is about more important things: conservation, creating a network to safeguard the forests of the world and two famous old people walking around a London garden admiring even older trees."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/137ab4a37b2feec36f6fdbb57654a58d5e97a45d/0_50_5760_3455/master/5760.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b8cdd1ab6e8ab8c8e33d39f4db3301a2 2600w","title":"first mosque stornoway isle of lewis outer hebrides islam christianity","story":"On the Isle of Lewis, support for the project is flooding in from Muslims and non-Muslims alikeA couple of weeks ago, Aihtsham Rashid was standing in front of a derelict building in Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis, considering the scale of the task of turning it into the first mosque in the Outer Hebrides.“This could take years,” the Leeds-based builder told crestfallen members of the town’s Muslim community as they gazed at the crumbling walls, sagging roof and broken windows, and weighed up logistical problems of supplies and labour.But at the end of last week, five roofing contractors wearing hi-vis jackets emblazoned with the words “Stornoway mosque team” were hammering nails into new joists and beams. This week, plumbers, plasterers and electricians will arrive on the island. New windows still encased in packaging are stacked up on the floor, waiting to be installed. A prayer carpet has been ordered.Money and support, both moral and practical, have poured into the project after Rashid set up a crowdfunding appeal. Donations from around the world have pushed the sum raised well past the £50,000 target. Professional builders and tradesmen assisted by local residents, some also juggling their regular jobs, are working from 8am to 8pm, seven days a week.Now, Stornoway’s Muslims – a few dozen people out of about 8,000 in the town – are hopeful that the mosque will be ready for the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which begins in May. “It’s a big challenge to get it done in time for Ramadan, but we’ll do our best. Some things are out of our control, but now we have millions of people praying for us. It’s got a lot of momentum,” says Rashid.Muslims have lived in Stornoway since the 1950s, adapting to an island on which the Sabbath is still observed and churches retain considerable influence. Back then, some became travelling salespeople they lugged suitcases along roads winding through peatlands and past small lochs to offer fabric and other goods door to door until they had enough savings to open shops and buy homes for their families.But they never had a place of worship. Instead, prayers were held in people’s living rooms and the bodies of the dead were washed in garages. It could several days before an imam could come from the mainland to say funeral prayers.Over the years, some Muslims left the island for work, to join children and grandchildren who had settled on the mainland, or to be part of a bigger mosque-based community. But since 2015, the dwindling numbers have been boosted by the arrival of several families fleeing the civil war in Syria. The need for a mosque took on a renewed urgency.The community bought a derelict building in the town and planning permission to turn it into a mosque was granted last summer. Little headway was made until a friend of Rashid’s visited the island a few weeks ago.Rashid runs a construction firm that specialises in new-build properties but also has experience of building mosques. As well as raising money for the Stornoway project, he has negotiated discounts on supplies and called in contractors. “Suppliers have been very cooperative. Most of the people helping to build the mosque are non-Muslim,” he says.The response of other Stornoway residents has been mostly encouraging, according to members of the Muslim community. A woman turned up at the site this week with a cheque for £500. “This goes a long way to show the love and support we have been receiving from the people of Stornoway,” the mosque team tweeted.No members of the Muslim community wish to be quoted directly or named, saying they want to get on with the project quietly and peacefully. Some are especially wary of the media, which they say has tried to stir up isions in the town over the mosque and has routinely misrepresented Islam.The only strident opposition has come from the Free Church (Continuing), a small breakaway from the Free Church of Scotland. It described the mosque as a “most unwelcome development” in a statement issued last year that spoke of “the oppression of Christians and the reduced status of women under Islam” and of “militant Islamists or ‘jihadists’”.The church’s response to the mosque was guided by the biblical commandment to love God, says Greg MacDonald, moderator of the Outer Hebrides presbytery of the Free Church (Continuing). “On the basis of this biblical teaching, we object to the promotion of all false religion, including the promotion of Islam through a mosque in Stornoway. God’s right to be worshipped by his creatures in the way he requires must take precedence over any other supposed rights,” he says.In contrast, James Maciver, a minister with the Free Church of Scotland, the biggest congregation on the island, says he supports Muslims’ right to worship. “They have always been regarded by the local community as people who’ve contributed to the local economy and integrated well. I don’t remember any animosity towards them. Outsiders may have got the impression that the Christian community here have resisted the mosque, but that’s not the case,” he says.“I come at this from the point of view of liberty of conscience, freedom of religion. I don’t personally see Islam as the way to salvation, but they have a civil right to a place of worship. I have no right to come between someone’s conscience and their god.”Two Syrian women have been welcomed at his church’s parent and toddler group, Maciver says. “Local people simply take the view that their faith is their business. No one wants to disturb the peace.”Back at the mosque building site, work will begin on the interior once the roof is weatherproof. The prayer room will have a women’s section, ablution facilities will be installed and a separate mortuary will be created.Plans are already under way to invite Stornoway residents to the mosque for tea, to give people an opportunity to ask questions and get to know their Muslim neighbours better. “Christianity and Islam have very similar values, the same values in fact,” says Rashid. “Once we have finished building, we will have an open-door policy. Everyone is welcome.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d7a1e0118fdc0960ed159b542f046394f847617/785_0_2721_1633/master/2721.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=309e8c8d8e68d47029e7bdd96b87bfd1 1240w","title":"the hague bans marijuana smoking in city centre","story":"Move prompted by numerous complaints from both residents and visitors, says mayor’s officeThe Hague has become the first Dutch city to ban the smoking of cannabis around its city centre, central railway station and major shopping areas, in the latest example of a wider trend towards reining in country’s traditional gedoogbeleid (tolerance policy).Flyers are to be distributed at cannabis-selling coffee shops and homeless shelters to warn of fines for those caught breaching the ban. An English-language version of the flyer is to be made available in hotels.Cannabis is sold openly in 573 coffee shops operating in 103 of the 380 municipalities in the Netherlands, including The Hague.However, awareness of the increase in strength of the varieties of the drug now available, compared with the 1970s when the tolerance policy was introduced, and concern that it is encouraging antisocial behaviour, has seeped into the thinking of central and municipal authorities in recent years.A spokesman for Pauline Krikke, the mayor of The Hague, said the “many complaints” from residents and visitors about the strong smell of cannabis, and the noise from its users, had prompted the prohibition.The spokesman added that the mayor and police had decided there was evidence that “the use of soft drugs has a negative impact on the living environment of residents and visitors” in the areas where the ban will be in place.The prohibition will be enforced by the police, with warnings given to those found to be using the drug in 13 designated public places over the next two weeks.Fines, the level of which will be decided by the public prosector, will apply after that period, and the police will be proactively monitoring the doorways of shops for users.The municipality of Amsterdam prohibits drug use around schools and playgrounds. Rotterdam introduced a ban on use in 2010 around five secondary vocational schools, which was later extended to schools across the entire city. The city has been also been seeking to reducing the number of coffee shops.The development in The Hague is just the latest move in an attempt to tighten the rules around the sale and use of cannabis.Recent governments have clamped down by banning coffee shops in border areas from serving tourists.Last month the Dutch government announced a pilot scheme in 10 municipalities for the regulated production of cannabis, with cultivators recruited through a tender.Coffee shops can currently sell the drug butare not allowed to produce it, which critics say provides a clear opening for criminal gangs to become the suppliers.

It has found a hoard believed to be linked to the Danish king Harald Gormsson, better known as “Harry Bluetooth”, who reigned from around AD958 to 986.Braided necklaces, pearls, brooches, a Thor’s hammer, rings and up to 600 chipped coins were found, including more than 100 that date back to Bluetooth’s era, when he ruled over what is now Denmark, northern Germany, southern Sweden and parts of Norway.“This trove is the biggest single discovery of Bluetooth coins in the southern Baltic Sea region and is therefore of great significance,” the lead archaeologist, Michael Schirren, told national news agency DPA.The oldest coin is a Damascus dirham dating to 714 while the most recent is a penny dating to 983.The find suggests that the treasure may have been buried in the late 980s – also the period when Bluetooth was known to have fled to Pomerania, where he died in 987.“We have here the rare case of a discovery that appears to corroborate historical sources,” said the archaeologist Detlef Jantzen. Bluetooth is credited with unifying Denmark. The Viking-born king also turned his back on old Norse religion and introduced Christianity to the Nordic country.But he was forced to flee to Pomerania after a rebellion led by his son Sven Gabelbart. Bluetooth’s lasting legacy is found today in smartphones and laptops – the wireless Bluetooth technology is named after him, and the symbol is composed of the two runes spelling out his initials HB."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef2a0d8f516fdecdeac8a62bb1bae6abeb389818/754_618_1781_1068/master/1781.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9fb15e25f5e7ffa9fce7975e8b5390dd 1240w","title":"commonwealth leaders choose next head after queen this week","story":"Ahead of leaders’ retreat, Theresa May makes clear that UK backs Prince Charles as next symbolic leader of organisationCommonwealth leaders could decide this week on who takes over from the Queen as head of the organisation, Downing Street has said.The news came as Theresa May prepared to address her fellow national leaders on Tuesday. The prime minister is expected to urge the Commonwealth to engage and inspire the next generation, and to pledge £212m to help a million girls get a better education.She also made clear the UK backed Prince Charles to be the new head of the Commonwealth. The position was passed from his grandfather to his mother but is not hereditary.May’s spokesman said Charles had proven a “proud supporter of the Commonwealth for four decades and has spoken passionately about the organisation’s unique ersity”.No 10 said: “Succession is a matter for the Commonwealth as a whole to determine. If any discussion did take place it would happen at the leaders’ retreat at Windsor on Friday. Decisions in the Commonwealth are made by consensus.”Commonwealth leaders are gathering in London for an executive session on Thursday, before a retreat at the castle.The organisation’s secretary general, Patricia Scotland, said the retreat was a chance for the leaders to talk one to one without outside interference.“On the retreat, the 53 leaders get to go away together with no agenda and just talk about all the things that they desire to talk about. That enables them to deal with some quite tricky, sensitive issues, but collectively, collegiately and as part of the family,” she said.Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, had suggested on BBC television on Sunday that the figurehead role could go to a rotating president. “The Queen clearly is personally very committed to the Commonwealth but after her I think maybe it’s a time to say, well, actually the Commonwealth should decide who its own president is on a rotational basis.”Queen Elizabeth, who is 91, has been the symbolic head of the Commonwealth since 1952. Charles is heir to the throne in 16 of the 53 Commonwealth member states, which are chiefly territories that used to be part of the former British empire.In her speech on Tuesday, May is expected to warn that a failure to engage and inspire the next generation will see the Commonwealth dismissed as “an irrelevance”. She will say she is “confident about our chances of success” in building a “bright future” for the organisation.In front of an audience expected to include the Microsoft founder, philanthropist and anti-malaria campaigner Bill Gates, May is expected to pledge the money towards making sure children living in developing Commonwealth countries receive 12 years of quality education. She will also call on leaders to commit to halving malaria by 2023."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"European Commission said the proposed legislation may conflict with bloc\u0026rsquos lawSenior aide in George W Bush White House to lead delegation of Facebook executives and advisers at Oireachtas committeeGroup could be open to legal action from a man who alleges abuse by a leader, expert saysMove comes just weeks after AG called the new judicial appointments Bill a \u0026lsquodog\u0026rsquos dinner\u0026rsquoNew legislation will make licences dependent on consultants completing specialist trainingOne group leader criticises membership supporting under-fire senior volunteersCabinet is to consider a proposal to create a rental register to help protect tenantsIf no progress on \u0026lsquobackstop\u0026rsquo wording by June, UK withdrawal treaty at risk, says CoveneyIreland will see number of MEPs it elects rise from 11 to 13 as a result of UK leaving EUCabinet to discuss proposals to allow more former laundry workers to apply for redressMother walks out in protest saying abortion \u0026lsquonot appropriate\u0026rsquo subject for childrenDavid Gantly gives evidence on day 55 of David Drumm\u0026rsquos conspiracy to defraud trialAnna Marie Pezzillo and Rachel Comiskey admit manslaughter of Ian Quinn after drink and drugs bingeBarrister cites \u0026lsquoone of the longest cases of prosecutorial delay to come before the courts\u0026rsquoDiscovery could result in recycling solution for millions of plastic bottles and containersGunshot injuries not believed to be life-threateningFormer Fianna F\u0026aacuteil councillor was jailed in 2015 for soliciting to kill garda, Revenue official and accountantTimmy Dooley has \u0026lsquono issue\u0026rsquo being sent such material but says it is difficult for female staffDirector of Corporate Enforcement wants two inspectors to investigate INM\u0026rsquos affairsThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"British PM defends decision to launch action against Assad without parliamentary approvalPrime minister insists call made in \u0026lsquonational interest\u0026rsquo rather than due to pressure from USLuxembourg meeting condemns \u0026lsquorepeated use\u0026rsquo of chemical weapons by Syrian regimeImpact of the strikes could have been limited by the amount of time Syria had to prepareTheresa May to seek Commons debate amid calls she lacked authority for attackUK, US and France target alleged chemical weapons facilities in bombing campaignMilitary action against Syria brings warnings from Iran and most Arab governmentsUS ambassador to UN says US \u0026lsquolocked and loaded\u0026rsquo if Syrians further use chemical weaponsVincent Durac: It\u0026rsquos expected this US-led attack will be of much longer duration than last year\u0026rsquos\u0026lsquoWe are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents\u0026rsquoGrim total of 511,000 casualties may be disputed but each death is vital to accountabilityUN inspectors arrive in Syria to investigate last week\u0026rsquos chemical weapons assaultOne killed and more than 100 injured from live Israeli fireBritain asks Cyprus to reserve airspace in preparation for possible air strikes on SyriaMore than 40 people were killed in the strike in Douma last week, WHO saysEmmanuel Macron says he has proof of Syria\u0026rsquos guilt but needs to gather more informationOfficials believe both chlorine and a nerve agent were used in weekend attackTrump breaks with national security protocols to warn of imminent attack on SyriaUS president keen on sending strong message to Assad, but at what potential cost?Eurocontrol warns carriers to exercise caution over eastern Mediterranean regionThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3463708.1523904133!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"a new british centrist party could win over voters but not yet","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNew political movements, such as French president Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche, are disparaged for their intellectual vacuity – until they win. Photograph: Charles Platiau via APIf the worst thing that can happen to a new project is to be ignored, a party of the British centre ground has a chance, after all.The latest people to try, steered by the entrepreneur Simon Franks, are drenched from the Victoria Falls of cold water that has been poured on their idea. The yet-to-be-named party is doomed, say well-wishers, not just enemies, by its reliance on shop-soiled politicians from the recent past, its lack of ideas, its support from donors of the faceless, cat-stroking kind, its air of de haut en bas and its geographic spread of potential voters in an electoral system that rewards concentration.Some of these problems are more real than others. A wider donor base would make it harder for cynics, including Conservatives who should know better, to demonise this “rich man’s party”. But the Brexit campaign was not financed by the spare pennies of honest draymen either, and still won.As for ideas, lots of political movements are disparaged for their intellectual vacuity until they win. Tony Blair’s New Labour, David Cameron’s modernised Tories and Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche are just the most recent examples of vague but well-led platforms that carried the public. The inidual leader comes first. The ideas follow, and sometimes never do.The unavailability of such a leader is one of British centrism’s besetting curses, but there is an even more obvious problem. Nothing has happened yet. The hard but crucial thing to remember about the great age of populism, the historic rout of the centre, globalisation’s writhing ordeal, is that almost all of it is prospective. It amounts to a series of electoral shocks that have not had time to work much tangible effect on the governance of nations, and therefore on people’s lives.The implementation of Brexit is still years away, on the other side of a transitional phase. Fifteen months into his US presidency, Donald Trump’s foremost legislative achievement is a corporate tax cut that most of the hated “globalists” would drink up. Over the same period, the most notable policy change in Europe has been Macron’s attempted supply-side reform of France. Exactly what is a voter of the liberal centre meant to be mobilising against at this point, beyond the atmospheric change?The economist Robert Solow, unimpressed with the growth-boosting properties of information technology, once said that the computer age is everywhere but in the productivity statistics. The populist age is everywhere but on the statute book, at least for now. There have been some disturbing reversals for liberalism: in eastern and central Europe especially, and on the subject of immigration. But the overall balance of government policy in the democratic west, including Britain, has not changed drastically since the Year Zero of 2016.This can change, and probably will. But until it does, middle-ground voters are being invited to react against something that has not occurred – against the idea, not the felt reality, of illiberalism. It is too little to hang a new party on. No one calls the police because they fear a burglary in the medium-term future. It is the immediacy of a threat that concentrates the mind.Looking back, no one is surprised that an anti-globalisation movement failed to materialise in, say, 1980, when Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan had just been elected and the intellectual right was still talking a better game than it had legislated. Yet at an equivalent stage of this new populist era – if it turns out to be any such thing – the lack of a liberal resistance is seen as an ignominious failure. In fact, it is natural.The creation of a successful new party is not just difficult, it is mostly beyond anyone’s control. It requires a mating of historic circumstance and the human element, in the form of an outstanding inidual. All the same, Franks and his like are right to detect lots of unspoken-for voters in modern Britain. They are middle-income, largely apolitical workers who do not answer to the mystifying name “centrist”, but simply have a material interest in continuity. (Most people in work voted Remain.) They are frustrated by the world as it is, but do not believe it needs turning upside down.The trouble is, as of spring 2018, the world has not been upturned. Their material lives have not changed enough. As much as politics has pitched and yawed noisily in recent years, policy itself has not. If that changes, and these voters feel their hard-won living standards compromised by ideological hot-heads, watch the “insurmountable” barriers to a new centrism tumble. Voters cannot be persuaded of that which has yet to be felt. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3462566.1523813034!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mps could delay brexit with final deal renegotiation demand","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople’s Vote: the MPs Caroline Lucas, Layla Moran, Chuka Umunna and Anna Soubry want a referendum on the final Brexit deal. Photograph: Ben StansallAFPGettyMPs could delay Brexit if they are unhappy with a final deal by sending the British government back to Brussels to renegotiate it, according to a new analysis of the role of parliament in the process.A report by the Institute for Government, a think tank close to Whitehall, rejects the assertion by Theresa May’s government that MPs will face a choice between endorsing the deal or leaving the EU with no agreement at all.“The government has a massive political incentive to talk up the chaos that would ensue if parliament did anything other than approve its deal. It is not surprising, therefore, to hear ministers arguing that the only alternative is to leave the EU without a deal – meaning no transition period and no legal guarantees for UK and EU citizens,” said Raphael Hogarth, one of the report’s authors.“The facts, however, are messier. If parliamentarians object to a particular bit of the deal, or to all of it, they could ask the government to renegotiate. The real questions then would be political: could the present government survive this, and would the EU 27 be prepared to return to the table?”The UK and the EU hope to reach agreement by October on two major documents outlining the terms of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the union and its future relationship with the European Union.The withdrawal agreement, a treaty setting out the terms of the UK’s exit for the short to medium term, will have the force of international law once it is signed and ratified. The second document is the “framework for a future relationship”, a political declaration on the terms of the UK’s long-term relationship with the EU.The government has promised to put the withdrawal agreement and future framework, together, to a “meaningful vote” in parliament. If the motion is approved it will be followed by a Withdrawal Agreement and Implementation Bill, which will enshrine the agreement in British law.The Institute for Government report says that, although MPs will not be able to amend the withdrawal agreement itself, they can attach amendments to the “meaningful vote” motion obliging the government to seek a better deal.“MPs can force ministers back to the negotiating table and, if they do, the government’s timetable could be unachievable. If MPs were to send ministers back to Brussels to ask for significant changes to the deal, it is likely that Brexit would have to be delayed,” said Hannah White, another of the report’s authors.More than 1,000 people attended the launch in London on Sunday of the People’s Vote, a campaign to put the Brexit deal to the people in a referendum. MPs from four parties were at the launch, including the Conservative Anna Soubry, Chuka Umunna of Labour, the Greens’ Caroline Lucas and the Liberal Democrat Layla Moran.“We have got to get a majority in the House of Commons for the proposition of this people’s vote,” Mr Umunna said. “That means at the very least my party, the Labour Party, needs to be true to its values and support this.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orceThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

Initially, emergency rations included only rice, vegetable oil and lentils. Ms Leidman warned that the coming rainy season, which normally starts between April and June, could make the situation worse.She said some of the feeding centres were in areas that could flood and, although steps were being taken to prevent the worst effects of the flooding, it was unclear what impact the monsoon would have on vital services.The rainy season also presents a greater risk of waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea, typhoid, hepatitis, malaria and dengue.Ms Leidman added: “The possibility of an outbreak of infectious disease can exacerbate malnutrition. In a malnourished population the disease severity and duration of an infectious disease can be much greater.”Researchers are now conducting a follow-up study to assess whether the nutritional situation has changed.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Women who want to conceive should adopt a healthy diet years earlierCanada withdraws diplomats\u0026#39 families from Cuba over mystery illnessComment: Windrush children like me are being put in an appalling situation.

The Viking-born king also turned his back on old Norse religion and introduced Christianity to the Nordic country.But he was forced to flee to Pomerania after a rebellion led by his son Sven Gabelbart.Bluetooth\u0027s lasting legacy is found today in smartphones and laptops - the wireless Bluetooth technology is named after him, and the symbol is composed of the two Runes spelling out his initials R.

That’s possible thanks to Jesus,” said Cardinal Ernest Simoni, an Albanian who was tortured and imprisoned by the Communist authorities but after his release performed frequent exorcisms.His comments took some prelates by surprise, with priests pointing out that conducting an exorcism remotely would not be wise because people who are possessed often writhe around violently and have to be physically restrained to stop them harming themselves.“Priests pray with people on the phone to calm them down, but if you are not there you cannot control the physical aspects,” said Professor Giuseppe Ferrari, one of the organisers of the event and an expert on demonic sects. “Some exorcists say it is effective. Whether it is orthodox or correct, I couldn’t say.”In The Rite, a young American seminarian travels to Rome to learn about fighting the DevilMore than 250 priests, theologians, psychologists and criminologists from 51 countries gathered at a Catholic university in Rome for the start of the week-long conference, the only one of its kind in the world.The concept of demonic possession may be regarded by agnostics and atheists with scepticism, even derision, but it is a subject of deadly seriousness for the Catholic Church.This is the 13th time the annual conference has been held at the Regina Apostolorum pontifical university – the first was in 2004 – and the number of participants grows every year.Topics to be discussed this week include: Angels and demons in Holy Scripture, How to recognise diabolical obsessions, Witchcraft in Africa, Afro-american cults in Latin America and Paedophile pornography used in Satanic and occult rites.On Wednesday, they will hear disturbing testimony of a young woman who was allegedly kidnapped and use in a satanic rite.The week-long course on exorcism is being held at a Catholic university in RomeA belief in black magic and Satan – or “the Prince of Evil” as one priest called him - is on the increase and with that, the need for exorcisms, delegates said.In Italy, it is claimed that in the past decade the number of people asking for exorcisms to rid themselves of demonic infestation has tripled to half a million.The country now boasts around 300 exorcist priests, with hundreds more in other parts of the world.The Vatican insists that every Catholic diocese in the world must have a priest trained as an exorcist.To cast out the Devil, they read out the Roman Ritual of Exorcism, which was drawn up by Pope Leo XIII in 1884.The prayer, which must only be uttered by a priest, calls on God, Christ and all the saints to “repulse the attacks and deceits of the Devil”, who is also referred to as “most cunning serpent.”“Demand is growing, absolutely,” said Father Anthony Barratt, a British priest who is based in Albany, New York State. “I think it is partly due to the internet, which makes it (satanism) so accessible. Films and television programmes are also a factor. There’s a fascination.”A Spanish priest holds up a book entitled \u0026#34Exorcism rites and prayers\u0026#34Priests at the conference claimed that, as depicted by Hollywood, victims really do speak in tongues and vomit nails and shards of glass during exorcisms.They develop supernatural strength, their voices change to a gravelly growl and they are unable to speak languages they have never studied.“Most commonly they speak Latin, Hebrew and Aramaic,” said Father Pedro Barrajon, a Spanish priest and a past organiser of the conference.“If you show them a holy object, like a rosary or a cross or a picture of the Madonna, they go into shock and start yelling.”Experts insisted they could discern the difference between people suffering from psychiatric problems and those who had fallen into the diabolical clutches of the Prince of Darkness.“There’s a protocol. A person will be referred by the parish priest. There may then be an assessment by a psychologist. They may be bipolar or there could be issues with drug abuse, which does serious damage to the brain. It’s a lengthy process,” said Father Barratt. “Only a very small number of people need an exorcism.”Pope Francis often refers to the Devil in his sermons and homiliesWhile lamenting the fact that the media sometimes “sensationalises” exorcisms, the Church also seems to revel in the dark appeal of the phenomenon.Prof Ferrari proudly told delegates that there is a reference to the conference in The Rite, a 2011 film starring Anthony Hopkins and Ciaran Hinds about an American seminarian who heads to Rome to learn about exorcisms.“She doesn’t need a priest, she needs a shrink,” the sceptical seminarian tells Hopkins’ character, a veteran exorcist, in reference to one alleged victim.The prelates at the conference have no time for such doubts.They insist that the Devil is real, not just a metaphor for evil or a character from folklore.Such views are shared by Pope Francis, who makes frequent references to Satan in his homilies and addresses.“He is evil, he’s not like mist. He’s not a diffuse thing, he is a person,” he told a Catholic television channel in December. “I’m convinced that one must never converse with Satan - if you do that, you’ll be lost.”Opening the conference, Father Jose Enrique Oyarzun, a professor of theology and philosophy, said: “We need to confront the reality of something that has always been present in the life of the Church.”The Devil is capable of behaviour that is “unexplainable by science”, he said. “The Devil roars around us like a lion. The father of lies is more and more sought after. Digital technology is invigorating him and leading people astray. The phenomenon is very, very widespread.”Cardinal Simoni, 89, spent 28 years in forced labour camps under the Communist regime of Enver Hoxha for refusing to renounce his faith.He was released from prison in 1981 but had to preach secretly until the regime finally collapsed in 1990.Since then, he has performed exorcisms on many people, including Albanian Muslims, who he said came to him begging for help.The cardinal gave a vivid description of one exorcism he said he performed.“There was a very tall woman. She must have been two metres in height. It took six people to hold her down in a chair. After hours and hours of struggle, I was able to banish the evil. I cast out the demons. This is the power of God.”For true believers, there is still much work to do, he told the conference. “There are millions of people who are possessed by Satan. But when Satan hears the word of God, he is terrified.”Women who want to conceive should adopt a healthy diet years earlierCanada withdraws diplomats\u0026#39 families from Cuba over mystery illnessComment: Windrush children like me are being put in an appalling situation.

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In part this was for its symbolism, but it also meant he could be home with his family by Easter Day.Tony Blair and the Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern sign the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 (PA)Those who signed up called it the Good Friday Agreement those forced reluctantly to accept its terms still call it merely the Belfast Agreement. Its terms have come to be a guarantor of peace – or as near to it as Northern Ireland ever comes – for 20 years. Now is a curious time to threaten it.Yet the lessons of history are repeatedly forgotten, or disregarded by those who find them inconvenient for their present circumstances. In Blair’s more recent words, it is an “irresponsibility that is frankly sickening” that there are British politicians who would “sacrifice peace in Northern Ireland on the altar of Brexit”.His views are shared by his predecessor, the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who engaged with and edged along the politically precarious process of engagement with the IRA. But opposition from his own party’s right wing meant only a Labour prime minister could carry it through to fruition.April 2018, with an uncertain Brexit hovering over the graveyards, is an apposite moment to recall the grim origins of the ‘peace process’, which lie in part in a particularly gory incident on the streets of Belfast that brought home to the British public the horror that most have since preferred to forget.It was shortly after noon on Friday 19 March 1988, two weeks before Good Friday. Father Alec Reid, a Catholic priest, was walking down Andersonstown Road when he heard angry shouts and animal-like screams mounting in murderous crescendo.Two British army corporals had apparently accidentally driven into the path of the funeral procession of an IRA member, himself killed by a loyalist gunman at a funeral three days earlier. Fearing a repeat attack, the crowd set upon the two soldiers, who were wearing civilian clothes, in their car. One of the soldiers drew his service pistol and fired in the air. They were dragged from the car.The men were overpowered, beaten and stripped. They were then shot dead on a patch of wasteland next to Andersonstown social club.Footage of the incident shocked the world. But with it came an image of compassion: a Catholic priest, grief etched on his face, ministering to one of the British soldiers in death. Few who looked upon that scene were aware that a regular visitor to Reid’s confessional was a former barman named Gerry Adams.Father Alec Reid giving last rites to one of the two soldiers killed by a mob at the funeral of an IRA member shot by loyalist gunman Michael Stone (Rex)Indeed, Reid was already by this time acting as a go-between for Adams, the leader of the IRA, and John Hume, head of the moderate nationalist SDLP. The incident on the Andersonstown Road strengthened his determination to bring about an alliance between the two men. Staggeringly, it emerged years later that he was carrying a message from Adams to Hume on the day of the killings.  The IRA were understandably toxic to British politicians. The aim was to bring them in from the cold. Hume was a republican but respectable. The theory was that he might be able to convey to London what it would take to make the IRA call off their campaign of violence.The most difficult issue was the IRA’s total refusal to recognise an inner-Ireland border guarded by soldiers and armed police. (Sound familiar?)I understood all this. I had grown up in Northern Ireland had lost two schoolfriends to the IRA. I was also aware of what had led to the violence: my Protestant grandfather had been a landlord who had three votes in local elections, while his Catholic tenants had none.Talking to Adams represented a political risk for Hume. Reid orchestrated secret meetings at Clonard Monastery on the ‘peace line’ in Belfast, where the 20ft-high wall had a statue of the Virgin Mary on one side and a ‘No Surrender’ mural on the other.The IRA top command had started to realise they might not convince the British government to ‘sell out’ the wishes of nearly one million citizens in Northern Ireland at the barrel of a gun. The slogan ‘Armalite in one hand and ballot box in the other’, coined by Danny Morrison in 1981, was being called into question.On the other hand, Peter Brooke, British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland between 1989 and 1992, admitted military defeat of the IRA was ‘difficult to envisage’.Still, many at the top of the IRA now believed London’s insistence – communicated publicly by Brooke – that it laid no claim to the six counties other than respecting the wishes of a majority of its people.Peter Brooke played an important role as Northern Ireland secretary (Reuters)Reid was also in regular contact with Irish taoiseach Charles Haughey. Brooke, meanwhile, set up shop in Stormont and held regular talks with Dublin politicians. Soon after taking up his post he had been briefed on the existence of a back channel between Michael Oatley, an MI6 agent, codenamed ‘Mountain Climber’, and the IRA’s hard man Martin McGuinness he authorised it to be continued.The word ‘clarification’ bounced back and forth in the game of semantics versus reality, the perpetual hallmark of Anglo-Irish relations. There were regular calls between Dublin wordsmith Martin Mansergh and Northern Ireland Office man John Chilcot (later to become known for overseeing the inquiry into the Iraq War) in an attempt to find common ground.Palace coups played their part in bringing matters to a head. First, Margaret Thatcher was ousted by her party, then Haughey by his. The ‘Iron Lady’ and ‘The Boss’ were gone. In their places were the less intimidating and more amenable John Major and Albert Reynolds.Ex-PM John Major tears into May’s ‘grand folly’ Brexit strategyIn February 1993 Major was looking over papers in the Cabinet Room when he was informed that there was a phone call for him from the IRA, possibly McGuinness himself. “The conflict is over, but we need your advice on how to bring it to a close.” Major decided to take the call seriously.A bomb in Warrington a few weeks later, which killed two children, nearly destroyed everything, until the IRA, chastened by their own wives and mothers, confidentially apologised: they had uncontrollable hardliners too. Indeed, in October, a bungled attack on a loyalist paramilitary office above a chip shop killed nine. A retaliation Halloween attack on a Catholic pub killed eight.But the forces of reason still rang out loud. By December, Major and Reynolds agreed what became known as the Downing Street Declaration, containing most of the points that would later be embodied in the Good Friday Agreement. The response was hesitant, but in August 1994 the IRA declared a ‘cessation of hostilities’.It seemed Major’s gamble had paid off, even if at a rally outside Belfast City Hall in August 1995 Gerry Adams was cheered when he declared: “They haven’t gone away, you know.”John Hume with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness during talksIn November, US President Bill Clinton addressed another Belfast rally and announced Senator George Mitchell as his ‘special envoy’ to the peace talks.Mitchell declared his strategy to be a twin track of talks and moves towards arms decommissioning. The two main unionist parties, the UUP and the more hardline DUP, refused to attend negotiations. Sinn Fein were refused entry. The political wings of unionist paramilitaries, however, were allowed in.In late 1997 I sat with David Ervine, a former UVF man jailed for possession of explosives, now a member of their political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, in a north Belfast bar. Guinness dripped from his moustache as he shared his changed views:“Pope John Paul II is a nice old Polish bloke it doesn’t do anybody any good going around shouting he is the antichrist.“If you want to make peace with men with guns,” he went on, “you have to talk to those who represent the men with guns.”The British government had initially done that with one side but not the other. As a result, the IRA ceasefire ended abruptly on 9 February 1996 when a bomb in London’s Canary Wharf financial district killed two and wounded more than 100.Allegations of foot-dragging were exchanged by both sides. In June, elections were held for a Northern Ireland Forum. Sinn Fein won 17 of 110 seats but refused to take up membership of what it considered a puppet British institution.The IRA caused huge damage in the Docklands bombing of 1996 (Reuters)Sure enough, the day after the Forum’s first meeting, the IRA gave its clear verdict: a 1,500 kilo bomb (the biggest in Britain since the end of World War Two) wiped out a large portion of Manchester city centre. A 90-minute warning saw 75,000 people evacuated from the area, and while there were no fatalities hundreds were injured.Again, though, a change of government put talks back on track. In May 1997 John Major handed the keys of 10 Downing Street to Tony Blair, a Labour leader who didn’t have to cope with the hard right wingers Major himself called “bastards”.Blair’s new Northern Ireland minister Mo Mowlam issued the long-awaited invitation to Sinn Fein to join the talks. In July, the IRA announced a renewed ceasefire.Cameron was right to ‘tell the truth’ on Bloody Sunday: Introducing anCrucially, in January 1998 Blair announced a fresh public inquiry into the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Derry, in which 14 unarmed citizens were shot dead by British troops. Its conclusions, finally revealed in 2010, exonerated Martin McGuinness from involvement and blamed British paratroopers for firing first.Compromises paid off. A legally binding agreement, involving both British and Irish governments and echoing the 1993 Downing Street Declaration, was at last on the cards. The wording was designed to be a classic agreement to differ, to promise everything to everyone.The key elements were a mutual renunciation of violation, and assurances that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK as long as a majority of its citizens wanted it to – but could in principle become part of the Irish Republic if a majority desired it in the future.The provisions were put to referendums on both sides of the border. In the Republic, more than 94 per cent of a 56 per cent turnout voted ‘yes’, in the north 71 per cent voted ‘yes’ on a turnout of 81 per cent. There was no official breakdown of the ethnic pattern in the north independent observers reckoned it was overwhelming in republican circles but marginal among unionist voters.Of Northern Ireland’s nine political parties, eight signed up to the agreement. Only one, the DUP, refused (a fact Theresa May might have missed in 2017 when she welcomed the party as an ally to prop up her minority government).Ireland amended its constitution to remove the claim that the territory of the state was the ‘whole island’. In return Britain repealed the symbolic but obsolete 1920 Government of Ireland Act, which still nominally implied similar territorial claims.Ian Paisley, left, and Martin McGuinness developed a surprisingly close relationship when they led the Northern Ireland Assembly (Getty)The European Union ploughed money into north-south Irish infrastructure, including a motorway from Dublin to Belfast. The single market and customs union meant border posts disappeared, and so did the armed men who guarded them.The early days were difficult. The old ‘moderate parties’ – the UUP and SDLP – initially dominated the new Northern Ireland Assembly, including by taking up the roles of first and deputy first minister. But after arguments broke out in 2001, the assembly was ultimately suspended by Westminster and Northern Ireland reverted to direct rule from London until a new agreement and the Assembly’s restoration in 2007.This time, as David Ervine had predicted, the real power brokers were to be found in the driving seat: the DUP veteran firebrand Ian Paisley and ex-IRA man Martin McGuinness.Against all odds, they not only agreed to work together but found points in common to the extent that they became something like friends, nicknamed ‘the Chuckle Brothers’. It was everything and more than the script writers of the Good Friday Agreement had dared dream of.Decommissioning of weapons, overseen by two American politicians and two generals, one Canadian, one Finnish, went on until 2005, by which time the international committee reckoned the IRA had done away with an armoury that included some 1,000 rifles, three tonnes of Semtex, and 20-30 heavy machine guns.Irish border joins orce bill on pile of reasons for Brexit deadlockIn the current Brexit context it is interesting to consider how British membership of the Euro currency – to which Ireland of course signed up – would have meant an even less obvious border between north and south.It wasn’t to happen though: British politicians treated the issue as done and dusted, and forgot the price.There is a belief among some Ulster Unionists – just as there is among many Brexiteers – that any risk is worth taking, any outcome acceptable, as long as it achieves the sole important aim: in the former case staying in a union in the latter, getting out of one.Kate Hoey, the pro-foxhunting Labour MP who has more in common with the DUP than her own party, is one of those who straddles both those camps. The Antrim-born Brexit supporter has said she would “do anything” to ensure Northern Ireland remains an integral part of the UK. She also caused outrage by suggesting that if Brexit did mean a hard border in Ireland, then it would have to be the EU – and thus the Irish – who would pay for it (on the basis that the British have no desire to erect one).Hoey and others like her give the strong impression of being dyed-in-the wool members of what was once the ‘protestant ascendancy’ who, like their forefathers, see British rule as a guarantee of superiority on their home turf.Michel Barnier says a solution must be found to avoid a hard border in Northern IrelandThe Good Friday Agreement questioned that assumption Northern Ireland’s demographic shift in the years since is moving it towards breaking point. Unionist parties lost their outright majority at Stormont in Assembly elections just over a year ago. How long will it be till a majority of voters in Northern Ireland would prefer to see their future as part of Ireland, not the UK?  Set against this backdrop, Brexit looked to many unionists like locking a fire safety door.That classic guide to British history up to 1918, Sellar’s and Yeatman’s ‘1066 and all that’, declared: “Gladstone tried all his life to guess the answer to the Irish question. Unfortunately, whenever he was getting warm, the Irish secretly changed the question.”This time it is the British who have changed the question.And nobody knows the answer.The Northern Ireland we know today was born in 1920 as part of a solution to long-running Irish ‘home rule’ demands, by creating two separate jurisdictions on the island, both still within the UK.It was a selective gerrymandering designed to perpetuate the rights of a pro-British, mainly Protestant ‘ascendancy’ within six of the nine counties of the historical province of Ulster, while giving discrete home rule to the south.It was not just too little too late, but way past its sell-by date. The scheme had been thrown into chaos by the First World War, the 1916 Easter Rising and its bloody suppression, then Sinn Fein’s 1918 landslide election and declaration of independence.The status of the ‘six counties’ was a major factor in the ensuing civil war over the new country’s status. But the deal survived and an imposing neo-classical parliament building was erected at Stormont on the outskirts of Belfast.Within their new Northern Irish fiefdom, with its built-in two-thirds majority rights, the Protestant-dominated government for the next 40 years oversaw a regime which frequently discriminated against the pro-Irish, largely Catholic minority. Prejudice was evident in housing, employment and voting rights, among other areas.The status quo was maintained by an almost exclusively Protestant armed police force that gloried in its ‘Royal’ Ulster Constabulary title and had a paramilitary wing known as the ‘B-Specials’, used against street riots in the 1930s and in the suppression of an IRA campaign in the 1950s.After renewed civil rights marches in the late 1960s led to further riots, brutally put down, regular British troops were sent to Northern Ireland and the ‘Specials’ were disbanded.A split within the IRA in 1969 had created the more militant ‘Provisional’ wing, which began a violent campaign both in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. Stormont’s response was internment without trial and a declaration that it was “at war”.In January 1972 British soldiers shot dead 13 people in (London)Derry, which would become known as Bloody Sunday. In response the British embassy in Dublin was burnt down. Two months later direct rule from London was imposed on Northern Ireland.Father Edward Daly (who became Bishop of Derry) leads casualties to safety on Bloody Sunday (Belfast Telegraph)Unionists at first considered this a blow but came to realise direct rule actually reinforced the province’s British status. The IRA stepped up its campaign, leading to a virtual civil war, with British troops considered to be on the side of the unionists.The death toll on both sides of the Irish Sea soared into thousands, with no end in sight. It was against that background that forces of sanity plucked the Good Friday Agreement seemingly from nowhere, persuading both sides that this was the only way to ensure peace and security for the foreseeable future.But the foreseeable future is hostage to demographics. In the 2017 elections, after the polarising Brexit vote, the combined unionist lobby lost their majority for the first time. The hardline DUP lost 10 seats, talking a total of 28, just one more than Sinn Fein.The Good Friday Agreement’s promise to both sides that Northern Ireland’s future would be determined by the wishes of the majority may eventually point towards a vote for Irish unity.As things stand, few would see the point of posing such a potentially explosive question. But Brexit and the possibility of a ‘hard border’ between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic could put all sorts of options back on the table.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 20,000 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpathsYet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidationCertainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.At a picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up, the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers. Stag membership doubled within the month.“At that point people were really realising this isn’t just about trees, it’s about democracy and our right to a say on what happens in our streets,” says Teal, a psychologist by trade.Demonstrations became feistier. Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesAneira Thomas, the first baby to be born on the NHS, addresses the Unison Health Conference at the Brighton CentreSir Patrick Stewart addresses the crowd during the People\u0027s Vote campaign launch on Brexit at the Electric Ballroom in Camden Town.

None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Last month, the International Energy Agency reported that Venezuela is and will probably remain “the biggest risk factor” in a global supply crisis that may soon tip the market into deficit.The desperate parents leaving their children at orphanagesThe speed of decline in production has been vertiginous, with output falling by 100,000 barrels a day in February, according to Bloomberg. The Central University of Venezuela says production is reaching its lowest point in 70 years.Most of the enormous oil reserves Venezuela has access to – almost 25 per cent of all the oil controlled by the world’s biggest producers – is heavy crude, and needs to be diluted with lighter oil to become a commercially viable product.In 2016, with its own industry failing to deliver, Venezuela imported diluents for the first time in its history. In the two years since, those imports have grown to as many as 200,000 barrels a day, mostly from the US, according to Francisco Monaldi, fellow in Latin American energy policy at Rice University in Texas.The long queues for food and medicine in Venezuela are now well documented, but lines of cars waiting outside petrol stations – something that would have been unthinkable a few years ago, when petrol cost $0.01 (0.7p) per litre – are becoming more common.Filling your tank is still cheaper than drinking water in Venezuela, but the industry can no longer meet domestic demands – and is having to put exports first. Monaldi says that if production continues to fall to below a million barrels, the consequences could be catastrophic.“The domestic consumption of oil is around 450,000 barrels and Venezuela needs the exports to repay its debt with Russia and China,” he says.“They have to import for two reasons. One is the collapse of the refining infrastructure and the other is that its oil is naturally heavy so they need to import diluents to blend with their oil to re-export it.Grieving families teargassed by police after 68 killed in prison fireWhy Venezuela’s new bitcoin alternative is so controversialVenezuela’s most-wanted rebel shared his story, just before deathVenezuela plans to launch an oil-backed cryptocurrency “One of the craziest things is that a part of Venezuela’s imports is for the domestic market, but given its price, they practically give gasoline away for free. They are importing barrels that cost $80 to $90 and selling them at $0.”Monaldi says the only hope is for a major change in politics. He estimates it would take a decade for Venezuela to go back to what it was, and maybe much longer than that.Venezuelan polling group IVAD suggests that elections next month are not looking good for President Nicolas Maduro. Of those polled, 77 per cent believe that the country needs a change of government, the main reasons stated being lack of food and medicine, insecurity and the high cost of living.The IMF expects the Venezuelan economy to shrink by 15 per cent in 2018, and the country is facing the worst decline of GDP in recorded history in Latin America. It estimates that by the end of 2018, the accumulated decline will be almost 50 per cent from its peak in 2013.Oil makes up more than 90 per cent of the nation’s exports, but a combination of government corruption, lack of investment and the migration of qualified staff have left the industry in ruins. It’s a crisis that has directly hit the country’s ability to import resources like food or medicine for the Venezuelan population.It is a vicious spiral. It is estimated that 10 per cent of the population has emigrated. Almost two thirds of all households have at least one family member living abroad. And among those 3 million migrants are young and competent workers who have escaped from a country that sinks deeper into crisis.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?
