sterne victoria miro mayfair review new york school venice sublime vertical horizontal","story":"Victoria Miro Mayfair, LondonMoving freely between figuration and abstraction, Europe and America, the late Hedda Sterne approaches the sublime in this momentous first UK solo showHedda Sterne (1910-2011) is a magnificent heroine of art. She died in New York at the age of 100, almost entirely blind, but still drawing “behind my eyes”. In an eight-decade career, Sterne refused to cleave to any single style – no logo, as she drily remarked – unlike the abstract expressionists, with whom she was and remains too closely associated. She ran all the way from self-portraiture to cityscape, still life and collage. Her last exhibition, at 94, was a series of figurative portraits.But it was her appearance in a famous Life magazine photograph in 1951 that restricted Sterne’s reputation. She stands at the back, in a hat, the lone woman among the group of New York School painters, including Jackson Pollock, Robert Motherwell and Willem de Kooning, who had signed a letter of protest against the politan Museum of Art’s failure to include abstraction in its shows of American art.Late to the shoot, and diminutive in any case, Sterne was asked to clamber up on a table. She stands out among all these men in their surprisingly conservative suits, rising like a feather in a cap. But still she was there in that moment, clinched in what would become exhibit A in any history of abstract expressionism. “I am known more for that darn photo,” she later remarked, “than for 80 years of work.”And so it has seemed, in this country at least for Sterne has never had a solo exhibition in Britain. This alone would make the show at Victoria Miro momentous. But the gallery has chosen to present a very specific phase of her work – a few years in the early 1960s, inspired by a Fulbright fellowship to Venice, when Sterne began to paint the so-called Vertical-Horizontal pictures. They could hardly have made a better choice.Enter the gallery, and a high, portrait-shaped canvas transmits a startling glow straight at you. It is like walking into a sunset. But that’s not exactly what the painting depicts. Horizontal bars of lavish paint rise in a storeyed format, one above the other. You might call them stripes, to be crude, but they are much more than that. Each is laid on the canvas in relation to the next, in a variety of overlaps, blends, nubs of merging colour of curious moments of ignition, like fireflies or sparks. The significant impression is of an electrifying green, glittering in darkness, like the northern lights.But up close, that exact colour is not there at all. Instead, you see a brilliantly orchestrated arrangement of yellows, black and taupes, setting off an internal light of their own. This apparently simple composition, and its ever-changing effects, approaches the sublime.But is this abstraction, let alone a variant of abstract expressionism? Sterne was adamant in her rejection of both. And none of the works in this show have anything in common with Barnett Newman’s stripes or Mark Rothko’s numinous oblongs. Sterne’s horizontals invoke horizons every time (some of the works are explicitly titled Horizon). And the more these bands multiply, the greater the sense of landscapes and seascapes, of wide skies and watery reflections.The golden crescent near the top of one canvas suggests an actual sunset, but far away in the distance across receding flatlands or tides. Vertical Horizontal #6 from 1963, is a stunning field of opalescent striations, milky blue, silver and cream, with fleeting washes of grey and tan. It slows down the scene, and the weather, and the time of day to a perfect poise, the visual equivalent of a sustained harmonious chord.Venice was a return to Europe for Hedwig Lindenberg, who was born in Bucharest to Romanian Jews, and married a local businessman, Fritz Stern, in 1932. When the Nazis occupied the city in 1941, he changed his surname to Stafford and helped her escape to New York. The first person she called on arrival was Peggy Guggenheim, who she had met in Paris in the 1930s, and who included her in several group shows.Sterne – she added the “e” – later married the great New Yorker cartoonist Saul Steinberg. Letters between them, in this show, give the fullest sense of their mutual profundity. But he left, after 16 years of infidelity, and she began a life and art of greater freedom. There were huge botanical paintings – the so-called “Lettuces” – installations of crowded faces, canvases painted on the floor, images composed of texts and, in the mid-1990s, white drawings in which she described the flickering interferences of her own macular degeneration.“I walk in the house like a lion every day to keep healthy,” she told an interviewer the year before she died. “I defend myself. I’m ‘invalidated’… But I still learn.” Someone should publish Sterne’s every utterance, one day, as inspiration for the whole human race.Her Venice drawings are exquisite: a wonderfully original grammar of notations. Some are like black silk stitches, varying in length to indicate the shapes of clouds. Others are more like calligraphy, an outlandish handwriting running bottom left to top right, spelling no words, but reading like spiralling clouds.The ink drawings in one room are just radiant little dots, gathering in arcs and horizontals, rather like the paintings. A murmuration of starlings, starry constellations, a ray of light breaking across the Grand Canal: they hold grand visions in their fractional array of marks.And it is this minute observation that underpins the paintings. For there is no way that Sterne could have judged the exact moment at which lead white or slate grey would chime with ochre to get the last glimmer of sunlight without the most intense study of the world before her. She notices the smallest contrast or variation, and incorporates it deep within her paintings. The means appear limited – just swathes on coarse canvas – but the effects are magical, as if light itself were breaking inside these works of art."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53c48d283e34fe0a69f8307e20ea4dc30f60759d/0_915_2658_1594/master/2658.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23bac948f76f66364f6c776365974fb5","title":"pieter hugo la cucaracha mexico the big picture","story":"The extraordinary and the everyday jostle for attention in the South African photographer’s examination of Mexican culturePieter Hugo’s new series, La Cucaracha (The Cockroach), named after a traditional song made popular during the Mexican revolution, grew out of a visit to the country in 2018. He was invited there by a curator whose stipulation was that he make work on the theme of sex and mortality.“Mexico’s anarchic, visceral energy got under my skin and sucked me in,” he recalls. “There is an acceptance that life has no glorious victory, no happy ending. Humour, ritual, a strong sense of community and an embrace of the inevitable make it possible to live with tragic and often unacceptable situations.”Hugo’s approach shifted accordingly to reflect the flamboyance and gritty ordinariness of life there, his images filled with vibrant colours and often mysterious symbolism. This portrait is a case in point. Entitled The Wedding Gift, it shows a young bride in Juchitán de Zaragoza cradling an iguana, a creature considered a symbol of patience, understanding and kindness in Mexico. Conversely, the elaborately competitive mating rituals performed by the male of the species – head-bobbing, nudging, biting and even changing colour – have been mimicked in local song and dance, including a famous traditional ballet, La Iguana de Guerrero.Whatever the symbolism, the young woman seems perfectly at ease holding a lizard in her lap, her direct-to-camera gaze giving little away. Hugo is also noncommittal, refusing to reveal her age or comment on what he calls “the iguana tableau”. From the start, Hugo’s work has been characterised by degrees of ambiguity: his most famous series, The Hyena and Other Men, shot with an itinerant troupe of street performers and their captive beasts in Nigeria. His approach, which merges documentary, street photography and staged portraiture, has led to accusations that he exoticises, even exploits, his subjects, though his photographs are often created through sustained creative collaboration with his sitters.In his Mexican portraits and landscapes,about to go on show at a London gallery, the mood moves between the heightened everyday and the grotesque: weatherbeaten peasants in work clothes, a woman dressed like Frida Kahlo, corpulent nudes, blood-covered faces and a man wearing a crown of thorns. Nothing is ever entirely what it seems, the complex nature of Mexican culture reflected through an outsider’s eyes as a mixture of ritual, role-playing and various degrees of exaggerated reality. “I am drawn,” says Hugo, “to the fabulousness of the banal and the banality of the exotic.” In Mexico, he found his perfect location.Pieter Hugo: La Cucaracha is at Huxley-Parlour Gallery, London, W1 from 19 Feb to 14 Mar"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1183e29a78a72e07bb29130de2e487639dcc205f/0_463_5689_3413/master/5689.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=670cde6c69b1ef2c0c02ffc99e9c28bd","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"The coronavirus outbreak, tributes to Kobe Bryant, the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz and the Australian Open tennis – the best photography from around the world in news, culture and sport"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45234b3b1af10050d4a2c35f84f41f4101f80a40/108_351_4498_2699/master/4498.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04b53f540e86df536bd727998c779870","title":"original observer photography","story":"Steve McQueen, Bill Nighy, Julia Fox, Big Narstie and more – the best photography commissioned by the Observer in January 2020"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef1c52e621ed3cbedf5546d56d21bd03f7a55360/0_11_2444_1466/master/2444.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0f7e85af9abb822305c0e862a71e276","title":"american dirt bookstores controversy profits","story":"Some stores aren’t carrying the novel, which has been criticized for stereotypical depictions of Mexicans, while others are promoting it alongside works by Latinx writers Independent bookstores across the US have found themselves in the crosshairs of the unabating controversy over American Dirt, with some booksellers debating how they should promote the novel, and redistribute the profits.Jeanine Cummins’ third novel drew swift criticism following its 21 January release for its stereotypical depictions of Mexicans and inaccurate representation of undocumented immigrants in America. The large advance Cummins received raised questions about who gets to profit from telling the story of the border crisis.Following the backlash, several US bookstores canceled appearances with the author. Among them was Left Bank Books, a local bookstore in St Louis, Missouri.“We didn’t want to create a big mess,’ Kris Kleindienst, the owner of Left Bank, told the . However, Kleindienst didn’t want to give Cummins a spotlight without including authentic Latinx voices at the 25 January event.There also were legitimate safety concerns, Kleindienst said. Amid the controversy, Cummins received threats. People left aggressive comments on the Facebook page of the event. (Days after Left Bank canceled its event, American Dirt’s publisher Flatiron Books canceled the rest of Cummins’ book tour, citing safety concerns).Kleindienst said the outrage surrounding American Dirt is much larger than other controversial books the store has promoted. “This is unprecedented. It’s ripped open a festering sore in this country and made us finally have a conversation about what’s going on at the border,” Kleindienst said.The San Francisco bookstore City Lights confirmed it was not selling American Dirt, but declined to comment further on its decision.Green Apple Books, a local bookstore chain in San Francisco, employed a different tactic, displaying works by Latinx authors next to American Dirt. “That’s how we usually prefer to deal with a situation like this,” said Kevin Ryan, the co-owner of Green Apple. Would his store consider not selling American Dirt? “Deciding not to sell something is a big decision. One we don’t take lightly.”“We should be making sure the right people are getting something from this book,” Sherman-Nurick told the . “Our store should not be profiting from this whole controversy.”Kleindienst, the Left Bank Books owner, said many booksellers feel Flatiron Books should have done more to prepare bookstores for the attention and scrutiny American Dirt events were poised to receive. She hopes publishers learn a lesson and not only make smarter decisions about the books they acquire and heavily promote, but also how they support bookstores during controversy. “We are, oftentimes, expected to navigate the rockiness on our own.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfcbc478b03a61918bbfa8ac2759d903a1e8be82/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4199a0897dec54ef51e37569f803842d","title":"isabel greenberg glass town graphic novel charlotte bronte","story":"With Glass Town, the former Observer graphic short story prize winner explores the sisters’ fictional childhood landscape•Read an extract from Glass TownWhen Isabel Greenberg’s third graphic novel begins, it is July 1849. A young woman with a pugnacious jaw and a pair of unflattering spectacles on the end of her nose is striding out across a moor, oblivious both to the damp underfoot – the book’s first frame shows nothing more than a ladylike boot splashing through a puddle – and to the looming clouds above. Tiny in her bonnet beneath the vast, steely sky, this woman, for all her determination, strikes the reader as terribly alone.And she is alone, for this is the writer Charlotte Brontë. In the course of the past year, she has lost all three of her living siblings – Anne, Branwell and Emily – to tuberculosis she is still deep in grief. But then something strange happens. No sooner has she spread a blanket over the heather, and taken off her bonnet, than a dashing fellow suddenly appears beside her. He is not dressed for the moor. He wears a top hat, a scarlet cravat, dazzling white breeches and, somewhat incongruously, a pair of sunglasses. Who is he? Is this peacock with the spiky, rock-star hair real, or is he a figment of her imagination?In fact, he’s the latter – though as Greenberg points out, in the case of the Brontës, reality and the life of the imagination are sometimes difficult to separate. “In Charlotte’s diaries, there’s a bit where Anne and Emily are sitting at the kitchen table, talking about baking bread or something, and then they just switch into what’s happening in Gondal as casually as if they’re discussing the weather,” she says.Gondal was Anne and Emily’s imaginary world: an island in the north Pacific. Like Angria, the rival land invented by Charlotte and Bramwell, the older of the siblings, it had its roots in the Glass Town Confederacy, a realm that was inspired by the 12 wooden soldiers given to them as small children by their father, Patrick.Charlotte’s moorland visitor, we will soon discover, is Charles Wellesley, the brother of Arthur Wellesley, AKA Zamorna, the most important character in Angria – and out on the moor, he now asks her if she wouldn’t like to visit Glass Town, which is all that remains of these lands since she abandoned them, for one final time. What follows is a wild journey: an odyssey that takes in both Glass Town and Haworth, the West Yorkshire village where the Brontës grew up. In Greenberg’s hands, it is both comic and tragic a feat of narrative concision that is by turns dreamy, and gritty. If it’s a fantastic comic – and I think that it is – then it’s also one of the best books about the Brontës’ juvenilia ever written.Has she always been interested in the Brontës? “I read Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights at school,” Greenberg says, when we meet one cold winter morning. “I liked them, but I wouldn’t say I was obsessed. I didn’t know anything about their juvenilia until much later, but when I did finally hear about it, it interested me immediately from a world-building perspective. They were so young – and the sheer quantity and scale of it. It’s Tolkien-level.” Determined to dedicate her next book to it, she travelled to Yorkshire, hoping to see the tiny handmade books the Brontë children devoted to Gondal and Angria (they’re in the collection of the Parsonage Museum, where they once lived). “The first time, I didn’t have the proper paperwork. But the second time, I lucked out: a visiting American academic had them out already, so I was able to see a couple at last.” However, it was visiting Haworth itself that was most inspiring: reaching it across the moors on a local bus the lingering sense of isolation. “It’s a special place. Not even all the tea shops can change that.”Back in London, she read and read. “I got into a pickle. The more I researched, the more attached to the source material I got. Eventually, I had to stop and make some choices. The biggest decision was to choose which of their worlds to go for. My gut was to go for Gondal, with its amazing female characters.” She took the characters she thought most interesting, and some of the details of their plots. But thereafter, she freewheeled, adapting and embellishing the narratives as she thought fit. “Zamorna is as he appears in their stories, but the connections between the other characters, and the timeline, are my own. The Brontës were children of the empire, and there is a lot of Victorian racism in there, so I gave one of their black characters a more empowered story.”Greenberg, who is 31, studied illustration at Brighton University, and for an MA in animation at the Royal College of Art. She now teaches on the illustration course at Camberwell College of Arts, London. She still believes, however, that she owes her start as a writer of long-form comics to the ObserverCape graphic short story prize, which she won in 2011. This, she says, made her career. “I felt so lucky. At the time, I didn’t have any commissions. I was working as a nanny. Winning it changed everything. It got me my first agent, and my first publisher.”Her first graphic novel, The Encyclopedia of Early Earth, which came out in 2013, was nominated for two Eisner awards, and won the best book category at the British comic awards. Her second, The One Hundred Nights of Hero, made the New York Times graphic books bestseller list. What makes this all the more gratifying is that she didn’t grow up reading comics. “I didn’t know writing them was even something you could do,” she says. “I wanted to write, and I wanted to draw, that’s all.” For Glass Town, she completely changed her working practice, switching from black ink to pencil and charcoal: “a scratchier finish”. Having relied heavily on narration in her first two books, this one also makes more use of the comic form – something she would like to play around with in the future.Comics, she notes, are becoming more mainstream, readers coming to understand that they are a medium, not a genre. But for those who create them, they’re also all-engrossing the sheer labour involved is incredible. Thanks to this, she says she will always have to teach, and take on other illustration projects (she’s currently finishing a children’s book). “They’re never going to be the only thing I do,” she says, with a rueful smile. “Unless someone wants to buy the movie rights.” But this hardly matters. When she’s at her drawing board, they’re what she loves to do best of all.• Glass Town is published by Jonathan Cape (£18.99). To order a copy go to bookshop.

His bleak but scintillating book about race, We Were Eight Years in Power (2017), was a passionate collection of essays focusing on the sharp isions and overpowering emotions – from uplifting to ugly – that surfaced when Barack Obama became his country’s first black president. What white America fears most is black competence, Coates reasoned. Black excellence turns that fear into paranoia.Coates alerted readers to his talents two years earlier with the National Book award-winning Between the World and Me, a letter to his then 14-year-old son in which he warned about the perils of being African American. It was acclaimed by Toni Morrison, who celebrated Coates as the long-awaited heir to James Baldwin.Like Baldwin, Coates’s elegant nonfiction is haunted by the dark legacy of the American civil war. Little wonder, then, that slavery is the subject of his first novel.In common with Colson Whitehead’s The Underground Railroad, which draws on the life of Harriet Jacobs, an enslaved woman who hid for years in a low-ceilinged attic in which she couldn’t stand, The Water Dancer makes use of a number of real-life narratives. For one, there are parallels between the protagonist, Hiram, and the great abolitionist Frederick Douglass. Born in Maryland to a raped, enslaved woman whom he barely remembered after she was sold to another plantation, Douglass was a child prodigy, famous for his extraordinary biography Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, which told of his escape from slavery to become a great orator and an advocate for emancipation.Born on an antebellum plantation in Virginia named Lockless – whose community consists of the Quality (masters and mistresses) and the Tasked (enslaved) – Hiram is also the son of a slave master and slave, Rose, who is sold “down river”, leaving Hiram orphaned. Like Douglass, he is an exceptional child who has a gift for remembering everything. Everything, that is, except his own mother.As a cultural analyst, Coates is noted for his stylish prose, but in The Water Dancer the writing is spare. Hiram considers slavery “a kind of fraud, which paints its executors as s at the gate, staving off African savagery”. Sophia, a fellow slave, who admires Hiram’s intellect, dreams of escaping with him: “We could go together. You are read and know of things far past Lockless.”The book’s title refers to an African folk tradition where women on plantations balanced jugs of water on their heads while dancing. In Coates’s telling, theirs is a ritual of remembrance, of the possibility of slipping the shackles of slavery, if not bodily then spiritually. Lockless’s dancers are the reincarnations of those captured Africans who managed to flee the slave ships by wading into the water “to sing and dance as they walked, that the water-goddess brought ’em here, and the water goddess would take ’em back home”. This fable-like quality informs much of the book.As The Water Dancer progresses, it is increasingly shaped by the real-life saga of William Still’s The Underground Railroad Records (an 1872 book comprising the stories of slaves who escaped). Coates’s focus is on the strategies of the network of abolitionists who engineered passage of the enslaved from the “coffins” of southern plantations across the Mason-Dixon line to freedom in the north. Having nearly drowned and been buried under a river, dug himself out, been recaptured and escaped again, Hiram joins forces with another character, the actual abolitionist Harriet Tubman, whose daring rescues feature prominently. Like Tubman, Hiram is blessed with a supernatural gift called “conduction”, triggered by powerful emotions and enabling him to travel great distances.The description of conduction is The Water Dancer’s greatest strength – the author’s method of fictionalising the mystery of Tubman’s out-of-body hallucinations.During episodes of stress (especially when helping others escape plantations), Hiram, too, is a passenger in his own body. Distances collapse as the Underground Railroad agents travel back in time and jump into the future, the “jump” achieved by the power of their stories: “It pulls from all our lives and all of our losses. All that feeling is called up, and on the strength of our remembrances, we are moved,” says Hiram.In The Water Dancer Coates is attempting his own conduction – to make the terrible past real for modern readers. As Hiram says at the end of the book: “To forgive was irrelevant, but to forget was death.”Colin Grant’s most recent book is Homecoming: Voices of the Windrush Generation (Jonathan Cape). • The Water Dancer by Ta-Nehisi Coates is published by Hamish Hamilton (£16.99).

Ovarian tissue storage! And not only for fertility-related reasons. Who’d want a menopause? “Will you be ready?” the website challenges. “You never know what the future holds, so freeze the biological clock and prepare for the future.”For many women, alas, the offer will be empty. The ProFaM clockstopping technique requires young ovarian tissue and costs up to £7,000 for removal (storage and reinstatement extra). “Age 25-30 is optimal,” the doctors say. Once reinstalled, the tissue is supposed to function as “natural HRT”.The average age at menopause is 51. To defer the menopause – theoretically at least, via this method – women need to pay for an operation before they’ve thought about middle age, or experienced its social construction as an affliction, or, probably, considered volunteering as guinea pigs in non-essential experiments. Nobody knows how long, how well or how safely thawed ovarian tissue will function once it’s replaced in a much older body, because it hasn’t been done yet.“We believe we are now in a position to offer the opportunity to postpone the menopause” seems to be the closest ProFaM gets to closing the argument for costly speculative surgery. It’s a bit like persuading very thin people to pay for an untrialled weight loss technique they might not need for a quarter of a century, if ever. And what if, one day, “menopausal” ceased being an insult? Meanwhile, ProFaM needs healthy – and affluent – young women to pay up.Step forward Savannah Fishel, 22, the daughter of Dr Simon Fishel, a co-founder of ProFaM. In BBC interviews that may prefigure the corpororation’s new non-inquisitorial style, father and daughter last week together made the case for using Fishel ovary-harvesting services, presumably, in Ms Fishel’s case, at a discount.“I’ve seen menopausal problems manifest themselves in family members,” Ms Fishel offered, by way of objective scientific reasoning. The technique sounded, the BBC reporter hazarded, a bit experimental? One for the fertility expert. “It’s experimental with a group of patients we want it to benefit,” Mr Fishel said. “But in its own element, each element of it is not experimental, no.” You couldn’t help wondering at this point if we haven’t all been a bit unfair to Gwyneth Paltrow. Is vaginal steaming so much more disreputable than minced ovary with still indeterminate menopause-postponing powers?It was left to another doctor, Dr Melanie Davies of Fertility Preservation UK, commenting separately, to confirm that Fishel’s technique is unproven, to warn against “healthy women going through surgery that would not otherwise be needed”, and make the case, instead, for conventional hormone replacement therapy.More usefully for the Fishels, the BBC illustrated its report with one of those stock pictures of a tormented middle-aged woman who has stepped away from normal, happy people into private, menopausal hell. Unless Savannah Fishel’s dynastic loyalty can substitute for peer-reviewed studies, sustained aversion to the menopause is likely to be as critical to ProFaM’s prosperity as are misogyny and gerontophobia to buccaneering aesthetic surgery, and the cultural pressure to reproduce to the sale of unpromising IVF.Conversely, too much awareness about the significant number of women who are either unafflicted or only temporarily troubled by the menopause – or immeasurably more affected by other life events – could be disastrous for a business posited on a narrative of female biological doom. There can’t be enough doom, or gloom, where no compelling argument exists. Have women realised, for instance, that female longevity is not the unqualified bonus they may have thought? “As women, for the first time in human history, are living so much longer in the post-fertile phase,” Fishel likes to argue, “they may be suffering much longer.”But perhaps women define suffering – and indeed their reasons for existing – differently? Though one in four women, as a study suggested, report severe menopausal symptoms, that suggests three out of four don’t. Some actively exult. US research suggests that their experience will relate to prevailing cultural attitudes. “In societies where age is more revered and the older woman is the wiser and better woman, menopausal symptoms are significantly less bothersome,” Yale’s Dr Mary Jane Minkin has said. Should young women, not knowing into which category they will fall, pay, insurance style, for future interventions they may not want?Mercifully for Fishel’s embryonic industry, a growing and welcome openness about the menopause seems to favour his version, in alighting predominantly on its potential to cause distress, as opposed to its potential – compared with other middle-aged afflictions – manageability. To hear Dawn Butler, before the election, advancing Labour’s case for dedicated menopause rooms and menopause leave, was to wonder why any woman should be expected to work through an enveloping fog of heat, mood changes, cognitive decline and misery. Not to mention why these arrangements should be more urgent than, say, carers’ leave or bereavement rooms.If Labour’s menopause policy did raise awareness, it probably did just as much to consolidate the view that this process is a scary, debilitating illness that regularly defies all treatment. Earlier media rejoicing about Fishel’s evidence-light scheme had already indicated the degree to which the menopause is pathologised as a relentless biological curse on women, who await their saviour.Whether it is ethical for UK clinicians, in the absence of long-term trials, to monetise this kind of thinking is for professional bodies to decide. Maybe private ovary-freezing is no less respectable than other offers of inessential but encouraged “self-optimising” surgery?As a lay person I would only add that one of the unexpected benefits of a post-fertile existence turns out to be the protection it offers against ambitious male gynaecologists."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee955a2f6605438799d680e77273d959b78b7d7f/0_232_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef56ac5fc79dc59dab1b78cc0c71e91b","title":"overwhelmed prague tries to limit airbnb to curb tourism","story":"Joining a battle already being waged by many other cities, the Czech capital’s mayor wants new laws to limit the lettings websiteFor decades, its mesmerising blend of baroque and gothic beauty was closed to mass tourism by the iron curtain that ided the communist east from the capitalist west during the cold war.Now Prague, which has gained an unenviable reputation as a destination for stag nights and pub crawls, has become the latest European city to propose a radical assault on Airbnb and other short-term letting platforms as over-tourism threatens to overwhelm it and drive out residents.Under plans pushed by the city’s liberal mayor, Zdeněk Hřib, property owners would be barred from leasing out entire flats except when it was their own home and they were temporarily vacating it. Tourists demanding Airbnb rentals would be limited instead to single rooms in accommodation where the owner also lived.Speaking to the Observer in his office in Prague’s new city hall – near the heart of the tourist district – Hřib, a member of the Pirate party, said the idea was the focal point of a scheme to “give Prague back to the people of Prague” and mitigate the negative effects of tourism.He said Airbnb’s growth had turned the city, once the capital of the Holy Roman Empire and later a jewel of the Habsburg monarchy, into a “distributed hotel” and that failure to regulate it was “eating the city from inside”.“In the past, you could limit the amount of tourists in the city simply by approving a certain number of hotels of certain capacity during the process of building permits,” said Hřib. “Now in Prague there is no possibility for the city to limit the accommodation capacity for tourists. The numbers are really critical.”Nearly 8 million tourists flocked to the city – total population, 1.3 million – in 2018, up from 2.6 million in 2000, numbers that are expected to keep rising and which Prague’s infrastructure and finances are ill-equipped to cope with.The increase has accelerated as Airbnb has consolidated its presence, transforming previously sleepy residential districts into busy zones characterised by foreign visitors with tell-tale wheeled suitcases in residential blocks.An impact report from the city’s institute of planning and development said the number of Airbnb outlets almost tripled from 5,537 in March 2016 to more than 13,000 in May 2018, representing a jump from 17,913 to 52,738 in the number of beds. Eighty per cent of available rentals are entire flats.The result has been an increase in noise and disturbance to long-term residents and soaring property values and rents that have priced locals out of the housing market. An average Prague resident needs to pay 14 times the annual salary excluding tax, housing, eating and clothing costs to buy a flat in the city, the mayor said.Meanwhile the council has faced a widening financial shortfall as the nominal local tax levied on owners, some of whom live outside the Czech Republic, often goes unpaid and fails to cover the costs of the growing strain on resources and services.“This is far beyond the original idea of the shared economy where you are supposed to let a tourist stay in your home, you cook the breakfast and you tell them something about your nice city,” Hřib said. “This is just a distributed hotel, where you abuse the comfort of other citizens in the city, the local residents, and seek your own profit at their expense.”The European court of justice recently ruled that platforms like Airbnb were “information society services” rather than estate agencies, making them harder to regulate.Hřib plans to overcome this by persuading the Czech regional development ministry to back legislation allowing local authorities to issue their own laws and decrees on short-term holiday lets according to local conditions. Similar efforts have previously failed, but the mayor insists that the growing awareness of Prague’s problem has generated enough political support for a law to pass.Apolena Rychlíková, a film-maker and journalist who has campaigned against the unfettered growth of short-term lettings, welcomed the city council’s proposal, “after five years of ignoring the problem”. She added: “As a resident of the centre of Prague, I feel like a stranger in my city every day. And I’m not alone.”Janek Rubeš, a creator of the Honest Guide, a YouTube channel documenting the effects of over-tourism in Prague, said Airbnb’s evolution had harmed the city’s neighbourhoods. “These Prague apartment blocks aren’t made for tourism. Tourists have different needs from locals,” he said.“They need a 24-hour reception, where they can get into buildings when they need to. It doesn’t work like that on Airbnb. It was a great idea at first, but not the way it is now.”Prague is not alone in its stand against Airbnb. Last month, the council joined 10 other cities - Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Bordeaux, Brussels, Krakow, Munich, Paris, Valencia and Vienna - in signing a letter calling on the European commission to update its laws. “These short-term rentals are primarily for tourists at the expense of locals and families who want to live and work in our cities,” the letter says.Some of the cities have imposed their own limits on the platform and similar outlets. In January 2019, Amsterdam tightened its rules on rental of entire homes to fewer than 30 days, from 60 days.In Palma, Mallorca, authorities went further, issuing a ban in 2018 against almost all short-term Airbnb-type rentals of flats on the island, after local residents had complained of a sharp rise in rents."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eeb08c60f73d8fb1554523080a4b39a4762099a4/0_98_908_545/master/908.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ce4742be5d3ca38f34947001fdf92f2","title":"supreme clothes burning youtube instagram","story":"YouTubers and Instagrammers are raking in views by burning or cutting up garments: ‘It triggers people’For some of Supreme’s most die-hard fans, the highly coveted garments exist solely in their closets.Supreme’s box-logo tees, the Birkin bags of skatewear, are treated with the sort of care and attention typically given to a wedding dress – vacuum sealed and tucked away for safekeeping. The protective impulse makes sense: Supreme’s hyped and limited collaborations often get flipped for 10 times their selling price, creating serious profit for resellers and casual fans alike.So why are Supreme fans filming themselves burning or destroying their tees with scissors and hot irons and posting the clips to YouTube and Instagram? This bizarre brand of content is self-consciously silly and plays like a 2020 update of MTV’s slapstick prank show Jackass. But are these savage, costly destructions an anti-capitalist statement, Gen-Z nihilism or simply a shameless play for clicks?“Any video with ‘Supreme’ in the title will get traffic,” says Gianmarco Garofalo, who recorded a video where he and his friends destroyed a Supreme x Louis Vuitton box-logo tee, worth over $1,000 in resell markets. “Destroying something that is worth so much, I think people find entertainment in that. They watch the videos because they can’t do it.”In one video, Tristan Wick, a 17-year-old from South Carolina, takes a sharpie to his Supreme x Damien Hirst tee (worth over $400 on resale markets) and scribbles “Nothing Matters” in skinny, large letters. In another, Eric Whiteback, known as “the Supreme Guy”, tie-dyes a rare camo-print tee, creating a one-of-a-kind design for himself. Whiteback has over 400,000 followers on Instagram (where he primarily posts his videos) and Wick has over 25,000 YouTube subscribers.Whiteback says he customizes and destroys his high-valued tees to remind people that, at the end of the day, they’re just clothes. “Too many people view their Supreme items as sacred – never taking off the tags and leaving the items in their closets for years,” he tells the . “I want to break that mold and do something fun, creative, and shocking.”Whiteback’s original creations are largely credited for feeding the ever-growing customizations trend in streetwear. However, Supreme-heads are ided over these DIY-designs, popularized by Whiteback, the YouTuber Marko Terzo, and others. Some call the alterations destruction, others view them as art.“A lot of people shame Whiteback for what he does,” Garofalo says, citing him as a major inspiration for his own videos. “It triggers people.”These creators can stand to lose a Supreme tee every now and then. Whiteback says he rakes in five figures each month through his social media activity. He also spends close to $20,000 on new Supreme products every month. “I know that sounds like a lot, but I don’t personally keep most of the product,” he admits. “It’s sort of a revolving door for me: I buy product, I shoot content with it, I sell it. If I kept everything I bought, the walls of my apartment would be closing in on me.”Product destruction videos are not new. Many of these Supreme destroyers cite the immense popularity of iPhone destruction videos – multiple clips receiving over 50m views – as inspiration.“What really sparked the idea for me with these videos is the ‘shock factor’ they produce,” says Wick, who films his videos after school. “I had never seen anybody on YouTube make videos destroying valuable pieces of streetwear. So I thought I would be the first to do that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c24d99bbc3fb669cfccb99f9925f8dc8679ed04c/0_482_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8983f6d6134f129f0cdafa4482c3f513","title":"a chocolate spread recipe and a foray in 90 per cent","story":"A light mousse and a dark bar to tickle your tastebudsMuch of these past seven days has been spent finding ways of using up the platoon of nutty chocolate spread jars, amassed after the testing of a few weeks ago.

Something in which to hide fragile fillings, such as feta cheese and thyme leaves, ricotta and lemon zest or pistachios and honey. A crust so fine it will shatter into thousands of pieces when tapped with a pastry fork, the layers of pastry held together with butter, almond paste or rosewater-scented syrup. Filo’s point is its crispness. As you crunch through the crackling crust, it is something to hear as much as to taste.Made of little more than flour, water, olive oil and a dash of vinegar to encourage the crucial crispness, the simple dough is enriched by brushing each layer with melted butter or oil. Making your own is a right old faff, and after a morning of mixing and rolling and cutting, the result will be no better than you can buy from the supermarket freezer.I often see recipes using 5 or 6 layers of pastry to wrap a tart or little parcel. The result is inevitably a wodge of uncooked dough at the bottom – 2 or 3 layers is enough for most things. The trick to getting a crisp base is to put a baking sheet in the oven to heat up first, before placing the tart or little parcels on it. The direct heat will work wonders on the texture of the pastry. It is something I do with most baking but is, I think, essential with filo. After all, crispness is pretty much all this pastry has.I do think the accompanying carrot and coriander sauce is perfect. It adds a clean, fresh note to the sweetness of the tart filling. Serves 4.For the sauce:Peel and finely chop the onion. Warm the olive oil in a large saucepan, add the chopped onion and cook for about 10 minutes until translucent. Peel and crush the garlic, add to the softened onion then stir in the mustard seeds and continue cooking until the onion is gold in colour.Put the cooked beetroot into the bowl of a food processor and blend to a thick purée. Blend in the garam masala, salt and pepper, then stir into the softened onions. Drain the chickpeas and add them to the beetroot, then set aside to cool.When the filling is cool, preheat the oven to 200Cgas mark 6. Place a baking sheet in the oven to heat up. Line a 20cm tart tin with a sheet of filo, letting it overhang the tin where necessary, brush it with olive oil then place a second sheet on top. Brush the second sheet with olive oil. Place a third sheet in the tart tin, at a slight angle to the others, brush with oil and place another sheet on top.Spoon the beetroot filling into the tart, gently smooth the surface, then loosely fold the overhanging pieces of pastry over the filling, leaving the centre open. Place the tart on the preheated baking sheet and leave to bake until golden and crisp, about 35 minutes. (If the pastry is browning too quickly, then cover lightly with a piece of silver foil.)To make the sauce coarsely grate the carrot and fold into the kefir with the chopped coriander. Serve with the warm tart.As you fold the pastry sheet around the filling it is essential to seal it securely. Use a little beaten egg for this and let the parcel sit for a while so there is no danger of it coming unwrapped in the fryer.

Place 2 heaped tbsp of the ricotta filling on to each square and pat into a short thick barrel. Brush the edges of the pastry with beaten egg, then fold the pastry over the filling as if you were wrapping up a present, pressing the edges firmly together.

It means each remain six points behind the west Londoners in the race for a Champions League berth before the winter break.Solskjær’s decision to field Fernandes from the start could be read as bold and pragmatic: Nemanja Matic’s suspension left the manager even lighter, as he joined Paul Pogba and Scott McTominay on the injury list. The club’s new signing had to wait some three minutes for a first touch, a clearance from United’s area. Wolves pressed via a João Moutinho free-kick, an Adama Traoré cross and a wild Romain Saïss shot that was hooked over.Fernandes was positioned as a 10 in Solskjær’s 4-2-3-1 and once United settled the impression was of a clever player who was involved with deft touches and bursts of movement. If this United side lack a feisty edge the way Fernandes walloped Moutinho with a tackle that left him requiring treatment showed how. The pass moments later that put Anthony Martial in behind illustrated the No 18’s silkier side. “You can see he’s a top player,” the United manager told Sky Sports. “First half he was getting the ball into feet, Bruno wants players moving in front of him and we didn’t move enough so we moved him further back to give him more of the ball. He’s going to be a top addition.”Wolves, though, have noticed how shaky United are under the aerial ball. Twice Moutinho hit in corners from the right and twice the home side struggled, Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelöf and Aaron Wan-Bissaka all floundering. The next time Wolves attacked United’s defending became near-comedic. Diogo Jota was allowed to amble around deep in David De Gea’s area, Wan-Bissaka looking on as if he was seated in the Stretford End. The right-back and his team were lucky Jota spooned his cross but this was another warning.The closest United had gone by the half-hour was a Maguire shot from 30 yards that missed badly to Rui Patrício’s left. When Traoré was teed up before De Gea the wide man had to hit the target, but his effort lacked composure and United’s No 1 watched the ball sail past his left post.As the interval approached Fernandes had a golden chance to pen a headline start to his United career. Luke Shaw rolled the ball to the 25-year-old Portuguese just outside the box. He connected cleanly but could fire only into Rui Patrício’s hands. The half ended with Traoré outmuscling Maguire, who had to be assisted by Fred.Solskjær sent United out for the second half in a rejigged form. Fernandes now sat alongside Fred, Juan Mata became the 10, Andreas Pereira went to the left and Daniel James the right. The game still lacked rhythm, though. Pereira’s tendency to misplace and mistime passes sold Wan-Bissaka and Maguire short and Fernandes had to race back to defend when he too ceded possession.A planned walk-out on 68 minutes in protest at the Glazers’ ownership of United did not materialise. Ed Woodward was not present at Old Trafford five days after his house was attacked. Fernandes’s next act was to pull down Raúl Jiménez and be booked. Better was the new boy’s curving free-kick that Rui Patrício needed two attempts to clutch a little later. So, too, to a Mata shot that nearly crept inside the left post. De Gea saved from Jiménez, then Maguire threw himself at a Matt Doherty effort as Wolves pressed and Diogo Dalot went close with a late header."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/480b6302dcbdb97637399a4c15c23e9289cb758c/0_44_2555_1533/master/2555.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26cc30949a932b546533b4b09d5f4e36","title":"pioneering reds the reds jurgen klopp liverpool pressing unlikely origin","story":"The dominant style of football’s hyper-capitalistic age has its origins in the unlikeliest of placesA training field near Ostfildern, in the forest south-east of Stuttgart. It’s February 1983, and local sixth-tier side Viktoria Backnang are playing a friendly against Valeriy Lobanovskyi’s Dynamo Kyiv, who are wintering at Sportschule Ruit. For Viktoria’s young player-manager, Ralf Rangnick, it is a revelatory experience. When the ball goes out of play for a throw-in early on, Rangnick counts the Dynamo players, half-believing they had sneaked an extra man on to the pitch. They hadn’t, but such was the ferocity of their pressing that it felt as if they had. And so a seed was planted that has had a profound impact on football’s tactical development.Dynamo kept coming to Ruit and Rangnick, who is now the head of sport and development at Red Bull, kept studying them. As his career developed he became part of a group of coaches fascinated by the possibilities of zonal marking and pressing, radical ideas in a Germany dominated by the belief that football was about inidual battles, courage and vocal leadership.Arrigo Sacchi’s Milan became a huge influence. Helmut Gross, a structural engineer who had essentially taught himself tactical theory, became a close friend of Rangnick’s and together they implemented pressing through Stuttgart’s youth ranks.Volker Finke had remarkable success at Freiburg, leading them to third in the Bundesliga in 1995, beating Bayern 5-1 on the way. Economic issues led to their decline, and Finke was largely dismissed as a crank, but a revolution was gradually brewing.Wolfgang Frank had been a striker for Eintracht Braunschweig in the 70s but his biggest influence was Sacchi. When he was appointed coach of struggling Mainz in the second ision in September 1995, he set about applying the Italian’s methods.It was hard, boring work, learning positioning, walking through prearranged patterns on the training field. “But,” said the team’s centre-back Jürgen Klopp, “we thought if Gullit and Van Basten had to learn that at Milan, we could put up with it as well.”Klopp has taken those ideas to new heights, finding at Liverpool a club whose previous best days were based on a pressing game (albeit one quite different in tone from the modern version). His version of pressing – dynamic and aggressive – is now the pre-eminent tactical mode, prompting evolution even in Pep Guardiola, whose press-and-possess football at Barcelona had laid the groundwork for this development.Almost everybody at the highest level presses hard and high now, from Antonio Conte to Erik ten Hag, Mauricio Pochettino to Jorge Jesus, Christophe Galtier to Jorge Sampaoli. There is a generation of coaches schooled in the Bundesliga developing that pressing game: Julian Nagelsmann, Rangnick’s successor as coach of RB Leipzig, is the highest profile, but the group also includes Lucien Favre and Marco Rose in Germany and Ralph Hasenhüttl (who came between Rangnick’s two spells at Leipzig), Daniel Farke and Thomas Frank in England.Germany, having resisted pressing for so long, has seemingly adopted it wholesale, the excitement of the new, the absence of preconceptions, allowing it to be taken to new heights. But in terms of how top-level European football has evolved the recent pattern is unusual.In attempting to trace trends, there is a danger always of oversimplification. The development of tactics is not linear, and it is subject to a range of forces – economic, scientific and cultural – as well as the input of inspired iniduals. But there is something inherently dialectical about it.One team plays in a certain way, others copy it, others work out a way to combat it, that new mode becomes hegemonic until a way of countering that is found and so the game changes again.It is not cyclical, in part because each step is underpinned by knowledge of what went before and because external developments – leaps forward in nutrition to improve fitness or computer technology to improve analysis, for instance – open up new possibilities.But there was a time when the dominant mode in top-level European football seemed to oscillate between the attacking and the defensive. The freeform iniduality of Real Madrid and Benfica gave way to catenaccio, which in turn was supplanted by Total Football and then the pragmatic pressing of the years of English domination.The picture blurs a little after that, as globalisation takes hold and the advent of the Champions League begins the movement towards the modern superclub era. But still, the paradigm just about holds: Sacchi’s aggressive pressing followed by the more cautious style of Marcelo Lippi, then the coming of 4-2-3-1 and the reintroduction of dribblers before the last age of attrition with José Mourinho, Rafa Benítez and Greece’s victory at the 2004 Euros. Since when we’ve had Guardiola and the triumph of the pass before this era of high-intensity transition.Which breaks the pattern. This is an attacking mode following another attacking mode. And perhaps that is what is happening. Perhaps the commercial imperative to produce excitement, coupled with the domestic domination of the superclubs and various law changes designed to encourage a more open game, has produced a world in which the defensive impulse is diminished.But within that recognition, it is perhaps worth acknowledging that the attackingdefensive ide was always misleading, morally loaded terminology. Louis van Gaal, for instance, tends to use the term “attacking” simply to mean having the ball, but there are many who would regard his possession-based style as sterile. Or think of the 2010 World Cup, when Jogi Löw’s counterattacking Germany were more overtly thrilling than Vicente del Bosque’s possession-driven Spain.This is the paradox of pressing: in seeking to win the ball back, it falls into the category that has habitually been regarded as defending, and yet it is extremely proactive in the way it reacts to the internal shapes and rhythms of the opponent.It is, in other words, the perfect form of defending, thrilling, dynamic and percussive, for a world that demands constant entertainment for its television audience. And that, perhaps, is the biggest paradox of all: that the prevailing style in football’s hyper-capitalistic age was inspired by a Soviet team under an overtly Communist coach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8adbafa13df3beb1dd61f6ff187e3532556d439/0_0_6246_3748/master/6246.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b7be414563553090e2390b09460f795","title":"so i got an amazon echo but can alexa get my life together","story":"Looking to streamline his life, writer Phil Samba bought an Amazon Echo Dot to see if the smart speaker could provide some assistance … Like every millennial, I’m obsessed with self improvement. Also like every millennial, I somehow constantly manage to never do any of the things I need to do to self-improve. I’m hoping that technology can help me get it together – so I got an Amazon Echo 3rd generation, with Alexa.The Echo Dot comes in a small box, which I open up to reveal a small speaker, just larger in diameter than a drinks coaster, but small enough to hold in your hand. Aesthetically, it’s very futuristic – at the top within the light ring are four tiny microphones and four buttons – volume up, volume down, mute and Alexa. It feels smooth around the sides with adaptor and aux ports at the back.Mine is heather grey, but you can get them in charcoal, plum and sandstone too – you can even get one with a clock to show you the time. There’s an information document, a charger, a user manual and a list of commands to try, such as: “Alexa, set a 10-minute timer” and “Alexa, add toilet paper to my shopping list”.To set up, I need to be connected to my wifi and download the Amazon Alexa app on to my smartphone. Set-up is easy, all within the app, and takes about five to 10 minutes – but if you struggle, there are a million and one tutorials on YouTube for you to follow and a dedicated Echo help page.There are a ton of things you can do with the Echo straight out of the box, such as setting alarms and asking it trivia questions. To unlock even more value, you can add skills via the Alexa smartphone app or just by using your voice.I like to tell people I’d be fitter if I had more time to go to the gym, safe in the knowledge that I don’t actually have the time. Now I have no excuse. I never thought Alexa would be able to help me exercise in any way, but I was wrong. The Body Coach skill allows me to work out as Joe Wicks, the Body Coach, keeps me motivated with cries of: “You’ll smash it!” It has seven 15-minute, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts to help you burn fat when you’re short on time, including marching, star jumps, squats, push-ups and crunches – and that’s just lesson one. I can’t say I’m at my target weight yet, but it’s definitely helping me get more regular exercise in.Learning a new language can be quite daunting but with the Translated skill it no longer has to be. I ask Alexa to teach me how to say any word or phrase in Spanish, and Translated reads it out so I can learn how to say it myself. I can even ask the skill to slow down or repeat the translation until I’m happy I’ve nailed it. I’ve already learned how to introduce myself: Me llamo Phil! I’m hoping that a few minutes a day practising while cooking or cleaning can really make me el experto.I often struggle to get to sleep but Sleep and Relaxation Sounds is excellent at resolving this. It has hundreds of ambient sounds that can be used to help with meditation or lull you into a state of complete relaxation. Once the skill is open, I just say: “Alexa, help me sleep”, or “Alexa, play heavy rain”, and I’m zoning out in no time listening to the downpour.My flatmate has an Echo, so we use Drop In – an inbuilt, two-way, intercom-like feature that connects two Alexa-enabled devices together once permissions are enabled. It’s perfect for letting my housemate on the top floor know that dinner is ready. All I had to do was say: “Alexa, drop in on the attic room”, and I can immediately communicate with my flatmate without walking up the steps.It turns out playing a game with a speaker is actually a lot of fun. I try out Twenty Questions: you think of any animal, mineral, music or vegetable and the skill asks 20 questions that you can answer, aiming to work it out in 20 questions or fewer. I play with Beyoncé’s 2016 single Formation – of course – and Alexa gets it in 10 questions. Impressive! You can also play a variety of other games, such as Deal or No Deal and Pointless.Alexa is a lot of fun, but, importantly, she’s really handy at helping you with those small tasks that can take up time or easily be forgotten. It can play music, tell the time, give you news briefings and weather forecasts, check traffic and so much more. Most surprisingly, it helped me to begin a brand new fitness journey. I’m interested in adding some smart tech soon to make it more powerful. I could turn lights on and off, control TVs, open garage doors and change the temperature. I’m excited to continue exploring all its capabilities.Learn more about what you can do with Alexa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2b753a70bdde95c4320c7cfcc908de85e9c123a/388_860_3416_2049/master/3416.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26757706ce7fb5a95c3ee9f2ba07d2a9","title":"one is a great guy the other good in bed who do i choose mariella frostrup","story":"Neither sounds like a long-term prospect so as long as you’re not making promises you can’t keep, why not enjoy them both for the time being, says Mariella FrostrupThe dilemma Having been single for some time, two men have recently come into my life. Personality-wise, one is everything I want – fun, silly and intellectual. We clicked from the start. However, the sex has been odd, stilted and a bit awkward. I am attracted to him, love kissing him, but the chemistry isn’t there. I am wondering if it’s nerves and might get better. He mentioned his ex didn’t have a high sex drive and they were in an almost sexless relationship, so he could be “out of practice”.The other guy, who I’m seeing more on the side, is really good in bed. There’s an intense sexual chemistry between us, very primal and instinctive. It’s a strange dynamic, though, as we hardly speak. He comes round and we jump into bed. I don’t know him at all.I’m trying to go with my head and focus on the first guy, because this could be a relationship with legs. At the same time, when he’s not there, I can’t help reaching for my phone and asking the other to come round. I don’t want a relationship with him – at least I think I don’t. But the sex is so good. I think I know how to resolve this – cut out the “sex” guy – but it’s easier said than done.Mariella replies There is another option. It might seem greedy, but how about you stall for a while and keep them both? As anyone who’s “settled down” will tell you, putting all your eggs in one basket may be tidier, but it leaves little room for surprises. When we make investments we’re encouraged to ersify and I think the same can be true when you’re trawling for a partner. All varieties of prospective candidate will wind up in your net and it’s only as you dispense with the throwaways that you’ll uncover your prize.Looking for a lover for keeps rather than just for kicks means working out not just what you want – the non-negotiables – but also what you really don’t. Such wisdom is rarely purely instinctive and comes from hands-on experience. You’ve managed to narrow down your desires to two choices, each of whom has something you fancy. Until you stumble on a man who has it all, why not just take pleasure in your current bounty? So long as you’re not making promises you won’t keep, you’re not damaging anyone in the process. If you are frank about your desire to keep things uncomplicated with both of them, then no one can say they were misled. I appreciate it’s not a long-term solution, but it takes the heat off for the moment.Having been single for plenty of my first four decades I know how desperately you start longing for a more permanent arrangement. Cohabitation, at its most fundamental, means you don’t always have to carry your cleanser, your toothbrush and a spare pair of knickers in your handbag. Auditioning prospective partners definitely loses its allure when it becomes serious – and it’s all too easy to get to a point where you are grabbing at anyone who’s upright and passes close enough by. That’s not the way any of us makes the best choices, and I’m worried that it’s the position from which you are trying to make this one.Both these guys sound worthy of a dalliance, but anything more long-term would, I suspect, run into difficulty. Comparing a man who inspires you intellectually and makes you laugh with a guy who fulfils all your horizontal desires means you’re not comparing like with like. So, whoever you choose, you’ll be hankering after the assets of the other. At present you have plenty of quantity, but neither man is of the quality to sustain a longer-term arrangement. It’s not the end of the world. At some point I daresay you’ll tire of the compromise required with both and at least one of them will tire of feeling inadequate. With choice comes comparisons and nobody can possibly tick all your boxes, so it’s as good a time as any to evaluate what you can’t live without. Panicking that you’ll never find the perfect partner can cause you to overlook inconvenient details. It’s a good thing to be less tolerant, but not when you start to accept the unacceptable. You don’t know yet whether you can coax the sexy beast from your damaged companion or whether lover-boy has hidden intellectual depths. I dare say if you read back your own letter you’ll come to the same conclusion as me – that neither justifies sporting a Mr Right tattoo.If you could amalgamate your two lovers you’d have the ideal man but, sadly, that’s not an option. Perhaps the answer is to lighten up on your quest a bit? You’ve got two men who, between them, fulfil your needs and I can’t help thinking that’s better than one who doesn’t! How about you just try and enjoy things as they are for a little while. I’m the first person to argue that when it comes to making a long-term choice we all need to be prepared to make compromises, but sometimes it’s nice just to slip into cruise control and enjoy the ride.• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

She stuck around to say hello afterwards, as did the actor Brie Larson, who proved herself to be, in Olsen’s assessment, “super down-to-earth and really normal and just chill”.Miley Cyrus, meanwhile, called up ahead of one LA gig and was duly granted a parking space, her own green room and a prime viewing position at the side of the stage. “It was really sweet,” Olsen recalls. “She took selfies with everybody, with my record in her mouth. I was like: ‘This is so stupid!’ It was a fun time.”You’d think the Missouri-born singer-songwriter, who had built up a passionate following but was still at a remove from the mainstream, would have been gratified by all this starry attention. But Olsen, who has a bone-dry sense of humour, which she expresses in perfect deadpan, recalls the surge of interest that followed My Woman with a raised eyebrow. “There were a lot of people coming out of the woodwork going: ‘I loved the My Woman record.’ I’m like: ‘Yeah…’” She affects to look supremely unmoved. “‘I’ve made records before.’”By then, Olsen had been putting out music for the best part of a decade. She released her first solo EP in 2010 and followed it with an album of raw, acoustic folk songs entitled Half Way Home. On 2014’s Burn Your Fire for No Witness, she shifted up a gear, embracing the buzz of electric guitars and giving full vent to her extraordinary, multifaceted voice. The NME gave the record 910 and called it “sublime”, while Pitchfork, rounding up the best albums of the past decade in December, ranked it at No 26.But it was My Woman, her third full-length, that brought Olsen to a wider audience, breaking the Billboard top 50 and landing her high-profile festival slots at Glastonbury and Primavera. In an era when pop careers go stratospheric on the strength of a single track, such a gradual rise seems positively old-fashioned – but that’s only fitting for an artist who takes much of her musical inspiration, along with a penchant for beehive hairstyles and sequinned dresses, from the middle decades of the 20th century.Last October, Olsen released All Mirrors, her biggest, boldest album to date. A brooding, synth-laden opus that harnesses the full firepower of a 12-piece string section, it has been universally acclaimed – for Olsen’s risk-taking as much as the shimmering beauty of her arrangements. “It’s an album that keeps taking ostensibly recognisable musical forms and twisting them out of shape into something challenging and intriguing,” wrote the ’s Alexis Petridis.We meet in Lisbon, where Olsen has just kicked off a three-week European tour to promote the album, culminating with three English dates and a Valentine’s Day finale in Glasgow. Last night at Capitólio, a cuboid art deco building in the city’s theatre district, Olsen and her six-piece band made a heroic effort to reproduce the orchestral swoon of All Mirrors in a live setting. The thousand or so audience members may not have noticed a few rough edges in the performance, but Olsen felt the need to account for it. “I’m feeling a little loose tonight,” she confessed at one point in the set. “We haven’t played together for a month.”The next morning, when we meet at a kiosk on Praça das Flores, last night’s niggles are still playing on her mind. I try to reassure her by saying that slightly imperfect live shows are often more interesting than fully polished ones, but I’m not certain this has the desired effect.It probably doesn’t help that she’s a little bleary-eyed from post-show birthday celebrations – Olsen turned 33 yesterday and her band marked it by lighting candles in a plateful of Portuguese custard tarts. “We had a nightcap afterwards and then I realised it was three o’clock,” she winces as I order her an emergency cappuccino.We retreat to a quieter part of the square, away from the traffic, and settle on a weather-beaten bench where Olsen chats freely about the pitfalls of touring and the occasional excesses of her fans, a number of whom have had her face tattooed on their bodies (“That’s really weird to me,” she says). In person, she is warm, funny – and impressively composed, considering the lack of sleep. She tells me she felt nervous last night, but on stage Olsen struck me as imperturbable, even when the entire room interrupted her to sing happy birthday.Unlike many musicians, she doesn’t seem to mind discussing the (often very intimate) experiences that feed into her songwriting. Later, as we talk about the painful genesis of All Mirrors, I ask if she ever finds herself thinking, in the middle of a full-blown romantic crisis, that she might get some good material from it.“Oh yeah,” she says matter-of-factly. “And I think that anyone who dares to date an artist or a writer shouldn’t be surprised if they end up in their art in some form.”Does she ever get people saying: “That was about me, wasn’t it?”“I’ve had people ask, and then I say: ‘Huh.’” Long pause. “‘It’s interesting that you think that.’” She deploys her finest withering stare. “‘Hmm… I do care about you but… No. It has nothing to do with you.’”All Mirrors contains plenty of material to get ex-partners in a lather, but right now Olsen’s concerns are focused on the tour ahead. It can be tough going, she says. You don’t know when your next laundry opportunity will be. You end up drinking terrible coffee at motorway service stations. After eight solid weeks on the road in late 2016, she says: “I was not fun to be around. I was drinking a lot. And I just felt so responsible for everyone’s happiness.”Learning hard lessons, and taking charge of her life to minimise future bitterness, is one of the central themes of the latest album. After My Woman came out, as Miley Cyrus et al were queuing up to show their love, Olsen went through a painful breakup with a boyfriend she would rather not name. Around the same time, she started reassessing old friendships that were causing her more grief than happiness.“I spent a lot of time feeling really bitter and disappointed about the way people in my life saw me or interpreted me,” she says. “For me, All Mirrors is about letting go of toxic relationships, and also forgiving yourself for making mistakes, and not expecting that everyone is measuring you the way you’re measuring yourself. And if some people are, do you really need them around?”This subject is blown up to near-operatic proportions on All Mirrors’s opening track, Lark, in which Olsen lets rip at a partner who professes his devotion even as he moves to smother her creative ambitions. “You say you love Every single part,” she sings over a cascade of wailing strings. “What about my dreams? What about the heart?”Olsen’s dream of making music, and the single-minded focus she applied to it, arrived early. Adopted aged three by a couple who had fostered her soon after her birth, she grew up in St Louis, a midwestern city she remembers as “kind of depressing”. Her family were poor, relying on her father’s income from the car manufacturer Chrysler, but she had access to guitar and piano lessons – “and I did end up going to rock shows at a really young age,” she says, “so that was fun”.Her adoptive parents, who already had seven children, were much older – they are now in their 70s and 80s – and Olsen recalls searching for ways to bridge the generation gap. “I started listening to music from the time they grew up in,” she says (the influence of artists such as Patsy Cline and Roy Orbison is often discerned in her work). “I was trying to understand my parents a little bit and think about what they would have been like at my age.”She also began making music of her own. “I had a little Panasonic handheld tape recorder that I would take everywhere,” she says. “And I was pretty private about it. My mom would say: ‘I heard you working on a song, that sounds nice.’ And I’d be like” – she adopts a stern expression – “‘Please don’t listen. I’m working on it. It’s not done yet.’”Moving to Chicago aged 20, she enrolled in and dropped out of a massage therapy course, released an EP on cassette, and fell in with folk eccentric Will Oldham, who recruited her to perform in his covers band the Babblers and sing backing vocals for his Bonnie “Prince” Billy alias.By the time she released her debut album, Olsen’s voice seemed fully formed: she sang about death and betrayal with an intimacy that made her listeners feel like she was confiding in them directly. But with each subsequent record her sound took an unexpected leap. Whereas Burn Your Fire fizzed with a lo-fi rock energy, its successor was more polished, more immediate, veering towards full-on pop on Shut Up Kiss Me, still Olsen’s most popular track (and the one she most resents having to play live).“For My Woman, I was like, I want to make a classic rock’n’roll record,” she says. “I wanted to have all these crazy harmonies and make it sound like something from the 60s or 70s.” With All Mirrors, by contrast, she had no such plans. “The pieces were coming in one day at a time. It was really scary. I also knew that this material wasn’t as happy or upbeat and it wasn’t going to be immediate with some of my fans who loved the previous record.”“All Mirrors felt like an end of a chapter in a way,” says Olsen. The album moves from the fury and anguish of Lark to the realisation, on Tonight, that being in a relationship isn’t a necessary precondition for happiness. “I like the life that I lead,” she sings breathily in the opening verse, before delivering the crushing payoff: “Without you.”A big moment on this path, for Olsen, was buying herself a house in Asheville, the easygoing North Carolina city she moved to in 2013. Having a place of her own to retreat to after weeks on the road underlined for Olsen the pleasures of solitude.“I joke around about it, but I just don’t really want anyone in my house,” she says. “I don’t want anyone to wake up next to me. In my mind I’d be thinking: ‘I can’t wait till you leave so I can shower and play the music I want.’”She’s in no rush to get into another romantic tangle – and anyway, she laughs: “The dating scene in Asheville is pretty bleak. It’s like: ‘Did we date already? Or was it my friend that dated you?’“I don’t know,” she goes on, “maybe there will be some more drama in my life later. But I don’t really feel the need to get crazy drunk any more. I don’t want to go out all the time. I feel boring. My life is calm. And that’s good. But I almost miss the drama like a little bit. You know? Paul, who is playing guitar with me, was like: ‘Don’t worry, something dramatic will happen to you.’”We get on to talking about politics, where there is an excess of drama at the moment.“It’s like a TV show,” she says. “It’s like the world is a TV show, with alt-right leaders. And they’re all like trying to be like each other. It’s really strange. But at the same time, I’ve personally seen a lot of younger people become more political. That makes me happy. It makes me look forward to the next election in the US. I have some hope.”Does she see a Democratic candidate who could deliver on that hope?“Yes, I think so.” She seems reluctant to specify, so I prompt her. “I mean, I’m for Bernie,” she says. “But of course, we have to keep him alive for a while.”“It’s hard. And it’s a weird time to be self-promotional about your record and to go on tour and pretend that these things aren’t affecting you on a daily basis.”But doesn’t music have the ability to help in some way?“I think it does.” She nods. “I think music has always been used as a way of healing, of encouraging people to take a moment and be reflective.”One piece of music that affected her recently is by the American soul singer Alice Smith. “My friend showed me her live performance on YouTube, a cover of I Put a Spell on You. It’s insane. It’s been a long time since I saw or heard something like that. It’s really, really special. When I hear performances like that, I’m like: ‘OK, I need to go home and work on my shit.’”Which brings us to the question of goals. Now that she’s reached the end of a chapter with All Mirrors, and bought herself a house, and a cat, and resolved a bunch of issues and achieved some calm in her life, what’s driving her? What are her musical ambitions going forward?“I’m just happy it’s lasted this long,” she says.“I hope to keep growing as an artist, and it’s really cool to see that people want to come and listen to my music. But I don’t really want to be a pop star. I don’t want to merge into that world. It’s fun to collaborate with pop stars sometimes” – she recorded a track, True Blue, with Mark Ronson last summer – “and have a good time, and joke with people about it…”But in terms of exposure, has she reached a level she’s satisfied with? Is she happy to continue attracting celebrities to her shows without actually becoming one herself?She doesn’t give it a second’s thought.“Yeah,” she says flatly. “I don’t know if my label or manager would agree, but yeah. I would be OK with that.”Angel Olsen plays Bristol, London, Manchester and Glasgow, 10-14 Feb.

Plus: Dan Sabbagh on Huawei’s role in British infrastructureFrom the moment Britain entered the European Economic Community in 1973, the question of how closely to align with other European countries has been a vexed one. Britain emphatically voted to remain in the club in a referendum in 1975 but throughout the 1980s the relationship began to fray. By the 2000s, Britain had opted to remain outside the single currency and support for the separatist UK Independence party was growing until David Cameron took the fateful decision to call a referendum on membership of what was then a 27-member European Union.  John Palmer was the ’s Brussels correspondent in 1973 as Britain entered the EEC. He tells Anushka Asthana that he remembers it as a time when Britain was investing in its European future and it was Labour and not the Conservatives that was most wary of what was then primarily a free-trade zone.

A triumph of dogged negotiation by May then, briefly, Johnson, has fulfilled the most pointless, masochistic ambition ever dreamed of in the history of these islands. The rest of the world, presidents Putin and Trump excepted, have watched on in astonishment and dismay. A majority voted in December for parties which supported a second referendum. But those parties failed lamentably to make common cause. We must pack up our tents, perhaps to the sound of church bells, and hope to begin the 15-year trudge, back towards some semblance of where we were yesterday with our multiple trade deals, security, health and scientific co-operation and a thousand other useful arrangements.We endured a numbing complicity between government and opposition. The door out of Europe was held open by Corbyn for Johnson to walk through. In this case, if you travelled far enough to the left, you met and embraced the right coming the other way.What did we learn in our blindness? That those not flourishing within the status quo had no good reason to vote for it that our prolonged parliamentary chaos derived from an ill-posed yes-no question to which there were a score of answers that the long-evolved ecology of the EU has profoundly shaped the flora of our nation’s landscape and to rip these plants out will be brutal that what was once called a hard Brexit became soft by contrast with the threatened no-deal that even now persists that any mode of departure, by the government’s own estimate, will shrink the economy that we have a gift for multiple and bitter ision – young against old, cities against the country, graduates against early school-leavers, Scotland and Northern Ireland against England and Wales that all past, present and future international trade deals or treaties are a compromise with sovereignty, as is our signature on the Paris accords, or our membership of Nato, and that therefore “Take Back Control” was the emptiest, most cynical promise of this sorry season.We surprised ourselves. Only a few years ago, asked to list the nation’s ills – wealth gap, ailing NHS, north-south imbalance, crime, terrorism, austerity, housing crisis etc – most of us would not have thought to include our membership of the EU. How happy we were in 2012, in the afterglow of our successful Olympics. We weren’t thinking then of Brussels. It was, in Guy Verhofstadt’s famous term, a “cat-fight” within the Tory party that got us going. Those cats had been fighting each other for decades. When they dragged us in and urged us to take sides, we had a collective nervous breakdown then sufficient numbers wanted the distress to go away and “get Brexit done”. Repeated ad nauseam by the prime minister it almost seemed impolite to ask why.In the early days of the referendum campaign we learned that “on the doorstep” it was all about migration but we also learned that it was the UK’s decision, not the EU’s, to allow unlimited migration from the accession countries before the permitted seven years were up it was the UK’s choice to allow EU migrants to stay more than six months without a job it was the UK that successfully campaigned to enlarge the EU eastwards it is the UK, not the EU, that lets non-EU migration continue (and why not?) as EU migration declines. We also learned that the UK, not the EU, opted for our maroon rather than patriotic blue passports. Though, as I look, my old passports seem almost black.There is much that is historically unjust about the British state, but very little of that injustice derives from the EU. Brussels didn’t insist that we neglect the post-industrial towns of the Midlands and the north or demand that we let wages stagnate, or permit multimillion handouts to the CEOs of failing companies, or prefer shareholder value over the social good, or run our health service, social care and Sure Start into the ground, close 600 police stations and let the fabric of our state schools decay.Hedge fund owners, plutocrat donors to the cause, Etonians and newspaper proprietors cast themselves as enemies of the elite. More magic dust. The claim that the Northern Ireland issue has been settled is a dangerous pretence. We have witnessed reasoned argument’s fall from grace. The Brexit impulse had strong elements of blood-and-soil, with hints of Empire nostalgia. Such spooky longings floated high above mere facts.We acquired an argot. “Article 50”, “frictionless trade”, “just in time”, “the backstop” – how they tripped off the tongue. We learned to respect an “invisible border”. Before it all began, only a very few knew the difference between the customs union and the single market. Three years on, not much has changed. A survey last year showed that quite a lot of us thought that “crashing out” was the same as remaining. If only.The Brexit leadership and the leader of the opposition were always in a hurry to start article 50’s two-year stopwatch. They feared that leave voters might change their minds, that those who didn’t vote last time were 2:1 for remaining, and that young voters coming on to the rolls would be mostly pro-EU. The Brexiter generals reasonably feared a second referendum.At least, we can all agree that we will be a bit poorer. As one of my school teachers used to say, if a thing is really worth doing, it’s worth doing badly. Theresa May could never bring herself to say that Brexit would make us better off. She wouldn’t even tell us if she would vote to leave in a second referendum. We should credit her honesty. By contrast, Boris Johnson, laying his post-Brexit vision before parliament, promised he would narrow the UK’s wealth and opportunity gap between north and south, and make it the home of cutting-edge battery technology. He forgot to mention that the EU never stood in the way of either project.Redefining our new trade relations with the EU will preoccupy us for years. As for the US position, take a long walk in the American midwest and you’ll go a month across a monoculture desert and not see a wildflower. To compete, our own agriculture would have to welcome the hormone hypodermic. Our farmers will need to est of inefficient hedgerows, boundary trees and three-metre field margins – museum pieces all. When it was in trade talks with the EU, the US wouldn’t contemplate higher standards of husbandry, food standards and environmental protection, even though they would have granted access to half a billion consumers. American farming corporations will not be changing their ways for a nation of a mere 65 million. If we want a deal, it is we who must downgrade.We sense damage and diminishment ahead. In a dangerous world crowded with loud-mouthed “strongmen”, the EU was our best hope for an open, tolerant, free and peaceful community of nations. Those hopes are already threatened as populist movements have swept across Europe. Our withdrawal will weaken resistance to the xenophobic tendency. The lesson of our nation’s history these past centuries is plain: turmoil in continental Europe will draw us into bloody conflicts. Nationalism is rarely a project for peace. Nor does it care to counter climate change. It prefers to let tropical forests and the Australian bush burn.Take a road trip from Greece to Sweden, from Portugal to Hungary. Leave your passport behind. What a rich, teeming bundle of civilisations – in food, manners, architecture, language, and each nation state profoundly and proudly different from its neighbours. No evidence of being under the boot-heel of Brussels. Nothing here of continental USA’s dreary commercial sameness. Summon everything you’ve learned of the ruinous, desperate state of Europe in 1945, then contemplate a stupendous economic, political and cultural achievement: peace, open borders, relative prosperity, and the encouragement of inidual rights, tolerance and freedom of expression. Until Friday this was where our grown-up children went at will to live and work.That’s over, and for now the force is with English nationalism. Its champion is Johnson’s Vote Leave cabinet whose monument will forever be a special kind of smirk, perfected back in the days of the old Soviet Union. I’m lying, you know I’m lying and I know that you know and I don’t give a damn. As in, “The five-week prorogation of parliament has nothing to do with Brexit.” Michael Gove and Jacob Rees-Mogg were masters of the mocking grin. The supreme court’s inconvenient judgment that this prorogation was illegal clearly still rankles. Recently, the ex-home secretary Michael Howard was set on to murmur against the judges. Extending political control over an independent judiciary would be consonant with the Johnson-Cummings project. Victor Orbán of Hungary lights the way.The remainers held out for a kinder sort of world, but we were always the herbivores in this debate, with our enormous, good-natured and derided marches – “a hate-filled crowd”, the Sun “an elite”, the Daily . If 16 million remainers are an elite, then we may rejoice that the UK is a model of meritocracy.We were, in truth, the left-behinds. By the grace of Corbyn and his grim lieutenants, we had no effective voice in parliament. On her first day as prime minister, Theresa May promised outside No 10 that she would govern for us all. Instead, she threw half the country to the dogs to appease her party’s right wing. Initially, Boris Johnson’s elevation was decided by a tiny, ageing constituency, the majority of whose members told pollsters that they wished Donald Trump ruled Britain and that they longed for the return of hanging. In similar spirit, Johnson found fresh depths of populist vulgarity when he spoke last June of pitchforking the EU incubus off the nation’s back. He has realised his dream.As for the outer extremes, the occasional milkshake aside, we never violently assaulted a Brexiter in the street we only rarely inclined to sending anonymous death and rape threats such as came so abundantly the way of Gina Miller, Anna Soubry and many female MPs. However, the antisemitic emails from within the Labour party were a disgrace. So too was the bullying mob jeering outside the Rees-Mogg home. But we remainers did not slyly exhort our compatriots to riot in the event of a second referendum going against us. Nearly two-thirds of the electorate did not vote to leave most of business and the trade unions, agriculture, science, finance and the arts were against the Brexit project three-quarters of MPs voted to remain. But our representatives ignored the evident public interest and shrank behind party cabals and “the people have spoken” – that bleak Soviet locution – followed by “get Brexit done”, the mind-clouding magic dust which has blinded reason and diminished our children’s prospects.• This article was updated on 1 February 2020 to its correct version an earlier version having been published in error."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbfdb49bc2ed60eda14efc228761d0a2d50250a7/0_170_4846_2908/master/4846.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=491cb7e11a2969dc1bfb027c5e2c7ce4","title":"flags and fever dreams londons morning after the brexit before","story":"From Thatcherite thinktank dinners to ‘freedom breakfasts’ in Wetherspoons, it was quite the nightCities are expert in sluicing away the sins of the night before. By 6.30am on the first day of Britain’s new future, all traces of the beery patriotism that had fuelled Nigel Farage’s Brexit party had been swilled from the centre of the capital.From their plinths, Churchill, Lloyd George and Millicent Fawcett looked down on a muddy, empty, silent Parliament Square, unmoved. There was not a trampled EU flag or a discarded “Got Brexit Done” banner to be seen. On Wordsworth’s Westminster Bridge, the sun seemed reluctant to come up, perhaps just to annoy Mark Francois, reportedly waiting with champagne glass in hand.I had wandered down here early for evidence of that fabled new dawn that I’d seen advertised on the front of several newspapers (as well as on a souvenir tea towel, free with the Daily Mail). On the walk down through Soho, blinking itself awake, there was nothing to see apart from the extraordinary process of daily reinvention: floors being mopped, windows being cleaned, pavements swept, rubbish being hoisted onto wagons, warm bread being delivered. Questions about Brexit were met with shrugs and resignation in several languages. In Soho’s Bar Italia, above which John Logie Baird invented television, my mention of new dawns was greeted with a brisk “No, too much Brexit! Too busy!” We all know the feeling. One positive Brexit result: people might finally be vox-popped out. Anyway, down here they do new dawns every day.I’d had a pint in the Wetherspoon’s on Whitehall the night before. The pub had hosted the most raucous of “Ingerlund” crowds, getting tanked up before swaying down past the cenotaph to hear the nation’s landlord, Tim Martin, offer his back-of-a-fag-packet take on global geopolitics. At 8am, “freedom breakfasts” were being served, alongside medicinal pints of John Smith’s, to those for whom last night’s militant camaraderie had given way to this morning’s hung-over solitude.A few doors down, the prime minister perhaps recognised the feeling. Downing Street gave the impression of being more locked down than ever. Boris Johnson had only offered a recorded Facebook message to the nation at 10pm the night before. In place of a convincing vision of Britain’s “global future”, there had been a desperate-sounding hope that we should just all try to forgive and forget the recent past. Churchill, you were reminded, had taken to his bunker before victory in Europe, not afterwards.As the London morning wore on, that collective hangover from the harangues of the past three years seemed to be expressed in a curious silence. College Green had emptied of TV crews there was not a protest vigil or a megaphone shouter in sight.What was left in its place felt like a nation waking up from last night’s skinful to wonder: “Was I the worst?” And of course, the sweaty flashbacks kept coming.In this sense, the previous evening had offered a car-crash, fast-forward history, not of the last four years but of the last 40. I had spent the early part of it among the Thatcherite undead, listening to John Redwood, “the right honourable bastard” as he was introduced, speak on behalf of the “Maastricht rebels” to an invited crowd of dinner guests convened by the rightwing thinktank the Bow Group.Old battle stories were rolled out. Greater love hath no man, it appeared, than to have defied the Tory whips over the euro.The group’s “field marshal”, Bill Cash MP, doing a valorous tour of TV studios, was remembered in dispatches. A toast was raised in the memory of former patron Roger Scruton, the Conservative philosopher who died last month and who had provided the ideological ballast for Brexit: the belief that it is “only when people define their loyalty in territorial and national terms that difference in religion and class can be put aside”.After Redwood sat down, I walked across Westminster Bridge to see how that philosophy was expressing itself in practice. I was met first by a big bloke in a union jack T-shirt amplifying God Save the Queen through a bullhorn and challenging me to prove myself a patriot by joining in. A damp crowd of nostalgists of all ages watched clips of the 1966 World Cup winners being played on a big screen outside parliament, along with – let’s get this party started! – ancient footage of Teddy Taylor MP and James Goldsmith in leather club chairs arguing against Brussels elitism. News reporters from dozens of countries lined the square, trying to make sense of it.After 47 years and 30 days it is all over. As the clock strikes 11pm on Friday, the UK is officially orced from the EU and will begin trying to carve out a new global role as a sovereign nation. It was a union that got off to a tricky start and continued to be marked by the UK’s sometimes conflicted relationship with its neighbours. Here’s a run-through the beginning, the middle and the end.The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain’s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a “deep-seated hostility” towards the European project.Sir Edward Heath\u0026nbspsigns the accession treaty giving entry to the EEC in an official ceremony that was accompanied by a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.Lisa O\u0027CarrollMargaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the iron lady marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand “our own money back” claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back” despite being one of the “three poorer” members of the community.It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.\u0026nbspCollapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU.Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was ‘no, no, no’ to what she saw as Delors’ continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch’s Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered “Up yours Delors” front page.A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of “a single market without barriers – visible or invisible – giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world’s wealthiest and most prosperous people.Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union. John Major won the vote the following day in a pyrrhic victory.\u0026nbspTony Blair patches up the relationship.

Speakers appeared on stage to call for an end to the ides in society. And then, there you were, listening to Anne Widdecombe offering, as a national battle cry: “There will be no level playing field!” Brexit doesn’t really have a playlist beyond We Are the Champions, so instead, in the spirit of togetherness, the music-hall act Dominic Frisby got the audience to sing along with his composition The Maybe Song “maybe Donald Trump is not all bad” and made crowd-pleasing nudge-nudge jokes about Anna Soubry being a Nazi.It was fitting that the final act of this national fever dream was given to Farage, who took to the stage in his Arthur Daley coat and union jack tie, trying to flog spontaneous euphoria to a crowd that had been more used to stockpiling disgruntlement. As Farage conducted a countdown to the witching hour, he ventured some wild “we happy few” Shakespearean claims about the significance of the moment in our island history. In the crowd, I found myself Googling that fictional antihero Harry Flashman, George MacDonald Fraser’s “scoundrel”. Flashman, you will recall, inadvertently triggered the charge of the Light Brigade with a stentorian fart, blaming “Russian champagne” for “the most crashing discharge of wind, like the report of a mortar”, thereby sending his trusting regiment into uncertainty and worse.It would be tempting to believe that Farage and those footsoldiers – who variously embraced at 11pm or yelled “Fuck the EU” – have been appeased by the victory and that a new, one-nation vision might emerge. If not, the morning after might go on for a very long time indeed: as we know, hangover cures are rarely all they are cracked up to be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/834c47739a606f6dcf61278945ba4565169618fe/0_139_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9cedc741a15280a9d3e3bc848d711a0","title":"lisa nandy honours system british excellence","story":"Labour leadership contender says system should bring people together, not shut them outThe Labour leadership contender Lisa Nandy has backed removing references to the British empire in the honours system, saying it should recognise “British excellence” instead.At a hustings in Bristol on Saturday, Nandy said the honours system should be a tool to bring people together, rather than shut them out.“That is the country I want to build, and the Labour party I will lead. That never accepts the world as it is but builds the world as it should be. As Benjamin Zephaniah asked: ‘What happened to the verse of fire?’ We can be far more ambitious.”The move by Nandy is the latest pledge by leadership candidates designed to appeal to Labour’s leftwing membership, which expanded hugely under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. Nandy’s pledge came as leadership contenders clashed over the selection of Labour MPs – an issue that has regularly caused isions.Rebecca Long-Bailey, the candidate closest to Corbyn, reiterated her pledge to bring in open selections if she was elected leader, a move that would in effect allow local Labour activists to deselect their MP. She said being an MP was “not a job for life”. However, she was challenged by Nandy, who warned against focusing on the party’s internal power struggles. “The MPs I want to get rid of are Tories, not Labour,” Nandy said.The candidates also clashed over Brexit during the first hustings event since Britain’s departure from the EU. Long-Bailey and Nandy called on the party to accept Brexit and move on. However, the pro-remain shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, who still lacks the necessary grassroots support to appear on the leadership ballot paper, said the bumpy negotiations ahead meant Labour needed a leader who had been “on the right side of the argument all along”.Long-Bailey said the party’s next election campaign must not be based on “we told you so” over the dangers of Brexit. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, who helped steer Labour towards backing a second referendum, said the debate around leave or remain was over. However, he accused the government of failing to tackle the issues that led to the Brexit vote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5598a357a7dce2f40afad9ba7b1c3d31ab31799/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c37e7224bca1843dfb42895963ae0348","title":"voxpop last night britain member eu brexit","story":"Remainers and Brexiters tell the Observer how they marked the final hours of 31 January“I’d just made it to the pub in Haringey, having wrapped up two days of seminars with my students in Amsterdam.

And it’s not going to make conditions for non-EU migrants any better either.Under a Conservative majority, Brexit is a mandate for nationalism, authoritarianism and redrawing the boundaries of Britishness along increasingly nativist lines.

If there is no deal by 31 December, the UK will face a “cliff-edge” no-deal Brexit.Asked on Sky News if Michel Barnier was wrong to say there would be border checks on goods moving between the EU and the UK, Raab said this was up to the EU.“Yes, he is wrong if the EU lives up to its commitments on its side both in the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration,” he said. “We expect those assurances and agreements to be kept to. That’s why we’ve done this deal – it is a package.”Barnier made the claim in a speech at Queen’s University in Belfast earlier this week.Later, Raab told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show that following EU rules after 2021 “just ain’t happening”.“We are entering into these negotiations with a spirit of goodwill. But we are just not doing that other stuff. The legislative alignment, it just ain’t happening,” he said.He accused Brussels of attempting to “shift the goalposts” since the political declaration was signed off last year.Asked about reports of EU demands for the European court of justice to oversee disputes in any trade deal with the UK, Raab said: “We all agreed that we weren’t going to do that. You knew that, you signed up to the withdrawal agreement and political declaration on that basis. Why are you trying to shift the goalposts?“We want to have a good positive win-win new deal with the EU. That’s not going to happen if they pull the rug, shift the goalposts.”John McDonnell, Labour’s shadow chancellor, said Raab’s words were a showy and childish attempt to set out the government’s position in the trade negotiations. “It is ‘sabre-rattling’ … It is a bit puerile,” he told the Andrew Marr Show.Raab’s claims followed reports that British diplomats have been ordered to make a symbolic break with Brussels.After Johnson set out a hardline position before talks with the EU begin, the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said the EU could reach a sector by sector deal with the UK if a comprehensive Brexit agreement was not reached by Johnson’s December deadline.But he told the BBC it would be a “second-class outcome” and mean that negotiations could drag on for years.“If it isn’t possible to have a comprehensive deal then the back-up plan would be sectoral agreement or some temporary agreements that would buy us more time while we negotiate the comprehensive agreement, but that to me is an inferior outcome. and imposition of bureaucracy, checks, tariffs and quotas that is not good for anyone,” he told Marr.He added that such a deal “by its nature would be temporary or short-lived because we would still have to come to the agreement on the other matters, which means everything running on to 2021and 2022 to carry on with the running matters”. It is understood Downing Street is not keen on a sector by sector agreement but it could be a fallback that would allow pacts on vital national interests such as security and aviation if talks on other issues break down.A clash in thinking over regulatory alignment between the UK and the EU is already shaping up to be a central sticking point, with the EU insisting on alignment in exchange for access to the single market and the UK threatening to throw up a customs wall around Britain.Varadkar called on the UK to tone down the “nationalist rhetoric” and said negotiations would get off to a better start if we did “not repeat some of the errors that were made in the last two and a half years”.“Let’s not set such rigid red lines that makes it hard to come to an agreement and let’s tone down the kind of nationalistic rhetoric,” he told the BBC.He said reports that British ambassadors were being instructed to sit away from EU ambassadors at international events was “silly”.“I think it just comes across as a little bit petty. It’s kind of when you are in primary school and in secondary school and you get worried about who you can sit beside in class. Most international forums I have attended, whether it’s the UN or other international bodies, you tend to be seated in alphabetic order or protocol.”He said it was “possible to have a Canada-style trade agreement” but it would not make sense because of the UK’s geography. “Canada isn’t the UK,” he said. “It isn’t geographically part of the European continent. We share seas, we share airspace.”Critics of Varadkar have claimed he has become much more bullish about the UK’s Brexit because he is facing a difficult general election in Ireland."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b930540455ea8413b811bab2319217db1772620/0_288_4407_2645/master/4407.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb289032f22fcaaaebdff5fc731e6bea","title":"leadsom gove touted cop26 presidency","story":"Britain needs to find a new high-level leader of its team preparing for this year’s crunch climate talks in Glasgow as a matter of extreme urgency.That is the clear message from politicians, senior scientists and climate experts following last week’s sacking of Claire O’Neill as president of the climate talks, known as COP26.Among those who have been touted to take over the task of preparing for the climate conference include Michael Gove, Zac Goldsmith and Andrea Leadsom. Former Conservative leaders William Hague and Michael Howard have also been suggested as possible candidates.“It is going to have to be a very senior, experienced politician or diplomat if we are to have a hope of saving these talks,” said one senior source. “We have fallen badly behind in our preparations for the conference, which is essentially our last real hope of halting dangerous global warming, and we need a big hitter to get us back on track.”Although the summit is not until November, massive diplomatic and logistical hurdles will have to be overcome if the talks are to succeed. Governments worldwide are meant to offer tough new targets, agreed in Paris in 2015, for cutting greenhouse gas emissions in order to prevent the world overheating dangerously later this century.However, Britain has yet to hold a single climate cabinet meeting since it agreed to host COP26. At the same time many countries, including US, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Russia, have revealed growing hostility to the Paris agreement to end the world’s addiction to fossil fuel burning.“Time is now really against us, for there are fewer than 10 months to go to COP26,” said Professor Dave Reay, chair in carbon management, at Edinburgh University. “Claire O’Neill rightly pointed out that the Glasgow COP was our ‘last shot’ at delivering on the Paris climate goals. At this rate we won’t even have the gun loaded.’’The prime minister, Boris Johnson, is scheduled to attend the official launch of COP26 on Tuesday and is expected to name O’Neill’s successor beforehand. Johnson is expected to insist that his government takes its role as organiser of the conference extremely seriously and has made it clear he or she will be someone “at a ministerial level”.His decision to replace O’Neil as COP26 president has been attributed to a number of factors, including her lack of status and experience. Her highest post was as junior minister in Theresa May’s government before standing down as an MP last year. That left her free to concentrate on her duties as COP26 president, but outside cabinet discussions.By contrast, when the French staged the COP21 meeting in Paris in 2015 they gave the presidency to Laurent Fabius, who was then French foreign minister.In addition, there have been complaints about her abrasive manner. In November 2018 three unions wrote to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, where she was a minister, to raise allegations of shouting and bullying civil servants. However, O’Neill has denied the claims and no action followed. “Whoever becomes president of COP26, they face an enormous task,” said Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. “We will have to persuade countries that they have to make pledges to cut carbon emissions that are far more ambitious than those they are currently offering. Given the timetable for the conference, that is going to be very hard work.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31136ce998a49f288e41848af6585f1a0e7357c/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77932bb35b0fe9163ffbbf85ebb3272b","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youThe death toll in China stands at 170, with 7,711 confirmed cases of infections.

Andy Farrell may not remember his first game as Ireland’s head coach with any particular pride, such was the error count. Defiance and hunger, though, remain palpable Irish characteristics and were needed as they withstood a last-ditch assault on their line by Scotland.“You can sum the performance up in those last five minutes,” said Farrell. “We asked the lads to make sure they stand for something. It was true Irish grit out there.”Nobody could have complained particularly had Scotland snatched the draw, but their hunt for a win on this site will stretch on beyond 22 years. They have a new captain, too. While Johnny Sexton marked the era of his captaincy with an accumulation of points typical in its ruthlessness, scoring all 19 of Ireland’s, Stuart Hogg marked his era as Scotland’s captain with one of the more toe-curling howlers, dropping the ball with the line at his mercy in the second half. “It was a schoolboy error,” he conceded. “I can’t change what has happened. I just have to get on with it but I’ve apologised to the boys.”His error was no more than the most extreme example of the kind of slip that might sum up Scotland, who played most of the rugby, or at least seemed to such were the stings they inflicted, but the kill proved beyond them. Time and again a promising move – and even the full-on threatening ones – foundered either on their own carelessness or, more often, on the insatiable presence of Ireland’s back row at the breakdown.It is a trope hardly worth repeating that discipline is key to these matches. Scotland’s deficiency in it plagued them throughout. Rugby’s lottery by whistle will punish any team as much as it might reward but, when a penalty count strays well into double figures, a team need to look in the mirror, however promising the rest of their play. Scotland’s indiscipline seeped throughout their endeavours, as fundamental to their careless errors as to the decisions of the referee.This Ireland team have always been the harder of mind but they took a terrific pounding of body. Alas, the eagerly awaited debut of Caelan Doris was cut short by a concussion in the fifth minute. It was a wider loss to the narrative but less of one to the functioning of Ireland’s defence, allowing as it did for the familiar figure of Peter O’Mahony to resume his spiky role at the heart of proceedings.Ireland’s injury problems did not stop there. Garry Ringrose was off at half-time with a hand injury and the musical chairs in their front row was something to behold as the game wore on – Cian Healy, for example, going and coming and going and coming again as his colleagues fell. In light of that Ireland’s grit to the very end was all the more impressive.Their attacking game was more fitful but early indications were positive. Scotland opened with intent, garnering the first of Adam Hastings’ four penalties, before Sexton swooped for the game’s only try. After an attacking lineout slick handling between James Ryan and Cian Healy found Conor Murray in the pivot position. His delayed pass to Sexton was worthy of the latter himself and set him on the way to the try line. So far so familiar but it proved a false harbinger of any further Irish try-scoring, as much as anything because of their own looseness.A vignette just before half-time was illustrative. Ireland were looking dangerous, when Murray’s pass was seized on by Sam Johnson, who was away from his own 22 towards Ireland’s. The counter was sustained by Nick Haining and Blair Kinghorn down the left before Hogg was hot-stepping ever closer.But just as the line beckoned CJ Stander pounced to force the turnover penalty. A half-time score of 10-6 to Ireland felt unsatisfactory, even if the margin felt about right.Then came Hogg’s howler early in the second half. Sexton had extended Ireland’s lead with a second penalty but one area where Scotland held an unexpected edge was at the scrum. They won their second penalty there and soon had worked Hogg into the corner. As he went to score unopposed he contrived to spill the ball a split-second before he touched down. There was no chance of the TMO missing it.An earlier infringement meant, at least, that Hastings could pull back three points. Sexton had those back again with a penalty five minutes later, before a break by Ali Price set up position for Hastings’ fourth, leaving the contest poised as the endgame approached.The Aviva waited to see who might blink. Inevitably it was Scotland. Johnson, who had been one of Scotland’s better players, senselessly blocked Andrew Conway’s hopeful chase of an up-and-under and Sexton slotted an easy penalty to leave Scotland up against it.Still they chased the draw.A lovely break by Stuart McInally, developed by the ever-superb Hamish Watson, enabled them to edge to within inches of the line. But, whatever their mood, whoever their captain and coach, Ireland are at their best defending in this area. Sure enough, Stander spotted a glimpse of daylight over Watson’s latest charge for the line and the siege was lifted, Ireland’s honour preserved."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/611089bb87dc406e0e12d1b060da4401b1f8a4e5/0_48_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79981b081a0f7b1b00b31af1f03fd74b","title":"wales italy six nations match report","story":"The question of whether Wales will wane under Wayne Pivac was not posed here with Italy willing but feeble as they started life without Sergio Parisse. Ireland in Dublin next Saturday are far more likely to demand an answer but the home side achieved a first under their new head coach, not conceding a point for the first time in the Six Nations, as well as banking a bonus.However one difference was evident from the kick-off and was highlighted when Nick Tompkins came off the bench to make his Test debut. Wales had possession for two minutes and did not resort to the boot once. Leigh Halfpenny passed when fielding a kick in his own half and the recipient, Dan Biggar, who last year would have sent the ball high into the air and set off in determined pursuit, set off and passed.It was the unfurling of a more colourful flag. Wales were not reluctant to take to the skies but there was an attacking intent with few uncontestable kicks. Italy’s full-back Matteo Minozzi is not the most physically imposing in the game but if he had feared being buried underneath a posse of chasers, it was his positioning, rather than his courage, that was tested.Wales played a certain way under Warren Gatland but here they varied their game against opponents who were anxious to speed up the game without being able to control the breakdown. If it marked a successful start for Pivac, it was inadequate preparation for Dublin and there were areas of concern, not least the set pieces and defence around the fringes where Italy enjoyed some profit. “Ireland will be a massively different proposition,” said Pivac.He told BBC One: “Getting five points is really important but also we defended well. We’ve got plenty to work on. It was far from the perfect performance. There were some good performances. Nick Tompkins ... people have seen what we’ve been saying and he’s a bright star for the future.”It was Wales’s eight successive victory in the Six Nations, which equalled their record, and it also extended their run at home to six wins. Before Gatland they lost in front of their supporters in the tournament more often than they won, 10-9, but in his 12 years they suffered six defeats and only England have won here since 2013.Italy never looked like emulating their 2006 draw at the ground, never mind improving on it. They conceded two penalties at the breakdown in the opening 10 minutes which Biggar converted into points before adding a third after Andrea Lovotti tripped Halfpenny as the full-back chased his kick into space. The Azzurri had their moments, Abraham Steyn’s disguised pass putting Matti Bellini into space, but they were reduced to sniping and crumpled all too readily in defence.Wales’s two first-half tries were scored by Josh Adams and took him to 12 in the last year, the highest in Test rugby. Both came from lineouts that had followed penalties. Wales clustered the midfield and drew the defence before long passes from Tompkins and Halfpenny gave Adams just enough room to score in the corner.Tompkins, on as a temporary replacement for Johnny McNicholl who was having a head injury assessment, had won the penalty after forcing Bellini to hold on after a tackle. He made a permanent entry after 52 minutes, taking over from Hadleigh Parkes, and provided the creativity Wales need if they are to turn the thoughts of Pivac into results.He scored Wales’s third try on 59 minutes after the game had started to drift. Cory Hill broke from his own half and, after declining to pass to Biggar outside him, went to ground.Italy were still working out where to position themselves when Tompkins picked up, ran straight through a hole where a guard should have been, turned Matteo Minozzi inside out and scored under the posts from 35 metres.Four minutes later he set up George North, drawing Jayden Hayward before timing his pass, but the bonus point try was ruled out after a review showed Tompkins had flicked the ball forward in the build-up. The only try Wales scored when he was not on the field came after 28 minutes when they got nowhere with a maul before Biggar passed to Adams beneath his legs and exposed Leonardo Sarto, who had drifted away from the player he should have been marking.Tompkins was the central figure in the final quarter, adept at raising the pace of the game and detecting fractures in the defensive line. Wales secured the bonus point with three minutes to go through North who, despite taking a pass from Rhys Webb behind him, had the strength to turn and power through two tackles, assisted by Alun Wyn Jones.He then set up Adams, who became the first Wales player to score a home hat-trick in the tournament for 51 years. Italy, for the fourth time in the Six Nations, were pointless on their long journey to nowhere."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b39304bda986276bae132b9554deb6a0162602f3/0_230_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2455d6cb043c9728914c6754f6df6fa2","title":"australian open men s doubles match report","story":"Britain’s Joe Salisbury set his sights on becoming the best doubles player in the world after winning his first grand slam title alongside American Rajeev Ram at the Australian Open.Salisbury and Ram went into the final on Rod Laver Arena as the favourites against Australian wild cards Max Purcell and Luke Saville and justified that with a 6-4, 6-2 victory.Salisbury follows in the footsteps of Jamie Murray, who won this title in 2016 with Brazil’s Bruno Soares, and joins the Scot, 2012 Wimbledon champion Jonny Marray and Roger Taylor as the only British winners of slam trophies in men’s doubles in the Open era. British interest in doubles still centres on Murray but 27-year-old Londoner Salisbury has enjoyed a rapid rise to become the country’s leading exponent in the format following a surprise run to the Wimbledon semi-finals in 2018.Salisbury and Ram qualified for the ATP Finals together for the first time in November and this title will lift them to four and five in the world rankings, respectively. They are not planning to stop there, with Salisbury saying: “We set some goals at the end of last year. One of them for this year as a team was to win a grand slam, the other one was to finish the year as the number one pair.”Glandular fever affected Salisbury badly as a teenager but he still had hopes of making it as a singles player after going to college in the United States. It was not until 2017 that he made the switch to doubles full-time, with his Wimbledon run the following year alongside Dane Frederik Nielsen proving a watershed moment.“Before that, I was thinking I could be a good doubles player,” he said. “I wasn’t really sure how high I could get. Once I did that at Wimbledon, then I kind of realised the level that I could play. It was possible to win a grand slam. I guess it shows, even if you’re not one of the top juniors, winning all the junior grand slams or breaking through when you’re 19, 20, that you can still have a very good career.“Obviously, it’s still early days for me. I think it should give a lot of belief to other players that, if you keep working at it and you have the right support, you can do it.”With their matching long, blond hair, Purcell and Saville looked like they would be more at home surfing at nearby St Kilda beach. They were not to be underestimated, though, having taken several impressive scalps this fortnight as well as a string of title wins on the second-tier Challenger Tour.They were under pressure from the start and Ram and Salisbury might have forged ahead before they broke the Saville serve at 3-3 in the first set. They did not face a break point throughout the match and Salisbury in particular was outstanding.Ram won the mixed doubles here 12 months ago but, at 35, this was his first men’s doubles title in his 58th slam tournament, setting an Open era record. The American was full of praise for Salisbury, saying: “He doesn’t show it outwardly, but he’s incredibly competitive, especially on the tennis court.“I think just his ability to rise to the occasion is pretty special. Obviously he’s an incredible athlete, too. But I think one thing that’s helped us is we’ve become really good partners. When we’re nervous in tough situations, we’re not afraid to say what we think.”The trophy came with combined prize money of 760,000 Australian dollars (approximately 385,000), and Salisbury revealed another of his goals for the year is to move out of his sister’s flat in Peckham and buy a property.He said: “We tried to stay in the moment, not think about what would happen if we win. I think that’s the next thing on the list, looking to buy a place sometime this year.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20aca9ae27d914c8913989cf8cbb9a9e24116436/0_221_3514_2109/master/3514.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70ed82e11405f51a1804030d4a2115e9","title":"england cricket world cup winners curse gilded few football rugby union","story":"Outside, it is cinereous and damp February creeps in without an ode to anything, least of all joy. But somewhere, surely, the Cricket World Cup final is being replayed. On Tuesday England men’s cricket team play their first ODI since that magical Sunday last July when the bubbles flowed and the sun cranked up and the burnt-orange bricks of the Lord’s pavilion shouted “England” – though in a carefully non-xenophobic way.When a tied champagne super over gave England victory by dint of more boundaries, when administrators and broadcasters saw sense by showing the game on terrestrial television and school playgrounds the next day were full of did-you-sees and England became the first country to win the football, cricket and rugby world cups, with a team of superstars with multi-national heritage in baby blue pyjamas.When Jofra Archer bowled a fearless yorker with his last ball, when poor Martin Guptill’s legs turned to cottage cheese, his lungs bursting for an impossible second. When tiny Ashington in Durham added a third World Cup winner to its list of greats – Mark Wood joining Jack and Bobby Charlton. That lazy hot Sunday, nearly seven months and half a lifetime ago.Since then, mixed fortunes for the gilded 15. Liam Plunkett has been forcibly retired from the one-day side, Jason Roy tried and failed as a Test batsman, Adil Rashid suffered injury, Moeen Ali asked for a rest from the long game, Jonny Bairstow was dropped, recalled and dropped again, Jos Buttler’s Test batting has been lost in a sea of confusion, Ben Stokes hijacked an Ashes Test while ducking in and out of a controversy or two, and Archer become the most talked about English pace bowler since Fred Trueman, before succumbing to a winter-ending elbow injury.A seemingly random handful of the squad were also thrown honours – a CBE for the captain Eoin Morgan, an OBE for Stokes and the coach Trevor Bayliss, MBEs for Buttler and Joe Root. Nowt for the bowlers but grist to their mill. Presumably the raised eyebrows over the post-2005 Ashes honours vomit, which included Paul Collingwood, who played only one Test, made the list-makers more hesitant this time.History would suggest, anyway, that time is not always kind to World Cup winners. The England men’s football and rugby union teams have had mixed fortunes after their World Cup victories in 1966 and 2003, the only thing in common being that they failed to win another trophy.On his way back from Wembley in 1966 to his heavily pregnant wife, Jack Charlton celebrated with a plate of egg and chips at a transport cafe. For others, it got a little more glitzy – Tina Moore, the England captain Bobby Moore’s wife, described how they were invited to a party by Lionel Bart, alongside Tom Jones and Joan Collins. Moore then became a model for a gentlemen’s outfitters and was named one of the 10 best-dressed men of 1971. The gongs came in dribs and drabs – a knighthood for Alf Ramsey, OBEs for the Charlton brothers when they retired, a knighthood for Geoff Hurst a mere 32 years after scoring the winning hat-trick and an afterthought of MBEs for the forgotten rest in the 2000 New Year honours list. Football-drilled dementia has also been an unwelcome spectre, striking down Martin Peters, Nobby Stiles, Ray Wilson and Jack Charlton.Ramsey’s team next got together for a game against Northern Ireland in the 1966-67 British Home Championship, a journey to Windsor Park, Belfast. The buildup to the game was enlivened with the news that the taxman wanted a share of the £1,000 win bonus the England squad had received (something that Moore and Hurst challenged successfully in the courts). In the match itself, George Best twinkled all over but England won 2-0.However, the following April England lost the British Home Championship final at Wembley to Scotland, who therefore crowned themselves world champions, ending England’s run of 19 unbeaten games under Ramsey. Jack Charlton broke a toe but had to hobble on regardless because no substitutions were allowed, and there was a pitch invasion at the end by giddy Scottish fans, who tore up and pocketed chunks of the turf as souvenirs. After losing in the quarter-finals in 1970 in Mexico, England failed to qualify for the 1974 World Cup.In 2003 Jonny Wilkinson kicked his drop goal into the drizzling Sydney sky with seconds left on the clock, and England became the first – and to date only – northern-hemisphere winners of the Rugby World Cup. They were rewarded with an open-top bus tour, the freedom of Greater London from Ken Livingstone and at the very least an MBE – Martin Johnson got a CBE and the head coach Clive Woodward was knighted. Post-retirement, most of the team headed into coaching or the media, while Kyran Bracken won Dancing on Ice and Ben Cohen did a turn on Strictly, as did – less controversially – a Question of Sport’s Matt Dawson. Mike Tindall married into the royal family.But, after a 22-game unbeaten run going into the World Cup, that invincible rugby side had gone. In their very next game, they lost 19-13 to Ireland in the Six Nations, the magic no longer quite there.If there’s a message for England’s cricket side in all of this, it may be: no fear. Or, perhaps: nothing will ever be quite as good again. After all, I don’t know what those gracious runners-up New Zealand have done to deserve their groundhog days since July, this week losing two further matches to super overs to take the total to four in seven months. Sport, eh: what a malicious bastard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28b468a9ce3499b8e2f34b2013a140e4c06db947/0_0_4744_3163/master/4744.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff666f34435cba709b9f6347979ad65c 700w","title":"australian open mens singles final novak djokovic v dominic thiem live","story":"Fourth set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 2-6 2-1* Dominic Thiem: Djokovic keeps himself ahead, but only narrowly as he quickly found himself down 30-40 after a bad forehand miss.He responded incredibly well. At break point, Djokovic did something that he has only attempted once today: he serve and volleyed, scuppering the break point with two slick volleys. He then moved into the net on the very next point and executed another lovely volley. He completed the hold with a bit of luck - a net cord winner off a regular slice.If he is in any mental shape for a scrap, Djokovic should take a lot from how he navigated that game.Fourth set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 2-6 *1-1 Dominic Thiem: These early games are going to be so important for Thiem as Djokovic looks to dig into the fourth set, break early and steal some momentum. We have seen it so often in the past. A great hold to 15 from the Austrian there, closed off with his 9th ace after some exemplary serving.Fourth set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 2-6 1-0* Dominic Thiem: Djokovic pieces together an essential routine hold to open the fourth set, sealed with a point-ending inside-in forehand. He is still struggling with his second serve and rolling them in at laughable speeds, but it was enough there.From John Murray on Twitter:“How many times has Novak trailed 2 sets to 1 in Australian Open finals?”The answer is zero. Uncharted territory for Novak Djokovic here. However, he is the world’s top expert at playing poorly against the very best yet winning the points that matter and escaping with the win.If he wants to come back, he has to start with his serve which has been a complete mess. After increasing his second serve speed in the off-season and firing huge second serves throughout this tournament, it has unraveled under pressure and it is affecting every part of his game.That was nervy and tough, but Thiem edges out the hold to move to within a set of his first slam title. Thiem moved up set point at 40-30, but he just couldn’t convert. Djokovic forced a forehand error from Thiem on the first set point at 40-30, then Thiem double faulted on the second set point. On the third attempt, Djokovic crunched a great backhand down the line return winner. But after saving a break point, Thiem finally got it done. The three unforced errors by Djokovic from break point up was a great reflection of his level today.Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 2-5* Dominic Thiem: A regulation, businesslike hold from Djokovic with much better serving. Now for the most important game of the match so far: Thiem will attempt to serve this out.Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 *1-5 Dominic Thiem: Well, that was easy. Dominic Thiem strolls to a love hold, sealed with a glorious backhand down the line. That shot was missing in action early on but now he can’t stop landing them. One game away from a 2-1 sets lead.Djokovic just had the trainer on for an unspecified reason. The commentators at Eurosport thought they heard something about Djokovic being “tired”. Who knows?Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 1-4* Dominic Thiem: Djokovic finally nabs his first game since 4-4 in the second set. Some good serving and one particularly delightful finish off a serve and volley, but it’s doubtful that Thiem was particularly fussed about that.Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 *0-4 Dominic Thiem: Thiem very nearly did help Djokovic back into the set, double faulting at 15-15. But he recovered extremely well, eliciting a Djokovic forehand error with an awesome crosscourt forehand before directing a lovely lob over the Serb’s head. He sealed the hold with an ace. A great sequence.As dire as Djokovic has been since the middle of the second set, Thiem deserves so much credit for how he has handled these tight moments. Six games in a row.Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 0-3* Dominic Thiem: Thiem is flying as Djokovic sinks deeper into distress. After Djokovic fell down 0-30 with his 5th double fault of the day, Thiem responded with another brilliant backhand down the line at 15-30, a shot that is finally beginning to fire. On the second break point, Djokovic dumped a weak forehand into the net.It will take something spectacular from Djokovic to win this set from a double break down or something spectacularly poor from Thiem to lose this set.Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 *0-2 Dominic Thiem: A tremendous hold from Thiem to consolidate the break. Djokovic played a glorious drop shot at 30-30 to bring up break point, which Thiem erased with a vicious backhand down the line after a long point.At deuce, Thiem landed a huge inside out forehand to bring up deuce before a solid first serve elicited a return error. Bold and brave under immense pressure.Djokovic and Federer have played each other 50 times with the Serb winning 27-23 including 11-6 in Grand Slams, 13-6 in tournament finals and 21-10 since 2011.Surely there must be a case for Novak being the greatest player of all time?Yes. Personally, I think that there is a good case to be made for everyone at this point. What Djokovic lacks in slams, he makes up for in the mere fact that he has had to break through both Nadal and Federer to win his slams. Still, I think this will be a better conversation when they all retire.Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-6 0-1* Dominic Thiem: Thiem sensed an opportunity here and he has taken it. At 30-15, he snuck into the net and put away a lovely angled backhand drop volley winner. Then he crunched a forehand down the line winner to bring up break point. Although he missed the break point with a quite horrendous forehand miss as Djokovic stood stranded at the net, Djokovic gave up two bad unforced errors to hand over the early break.Djokovic is particularly struggling on his serve. He opened the game with a double fault and he keeps on falling over his follow-through as he misses first serves. Thiem has to run with this momentum for as long as he can because, with Djokovic, it usually doesn’t last.Here is a lovely photo gallery from two great weeks in Melbourne.“Great job, man. You made yourself famous. Well done.” - Novak Djokovic to umpire Damien Dumusois after his two time violation calls.Thiem had no problems serving out the first set there, breezing through the hold to 15 with good serving and a couple of enormous forehands. As Djokovic’s mood continues to swing, he has been cool and focused even when struggling with his own form. A well deserved set.Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-5* Dominic Thiem: Oh dear. Just as it seemed that Djokovic would wrestle the momentum, Djokovic found himself down 15-30 after a double fault.At 15-30, Djokovic was given his first time violation and the crowd cheered. He responded with a drop shot into the net. At 15-40. Djokovic immediately received another time violation, losing his first serve as a result. He immediately sprayed a forehand long.As he walked past the chair, Djokovic gave the umpire a sarcastic thumbs up. A complete mess of a game. Meanwhile, Thiem is cool and relaxed across the net. He will serve for the set.Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 *4-4 Dominic Thiem: Djokovic immediately chased after a break, moving to 15-30 and putting immense pressure on the Thiem serve. Thiem recovered extremely well, playing a beautiful forehand dropshot winner after dragging Djokovic out of the court with bruising forehands. At 30-30, he found a forehand on-two punch to bring up game point.But from 40-30, Thiem missed a couple of first serves and sprayed three loose errors in a row: a forehand error and then two backhands errors. Across the net, Djokovic is grunting louder, finding more depth on his strokes and refusing to miss. He is fully dialled in and now he is back on serve.Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 3-4* Dominic Thiem: Djokovic pieces together another swift hold to 15. He looks a lot more focused and Thiem is going to have to serve extremely well in order to see this set out.Here is the report on Joe Salisbury’s Australian Open doubles title. He now has a bit more money (around 192,500 pounds) to put towards moving out of his sister’s Peckham flat.Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 *2-4 Dominic Thiem: A big moment here. Thiem once again found himself down break point after missing another backhand down the line at 30-15 before double faulting at 30-30.From break point down, Thiem stepped up. He scuppered it with a brutal inside out forehand winner and then he found an excellent service winner at deuce. He closed off the game with a sickly sweet low backhand slice, drawing a slice error from Djokovic.Djokovic is smiling bitterly and shaking his head. This is a different match.Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 2-3* Dominic Thiem: A much better hold for Djokovic there. Easy and businesslike, sealed with a lovely combo of backhands.Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 *1-3 Dominic Thiem: Djokovic’s level is finally out of the stratosphere and the fact that he is openly seething isn’t helping.Djokovic opened the game two bad errors and then a weak drop shot-lob combo, with Thiem easily dispatching the overhead. After some excellent defense from Thiem at 40-15, a last ditch Djokovic dropshot landed just wide. It was called in, but Thiem rescued the point with a glorious challenge. Everything is going his way now.Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 1-2* Dominic Thiem: Thiem breaks in set two! Thiem finally managed to open up on his trusty backhand down the line early in the game, crushing one such winner to bring up 15-30. At 30-30, Djokovic then double faulted to bring up a break point. This time, a flashy Thiem backhand went well wide on the break.Djokovic saved the second break point with a serve and forehand combo, but on the third, he bizarrely went for a 194kmh second serve and he missed. Game on.Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 *1-1 Dominic Thiem: Thiem opens with a rare love hold of his own despite landing only one first serve. He opened with some incredible defence, chasing down at least three shots that seemed almost certain winners, including an overhead, before grinding out the unforced error. Helpfully, Thiem’s one first serve was an ace on game point.Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 1-0* Dominic Thiem: An easy love game from Djokovic to begin, which included a glorious backhand down the line at 30-0. The pressure is all on Thiem right now.Sadly for Thiem, that was a mess of his own making. Thiem opened with two bad unforced errors and although he served extremely well to move back to 30-30, he then tripped over a forehand as he moved towards the net and handed Djokovic a set point.Thiem did extremely well on the set point, dispatching a couple of enormous forehands and then forcing an errant passing shot from Djokovic by moving to the net. But after digging himself to game point, he then threw in two bad errors and followed them with a double fault on set point #2.Six errors in a 4-5 game. He knows that it’s not good enough.The crowd is very rowdy right now and Novak is not pleased. Check out his reaction after this excellent overhead. First set: Novak Djokovic 5-4* Dominic Thiem: The points are getting longer and tougher on Djokovic’s serve, but the Serb gets back on track with an essential hold. After a gruelling rally ended with a Thiem backhand into the net at 30-15, Djokovic held with an unreturned serve.Thiem’s backhand still hasn’t fully arrived in this match. His down the line backhand is going to be essential to flipping these long points in his favour and it needs to start firing. He will serve to stay in the first set.First set: Novak Djokovic *4-4 Dominic Thiem: Thiem survives another difficult hold while under immense pressure from the Djokovic return. This time, from 30-15, Djokovic came up with an incredible inside out forehand to dispatch an excellent low, short slice from Thiem. At 30-30, he produced a brilliant forehand crosscourt return to bring up break point.Thiem saved the break point with aplomb, sweeping into the net to clean up the short ball from a big forehand down the line. He found a big serve from deuce, then he closed it off with another foray to the net and a solid overhead.Two years ago, Thiem would not have even considered finishing either point at the net. He is a different player now.First set: Novak Djokovic 4-3* Dominic Thiem: Finally, Thiem gets stuck into some of the lengthier rallies and he immediately breaks back! At 15-15, he ground Djokovic down until the Serb sent a forehand well wide, then he stepped into the baseline and broke up a gruelling 24 stroke rally fantastic down the line backhand. On the first break point, Djokovic dumped a backhand into the net.Suddenly, we’re back on serve.First set: Novak Djokovic *4-2 Dominic Thiem: Thiem digs out another tight hold. Thiem was en-route to an easy game after firing an ace to move up 40-0. He found a first serve, he lined up a backhand down the line, and then sent it just long. Some great returning and baseline pressure from Djokovic elicited a couple of forced errors, pulling him back to deuce.Thiem responded with a great serve and forehand combo, but Djokovic dragged him back to deuce again. Finally, Thiem found an ace on the second deuce and a Djokovic backhand error gave him a second game.First set: Novak Djokovic 4-1* Dominic Thiem: All the action so far is on Dominic Thiem’s serve. Once again, Djokovic breezes through another service game. After arriving at 40-0 thanks to more excellent serving, he took his second game point with a glorious backhand down the line winner after a long rally.First set: Novak Djokovic *3-1 Dominic Thiem: Thiem digs out an excellent first hold, but even that was so difficult. Djokovic has been so aggressive early on and he is controlling far more of the rallies than Thiem expected.Djokovic sent a forehand wide at 30-30, then immediately responded by crunching a crosscourt forehand winner. He went on the prowl again at deuce, but Thiem came up with some incredible defence, throwing up a beautiful lob over Djokovic’s head and then moving forward to dispatch Djokovic’s tweener. He held with a nice serve-forehand combo.First set: Novak Djokovic 3-0* Dominic Thiem: One of the big stories this week has been Djokovic’s improved serving and he showed it there as he breezed through the following service game with ample first serves to consolidate the break. He sealing the hold with another unreturned serve.First set: Novak Djokovic *2-0 Dominic Thiem: Djokovic breaks! What a tough game that was. Thiem worked his way to 40-15, but Djokovic reeled him back to deuce with an excellent point-ending backhand return at 40-15 and then a forehand error from the Austrian.Thiem generated two further game points, but Djokovic scuppered both before winning a crazy cat-and-mouse point at deuce. After a long rally, he drew out a forehand error from Thiem on his first break point to take the lead.A couple of errors from Thiem early on, but Djokovic is already not letting him breathe.First set: Novak Djokovic 1-0* Dominic Thiem: A fine start for the defending champion, who pieced together an easy hold to 15. Djokovic drew out a forehand error from Thiem in a long rally at 15-0, then he slammed down successive aces from 30-15 to hold.Ready? Play. We begin. Djokovic to serve.Dominic Thiem’s growth on hard courts in context:The players have arrived on- court. Djokovic won the toss and should serve first. This should be good.Dominic Thiem on Novak Djokovic:I mean, yeah, it’s true, I won I think more of the last encounters than he did. But I think it doesn’t count so much. It’s absolutely his comfort zone here. He always plays his best tennis in Australia since many, many years. So I’m expecting that as well in the finals.All I can do is doing my best again, playing great tennis again, and of course take a look at the last matches we had as well in Paris and also London, try to repeat the good stuff what I did there.I think I have to keep a good balance. Of course, I have to risk a lot. I have to go for many shots. At the same time, of course, not too much. That’s a very thin line. In the last match against him, hit that line perfectly in London.Of course, going to take a look at that match, how I played, and try to repeat it. But for sure he’s the favorite. I mean, he won seven titles here, never lost a final, going for his eighth one.I mean, I’m feeling good on the court. I’m playing great tennis. So try to be at my absolutely best on Sunday.Novak Djokovic on Dominic Thiem:Well, Dominic won our last match we played against each other, a close one in London. He played a terrific match against Rafa last night. I watched that. Definitely one of the best players in the world. Deserves to be where he is.It seems like he’s improved his game a lot on hard courts, because his game is more suitable to the slower surfaces. The clay of course being his favorite surface.But winning Indian Wells I think last year, beating Roger in the finals, that probably gave him a lot of confidence that he can win big tournaments on other surfaces, as well.I don’t think he’s really anymore next generation. He’s been around for many years. Now already he’s an established top-5, top-10 player. Played a couple of Grand Slam finals, won Masters events, played finals of World Tour Finals. He’s already there.It’s just a matter of one match here and there that can potentially give him a Grand Slam title, that he can actually get in the mix of top three in the world.He definitely has the game. He has the experience now. He has the strength. He has all the means to really be there. He has improved in the last 12 months playing on the hard court without a doubt, and the results are showing that.Here are some highlights of their meeting at the end of last year in London. A not insignificant stat: Thiem is now 7-2 against the big 3 over the past couple of years. He is competing with them consistently and now it is a case of beating two of them in one tournament.Djokovic leads the head-to-head 6-4 but Thiem has won four of their last five meetings. Four of those five meetings came on clay, including two victories for Thiem at Roland Garros, but Thiem finally made a hard court breakthrough against Djokovic at the end of last year as he surprised the Serb with a 6-7(5) 6-3 7-6(5) win in the round robin stages of the ATP Finals. It was an incredible match and performance from Thiem, who blasted winners for three hours and was mostly clean off the ground yet he still just about survived. It shows that Thiem is more than capable of competing with one of the best hardcourt players of his time, but it also shows the stratospheric level that will likely be required over three sets to beat him. It is so difficult.So, what is on the line today?Still, a great couple of weeks for the Aussie wildcards. It will be difficult to top a slam final on home soil. Earlier today, Britain’s Joe Salisbury became a slam champion for the first time as he and Rajeev Ram of the United States defeated Aussie wildcards Max Purcell and Luke Saville in the men’s doubles final.Hello! Welcome to our live coverage of the 2020 Australian Open men’s final as first time finalist Dominic Thiem takes to the court against seven time champion Novak Djokovic.What a ride this fortnight has been for Dominic Thiem. He started the tournament with a five set second round scare against 140 ranked wildcard Alex Bolt and shortly after he took the decision to sack Thomas Muster, the Austrian legend he had appointed as a secondary coach, 2 weeks into their partnership and in the middle of a slam. Since then he has improved to play some great tennis but it has seldom been easy. After a desperately tight four set match against Nadal, in which he won three tiebreak sets and produced one of the best wins of his career, he overcame Alexander Zverev in four nervy sets. Thiem’s quality has been clear for a long time, but it is only over the past eleven months that he has finally put his game together on hard courts. He is flattening out his strokes more, standing closer to the baseline, finishing more points at the net and slowly turning himself in the complete player.Still, none of this gets any easier. Tonight he will be facing the defending champion on the court that has defined him. Novak Djokovic may not have established quite the mind-numbing dominance on Rod Laver Arena as Rafael Nadal on Court Philippe Chatrier in Paris, the opponent and site of Thiem’s two other slam finals, but it is damn near close. Djokovic is chasing a record extending 8th title and after producing arguably the performance of his career when he eviscerated Rafael Nadal in last year’s final, the scariest part is that it seems like he has improved. He is serving even better, his second serve speeds have improved dramatically, and he is keeping the world at arms length off the ground. Although he wasn’t always efficient in a strange semi-final against an injured Federer, after two weeks in Australia he has lost only one set of tennis and he hasn’t come close to being troubled. We will see if Thiem can change that in the final."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e6fe8cc3491663a13f12703c52af47857eca1d2/363_451_5613_3368/master/5613.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c0af7d8b3e02bf8dffc19675c542057","title":"paul ready interview motherland taming of the shrew globe","story":"The actor on working with his wife, Michelle Terry, taking the rap for blowing up Keeley Hawes and the perils of real-life parentingBirmingham-born Paul Ready, 41, joined the National Youth Theatre in his teens and trained at Lamda. He’s a regular at the National and Royal Court theatres. On TV, he is best known for playing Kevin in the BBC Two parenting sitcom Motherland. Other screen credits include Bodyguard, The Death of Stalin, MotherFatherSon, The Terror and Utopia. He’s married to Michelle Terry, artistic director of the Globe theatre, and they both appear in its new production of The Taming of the Shrew.Director Maria Gaitanidi’s take on The Taming Of The Shrew has been described as experimental. How so?It’s a different way of looking at a play. I initially approached Taming of the Shrew with trepidation, because of what I thought it was and what I’d been told. The gender politics presents challenges to a modern audience, for example. But Maria’s process drills down into the essence of the story. Shakespeare works on a mythical level that we don’t in our everyday lives.Aren’t you playing different characters in different performances?Maybe! Part of the deal was that we all signed up without knowing who we’d be playing. It meant that during rehearsals we’d explore the whole play and see what emerged, rather than each looking at it through a single character. Eventually we settled on three alternative ways it can be cast. We’re currently concentrating on one of those, but that could change. The director’s philosophy is that any of us could play any part. It’s an ongoing process, which is exciting.You’ve said nothing scares you more than an empty theatre…That’s true, but a full theatre can also be quite scary. Maybe it’s just theatre generally! Both spaces at the Globe are so intimate, there’s nowhere to hide. You’re surrounded by the audience. They see the whites of your eyes. It’s both frightening and invigorating.How is it working with your wife, Michelle Terry?I love working with her – otherwise we wouldn’t have done so many shows together! We last worked together on Macbeth, which was very intense and psychological, but this is different. We’re not playing opposite each other, here we’re part of an ensemble.You seemed to spend most of the recent series in cycling gear…Well, Kevin’s very busy. Always on the go. His marriage is in a terrible, loveless state but he holds everything together for those kids, bless him.Which character’s parenting style does your real life most resemble?At the soft play centre, I’m Kevin. But when I’m trying to balance my work and learning lines with parenting, I’m probably heading straight towards Julia levels of stress.Have fellow parents started to behave differently around you at playdates?Not really. I have a massive beard at the moment so I don’t look much like Kevin. Although, brilliantly, a woman did sidle up to me at a kid’s party the other day and say: “My friends call me the female Kevin.” Normally people don’t want to admit they’re Kevins, but we’ve all got Kevin in us.Have you ever cooked “an event pig”, like Kevin on that cottage minibreak?Never. I’m not tempted either. It looked like hell and I’d definitely give people food poisoning.You played the home secretary’s aide in Bodyguard. What was it like being part of such a ratings phenomenon?It took me a bit by surprise, not because Jed Mercurio’s scripts weren’t brilliant, but because the response to it was so epic. There was one episode where it looked like it was me who’d blown up Keeley Hawes. At that point, I was definitely getting some funny looks on the tube.In Channel 4 conspiracy thriller Utopia, you memorably gouged out someone’s eye with a teaspoon. Was that fun?I loved that role. I originally auditioned for another part, but the director said: “Come and try out for Lee the hitman instead.” I never thought I’d get the chance to play that sort of character. I always want varied roles, so to play Kevin at one extreme, then spoon out someone’s eye at the other – it doesn’t get better than that.What’s next for you?A third series of Motherland has been commissioned and they’re in the process of writing it now, so we’ll probably film it later this year. I also played a part in something else and that character might go again. I can’t say more than that! I’m always looking for the next adventure.Who’s on your bucket list to work with?I’d love to do some more film in future. Directors I’d love to work with include Paul Thomas Anderson, Yorgos Lanthimos and Ruben Östlund. I adore their different approaches to storytelling. Failing that, a voiceover in Trolls 3 – then my kid will be happy.What do you do when you’re not working?Mainly parenting, but that’s at a fun stage where it’s basically playing. I’ve got very good at doing different voices for Anna, Elsa and Kristoff from Frozen.Do you get typecast in one role?No, it’s pretty freeform. Depends what my daughter’s woken up as that day.The Taming of the Shrew runs until 18 April at The Globe, London SE1"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78053cc68c1ab0240635896770468e9f03824779/0_50_3716_2229/master/3716.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ddc93a30b125a07560462f5cef12ae1a","title":"facebook political ads zuckerberg","story":"CEO defended Facebook’s decision not to ban political ads and said company will ‘stand up for free expression’Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, has unveiled a new approach to political advertising which he described as a stand for the principles of free speech, but also one that will “piss off a lot of people”.In a candid discussion at the Silicon Slopes Tech Summit 2020 in Salt Lake City on Friday, Zuckerberg said that since his company is criticized for both what it does and does not do in terms of monitoring use of its platform, it will now support free speech “because in order to be trusted, people need to know what you stand for”.“We’re going to stand up for free expression,” he said, apparently referring to the company’s decision to resist pressure to ban political ads because it would be too tough to determine the line between true and false content.“It’s unfortunate that this is such a controversial thing,” Zuckerberg said, adding that critics of his stance are typically “people not at risk of being censored themselves”.He did acknowledge that the Cambridge Analytica data breach might have been avoided with better monitoring of how customer data was being handled, and said the company was introducing tools to combat hate speech and terrorist recruiting.The issue of targeted political advertising, including its use in Russian interference with the 2016 US election, continues to haunt the social media giant.Facebook was recently accused of accepting a Trump ad that included false information about potential challenger Joe Biden and an Elizabeth Warren ad that contained false information. The Massachusetts senator said her campaign intentionally made the ad and submitted it to see if it would be approved.Zuckerberg has said he has considered banning political ads because “from a business perspective the controversy is not worth the very small part of the business that they make up”. But he has also said he believes “that when its not absolutely clear what to do, we should err on the side of greater expression”.In Utah on Friday, he offered further explanation for the decision to refuse to ban political advertising, a step Twitter has taken.“Powerful people are always going to have a voice,” Zuckerberg said. “I feel like someone needs to stand up for giving everyone a voice.”His comments are unlikely to dampen pressure on his company, which has almost 1.6bn daily users, to take a more proactive role in editing content for inaccuracies and preventing the misappropriation of data.In a column for the New York Times on Friday, the billionaire philanthropist George Soros warned that Zuckerberg and Facebook would help Donald Trump win re-election in 2020, thanks to a developing “informal mutual assistance operation or agreement”.Soros wrote: “I believe that Mr Trump and Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, realise that their interests are aligned – the president’s in winning elections, Mr Zuckerberg’s in making money.”In Utah, Zuckerberg acknowledged that “communication is not my best thing” but said Facebook was ultimately about creating a place where everyone can participate.“This is the new approach, and I think it’s going to piss off a lot of people,” he said. “But frankly the old approach was pissing off a lot of people too, so let’s try something different.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83b3fc2a006d5134779fb2e3728e90b414221205/59_416_4464_2678/master/4464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e440c3b8e3735c544cc6e059b732b98","title":"good morning britain piers morgan the wake up call we deserve","story":"ITV’s breakfast show epitomises – and fosters – the UK’s culture wars. To see for himself,  Tim Adams wakes to Piers Morgan for a monthThere were a few days in mid-December when it looked like the nation might have won some respite from its daily diet of shouty culture wars. But then, on 17 December, just days after Boris Johnson’s election victory, Piers Morgan signed his new contract with Good Morning Britain, and the most enthusiastic cheerleader of national disharmony was granted two more lucrative years behind his breakfast desk.Morgan insisted that this would be his last term of office, and that he will “sail off into the sunset” in 2022. His original tabloid mentor, Kelvin MacKenzie, argued a year ago that Morgan would not be happy until he “absolutely owns breakfast” and “is making £10m a year”. I don’t imagine he is quite there yet.In the four and a half years since Morgan took up his seat – “back by unpopular demand” – I’ve done my best to avoid watching Good Morning Britain because, well, obviously, who in their right mind wants to start the day with Morgan at their breakfast table? But in fact there is no escape. You don’t need to be among the million viewers who tune in to Good Morning Britain to feel its daily presence in your life. Anyone with an eye on this country’s media, whether print, social, broadcast, will have absorbed Morgan’s more strident opinions – about vegan sausage rolls or Donald Trump or gender identity – by osmosis.As part of a somewhat perverse new year’s resolution, for the past few weeks I have reversed my abstention, and watched Good Morning Britain – “the nation’s most talked about show” – as much as work has allowed. After the increasingly disconcerting political events of last year, I felt some need to begin the decade immersed in the nation’s prevailing gobby mood where better to start? I have come to think of this hair-shirt commitment as Morganuary.Morgan has, as you will know whether you like it or not, begun this decade as he finished the last, as the nation’s self-appointed headline-generator in chief. His long-running obsession with Meghan Markle became, as if at his personal direction, also the nation’s primary obsession: having amplified the persecution of the Duchess of Sussex, Morgan then choreographed the fallout of her escape from that persecution. Along the way there has also been the usual quota of viral sidelines. Inevitably, Morgan chimed in with Laurence Fox and his acoustic struggle to highlight the plight of white male TV celebrities, along the way explaining his definition of racism to colleagues including mixed-race weatherman Alex Beresford and guests in what GMB regulars enjoy calling “ersity corner”.Counter-intuitively, one effect of social media has been a dramatic narrowing of the range of topics that capture the collective mind. Morgan with his 7 million Twitter followers is a master of the kind of circularity that online debate demands – all links lead back to him. As Roger Ailes, creator of Fox News, observed of the so-called infotainment age: “People don’t want to be informed, they want to seem informed.” Morgan is a prime mover in that principle.I should make a very obvious point, belatedly, here: that Morgan is never alone at his Good Morning Britain desk (though he sometimes seems to believe himself to be). He is, for a start, not there at all on Thursdays and Fridays, or over the weekend. And beside him, from Monday to Wednesday, sits the unflappably charming and sane Susanna Reid, winner of numerous awards for television valour. Reid is paid more than £1m a year leaving aside the manifest absurdity of that wage, there can hardly be a regular viewer of Good Morning Britain who does not entertain the idea that she earns every penny.The industry cliche has it that news anchors are finally hired on the basis of how convincing they appear with the sound off. Reid has taken that principle to a whole new level. Though she is an incisive interviewer – witness her brilliant evisceration of Nicky Morgan talking nonsense about nurses before the election – much of her best work is nonverbal. There are YouTube compilation videos of Reid’s grimaces and eye rolls during Morgan’s never-ending monologues. “Susanna Reid dies a little inside every time Piers Morgan opens his mouth…” has nearly 800,000 views.The more you watch the pair at work, you can’t help but feel Morgan and Reid, for better and worse, dramatise precisely, depressingly, the public mood, in which those who talk loudest feel empowered to drown out those you might want to hear. Much of the time Morgan and Reid are engaged in inane banter about ratings or Gwyneth Paltrow, but arguably no television double act has better reflected a fracturing national psyche since Steptoe and Son. Just as Albert Steptoe never gave Harold’s dreams of a more civilised life a moment’s thought, so Morgan blunders over Reid’s every effort at compromise or nuance.The latter is obviously easier said than done. Take last Monday. Even in the short time I have been watching I have noticed that some mornings matter to Morgan much more than others. Mondays are particularly critical because he can set the dogs of particular items running all week. The three stories that he has decided are dominating that morning’s agenda are all out of his own back pocket, or at least he makes them seem so.First, there is the tragic death of Kobe Bryant, which for Morgan inevitably becomes an occasion for personal reminiscence of his time watching basketball in Los Angeles when he was hosting his talk show for CNN. Second, there is the latest chapter in the ongoing Meghan Markle story, a trail for another exclusive interview with Markle’s estranged father, Thomas. And finally there is the kind of “story” Morgan gets up for. This is generated by a stray comment that Hugh Grant has made in promoting his latest movie, suggesting that the December election result was “a catastrophe” and, because of Brexit, Britain “is finished”.In one of his many reflections on his decade editing the News of the World and the Mirror, Morgan once observed that “on newspapers every day is a feud. All editors need one to get by.” Morgan always needed several. Most days he rips into his current nemeses – Gary Lineker, Alastair Campbell, feminists, Meghan Markle, assorted “snowflakes”, Lord Adonis – but the feud with Grant seems more primal.As he gets into his stride about how much he despises Grant – one of Morgan’s gifts to the nation has been to normalise the idea that it is natural for presenters to own up to “loathing” and “hating the guts” of particular public figures – you are reminded that one of the moments in his career of which Morgan is most proud was the day he ran out of his office “punching the air delightedly and shrieking an order: ‘Get the hooker!’” This after Grant had been arrested with a prostitute on Sunset Boulevard.The drama of finding and buying off Divine Brown for the News of the World is presented in Morgan’s memoir, The Insider, as if he had taken possession of the Pentagon papers. Grant had the temerity not to be overly chuffed about that treatment in the News of the World, or about the fact that his phone was subsequently hacked by other journalists. Grant is many of the things that Morgan can’t abide: he went to private school and to Oxford (Morgan, who grew up with his mother and stepfather at a village pub in Sussex, was educated privately until he was 13, then went to the local comp after his family fell on harder times).Using all this stored animus, Morgan revs himself up at 6.40 to a quite alarming pitch about the romcom actor’s lack of patriotism while Reid winces silently beside him. Inevitably, an immediate poll is called for by Morgan (it is an overlooked fact that the national eitheror of Brexit was primed by countless such online barometers of staged anger). “Do you agree with Hugh Grant that Britain is finished?”It is then that Good Morning Britain’s hold on the national conversation kicks in. As you watch Morgan and Reid argue about Grant, you can also watch Morgan’s mansplaining immediately amplified in real time. Some of this comes from online reaction – unchecked outrage about Grant’s throwaway line is by now trending on Twitter – some comes from online newspaper journalists, who appear to watch Good Morning Britain in the way that their predecessors used to watch the tickertape of newswires.Hardly has Morgan half-uttered the words “Shut up” to his co-host than an online news story in the Sun is breathlessly reporting the fact: “Piers Morgan has admitted he pushes co-host Susanna Reid to her absolute limits when the pair host Good Morning Britain. This morning the pair exchanged fiery comments whilst presenting GMB live on air, signalling no end in sight to their stark differences in opinion,” the paper announced. “Susanna attempted to shut down her fellow presenter by saying: ‘I don’t want to talk about Hugh Grant any more.’ In this particular moment, Susanna knew how to wind up the former newspaper editor as he was almost caught saying ‘Shut up’ on camera. He let out a ‘Shu–’ before quickly correcting himself…”By now I am far enough into Morganuary that it can seem that no reporting of a world event is complete without input from Morgan. There is a genuine weirdness in watching this unfold. Morgan writes newspaper columns for the Mail and the Mail on Sunday. There was a time when that would have meant that rival tabloid newspapers would have operated a blanket ban on coverage of him. Now, perversely, certain rival online editors appear to work on the principle that if a tree falls in a forest and Piers Morgan has not tweeted about it, has it really happened?Here, for example, is how the Express – ostensibly the biggest rival to the Mail for the hearts and minds of middle England – first reported the tragedy of the helicopter crash in which basketball legend Kobe Bryant and his daughter died: “Piers Morgan pays tribute to ‘icon’ Kobe Bryant after death aged 41” the Express headline reads. And this is how the story that follows is constructed: “PIERS MORGAN took to Twitter alongside many celebrities to pay tribute to basketball legend Kobe Bryant, who has passed away at the age of 41… The Good Morning Britain presenter, 54, shared a photo of the basketball star in his Lakers kit and wrote in view of his 7.1 million Twitter followers: ‘Few bigger icons in the history of world sport than Kobe Bryant.’”This habit of filtering world events through Morgan’s eyes is very far from an isolated case. On Monday morning there are by my count at least a dozen clickbait stories in the papers featuring Morgan’s reaction to the world. The previous week, in the Express alone, I had counted 16.Does any of this matter? It used to be observed – partly because of the grounding principles of the BBC in our media – that something like Fox News, which set the tone for the extremist populism of Trump, could never gain a foothold in this country. With BBC news under siege from all sides, Good Morning Britain, operating in that no man’s land between news and highly partisan presenter-dominated comment, goes some way to proving the opposite.Morgan’s main opponent in this war is consensus. Increasingly of course, that means he casts himself as the defender of “common sense” and plain speaking in straw-man arguments about whether “clapping should be replaced with ‘jazz hands’ to make it more inclusive” or in rants about plus-sized models, gender-neutral clothing or men carrying babies in papooses.“Culture war” seems a grandiose term for what Good Morning Britain does. But the effect is to add to that pervasive impression that public life is a zero sum game in which for me to win, you have to lose. Morgan jokes continuously about his rival morning show on the BBC (which brings in twice the viewers but emits a fraction of the “noise”). “I want to destroy them, I want to dismantle them, I want to wreck them,” he says, only partly tongue in cheek.We might think of this kind of tone as an invention of cable networks and shock jocks in the United States. If you trace its history closely, however, the language of Breitbart and Fox News – that mixture of laddish mischief and bigoted cruelty – was lifted wholesale from the Sun and the News of the World in the 1970s and 80s. Rupert Murdoch first injected it into the American bloodstream in the pages of the New York Post, and then into television through Ailes’s Fox News. The lowest common denominator principle was to “Give people what they want”.Morgan was in many ways the wunderkind of that impulse. In 1994, Murdoch scenting an ambition he could work with, promoted 28-year-old Morgan from being editor of the Sun’s celebrity gossip column, Bizarre, to the editorship of the planet’s most read paper, the News of the World. He no doubt sensed that Morgan understood, at heart, that profit should always come before principle. Morgan tested that idea a couple of times, most notably in his bold anti-war stance while editor of the Mirror at the time of the invasion of Iraq. A crash in sales, however, saw him send a note of apology to his then boss, Sly Bailey. “One thing I won’t be doing is sitting here defiantly telling myself how I’m right and they are all wrong,” he wrote. “The readers are never wrong. Repulsive maybe, but never wrong.”That definitive populist wisdom is something Morgan has carried with him ever since the sense that news was a business, or a game played with public sentiment, and one that you would be a mug not to play to win. “Sometimes the job does feel a bit like playing God with people’s lives,” he said of his time at the News of the World. “I get, ultimately, to decide every week who lives and who dies by the NoW sword… The obvious glee with which my newsdesk rehearse the weekly stories of misery and mayhem created by our revelations slightly unnerves, as well as excites.”That excitement has never quite left Morgan, even now he slurps his tea for the breakfast cameras. He would like you to believe that most of it is for show, these days, and that perhaps it always was.In interviews, he says: “My persona in public is a slight pantomime villain. I constantly fuel this because it’s fun, it’s entertaining, it’s provocative, it gets everybody going, it encourages debate. All the things I like.”The thing he most doesn’t like is the suggestion that any of that villainy might ever have been for real. Morgan has long performed triple-salchows on the thinnest of ice around the hacking scandal that led to the closure of the News of the World, and 14 criminal convictions. By his own admission before the Leveson inquiry, he knew about illegal voicemail hacking some years before it became a public outrage but he has always strongly denied any involvement in the practice. These denials have never been tested before a jury because his former employer, Mirror Group – now Reach plc – has preferred to settle any claims out of court – £70m has been set aside to cover compensation payments and legal fees and significant sums have already been paid out.Two live cases may yet require Morgan to answer more legal questions. Princess Diana’s former lover, James Hewitt, is suing Mirror Group for damages arising from unlawful information gathering during Morgan’s time as editor at the Mirror, while Prince Harry also has a suit pending against the Mirror and the Sun on similar grounds.Morgan did not mention that latter case in the latest instalment of his headline-making interview with Thomas Markle on Monday, though he was once again pointedly critical of Meghan’s recourse to the courts in her privacy battle against another of his employers, the Mail on Sunday. He did not feel the need to highlight any conflict of interest.When news of Hewitt’s suit against the Mirror was tweeted by Hugh Grant, Morgan was, as ever, however, quick to respond:“Great! Always wanted to get the Major into court so we can discuss his treasonous adultery with the wife of our future king. This will be fun! Ps Just a reminder, again, ‘Saint’ Hugh – one of us has a criminal record, and it’s not me. So stick your moralising up your a**.”Watching Morgan at breakfast over a period of time, and despite all his self-mockery, that old tabloid nastiness is never too far from the surface. Though by all accounts an affable and charming colleague and friend, in his professional life, even at 7am, he retains the right to a bully’s instinct for taking advantage of vulnerability. That instinct, which he exploits more effectively than any other journalist in our tribal times, drives attention where he wants it: towards him. He knows how to feed that playground impulse that made you run toward a scrap when the cry of “Fight!” went up.On Wednesday morning, Morgan was obsessing about his no-show at the National Television awards, and slagging off another of his hate figures, David Walliams. I watched Reid trying to get a word in edgeways, and felt her lucrative pain a few times when she had to give up. I could sense my resolve to keep my Morganuary habit going into our post-Brexit February waning. As with all new year’s resolutions, a month suddenly seemed like more than enough.Author Afua Hirsch is asked to defend her New York Times piece “Black Britons know why Meghan Markle wants out – it’s the racism”.“You can’t just say these things are racist when they’re not,” Morgan froths.‘I’m telling you that as someone who’s lived the experience of being a person of African heritage in this country that there are narratives that are regularly…” Hirsch replies, before being cut off by her host.A discussion about “Harry and Meghan’s new life” becomes another robust debate about whether the treatment of the couple by the UK media had been racist. Morgan says not. This prompts lawyer and activist Dr Shola Mos-Shogbamimu to say: “You are a man privileged to have power and influence, and you’re using your power so irresponsibly to spout some personal vendetta with nasty and vile comments.”Labour leadership candidate Lisa Nandy also ends up having to fact-check Morgan’s view that race and gender were not a factor in the media’s treatment of Meghan Markle. “If you don’t mind me saying, how on earth would you know?” she counters. “As someone who’s never had to deal with ingrained prejudice, you’re not in a position to understand people who have.”He also picks a fight with GMB’s mixed-race weather presenter, Alex Beresford, about, you guessed it, race and Meghan Markle.After saying he had been championing the anti-woke frontman and Question Time celebrity Laurence Fox, Morgan clashes with him over Fox’s comments that the inclusion of a Sikh soldier in the film 1917 was “forcing ersity on people”. Morgan points out that he was “sort of insulting, actually, to Sikh soldiers who had served”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/715600d574531f15be326bf106450e888112fdb4/0_176_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8e01b9a0af97e67be2d9f66c9711cfc","title":"bernie sanders iowa democrats martin omalley","story":"In 2016, the Maryland governor ran for president.

Born in 1963, to working-class Democrats in the Washington suburbs, he was schooled in the Kennedy way. He volunteered for Gary Hart, the Colorado senator who was the party frontrunner for 1988 until scandal brought him down. Entering elected politics himself, O’Malley was the mayor of Baltimore from 1999 to 2007 and the governor of Maryland from 2008 to 2015. He aimed at the White House as a happy warrior, a guitar-playing politico with a record of progressive policy achievement.But in the primary, he says, he found himself caught “between a rock”, meaning Hillary Clinton, “and an angry place”, meaning Bernie Sanders. There wasn’t room to breathe and his campaign went nowhere: the middle candidate in an election that ended up with America deeply ided.A few days before Iowa votes again, O’Malley walks a few blocks from his Washington office. The room is quiet, the table discrete. The national stage is not. Over at the Capitol, in the impeachment trial, Donald Trump is on his way to acquittal. In Iowa and New Hampshire, Sanders is surging again. Some fear that in answer to Trump’s march to the right, Democrats are sliding too far left. O’Malley is among them.“Bernie’s still being given a bit of a free pass by the national media,” he says. “I do not believe that he would be a strong candidate for our party in the fall. And, except for three months out of every four years, he’s not even of our party.”Sanders sits in the Senate as an independent, a democratic socialist, the “d” very much lower-case. He may be 78 but he’s popular with the young. Since leaving office, O’Malley has taught at Johns Hopkins, Georgetown, Boston College and Carnegie Mellon.“I would frequently tell my students, ‘Look, I know in my own generation we fell for the Nigerian prince scam, but how do you all fall for the Bernie Sanders scam?’ I don’t get that.“Here’s a guy who has been a kind of stalwart of the National Rifle Association, a man who said immigrants steal our jobs right up until he ran for president, a guy who said the sound of John Kennedy’s voice made him nauseous.”In conversation, O’Malley can seem to slip behind an invisible podium, rapping out his points with dramatic cadences, frowns and smiles. If there is an air of the stump speech, he’s given thousands. He did so again in 2017 and 2018, touring the country, supporting Democrats in midterm elections which swung hard the party’s way.Of course, much of the energy which delivered such victories was determinedly progressive, akin to or directly supportive of Sanders and his transformative effect on the liberal cause. But O’Malley is as much a pillar of the party as Sanders is not.“I respect the fact that he’s been saying the same things, mostly, since 1952, albeit dialing down his hatred for John Kennedy and his disdain for immigrants, but I just don’t get the appeal.“He’s a man who never has accomplished anything in public office, who has I believe demonstrated his inability to forge a governing consensus, let alone hold a governing consensus. And I think he’d be an awful choice as our party’s nominee.”He smiles. “Do you want me to speak more frankly?”O’Malley has irons in many fires, teaching, consulting, campaigning. He’s written a book, Smarter Government: How to Govern for Results in the Information Age.It’s a textbook, built on a use of data in government well known among policy geeks. But O’Malley’s lyrical side is never far from the surface and the book is shot through with stories from his time as mayor and governor.Some such stories, he says, feature in another manuscript, written with the guidance of the late Richard Ben Cramer, the author of What It Takes, “the definitive book about the 1988 presidential race” in which Hart flew so high then fell. Its title is Baltimore: A Memoir and a piece of it is out there on the web. Some want O’Malley to rewrite it, he says, to tie his own story more closely to the idea he was the model for the mayor of Charm City played by Aidan Gillan in The Wire, David Simon’s groundbreaking HBO series. He’s not keen.“Everyone gets one Wire question,” he says, laughing a little ruefully. As the only person in America who hasn’t seen The Wire I don’t have one, so he describes instead an invitation over to Ireland to sit with Gillan at a celebration of the life and music of Shane McGowan. O’Malley still plays in his own eponymous band. He says he wrote his textbook “because democracy’s in a crisis and the crisis is democracy itself. Whether governments of and by the people can still deliver the things that make a republic worth having, in essence lives with greater safety, security and opportunity for ourselves and our kids. That’s the question on the table.“And set against the declining trust that Americans express in their national government is a quieter story that’s rising across the country, from cities that are well-governed. And that’s a story of rising trust, of smarter government, of taking advantage of the tools that no prior generation has had, to model, measure and map changing human dynamics in ways that allow us to make better and more timely decisions.“Whether those better results are improving student achievement or reducing violent crime or turning around a 300-year decline in the health of the waters of the Chesapeake Bay, I consider myself to have been very fortunate and blessed to have served at a time when this new way of governing was just emerging.”Such focus seems timely: with the federal government in Trump’s sclerotic grip, cities in particular have begun to take a lead. On climate change, for example, some US mayors have reacted to Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris deal by saying they will simply pursue its aims themselves.That showed one way Trumpism might be challenged, away from the polls and the corridors of power. It is also challenged on the streets of the cities themselves.On the night before Thanksgiving, O’Malley went as he does every year to the Dubliner, a Capitol Hill pub, with other graduates of Gonzaga, a Washington Jesuit high school. Then another member of an 80s class walked in: Ken Cuccinelli, formerly attorney general of Virginia, now the acting director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services for the hardline president.The Gonzaga gathering, O’Malley says, is a friendly one, a chance for the old boys “to ask, ‘Hey, how are you doing? How’s your wife? How’s your kids? What are you up to?’“And into the bar walked Donald Trump’s child-taker in chief.”That is a reference to the Trump administration’s family separation policies at the southern border, of which O’Malley has been a vocal opponent. Cuccinelli was soon walking back out of the Dubliner, driven back on to Massachusetts Avenue by a blast of Baltimorean anger.“We recognized each other from the Sunday shows and having served together. We shook hands … but it was not a moment for me to simply say, ‘Hey, how’s work?’ I know how work is with him.“Work with him is really bad for a lot of human beings because he shoves those cages on the south-west border full with as many brown-skinned, Spanish-speaking, mostly Catholic people as he possibly can. “I told him he was a coward and he put the little kids in cages. And when he tried to get a drink at the bar, other people started telling him the same thing. So after the patrons drove him from the place, someone at the bar decided to tweet it out and then it went kind of viral.”The Washington Post picked up the story and for a while it fuelled debate around such public confrontations: do opponents of the Trump administration owe it a debt of civility? “Each of us has to make our own decision in these unprecedented times,” O’Malley says, “about whether we want to be silent in the face of suffering being inflicted on other people at the hands of our government, or whether we stand up to it.“And some of us will stand up to it by running as candidates, others will stand up to it as elected officials, others will stand up to it as lawyers, others will stand up to it in social settings. And for me at that moment in time, I couldn’t look myself in the mirror in the morning if I missed the opportunity to let him know that he wasn’t welcome. And so I did.“The day we become passive in the face of that sort of immorality, injustice, that sort of systemic child abuse exercise by our own government, that’s the day we lose our republic.”Cuccinelli, needless to say, saw the evening differently. But viral fame recedes quickly and O’Malley is back in milder climes, publishing op-eds in the Post, concerned with the push against Trump at the polls.After 2016, he considered running for chair of the Democratic National Committee but stepped back when he sensed a “a proxy echo of the Sanders-Clinton clash and there wasn’t oxygen there”. Tom Perez, once the Maryland secretary of labor, ended up in the role but O’Malley supported a young mayor from the Republican heartlands: Pete Buttigieg, now a challenger in the presidential primary.For Buttigieg, O’Malley says, “that race really wasn’t about DNC. That race was about putting on the sneakers and getting around the track”. The younger man, he says, has gone on to beat all expectations.O’Malley isn’t ready to endorse again – he first backed Beto O’Rourke – but he expresses a wish to “hear more from” Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor whose self-funded campaign has kept him off the debate stage too. He thinks that wish is shared by others.Either way, he hopes the party will decide wisely. “I do believe,” he says, “that in 2016, a year of anger, rage and retribution, a cry for new leadership got squeezed between a rock and the angry place. But I think people are looking for that leadership now.“Each of the many candidates who stepped forward this year has caught the attention of the voters for a week or two as being great vehicles for people to demonstrate that they really dislike Donald Trump. That they were 180 degrees diametrically opposed to Donald Trump. And being opposed to Donald Trump, giving him the proverbial finger … is being opposed to a white, racist misogynist.“All of that’s part of the process. But at the end of the day, we have to nominate someone who can defeat him and who can bring our country together and govern.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fedc753a5cbcab449389d06d1ac063673a7c2b2c/0_194_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91299a1f5a08cf0e0975a8f36f6f7f69","title":"fukushima radioactive water should be released into ocean say japan experts","story":"Build-up of contaminated water from wrecked nuclear plant has been sticking point in clean-up likely to take decadesA panel of experts advising Japan’s government on a disposal method for radioactive water from the destroyed Fukushima nuclear plant has recommended releasing it into the ocean, a move likely to alarm neighbouring countries.The panel, under the industry ministry, came to the conclusion after narrowing the choice to either releasing the contaminated water into the Pacific Ocean or letting it evaporate – and opted for the former. Based on past practice, it is likely the government will accept the recommendation.The build-up of contaminated water at Fukushima has been a sticking point in the clean-up, which is likely to last decades, especially as the Olympics are due to be held in Tokyo this year with some events less than 60km (35 miles) from the wrecked plant.Neighbouring South Korea has retained a ban on imports of seafood from Japan’s Fukushima region imposed after the nuclear disaster and summoned a senior Japanese embassy official last year to explain how the Fukushima water would be dealt with. Its athletes are planning to bring their own radiation detectors and food to the Games.In 2018, Tokyo Electric apologised after admitting its filtration systems had not removed all dangerous material from the water, and the site is running out of room for storage tanks.But it plans to remove all radioactive particles from the water except tritium, an isotope of hydrogen that is hard to separate and is considered to be relatively harmless.“Compared to evaporation, ocean release can be done more securely,” the committee said, pointing to common practice around the world where normally operating nuclear stations release water that contains tritium into the sea.The recommendation needs to be confirmed by the head of the panel, Nagoya University professor emeritus Ichiro Yamamoto, and submitted to the government at a later date that has not been set.Tokyo Electric, or Tepco, has collected nearly 1.2m tonnes of contaminated water from the cooling pipes used to keep fuel cores from melting since the plant was crippled by an earthquake and tsunami in 2011. The water is stored in huge tanks that crowd the site.The utility says it will run out of room to store the water by 2022.

We are delighted to welcome the country and its people back to the Commonwealth.“The reform process under way in Males aligns with the values and principles of the Commonwealth and we encourage the nation to continue on this path. Commonwealth members were pleased to note these developments and are happy once again to count Males as a member of the family. Together we will support Males to realise its ambitions.”Lady Scotland consulted the other Commonwealth nations, who all had to agree to Males’ readmission for it to go ahead.The Indian Ocean archipelago – home to about 500,000 people – is formed of nearly 1,200 islands, most of them uninhabited. It is known for its sandy white beaches and luxury tourist resorts.During his election campaign, Solih vowed to promote human rights and, since his surprise win, political prisoners have been freed and exiled opposition figures have returned to the islands.Within months of taking power, he wrote to the secretary general expressing interest in rejoining the Commonwealth, before making an official application.Solih said: “Today is a happy day for Malians as we return to the family of Commonwealth nations. As a young democracy, the Commonwealth’s foundational values of the promotion of democracy, human rights, good governance, multilateralism and world peace remain relevant to us more than ever.“We gratefully acknowledge the support and help of the Commonwealth to the Malian democratic movement, and we look forward to the support of fellow member states to ensure the long-term entrenchment of these values in our society.”The country faced an assessment including two site visits and consultations, in accordance with the rules and procedures agreed by the Commonwealth heads of government in Kampala in 2007.In 2016, the Males government quit the global body under former president Abdulla Yameen, saying it had been treated “unjustly and unfairly”.The country had been threatened with sanctions including suspension if it failed to show progress in leading democratic governance issues, including the prompt release of political leaders and misuse of anti-terrorism legislation.Yameen, who was elected in 2013, was accused of a crackdown on political rivals, courts and the media. But he was replaced by opposition leader Solih after a shock election result in 2018.The islands, which became a multi-party democracy in 2008 after decades of autocratic rule, had been in political turmoil since its first democratically elected president, Mohamed Nasheed, announced his resignation in 2012, after a mutiny by the police and weeks of demonstrations against his order to arrest a senior judge. He later said he was forced out in a coup.All member countries of the Commonwealth must subscribe to the values and principles of the Commonwealth charter, including a commitment to the development of free and democratic societies and the promotion of peace and prosperity.Males, which last joined the Commonwealth in 1982, will now be part of the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Kigali, Rwanda, in June.The Queen is the symbolic head of the Commonwealth, and more than 2.4 billion citizens make up the voluntary association."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfdff757d00b19be1bd7ae36a10716c960fc6d5b/19_141_5434_3260/master/5434.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=493415cda448351e3377e09f0623c2cf","title":"bosphorus amateur ship spotters reveal global power struggles","story":"They’re up before dawn to track traffic on the busy strait – and their sightings of warships can help to predict Russian strategy. The Observer meets ‘a nerdy little community’The Bosphorus, the magnificent strait iding Istanbul in two, is named after Io, a mortal lover of the god Zeus, who was cursed by his wife Hera to wander the earth in the form of a white heifer: the name comes from the Greek boûs, cow, and poros, passage.Io may have been the first to cross the waterway iding Europe from Asia, but she was certainly not the last. As the route from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, the Bosphorus offers enormous geopolitical power to whoever controls it. The city of Constantinople was founded on either side of its shores, successively the seat of the Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman empires. Today, the Bosphorus breathes calmly and quietly beneath the hills of modern Istanbul, but its waters are still full of international intrigue.Alongside the thousands of passenger ferries, oil tankers and cargo boats that make this waterway one of the busiest in the world, the comings and goings of warships on the Bosphorus can predict events in volatile places as far away as Syria, Libya and Venezuela. As a result, the traffic is monitored obsessively by the channel’s self-appointed  – a warm and funny bear of a man called Yörük Işık.Işık, born in Istanbul, has been in love with the Bosphorus his whole life. He is one of the city’s handful of passionate ship spotters who in recent years have realised that their hobby is of interest to diplomats and intelligence agencies all over the world.Last Saturday, Işık was up before dawn in pursuit of something special. Wrapped up warm against the wind on the open-top deck of a ferry, he kept his hands warm in his pockets as the winter sun began to dance on the water and the boat left the wooden mansions of the middle-class neighbourhood of Emirgan behind.“I end up doing this at all hours of the night and day when I’m looking for something,” the 48-year-old said. “It drives my wife mad sometimes. But it’s totally worth it for the right ship.”Equipped with a powerful zoom lens donated by the local Reuters bureau after it got a bit too battered in war zones, Işık leapt up to photograph a pod of dolphins (“always nice”) and a passing Turkish submarine (“a rare treat”). But the prize, the Russian patrol ship Dmitriy Rogachev, didn’t come into view around the Bosphorus’s narrow bends.Under the terms of a 1936 international treaty, the Bosphorus is open to all civilian boats during peacetime, as well as naval ships belonging to its Black Sea neighbours. The treaty reestablished Turkish control of the strait but ensured Soviet dominance of the inland sea. Today the strait gives Russian ships stationed there access to the wider world.“It was always fascinating to me to watch the Russian and Nato ships when I was growing up,” Işık said. “Turkish media has become less and less reliable, so I decided to set up my blog as a citizen journalist. But it was only when Russia decided to intervene in the Syrian war in 2015 that people outside our nerdy little community really started paying attention.Warships are allowed to turn off their GPS tracking devices and commercial boats contracted by navies often give false destinations, making Işık’s work akin to that of an international relations detective, piecing together where ships went, for how long, and why.His most famous photo, taken in 2015, showed a Russian soldier on the top deck of a huge landing ship sailing through the heart of a city home to 16 million people holding a shoulder-launched missile.Ankara was furious at the provocation, which further damaged the two countries’ already tense relationship after Turkey shot down a Russian jet on the Syrian border it said had violated its airspace.The elusive Dmitriy Rogachev was on Işık’s radar last week because a fellow ship spotter in Sevastopol had messaged to say he believed the Russian warship had left the Black Sea for the first time. Any pictures he could take would be the first proof of the ship in active service outside Russian waters, probably en route to the Syrian port of Latakia.Over the last five years, as Russia has begun to reassert itself as a major player in Middle Eastern politics, such movements hold the key to understanding where and how Moscow wants to send soldiers and equipment to project its power. Other Russian vessels, loaded with wheat and other goods, have made their way through the Bosphorus for Venezuela, where Moscow supports a government struggling with an economic crash.Watching Turkey’s maritime movements, too, is becoming more and more important since Ankara’s recent agreement to come to the aid of the UN-recognised government in Libya.Işık and his fellow ship spotters watched with interest the arrival of the Lebanese-flagged Bana, which arrived in Istanbul’s Haydarpaşa port on 11 December and left again with its destination set as Beirut. It actually sailed to the Libyan city of Misrata, arriving on 1 January.The Turkish parliament didn’t approve military assistance until 2 January, leading to speculation the carrier actually transported equipment from Istanbul for the Turkish military build-up before the vote took place.“Our planet is mostly made up of water. It’s what connects everything,” said Devrim Yaylalı, 49, another ship spotter. The two men are friends united by their love of the Bosphorus.“When a ship leaves its berth for the open sea it goes over the horizon, out of sight and out of mind. Istanbul is unique because they have to come so close to the city, even if they don’t stop. Ship spotting here gives you an insight into what the world looks like outside your own little part of it. It’s an inherently political hobby.”There isn’t much in Turkey that doesn’t have a political dimension. Last month President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan revived plans to in effect create a second Bosphorus – a 45km canal to be built west of the natural waterway that the government says will ease the heavy traffic on the Bosphorus and reduce the risk of accidents.First announced in 2011, the proposed Istanbul canal is the most ambitious of dozens of the president’s infrastructure megaprojects that have come to define modern Turkey’s economic boom and bust.The £9.5bn plan was put on hold in 2018 when the Turkish lira crashed. Its reintroduction has prompted concern from environmentalists and the Turkish opposition, which has warned costs will spiral.“The Sea of Marmara has a very delicately balanced oxygenation system and it is already struggling with the changes caused by the rapid expansion of the city of Istanbul in the last few decades,” said Cemal Saydam, a professor of environmental engineering at Ankara’s Hacettepe University.“To connect the two seas like this would reduce oxygen levels enough to kill all life in the Sea of Marmara. That kind of mistake cannot be undone.”Neighbouring Black Sea states have been left to wonder what the proposed canal will mean for the balance of power in the region. Turkish officials have insisted that the 1936 Montreux Convention governing use of the Bosphorus will not apply to the new canal, meaning Turkey could in theory allow whatever ships it likes – including US warships – passage to the Black Sea, effectively militarising the currently Russian-dominated waters.Işık echoes the environmental concerns over the project, but at the same time can’t help but wonder what new dimensions it might bring to his hobby.Around 4pm, seven hours later than expected, the powerful silhouette of the Dmitriy Rogachev finally appeared at the mouth of the Bosphorus.The grey warship dwarfed the tiny Turkish coastguard tugboat sent to accompany it, which bobbed up and down in the larger ship’s wake. The Russian vessel quickly powered past the gardens of the Topkapı palace towards the open sea on its first voyage into the wider world.“What did I tell you?” Işık said. “Totally worth it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5eda1fb38572e0d2c252dd25f6f1f82e9206a1a5/0_120_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bb5431dae9ae1263ee2d4f4133132a9","title":"coronavirus 11 more uk nationals to be flown back from china dominic raab","story":"Foreign secretary’s comments come as Philippines reports first death outside ChinaThe UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has confirmed 11 British nationals will be flown back from the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak on Sunday on a French-chartered plane after they missed a UK evacuation flight on Friday.Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Raab said the government was doing everything in its power to help Britons who wished to leave but that the process posed serious challenges.“We’ll do everything we can to make sure that those that still want to leave, give them the opportunity to do so,” he said.“The challenge that we’ve got, and the Chinese have got frankly, is to contain the virus but also then to lift out people that want to come back home and we’re doing that as sensitively and as effectively as we can.”Raab’s comments came as the Philippines reported the first death from coronavirus outside China, where 304 have died since it was first detected, and the first people to be tested positive for the virus in the UK continue to be treated at a special unit at a hospital in Newcastle.The UK government had been expecting 200 people would be on Friday’s chartered flight, but when it left Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, only 83 Britons were onboard.Speaking earlier on Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Raab said those flown back would join the other 83 evacuees in quarantine conditions in Arrowe Park, on the Wirral in north-west England.Asked why more people were not flown out on Friday, Raab listed some of the difficulties UK diplomats have faced negotiating with Chinese officials. He said: “The challenge has been immense. You’ll know that Hubei province is nine times the size of Wales.“We had a job to do to get permissions for the charter flight going in, then the permissions to get the roadblocks eased for the UK nationals to get to the muster points. We had four coaches put on, and we delayed the original flight by three hours on the tarmac to try and make sure as many people could get out that wanted to get out.”He added: “As this flight with the French shows, we will continue to work for those that didn’t make the first flight to give them the cooperation, the support and reassurance that we can help them as best we can.”Britons still stranded in Wuhan have said confusing messages from officials contributed to them missing Friday’s evacuation flight home.Chris Hill, 38, said he had refused to board the flight back to the UK because because the Foreign Office could not confirm whether his four-year-old daughter, a Chinese national, would be allowed to join him.Hill, from Sunderland, said his wife of 11 years could not travel as she was needed to work in a hospital in Wuhan, and he could not consider leaving his family.Hill criticised the planning of the flight, saying that he was given only seven minutes’ notice to arrive at the airport.“There’s no cars, there’s no taxis, anything, and the FCO say, ‘Oh we’ll pick you up from Wuhan Tianhe airport but you have to make your own way there’. That gives me a very bad taste in my mouth. It’s just bad planning.”One British man in the city said he had been offered a place on a French evacuation flight, but told of his fears of being left stranded in the city after deciding he could not leave his wife, who is a nurse, behind when she could not get the time off workA spokesman for the Foreign Office said: “The government is in touch with British nationals who remain in Wuhan, and are doing everything we can to bring them home as safely and quickly as possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/848bd402a4de01d3fc24c8acc6929e68e526beca/58_0_3384_2031/master/3384.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d95c69acea8ec08c63e0a6f1b4bac3c7","title":"zoos time shut down conservation education wild animals","story":"Cruel or kind? Education and conservation are cited as reasons for keeping wild animals in captivity, but many critics say zoos are outdated relics of a less enlightened era. We hear what both sides sayIn a few days, a pair of two-year-old cheetahs, Saba and Nairo, will depart from the UK on a remarkable journey. The brothers will be taken from Howletts Wild Animal Park, in Kent, and flown to South Africa to begin a new life – in the wild.It will be the first time that cheetahs born in captivity have left the UK for rewilding in Africa, says Damian Aspinall, who runs Howletts. “There are only about 7,000 cheetahs left on the planet and they are listed as vulnerable,” he says. “This reintroduction – to a reserve in Mount Camdeboo, in south of the country – is important because it will help to support the small population of cheetahs we have left in the wild.”And the process of releasing animals from his wildlife parks is likely to continue unabated, adds Aspinall. He now campaigns vigorously for a sharp acceleration in the return of all captive animals to the wild and, ultimately, the closure of all zoos and wildlife parks in the UK – including his own.“We have no moral right as a species to let animals suffer just because we are curious about them,” he says.The day of the zoo is over, he claims – and his views are reflected by other critics who view wildlife parks and animal collections as anachronisms that should be phased out of existence over the coming 25 years.Yet zoos are a major part of British culture. About 30 million visits are made to animal collections every year, according to the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Some of these outfits are small and isolated – and occasionally fall foul of local authorities for their mistreatment of animals. On the other hand, some larger institutions, such as London or Chester zoos – are well-run and, according to supporters, justify their existence for three clear reasons: education, research and conservation.According to this argument, revealing the wonders of our planet’s wildlife to the public, and investigating the biology of these animals in order to help them return to nature provide zoos with valid reason to exist. In a world beset by climate change, habitat loss and soaring human numbers, zoos provide protection for the world’s endangered species.So who is right? Is there any justification, today, for keeping wild animals in captivity? Are zoos good for the planet’s threatened creatures – or are they relics of past cruel attitudes to wildlife?One argument is that zoos educate visitors, particularly younger ones, about the wonders of the planet’s wildlife. But Chris Draper of Born Free, the international charity that campaigns against keeping wild animals in captivity, disagrees. “Today, people get more from a TV nature documentary than they will ever get from seeing animals in zoos. In captivity, an elephant or a giraffe is out of its natural environment and probably in an unnatural social grouping. Television or the internet are much better resources for understanding animals than a zoo.”Aspinall agrees. “David Attenborough’s programmes are far more educational than a day trip to a zoo,” he says. And you can see their point. Attenborough’s last series, Seven Worlds, One Planet, was made up of typically stunning material – dramatic close-ups of gentoo penguins fleeing leopard seals, pumas in pursuit of guanacos, and Barbary macaques in high-level chases after infant kidnappers. It was exhilarating, informative – and surely ideal for getting people hooked on animals.But Attenborough flatly disagrees and is emphatic that his documentaries cannot compare to seeing the real thing. Only the sight of a creature in the flesh can give us a true understanding of its nature, he says.“There is no way you can appreciate the quiddity of an elephant except by seeing one at close quarters,” he told the Observer. “People ought to be able to see what an animal looks like. And smells like. And sounds like. I think that is quite important. Actually, very important.”Education certainly justifies a well-run zoo’s existence, he insists. On the other hand, Attenborough acknowledges that some animals fare better than others in zoos. “Modern aquariums are particularly successful, with their vast ceiling-high tanks in which you can see whole communities of different species of fish living together. They are absolutely fabulous.”By contrast, polar bears, big raptors and large hunting mammals like lions are not suitable for being kept in zoos, says Attenborough. “I certainly agree with Mr Aspinall in saying you should not have lions in zoos – unless they were becoming endangered in the wild, which, of course is now becoming a real risk.”And the same goes for conservation, he adds. “Breeding programmes for animals that are on the verge of extinction are of incredible importance. If it was not for zoos, there would be no Arabian oryx left in the world, for example.”The Arabian oryx was hunted to extinction in the wild by 1972 but was later reintroduced – originally with animals from San Diego safari park – to Oman. Further reintroductions have since taken place in Saudi Arabia and Israel and iIt is estimated that there are now more than 1,000 Arabian oryx in the wild.Other species reintroduced to the wild using zoo-bred animals include the European bison and Przewalski’s horse. But that is about it, argues Aspinall. “Only a very small number of animals held by European zoos have been the subject of release projects, and third of those species were not rated as threatened,” he says. Instead, zoos are cluttered with unthreatened species put there purely to entertain the public: otters and meerkats are common examples.However, zoo officials reject the idea that their rewilding successes are limited and point to other examples of successfully returning zoo-bred animals to the wild – for example, the Mauritius kestrel. In 1974 only four of these beautiful raptors were known to exist in the wild. It had become the world’s rarest bird thanks to habitat loss, introduction of non-native predators, and widespread use of DDT and other pesticides on the island.A rescue plan was launched by a number of organisations, including the Durrell wildlife park and London Zoo, in a bid to save the Mauritius kestrel from extinction in the wild. “The invasive crab-eating macaque was a particular problem,” says Gary Ward, curator of birds at London Zoo. “It had arrived in Mauritius from Asia and was stealing eggs from kestrel nests. So we designed nesting boxes that were longer than a macaque’s arm, so they couldn’t reach in to snatch eggs. The birds then had a safe place to bring up their young.”Nesting boxes, in combination with other conservation measures, allowed numbers of Mauritius kestrels to rise to about 800 – although these have dipped slightly in recent years.Other zoo-led rewilding successes have ranged from the spectacular, such as the Californian condor which was restored to the skies above the western US last century, thanks to the release of young birds bred in San Diego – to the minuscule, such as the return of the tiny partula snail, native to Huahine and Moorea in the Society Islands, French Polynesia, from populations bred in London, Edinburgh, Chester and Amsterdam zoos.However, zoo opponents argue that these reintroductions remain infrequent and do not justify the keeping of other, unthreatened wild animals, a point taken up by Sam Threadgill of Freedom for Animals, which has campaigned for the abolition of zoos for several decades.“It is a simple fact that the vast majority of animals kept in zoos are not endangered or threatened and are there simply to provide public entertainment,” he says.Aspinall goes further. He maintains that many large mammals kept in zoos – lions, elephants, and rhinos, for example – are inbred or diseased or have the wrong genetic profiles to reintroduce to the wild, where they could further weaken wild populations already struggling to survive. “So why are they being ‘arked’ in the first place?” he asks.The infrequency of releases of zoo-bred animals into the wild is acknowledged by Dominic Jermey, director general of the Zoological Society of London, but interpreted in a different way: “The truth is that many ‘wild’ areas are no longer viable habitats for animals – and reintroduction is much more complicated than people might realise. Many of the world’s most threatened species are living in habitats degraded by agriculture, threatened by disease or hemmed into tiny areas with no way of reaching potential mates without coming into conflict with humans.”For his part, Aspinall points to conservation successes that he believes can be achieved with key endangered species without any input from zoos. First, he plans to gradually empty his two zoos – at Howletts and at Port Lympne, near Folkestone – and use these to help set up large groups of animals – gorillas, rhinos, lions and others – in protected reserves in Africa. “A particular animal would be given homes at several reserves so that if one got into trouble for some reason – civil war, for example – there would be other sources that could resupply the reserve once those troubles had been sorted.”Aspinall points to the example of the mountain gorilla. Their numbers had fallen to under 250 by the early 1980s. Today the population stands at 1,000. “This is in the country of Gabon, surrounded by aggressive habitat destruction, civil war and poaching – and all done without any captive breeding.”The crucial point of this plan is that animals would not be kept behind bars but left to roam in their homeland. And instead of money being spent on zoos, funds would go directly to conservation.But the idea of closing zoos to boost funds for conservation is challenged by Mark Pilgrim, chief executive of Chester Zoo. His organisation has a total annual budget of £47m.“That money is raised virtually entirely from people paying at our doors to get in,” he says. “After you deduct our running costs and cash for new development, we have around £1.5m and that goes on conservation in the field – work that includes studies of chimpanzees in Nigeria and sun bears in Asia and a programme to reintroduce eastern black rhinos to Uganda. If we simply closed our doors, as some people have suggested, our funding of these conservation projects would come to an immediate halt.”He quotes as an example Nigeria’s Gashaka Gumti national park, which houses the last reserve of the highly endangered Nigerian-Cameroon chimpanzee. “Chimpanzees here live in forests that are less dense and drier than where other members of the species live in other parts of Africa,” says Andrew Moss, a lead conservation scientist at Chester. “Their diets are rich in insects, and we have found they are amazingly adept at making tools that are just right for getting a different type of insect.“The crucial point is that if we had closed our gates at Chester, the research camp we support at Gashaka Gumti would have been badly hit and this crucial field work threatened.”Nor is it merely money for conservation work that makes zoos important, say supporters. Expertise built up in zoos is also crucial. Over the past few years, wild vulture populations in India and Nepal have crashed from about 40 million to a few thousand because of the use of diclofenac, a livestock anti-inflammatory drug that is highly poisonous to vultures who eat their carcasses.“We have been closely involved in conservation work, and our expertise in building aviaries on site to protect the last few vultures – and in treating sick animals – has been tremendously useful,” says Nic Masters, assistant director of wildlife health at London Zoo.In the end, these efforts and other attempts at conservation may prove futile in a world challenged by climate change, habitat loss and swelling numbers of humans, as Draper argues. “Keeping alive a handful of the last of a sub-species starts to look like fool’s errand because this tiny population is destined either to a life in captivity in perpetuity or to extinction. Neither of those two options is particularly attractive in anyone’s book, I would say. The damage has been done.”This view is contested by scientists who still believe there is time to save species and who argue, strenuously, that zoos have a role to play as arks for threatened wildlife. This idea is backed by primatologist Jane Goodall, whose pioneering studies of chimpanzees in the wild have revealed the complex lives led by humanity’s closest biological relatives.“Groups who believe all zoos should be closed have not spent the time I have out in the wild,” she once said. “They haven’t seen the threats destroying chimpanzee habitat they don’t understand what it’s like to watch a chimp struggle, wounded and lame from a wire snare. But I do.”Until the early 19th century, collections of exotic animals were usually owned by kings and queens and were symbols of royal power. This changed with the establishment of the Zoological Society of London in Regent’s Park in 1828. This was the world’s first scientific zoo and was intended to be a collection of unusual beasts for scientific study.The collection was eventually opened to the public in 1847. A couple of decades later, the music hall song Walking in the Zoo was made popular by Alfred Vance and is notable for first popularising, in Britain, the word “zoo” as a short form of “zoological gardens” in addition to the Americanism “O.K.” in the song’s chorus: “Walking in the Zoo, walking in the ZooThe O.K. thing on Sunday is walking in the Zoo.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4159078.1580573411!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pitches ruined by joyriders likely to be unusable until summer","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe extent of the damage caused at Kilbogget Park in south Dublin in December. File photograph: Colm Hand\u0026nbspFootball pitches in south Co Dublin that were damaged by joyriders in late December are not expected to reopen until the summer.On December 28th, gardaí in Cabinteely responded to a report of a car driving around Kilbogget Park at about 4.30am. A car was on fire when officers arrived at the scene.Photographs and video posted to social media after the incident show deep grooves and tyre-track scarring across two pitches, as well as the remains of a burnt-out car.Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council said repairs to the surface of the pitches were “well under way” and were being carried out in a “joint operation” between the council and the clubs that use the park.“It is hoped to have the facilities back playable in late summer 2020, although this could be earlier depending on spring weather conditions,” a spokesman for the council said.“It is difficult to give an estimate of the costs at the moment, but this information will be available once the repairs have been completed.”Michael Galvin, chairman of Cabinteely FC, a football club that uses the pitches, said there was a lot of work to be done before they can be returned to use.“Then, where it’s been ploughed up, they’ve done some quick, remedial work. They got rid of the tufts of grass, the loose bits, they’ve been removed, then they’ve put some sand in as well. But it’s not ready for use yet.”Just over 50 teams, with roughly 800 children use the sports ground each week. Mr Galvin added that despite the pitches being out of action for close to six months, the club will ensure that no young child has to miss out on football.‘Great response’“Matches have started. For the larger kids who play on the 11-a-side pitch, we’ll have to be a little bit creative. Thankfully, we’ve got a great response from the local clubs so if we are stuck, we have some options for us and could maybe use their facilities,” he said.“That part of it has been quite positive. The whole community is coming together to make sure the kids aren’t missing out.”He added: “It won’t result in some children being able to not play or anything. We will just be creative about it to make sure that matches get played. We will always make sure that the kids have their football, that’s the whole reason for it.”Similar incidents of vandalism using motorised vehicles occurred over the Christmas period, including in Drimnagh where off-road bikes were used to damage playing fields on Benmadigan Road. Gardaí are investigating the incident.Last month, pitches at Whitehall VEC in Dublin, which are used by Home Farm, Whitehall Celtic and Rosmini Gaels, were also damaged by joyriders."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4157987.1580510368!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"martin accuses fg of superiority complex over brexit negotiations","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has again ruled out going into coalition with Sinn Féin despite the party’s strong showing in opinion polls. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins.Mr Martin said that he had honest disagreements with Sinn Féin which he had openly expressed but he believed Fine Gael had decided to embark on a policy of attacking Fianna Fáil as part of its electoral strategy.“Fine Gael have been relentlessly negative from the get go, attacking Fianna Fáil – the issues are housing, health, education, special needs, climate and crime – they’re broadly the issues people want to talk about on the doorstep.“And all Fine Gael are saying is ‘We are the supremos, we are superior beings than the rest of you and nobody, only us, can do it’ and that is not resonating with people, I think they are insulting the electorate by their tactics.”Mr Martin said that Fine Gael were displaying the same arrogance when they raised the issue of Brexit and claimed they were the only ones who can safely negotiate it through the future relationship and trade agreement stages.“Again it’s more of this superiority complex and I think Brendan Howlin called it ‘supreme arrogance’ – look, Fianna Fáil brought Ireland into Europe, Fianna Fáil has negotiated many treaties, we brought in the Good Friday Agreement. Speaking in Blackpool where he was canvassing with Fianna Fáil’s two candidates in Cork North-Central, Tony Fitzgerald and Paudie O’Sullivan, Mr Martin was also forthright about his party’s attitude towards Sinn Féin.Earlier Taoiseach Leo Varadkar claimed Fianna Fáil could not be trusted to keep SinnFéin out of government, as the three leading parties continued to spar over possible coalition options.Mr Varadkar said: “The Fine Gael position on this is absolutely unequivocal – we won’t consider a coalition with Sinn Féin after the election and that’s down to their policies – the fact that they are soft on crime and high on tax.“They opposed the Special Criminal Court and they want to impose €4 billion extra taxes on Irish businesses, on people’s pensions, on property and wealth all of which would cost us jobs and cause wealth to leave the country.”However, “ I don’t trust Fianna Fáil because quite a lot of their candidates have said that they would be open to coalition to Sinn Féin – Pat ‘the Cope’ Gallagher, Darragh O’Brien, John McGuinness, Kevin O’Keeffe and Mary Butler. ”Mr Martin in return said that Fine Gael TDs such as Regina Doherty, Jim Daly and Kate O’Connell had all expressed positive views on Sinn Féin and it was not unusual to have differing views within parties.“The Taoiseach is on this message but judge me by my actions in 2016 – I could have engaged with Sinn Féin after that election, I could have but I didn’t engage with them.“In all parties, people will have views in this because we are not monoliths but he is underestimating the depth of resistance at all levels, membership, those who vote for us and TDs who will have no truck with Sinn Féin.“We will not go into government with Sinn Féin because of how they continue to endorse the past and try and shove it down people’s throats as a correct, just war which killed innocent people.”Mr Martin said that Fianna Fáil was also opposed to going into coalition with Sinn Féin because of the party’s policies on company taxation which he believed would stymie rather than encourage enterprise.Speaking on Saturday, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald described the exchanges as “very childish” and “silly”.Radical changeFocus group research carried out by IpsosMRBI for The  on Saturday shows undecided voters are overwhelmingly in favour of change in next week’s general election.The research finds that some voters are attracted to Sinn Féin’s message of radical change, which was echoed in the opinion poll published in this paper last week which saw the party gain seven points to reach 21 per cent.Asked about the research while canvassing for Michael Creed and John Paul O’Shea in Cork North-West, Mr Varadkar said he was a Taoiseach who had driven change.Mr Varadkar cited repealing the Eighth Amendment, leading Ireland through Brexit negotiations and beginning the implementation of the Sláintecare reform in health and Rebuilding Ireland as examples of him driving change.“I’m the person who is making change happen while other people are talking about it and we have to make sure as a country that the change we have is change for the good and not change that risks the progress we have made.” Mr Varadkar added: “There is quite a growing list of Fianna Fáil people who are gearing up for coalition with Sinn Féin – I think there are elements of Fianna Fáil who think this election is in the bag for them. “They are probably measuring up curtains, appointing advisers and talking about bringing back Garda cars and you know that’s the kind of arrogance we are seeing from Fianna Fáil and I hope they get a surprise next week.”Mr Varadkar admitted that, in various constituencies, some local issues had challenged Fine Gael and he cited Cork North-Central where the party was feeling a backlash over the Dara Murphy expenses controversy. However, he stressed he would hate to see the party’s other candidates “punished” for Mr Murphy’s actions.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4159227.1580603171!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sinn f%C3%A9in level with fianna f%C3%A1il at 24 in latest opinion poll","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar on Saturday questioned each other’s sincerity over their refusal to enter government with Mary Lou McDonald’s Sinn Féin.

That does not include additional fees, which include an \u0027interment fee\u0027 of almost £1,500 to dig the grave.The most expensive graves reach more than £13,000 in LondonPrices climb if you have moved away from your local area but want to return to be buried. Fees for non-residents can see the total bill rise four-fold.In Greenwich, the price to lease a plot of land and dig a grave is more than £12,000 for non-residents, but only around £3,000 for those who still live in the borough.As available plots begin to run out, some councils have taken to more drastic measures.At two cemeteries in Northampton - Towcester Road and Dallington -  trees have been cut down and grass walkways dug up to create extra graves.In Bexley, south-east London, Erith Cemetery was full by 1994. To provide new space for burials the council built upwards with a new \u0027memorial terrace\u0027 which opened in 2014, creating 600 new burial vaults above ground in a mausoleum.The council said there is virtually no space within the borough\u0027s boundaries for a new cemetery.London and West Midlands facing the most acute burial shortagesDr Julie Rugg, of the Cemetery Research Group at the University of York, said some councils were becoming desperate.Some have started digging up paths and car parks or knocking down buildings so they can reconfigure the space they have, she said.Some London boroughs have been known to bring in six feet of earth to put on top of the existing graves to provide additional depth.There is no legal requirement for local authorities to provide burial space, so some are relying on the private sector to pick up the slack.In Basingstoke and Deane just 180 plots remain at the Worting Road Cemetery, with an average burial rate of almost 190 a year.Last year the local council entered into an agreement with Dignity plc, which runs a nearby crematorium, with a view to leasing land for a new cemetery to provide capacity for 100 years.Dignity also partnered with Wyre Forest District Council, where capacity in Kidderminster Cemetery has already dried up.Price of buying land for a grave has risen by more than 40 per centIn 2011 the company opened a new £4.2m cemetery and crematoria, with Wyre Forest District Council contributing £1.5m.Rochford District Council, with just over a year\u0027s worth of plots remaining, are planning an extension of 2,000 new plots, expected to open in the middle of this year.At Ramsgate Cemetery in Thanet, the council has cleared vegetation to create 200 more plots. With more than 1,000 required by 2030, they are now reusing unpurchased graves more than 100 years old.The problem is particularly acute in London.Camden has no operational cemetery, and shares facilities with Islington.In Lambeth, burial capacity is now critical, according to a 2019 report.By June last year burials at Lambeth Cemetery were only being sustained through use of redundant roadways and paths on site.After the council approved \u0027reuse\u0027 of graves in 2019,  Streatham Cemetery now has an estimated three months left, and just over a year at Lambeth Cemetery.The  asked councils their estimated plots required to 2030, remaining plot capacity, and the number of burials in each cemetery since 2013.Of more than 1,000 cemeteries still accepting new burials, 223 are estimated to have less than ten years left.Yeovil Cemetery in south Somerset has just 10 plots remaining - which will last it until the end of 2020. The council said it is exploring the continued use of common graves to prolong its life.In Loughborough, the cemetery is expected to be full by 2022. Charnwood Borough Council submitted a planning application last December to develop a new 14 hectare cemetery, which would provide space for another 300 years.Two in five cemeteries closed or have less than a decade remainingDifficulties in finding new land include strict guidelines over suitable locations. Graves can be dug no deeper than a metre above the water table to avoid pollution.In 2018 the Environment Agency closed a cemetery in Poringland, Norfolk, after it emerged graves were flooding with groundwater.Dr Rugg said the system has long been in crisis, as cemetery land can\u0027t keep on expanding. The system is innately unsustainable, she told the . Once someone is interred in the ground you can\u0027t go back to that space - forever. Central London has already run out of space, and that is going to continue spiralling outwards. It won\u0027t be long before Greater London doesn\u0027t have space, and it will be the same in other cities.It will cascade outwards from every major city.She added under the pressure of austerity, many councils would be thinking hard about whether to continue providing burial space.Nobody expects cemeteries to make any money but local authorities are looking at all the services they charge for and thinking about how to meet the shortfall in central government funding, she said.They have been subsidised for a very long time and there is a cost of delivering the service.It is a crisis that can\u0027t be ignored,  and there is no alternative. Over time local authorities will just step away from this as an issue.Case study | \u0026#039They’re not showing any respect\u0026#039Oxford City Council are buying themselves some extra time.They estimated that by next year they will have no land remaining for burials, and a suitable new site has not yet been found.In May last year they began the process of \u0027reclaiming\u0027 - using unclaimed space in graves bought more than 75 years ago.Ian Brooke, head of community services at Oxford City Council said it would offer a solution that allowed the council to continue delivering the service.As cemetery space becomes harder to find it\u0027s important that we examine all of the options, he said. It is currently illegal to disturb human remains except in Church of England graveyards or in London burial authorities when certain conditions are met under the London Local Authority Act 2007. A technique debated in the 2000s, called \u0027lift and deepen\u0027, allows a cemetery to exhume human remains from old graves, dig to a deeper depth, and use the remaining space.The City of London routinely uses the practice, which means they theoretically do not have an upper limit of available plots.At Highgate Cemetery in north London - resting place of Karl Marx, George Eliot and latterly, George Michael - it is estimated only around four years of burial space remains.The Friends of Highgate Cemetery, who took over control from the London Cemetery Group in the 1980s, have brought a Bill to Parliament asking for permission to extinguish rights of burial and reuse existing graves.Dr Ian Dungavell, chief executive of the Friends of Highgate Cemetery, told the  safeguards would be put in place and they hoped it would not be necessary to disturb human remains.A right of burial is a lot like a property right, he said. It can pass down through generations, and sometimes the owner might get separated from the person buried in the grave. We are looking at those graves that have been long-abandoned.Highgate Cemetery is asking Parliament for permission to reuse gravesWhen Highgate was established in 1839, exclusive rights of burial - the lease for the grave - was sold in perpetuity.While Scotland and Northern Ireland still offer exclusive grave rights in perpetuity, cemeteries in England and Wales now limit leases to 100 years or less.The Highgate Cemetery Bill seeks to override leases on graves that have long been abandoned.It is now a balance between the needs of the present generation and the promises made in the past, said Dr Dungavell. What should happen is owners of the graves should change hands, and we do have some 19th century graves with 21st century owners. Some have put up a headstone and that is the last we have heard of those people.We are only looking at graves where the last burial has been 75 years or more ago, or was empty when purchased in that time. The absence of memorials may suggest it is not valued by someone in the present generation.If the Highgate Cemetery Bill passes it would not alleviate the problems facing local authorities outside London.Since the late 19th century thousands of Church of England churchyards have been officially closed, at which point responsibility for their maintenance often passes to the local council.Around the country there are examples of cemeteries that have closed, becomes degraded and loses the link to the surrounding community, said Dr Dungavell.You get people having to be buried a long way from where they lived so it is difficult for relatives to visit.Thousands of churchyards closed in the late 19th centuryThe solution for many councils is to buy up more land, if it is suitable.Of the 200 councils who responded to a Freedom of Information request from the , expansions or new cemeteries are currently planned in Middlesbrough, Ealing, Epsom and Ewell, Loughborough, Bedford, Durham, Watford, Corby, Hinckley, Halton, Ashfield, Horsham, Havering, Islington, Rochford, Powys, Solihull and  Hertsmere.A new site in Cardiff, due to open later this year, will provide an extra 3,500 burial plots at a cost of £3m, as the city\u0027s Thornhill Cemetery, opened in 1952, is expected to be full by June. But with a premium of land in many cities, it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep expanding.And annual deaths have been rising steadily since 2012 after decades of decline.Arguing for the new cemetery, Cardiff council officers said the death rate is going to increase substantially over the next ten years due to the \u0027baby boom\u0027 generation beginning to die.Annual deaths have been rising since 2012Cremations are now the overwhelming preference when it comes to burial options, with cheaper costs and less land required.But while cremations have risen in popularity, traditional burials still prevail.According to data from more than 1,600 cemeteries and crematoria, almost a quarter of people still opt for burial.The rate of burials has remaining relatively unchanged over the last six years so demand has remained steady. Some will prefer a burial over a cremation, others will require one on religious grounds.Burials still account for almost a quarter of deaths in the UKIf, through the nervousness over reusing graves, we have ever-expanding reams of land covered by cemeteries I would say it is a crisis because of the cost and consequence of providing ever-expanding burial space, said Dr Dungavell.If you could reuse graves, as was common up until the 19th century with a slow rotation, it enables a cemetery to be kept as a burial space for generations of local people. If what we want nowadays is a fresh two metre-squared plot of land for every family, that is not a sustainable way of proceeding.Foreign Secretary accuses EU of \u0026#39shifting goalposts\u0026#39 over Canada-style trade dealComment: The \u0026#39Make Dishwashers Great Again\u0026#39 movement isn\u0026#39t as crazy as it soundsDuchess of Cambridge expected to re-wear gown to Baftas as part of new green dress codeComment: Why even the Israeli Left has embraced Trump\u0026#39s peace plan\tGroundhog Day: how the Punxsutawney Phil prediction at Gobbler\u0026#39s Knob forecasts the weatherComment: HS2 is this Government’s first major mistakeIraq\u0026#39s Christians flee in the face of lawlessness and sectarianismPregnant women must be respected by medics, says regulatorComment: Optimism is suddenly in the air – and even Remainers are starting to feel itBritish skiier dies in northern Japan avalanchePhilippines records first coronavirus death outside of China as another city shuts downCoronavirus: a quick guide to the outbreak sweeping the world Britain is ready to speak for itself at WTO\u0026#39s top tableBoris Johnson team \u0026#39infuriated\u0026#39 as EU reneges on free trade dealDaughter of woman killed on smart motorway accuses Highways England of being responsible for her deathNHS Trusts spent £20 million battling whistleblowers, workplace discrimination claims and employment disputes Rape victims waiting almost three years to see suspects charged Nigel Farage won\u0026#39t join Donald Trump\u0026#39s presidential campaign to ensure Brexit is delivered properlyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/01/31/15/infact-norway-electric-car.jpg","title":"electric cars facts hybrid charging battery power energy pros cons","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Don’t some electric cars run on hydrogen?How far will one go on a charge?What are the advantages of an electric car?What are the disadvantages?Don’t they take ages to charge?Will they get easier to charge and go further in future?What about hybrids?Aren’t electric cars all a bit oddball?On my electric car odyssey, I thought I ought to start by sharing some basics with you, in Q\u0026ampA form. I mean, very basic. I’ve driven a fair few in my time – and this year will be sampling many more. This is a bit of what I’ve learned, imperfectly, thus far.\u0026nbspIt is not, for these purposes, a “hybrid”, like the Toyota\u0026nbspPrius\u0026nbspor any other vehicle that also has an internal combustion engine on board (with one of two very particular exceptions).\u0026nbspAn electric car is a pure thing – it runs completely and solely on its batteries. When they run out, you stop moving.\u0026nbspI like to think of it as a cross between a washing machine, a laptop and,\u0026nbsperm, a car. So, your car is driven entirely by electric power – powerful lithium-ion batteries (like in your laptop) sending electricity to an electric motor (like your washing machine) which drives the road wheels (like on your motor car).\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.210 Prince of Wales Drive, Battersea, London210 Prince of Wales Drive, Battersea, LondonThe electricity stored in the batteries mostly comes from being plugged into the mains (there are various charging options, most commonly a fast charger attached to the side of your home, if you have the space). Some will be regenerated from the car itself, saving power otherwise wasted when braking, for example.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp2 Don’t some electric cars run on hydrogen?Yes, but they are not much more than prototypes, with only a handful of filling stations currently. Critics say using a hydrogen fuel cell to generate the electricity for the batteries simply adds an additional stage of energy accumulation and the manufacture of the hydrogen could be problematic, if it requires a disproportionate amount of non-renewable electricity.\u0026nbsp3 How far will one go on a charge?Well, that depends, but you can count on a modern mainstream electric car these days to bae able to take you 200 to 250 miles (conservatively) on a single charge – a\u0026nbspKia\u0026nbspe-Niro, say, or Hyundai\u0026nbspKona\u0026nbspelectric. In the right hands, 300 miles might be possible. This, by the way is two or three times the usual range you’d experience a few years ago.\u0026nbspFeeling the spark: Drivers learning to love electric carsThe most advanced models, such as the famous Tesla range, will go on and on for near enough 400 miles. Some of the smaller more urban-oriented models, such as the new electric Smart cars will be good for about 100 miles.\u0026nbspThe rest is down to how you drive and when. Winter means the batteries tend to run down faster and you’ll likely get a shorter range.\u0026nbspIf you drive hard and fast you’ll use up more energy than otherwise, just like in a petrol or diesel car. Over along time the ability of the batteries to take and store a charge will deteriorate (just like your smartphone or laptop).Yes. To buy or lease you’re looking at a premium of some thousands of pounds. So, let’s take an example, the Hyundai\u0026nbspKona, a compact\u0026nbspSUV.\u0026nbsp With a conventional petrol engine you can pick one up at a list price of £17,505. For the hybrid version (petrol plus electric power generated on-board) you’ll need to fork out £22,495. For the\u0026nbspBEV\u0026nbspHyundai\u0026nbspKona\u0026nbspelectric, the price jumps to £35,100, or £32,600 when you take into account the government grant for electric cars of up to £3,500. \u0026nbspAgainst the usually higher purchase price or monthly PCP or lease fee you need to balance the savings you make compared t petrol or diesel: far cheaper fuel spending on your electricity tariff) lower running costs (fewer moving mechanical parts and consumables eg exhaust pipe, alternator, engine) and a range of lower taxes and congest and parking charges. Electric cars are exempt from road tax, carry lower benefit-in-kind tax liabilities for commercial users, usually form congestion charges and city bans, and can enjoy cheaper parking. There’s also a government subsidy of up to £500 for a home charger.\u0026nbspWhy have electric cars failed to spark with consumers? Has Tesla hastened the death of Britain’s electric car revolution?Grant Shapps’ plan for electric cars will make China a motoring giantWhether this makes financial sense really depends your pattern of car usage – the number of miles you do a year, and the type of journeys. With a lot of medium range commuting for example (say 60 miles a day) an electric car could pay for itself within a few years for sustained long-distance travelling then a diesel might make more sense.5 What are the advantages of an electric car?Apart from the financial ones it is of course far better for the environment. There are many debates about, say, the cost (in environmental terms) of mining rare minerals for the batteries, or transporting them vast distances to factories, or the energy used in making them. Also obviously an electric car that runs on electricity generated from soar power is better than one where the electricity happens to be generated by burning coal (ins or far as anyone can know this when they plug in).\u0026nbspHowever a reasonable assumption is that all electric cars are greener than any internal combustion engined equivalent, and that any public transport (rail or bus) is usually greener than any private alternative.Don’t forget that electric cars are very refined – being almost silent at any speed, and the acceleration form rest is startlingly fast, though they tend to run out of puff as they approach their top speeds. In other words they can be good to drive and to be driven in.6 What are the disadvantages?Surprisingly few, though it does depend on your circumstances. If you live in a flat or a terraced house, charging from home is obviously impossible or difficult, and the ease of use of an electric vehicle is much reduced. If you imagine that you’ll have to do journeys of more than 400 miles without warning, then an internal combustion engine is a surer way of getting wherever it is you might conceivably wish to go – though you’d need to take a break anyway.\u0026nbspIt’s fair to add that some of the public charging infrastructure leaves a bit to be desired – it could usefully be much bigger, more reliable and easier to use.And of course you do need to balance the financial sums against the clear practical and environmental plusses of being a green driver.\u0026nbsp7 Don’t they take ages to charge?Yes and no. The Tesla is an exception, in many ways, because it has a dedicated network of ultra-fast chargers, as well as being chargeable at home.\u0026nbspMost owners of electric cars have to rely on charging at home – but don’t\u0026nbsp have much trouble charging because they most likely have a home charging point, which does mean off-street parking for the moment. If you take a mainstream option like the Hyundai\u0026nbspKona\u0026nbspelectricity home, using a regular\u0026nbsp7kW\u0026nbspcharging point via its own cable a near-full zero to 80 per cent charge takes around 9 hours.A similar charge with a rapid charger (such as you’d fine at, say, motorway services)\u0026nbsptakes around an hour and a quarter. 75 minutes.\u0026nbspIn an emergency, you can also use a domestic three-pin charging lead, plugged into the mains at home like you’d plug in a kettle. However you’d looking at about 24 hours for a full charge – because the batteries are so big and the trickle form the domestic system so modest.\u0026nbsp8 Will they get easier to charge and go further in future?Yes. Much of the progress in the usefulness of the electric car is coming from improvements in battery “density” – the amount of useful power that can be stored in a an ever-more compact way.The battery pack is usually stored lower in the car, under the floor or the seats, and this can help with keeping the car stable (lower centre of gravity). Given that these units can grow very hot and need ventilation or water cooling for example, and have to be protected from water ingress (if fording a stream say, or just in a heavy downpour) , the progress in engineering in this field is truly impressive.\u0026nbspHowever, eventually the rate of improvement in range and efficiency will slow, and that might well mark an optimal moment to make a purchase or take on an electric car lease. But we cannot know when this will happen.9 What about hybrids?Well, what about hybrids? They are not electric cars. This is because they are, as the name implies, hybrids – a cross between an electric car and a traditional one powered by a petrol or diesel engine. Thus well-known hybrid models such as the Toyota\u0026nbspPrius\u0026nbsphave an internal combustion engine on board, as well as an electric motor and some batteries to boost performance and economy.\u0026nbspIn a hybrid the electric power is “self-generated”, which is to say that it comes from the engine regenerating and recycling power that might otherwise be wasted. So for example some of the power usually lost in heavy braking is instead sent back via the electric motor working “backwards” to the batteries, where it is stored for later use.\u0026nbspI drove 300 miles in an electric car and here’s what happenedMost hybrids pair an electric and a petrol engine because the two units tend to complement each other in use diesel-electric hybrids are rarer. “Mild” hybrids are just that – they have only a small ethic motor and minimal battery storage just to give a slight edge to reduce emissions and improve economy. The green advantage is quite marginal.\u0026nbspPlug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) have the additional option of charging from the mains, as with an electric car, but it is not necessary to do so.\u0026nbspThe drawback with the hybrid technology is the constant trade-offs that have to made between the energy saved through the battery-electric motor system, set against the additional weight of them, which of course tends to raise fuel consumption. Clever software can minimise these trade-offs to more acceptable levels, but they will always be there, as compared to a\u0026nbspBEV. Hybrids, indeed, in their complexity and weight, can represent the e worst of both worlds.\u0026nbsp10 Aren’t electric cars all a bit oddball?They have been, yes, but the next few months year will see the launch of some very well-known models with full-electric versions.\u0026nbsp These will include: the Vauxhall\u0026nbspCorsa-e Peugeot 208 electric Volvo\u0026nbspXC40\u0026nbspRecharge and the Mini electric. They join an already quiet impressive variety of electric cars on sale or soon to go on sale.From the tiny\u0026nbspSkoda\u0026nbspCiti GOe-iV\u0026nbspand Smart EQ through the Renault Zoe to the Nissan leaf to MG ZS and the Jaguar\u0026nbspiPace\u0026nbspthere are already options to match your tastes and budget. And there is also a small market in used models such as the Renault\u0026nbspFluence, Mitsubishi\u0026nbspIMEV, Vauxhall\u0026nbspAmpera\u0026nbspor first generation Nissan Leaf that might also suit.These cars will tend to have shorter ranges, though, while older Renaults may still have their batteries on monthly lease from the company. As always – do your own research, but you can approach an electric car with more positivity than ever before.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

His celebrity crush is Lily James.Meanwhile, the show has been sponsored by fast fashion brands (Missguided and then I Saw it First) for the last three years, giving viewers the opportunity to shop the female Islanders’ looks directly. Personally, I’ve always thought that Love Island contestants dress terribly: it’s Benidorm beaches meets Kardashian kitsch. But with prices starting at £5, the clothes are devastatingly cheap. Far cheaper than the designer garb we see on most TV stars. So I can understand the appeal. But I also know that every time someone buys one of those bikinis, or sparkly bodycon dresses, they’re adding fuel to fast fashion’s ever-blazing fire.But perhaps the onus is not on the consumer, or even the Love Island star. Lauren Bravo, author of How to Break Up with Fast Fashion, explains that the brands are the ones who should really be shouldering responsibility here. “These days we’re so used to instant gratification, and the idea that anyone can aspire to celebrity, that it seems reasonable for TV stars to sell us clothes and vice versa,” she tells me. “And it’s really hard, because I know what it’s like to love fashion and crave the clothes you’re seeing on people you admire, not to mention the huge social pressures on young people to keep that endless parade of new looks rolling over on their Instagram grid, so telling people who can’t necessarily afford to spend any more that their shopping habits are destroying the planet can feel snobbish and unfair.”Why I\u0027m giving up fast fashion #20PledgesBut, Bravo adds, the fact remains that those clothes simply cannot be made as cheaply as they’re sold. Somewhere down the line, someone is paying the price, whether it’s a garment worker barely surviving on poverty wages or a community grappling with industrial pollution.That’s not to say you can’t “get the Islander look” in a sustainable and eco-friendly way. Bravo suggests heading to secondhand shopping apps, like Depop, where you’ll find plenty of pre-loved items not dissimilar from the ones you see on the show. Some of them will be from fast fashion brands, but if you’re buying it there, you’re keeping that item in circulation as opposed to letting it wind up in landfill.\u0026nbspOr, you could take a closer look at some of the trends championed by Love Islanders, both past and present, and see that many (cycling shorts, mesh, high-waisted jeans and leopard print) hark back to another era, like, say, the 1990s. And what better way to shop Nineties fashion than by heading to your local Beyond Retro or Rokit, which will be jam-packed with original clothing from the decade that is not only more sustainable, but a hell of a lot cooler, too.How to Break Up with Fast Fashion by Lauren Bravo (£12.99, Headline Home) is out nowOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The reading was in line with analysts’ forecasts that it would hit the neutral 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.New export orders slipped back after rising for the first time in over a year in December. However, the survey was conducted before January 20, the day the world receiving reported numbers of cases of the virus. “So this will be seen as largely meaningless,” said Jim Reid, global head of credit research at Deutsche Bank.There have been 213 confirmed deaths (up from 170 on Thursday) while the number of confirmed cases stands at 9,692 (up from 7,783). The number of confirmed cases has now topped the official recordings of 8,096 cases in the SARS epidemic.Deutsche’s China economists believe the turning point is not far away, and that assuming the measures taken are effective at containing the outbreak, the peak of new cases outside Hubei province — where Wuhan is located — will likely happen at some point next week.There has been growing concern in financial markets that Beijing may have sought to conceal the start and full extent to the virus to contain the risk of panic.Georgieva said the world was facing more unpredictability whether from pandemics, climate shocks and geopolitical tensions. “Preparedness, prevention and early action have to be in the bloodstream of policy makers,” she said.According to research by ING bank, SARS knocked 1.0 per cent off Chinese GDP back in 2003, but the huge uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus makes the macro impact very difficult to forecast.It said that a 1 per cent fall in Chinese growth would mainly hit the Asia-Pacific region with countries such as South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia losing 0.3 percentage points. The impact on the UK would be around just 0.02 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.On Thursday, the Bank of England kept interest rates on hold after signals of a pick-up. The minutes of its meeting showed that it expects the UK House Price Index to have risen quite strongly in both the final quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of this year.Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said the figures were another sign that the UK housing market has “at least temporarily stepped up a gear”.“Mortgage approvals in December were\u0026nbsphighly likely\u0026nbspsignificantly lifted by increased confidence and reduced uncertainties among housing market participants following the decisive general election result,” he said.Why the calm over interest rates might not lastFigures from the bank on Friday also showed growth in consumer credit, rising\u0026nbspby £1.2bn, while credit card borrowing increased\u0026nbspby the most since February, up by £412m.Household spending has helped to drive Britain’s economy over the past few years, helped by record levels of employment and a recovery in wage growth,\u0026nbspbut there were signs of a slowdown in spending in late 2019.The bank’s data also showed that December saw the biggest increase on record in net purchases of British government bonds by foreign investors –\u0026nbspan increase of £28.6bn. The records date back to 1982.Meanwhile, it emerged that the bank will be repaid €58m (£49m) by the European Central Bank after the UK leaves the European Union. Brexit will mean that the Bank of England pulls out of the European System of Central Banks.The bank holds 14.3 per cent of the European Central Bank’s subscribed capital, of which 3.75 per cent –\u0026nbspequivalent to €58m\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspis paid up. The capital will be reallocated between the other EU central banks.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Conservative Party won with an overall majorityA dog outside a polling station during the general election in NorthumberlandOne poster on the Debt Camel advice website said their payment was an “absolute joke”, adding that they had paid more in interest on\u0026nbspone of their dozens of loans than they would receive in redress. Another wrote: “My claim was £986. I’m getting about £43. It’s an absolute disgrace.”However, some customers were more positive about the payouts. Sam\u0026nbspWindle, who took out loans with\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspseveral years ago, said that although 4.3 per cent was less than he had hoped for, it was better than nothing.His redress amount was initially £5,200 before being reduced to £2,700, of which he received just £121. However, like many other\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspcustomers, he was not aware that he was due compensation until the administrators contacted him.Mr Windle, who has now cleared all of his debts, was at one point paying off around £300 interest to\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspon each of seven payday loans. “It was a vicious cycle really. I can honestly say the day I paid it all off was the happiest day of my life.”He added: “The only frustrating about the compensation\u0026nbspis that it was due to be paid in January bit that’s been put back to some point in the next four weeks. The communication from the administrators has been pretty poor really.”Sara Williams, a personal finance expert who runs the Debt Camel website, said: “People were told last year by the Wonga administrators what their compensation amount had been calculated at and they were warned their payout would be ‘significantly less’.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On the average compensation of about £1000, they will get only £43.\u0026nbsp“Some people, remembering the stress the Wonga loans had caused them,\u0026nbsphave described this as an insult and not proper compensation at all.”Wonga had faced a barrage of criticism over the high interest it charged on loans and was accused of targeting those who were most vulnerable.In 2014, the firm wrote off £220m worth of debt belonging to 330,000 customers after admitting making loans to people who could not afford to repay them.Administrators had received 389,621 eligible claims from those said to have been sold unaffordable loans as of August 2019, according to documents filed with Companies House.Prior to its collapse in August 2018, Wonga blamed its difficulties on a “significant” increase in people making claims in relation to historic loans.

For this quarter, very likely there would be some negative impact.

The reading was in line with analysts’ forecasts that it would hit the neutral 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.New export orders slipped back after rising for the first time in over a year in December. However, the survey was conducted before January 20, the day the world receiving reported numbers of cases of the virus. “So this will be seen as largely meaningless,” said Jim Reid, global head of credit research at Deutsche Bank.There have been 213 confirmed deaths (up from 170 on Thursday) while the number of confirmed cases stands at 9,692 (up from 7,783). The number of confirmed cases has now topped the official recordings of 8,096 cases in the SARS epidemic.Deutsche’s China economists believe the turning point is not far away, and that assuming the measures taken are effective at containing the outbreak, the peak of new cases outside Hubei province — where Wuhan is located — will likely happen at some point next week.There has been growing concern in financial markets that Beijing may have sought to conceal the start and full extent to the virus to contain the risk of panic.Georgieva said the world was facing more unpredictability whether from pandemics, climate shocks and geopolitical tensions. “Preparedness, prevention and early action have to be in the bloodstream of policy makers,” she said.According to research by ING bank, SARS knocked 1.0 per cent off Chinese GDP back in 2003, but the huge uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus makes the macro impact very difficult to forecast.It said that a 1 per cent fall in Chinese growth would mainly hit the Asia-Pacific region with countries such as South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia losing 0.3 percentage points. The impact on the UK would be around just 0.02 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown.

She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.On Thursday, the Bank of England kept interest rates on hold after signals of a pick-up. The minutes of its meeting showed that it expects the UK House Price Index to have risen quite strongly in both the final quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of this year.Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said the figures were another sign that the UK housing market has “at least temporarily stepped up a gear”.“Mortgage approvals in December were\u0026nbsphighly likely\u0026nbspsignificantly lifted by increased confidence and reduced uncertainties among housing market participants following the decisive general election result,” he said.Why the calm over interest rates might not lastFigures from the bank on Friday also showed growth in consumer credit, rising\u0026nbspby £1.2bn, while credit card borrowing increased\u0026nbspby the most since February, up by £412m.Household spending has helped to drive Britain’s economy over the past few years, helped by record levels of employment and a recovery in wage growth,\u0026nbspbut there were signs of a slowdown in spending in late 2019.The bank’s data also showed that December saw the biggest increase on record in net purchases of British government bonds by foreign investors –\u0026nbspan increase of £28.6bn. The records date back to 1982.Meanwhile, it emerged that the bank will be repaid €58m (£49m) by the European Central Bank after the UK leaves the European Union. Brexit will mean that the Bank of England pulls out of the European System of Central Banks.The bank holds 14.3 per cent of the European Central Bank’s subscribed capital, of which 3.75 per cent –\u0026nbspequivalent to €58m\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspis paid up. The capital will be reallocated between the other EU central banks.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It would most likely be the new USB-C standard or something like it, meaning that Apple would have to change the port used in their iPhones.Apple hits out at EU proposal to force phones to have same chargerEuropean politicians passed the motion by\u0026nbsp582 votes to 10. While it does not introduce any new rules, it calls on the European Commission to examine new legislation, and the Commission has already suggested that it could introduce new rules forcing companies to adopt a single charger.It also suggests that companies should work to ensure they all use the same wireless charging standard. That largely happens already, with most phone companies using the Qi standard.If such a change were to happen, people would no longer need to get a new charger each time they buy a new device, the motion noted.Ten years ago, the European Parliament signed an agreement with technology companies in which they would voluntarily work to reduce the numbers of chargers across different devices. Politicians say that agreement has failed, though some including Apple have argued that those ten years have seen a vast reduction in the number of ports, with just two – Lightning and USB-C – used on almost all new devices.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Last year, the company unveiled the Switch\u0026nbspLite\u0026nbspas well as quietly bumping up the battery life of the larger version of the console. Those were made possible as a consequence of updated Nvidia chips on the inside.EA says people prefer not to play its games on the Nintendo SwitchFurukawa suggested that the console is in its midway phase and that it would be looking for further growth opportunities for the new console.“According to the conventional wisdom for dedicated video game platforms, Nintendo Switch should be entering the midway phase of the hardware lifecycle,” he said. “But we believe we have built a foundation on which we can pursue further growth opportunities for Nintendo Switch.”He pointed to the recent announcement of a special Animal Crossing version of the Switch, which will arrive in Japan alongside the game\u0027s release date in March. That suggests that yet more special designs might come to the Switch, even if there is no update to the hardware inside for 2020.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It also confirms a prediction of Einstein\u0027s general theory of relativity.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFrame-dragging has been spotted on Earth, where satellites have examined the gravitational field of our planet as it rotates. But the effect is very small, difficult to measure and hard to examine.More massive objects, such as neutron stars or white dwarfs, give scientists the chance to examine the phenomenon at a much grander scale.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The pulsar served as something of a clock: they could watch as the pulses arrived, measuring them very precisely, over a period of twenty years, and watch for changes as they did.Scientists release audio recording of sound of gravitational wavesThey found that the pulses did indeed drift, as predicted by the theory. After discounting other possible causes, they were able to conclude that the drift was caused by the white dwarf causing the phenomenon of frame-dragging.The idea that rotating bodies would be able to drag spacetime\u0026nbsparound with them was first suggested by Austrian\u0026nbspmathematicians Josef\u0026nbspLense\u0026nbspand Hans\u0026nbspThirring, who suggested it three years after Einstein published his\u0026nbspgeneral theory of relativity.Though the effect can be seen at a very minor and subtle level on Earth, using gyroscopes and other technology, it is 100 million times more potent in the case of a rapidly spinning white dwarf.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is a vital service needed to secure the future of thousands of people who have made the UK their home but because of their circumstances are unable to complete the application on their own.Charities providing this service don’t know if the funding is going to continue beyond the end of March and there comes a point at which you have to end staff\u0026nbspcontracts, because it’s a financial risk to continue employing people without dedicated funding.“Even if the Home Office does decide to provide more funding – which we absolutely think it must to avoid creating misery and chaos for vulnerable people – then it means we’ll lose three critical months because we have to carry out recruitment and then provide training so that people are up to speed on the new system.Bethan\u0026nbspLant, caseworker manager at the charity, said that due to the complexity of many cases, they had to work with them on a long term basis – which was not possible without guaranteed funding.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Caseworkers are working with women who have experienced domestic violence, trying to evidence that they have been here for five years when they haven’t got access to a lot of the documents they need and people with mental health issues who don’t have passports, helping them to approach their embassies to obtain the documents they need,” she said.EU nationals who cannot prove ‘settled status’ denied basic rightsIt’s very difficult for us to continue working with these people if we don’t know whether our caseworkers will be there in a month\u0027s time to be able to continue that work. It leaves us stuck.”Nicole\u0026nbspMasri, senior legal officer at charity Rights of Women, which runs an advice service funded by the Home Office to help domestic abuse victims apply to the EU settlement scheme, echoed these concerns, saying any break in continuity of the service would be a “real set-back”.The government can’t afford to lose any time in supporting people to access the scheme before the June 2021 deadline, she added.Christopher\u0026nbspDesira, solicitor at the law firm\u0026nbspSeraphus\u0026nbspand adviser at the European Commission Representation in the UK, said some charities had been forced to end their support for EU nationals because the uncertainty had left them unable to take on new cases.He said the European commission had been asking the Home Office whether there would be an extension of funding for the last few months and requesting details, but that it had as yet received no response.Mr\u0026nbspDesira\u0026nbspadded: “I met with the operations team in Liverpool about a month ago, and internally they support the funding being extended, because it makes their job easier. But it’s a ministerial decision.”A Home Office spokesperson confirmed that the\u0026nbspcurrent grant funding scheme was set to finish at the end of March 2020, and said the department was\u0026nbspexploring options for the financial year of 202021.They added: “We have already had over 2.5 million people given status under the EU settlement scheme and we are always looking at ways to make sure everyone with the right to status gets it.\u0026nbsp“As well as providing funding for charities which have supported hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people, there are over 1,500 Home Office staff working on the EU Settlement Scheme and 250 Settlement Resolution Centre staff in place to provide assistance to applicants with any questions about the scheme or who need help applying.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Conservative Party won with an overall majorityMs Sturgeon’s initiative came after a YouGov poll found a majority of Scots in favour of independence for the first time since 2015, by a margin of 51 per cent to 49 per cent.The first minister said: “We have never been stronger ... And independence has never been closer.“It is our strength that will make it a reality. The strength of our arguments. The strength of our unity and our commitment to the cause. The strength of our values.Westminster doesn’t care about Scotland. Expect independence to surgeIf we want to keep Scotland in the UK, we have to fight for itPM rejects Sturgeon’s call for second Scottish independence referendum“The strength of our vision of an open, progressive, outward-looking Scotland for all who live here, no matter where they come from.”And she added: “History tells us that change often comes quickly after many years when the obstacles seemed great. In Scotland I believe we are on the cusp of such a moment.”Ms Sturgeon said that Scotland was being taken out of the EU “against the will of the vast majority of us” and that for many Scots, it would be a moment of “sadness tinged with anger”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Conservative Party won with an overall majorityA dog outside a polling station during the general election in NorthumberlandOne poster on the Debt Camel advice website said their payment was an “absolute joke”, adding that they had paid more in interest on\u0026nbspone of their dozens of loans than they would receive in redress. Another wrote: “My claim was £986. I’m getting about £43. It’s an absolute disgrace.”However, some customers were more positive about the payouts. Sam\u0026nbspWindle, who took out loans with\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspseveral years ago, said that although 4.3 per cent was less than he had hoped for, it was better than nothing.His redress amount was initially £5,200 before being reduced to £2,700, of which he received just £121. However, like many other\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspcustomers, he was not aware that he was due compensation until the administrators contacted him.Mr Windle, who has now cleared all of his debts, was at one point paying off around £300 interest to\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspon each of seven payday loans. “It was a vicious cycle really. I can honestly say the day I paid it all off was the happiest day of my life.”He added: “The only frustrating about the compensation\u0026nbspis that it was due to be paid in January bit that’s been put back to some point in the next four weeks. The communication from the administrators has been pretty poor really.”Sara Williams, a personal finance expert who runs the Debt Camel website, said: “People were told last year by the Wonga administrators what their compensation amount had been calculated at and they were warned their payout would be ‘significantly less’.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On the average compensation of about £1000, they will get only £43.\u0026nbsp“Some people, remembering the stress the Wonga loans had caused them,\u0026nbsphave described this as an insult and not proper compensation at all.”Wonga had faced a barrage of criticism over the high interest it charged on loans and was accused of targeting those who were most vulnerable.In 2014, the firm wrote off £220m worth of debt belonging to 330,000 customers after admitting making loans to people who could not afford to repay them.Administrators had received 389,621 eligible claims from those said to have been sold unaffordable loans as of August 2019, according to documents filed with Companies House.Prior to its collapse in August 2018, Wonga blamed its difficulties on a “significant” increase in people making claims in relation to historic loans.

Sometimes, we exaggerate things.”Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Horses panic as a spot fire runs through the property of Lawrence and Clair Cowie near Canberra, Australia.

Almost a chance for them to prove that they are worthy of joining the gang.The -year-old runs Stand United community group which was set up following the death of -year-old family friend Tashaun Aird who was brutally kned to death in Stoke Newington.The teenager was set upon and kned in the chest and back despite telling his attackers he was not part of the Hackney gang, Red Pitch.She added: “Stoke Newington has always been considered the posher side of Hackney and was thought of being up-and-coming.“Some houses are worth more than £million. So what you are essentially saying to younger people is that they can’t afford to buy anything nice around here.“The expensive houses are right next to the poorer parts which does create a rt, it creates a class barrier.“Young people feel as though they are not going to afford a nice place where they’re from unless they join a gang and sell drugs.“Young people are confused and that mentality needs to change.“Gang members aren’t just targeting other gangs – it can happen to anyone. It can be a case of mistaken identity or someone can get caught in the crossfire.“The people in the gangs are also getting younger, some are as young as  and they have no fear. They feel as they can do as they please.”Lara, who as a detention officer sees first hand the trouble on the streets also told a sobering tale of a young boy who pulled out a -inch kne asit was normal when he was arrested.Another Stoke Newington mum, Lena Corner highlighted the issue by appearing on Question Time last week to say her -year-old son had been mugged three times in the past year.The -year-old said: “It’s just that fear he lives with every day. It’s that type of fear you have in your stomach and he has got that.”Just yards from the park where he was mugged, The Sun Online witnessed cops carrying out a stop and search on a group of kids at .pm – highlighting the issues officers are facing in the upmarket area.It comes amid rising fury in the borough – where the majority of residents are aged  to  with young “dependent children” – that not enough is being done to tackle crime.Residents claim the police cant cope with the rise in muggings and stabbings in an area where  burglaries,  robberies and  incidents of anti-social behaviour were recorded last year.Figures show that six per cent of people living in the Stoke Newington ward are unemployed and statistics show that last year , crimes were investigated – but just  offenders were dealt with in court.Another resident added: “It’s getting out of hand in the area – the recent stabbings on Shakspeare Walk, the drug dealing – and the police can’t cope, undoubtedly due to cuts.”Lara, a mum of two young children and two older stepsons, is now calling on parents to do more and spot the early signs of gang grooming.She said: “Parents need to know the signstheir child is being groomed by a gang.“If young people are carrying hundreds of pounds, why are they carrying that amount  How have they got that money “We want to educate parents to spot these signs early and maybe these terrible things on the streets won’t happen.”Lara also highlighted how there are at least four gangs in the Stoke Newington area covering the N post code.She added: “Children will start with mugging and that’s how it begins.“It is happening right on your doorstep, it might not be your children, but it’s happening.“We want to work with parents and local schools to educate children and adults that there is a dferent path they can go down. They can turn their le around.”Her aunt, Mercinth Anderson, , who also helped set up Stand United, said her friend was forced to move her -year-old son back to Jamaica over fears he will get caught up in gang violence.She added: “Unfortunately children are becoming easy targets because they have all of the latest equipment and gear.“They have become too materialistic and have the latest headphones, trainers and smartphones. It is easy pickings for these gangs.“Parents need to think twice about buying their children the latest iPhone because it could make their kids easy targets.“My son was nearly mugged  years ago when he was  outside the police station, the people that are doing it have no shame and no fear.“I’ve been living here  years and this is the worst I’ve seen. I used to tell my son to be home before it was dark and before a certain time.“But timing and whether it’s dark or not doesn’t seem to bother children now. They just don’t care.”The mum-of-one, who organises the Stand United meetings at the local Pedro Club, added: “My friend had to move her son back to Jamaica because of what is going on in London.“But some people aren’t able to do that. They either don’t have family living where or they can’t afford to move away.”University lecturer and local resident Caroline Bolam slammed authorities for “ghetto-ising” the area – and blamed the council for pedestrianising streets.She said: “The council needs to look at the impact of its traffic plans, and there has been a signicant rise in crime since these closures were introduced.“My concern is that the council is ghetto-ising the area – creating quiet alleyways with no cars or headlights where kids can congregate.”It comes as Sun Online analysis of crime stats show the area – made up of around  streets – suffered  violent or sexual offences in .There were also  vehicle crimes,  drug offences and  cases of criminal damage and arson in the area.Just eight per cent of offences investigated in the area resulted in a suspect being charged. Of these, only three per cent of offenders have been dealt with by a court.A further five per cent of cases were dealt with by police through punishments such as a warning or a caution.Met Police statistics claim  per cent of the , offences reported last year are still under investigation. Four per cent have been closed with no further action taken.Stoke Newington has become blighted by kne crime and sits in the borough of Hackney, which has one of the worst kne possession rates in London.In November , there were  kne-point robberies on Brooke Road and Narford Road alone.In each incident cash and debit cards were stolen from terried victims.Dad-of-five Steven Brown, , died after being stabbed in the heart outside a builder’s merchants on Mathias Road on April  last year.A total of  people have been arrested in connection with the broad daylight attack and later released or bailed. So far no-one has been charged.Just last month, police released CCTV of a suspect after a member of staff was glassed in the face and two others were punched in the face inside the Three Crowns pub on Stoke Newington High Street.Mum-of-three Mrs Corner told Question Time her son was mugged by an older gang who threatened to stab him in January last year before being targeted again in broad daylight in Clissold Park.The third mugging came just a week later in the same park when a gang took his phone and forced him to give then his cash card PIN number and Apple ID.She later told Thegetting mugged has become “the norm” for local children and said cops “completely bungled” efforts to catch her son’s attacker.Mrs Corner also blamed the number of children excluded from schools and cuts to policing for the increase in muggings.She said: “It’s not a good way to spend your childhood. Teenagers round here have totally changed the way they behave and socialise as a result of all these muggings.“It’s notyou’ll get mugged but when and how many times  It’s asnow it’s an accepted part of growing up.“I don’t like criticising the police but the investigation seemed completely incompetent.”The Sun Online has contacted Scotland Yard for comment.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I suddenly had to find a months money.I didnt know what I was going to do.Nichola, who works for a charity and used to be a benefits adviser, wasnt eligible for the Flexible Support Fund or a budgeting loan to help with the costs.She added: I looked at every opportunity for some help, but I dont have a wealthy family, or someone in the area to look after my child.Nichola says the current system unfairly penalises lower earners, when other childcare systems dont require Brits to fork up upfront.And like many working mums, over the school holidays she has to folk out thousands of pounds extra upfront too.Its women who are struggling the most here,  per cent of single-parent families are women, she added.I dread to think what its like for people on minimum wage, how they can afford it.How can you justy paying childcare costs upfront for someone earning £, in advance, but not someone who is on £, Its so frustrating, so detrimental, to iniduals lives, and potentially hundreds of thousands of lives.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. Luckily her new job allowed her to cut her hours and work from home to make the situation work for her.But she hopes the DWP will shake-up the system for it to help others in future get back into work.A DWP spokesperson said: We cannot comment on an ongoing case."},{"url":null,"title":"eu uk leave brexit independent","story":"Forty-seven years and  days after we joined. Three decades since the rot set in with the drive towards a United States of Europe. Seven years after David Cameron promised a referendum and ½ traumatic years since Leave won it. It is hard to exaggerate the magnitude of this moment.Or the relief that Brexit, after all the ision and rancour, will at last be done. That our democracy ­ultimately prevailed over those who fought to thwart it.Other EU nations saw their referendums overturned or ignored. We would not be bullied into a rethink.It is true that nothing much will change this year during the “transition period”. But at pm Brexit becomes irreversible.We will be the first country to leave the EU. And in The Sun’s view we will never rejoin, never again surrender our independence.Instead we will be firing the starting gun on a new era full of excitement, potential and promise:The birth of a new Britain, setting our own laws, controlling our borders and trading independently with the entire world.This will not be Little Britain — quite the opposite. Brexit is not some nostalgic fantasy about the Empire.We will be outward-looking, a magnet for the brightest and best migrants — and for those already making a living here, a permanent, welcoming home.Many Sun readers will be ecstatic to be out. Some not so much. We understand that.But this paper — which was always pro-Common Market but increasingly eurosceptic as the EU grabbed more and more of our ­sovereignty — backed leaving all the way.So we want to pay tribute here to the heroes of Brexit, the men and women without whom it would never have happened:Boris Johnson, who went from eurosceptic Brussels reporter to charismatic figurehead of the Leave campaign and finally to the Prime Minister whose election victory last December  assured he could deliver Brexit.Michael Gove, his cerebral and articulate Cabinet ally who sacriced political and personal friendships to fight for his principles.Dominic Cummings, the campaign genius who with Matthew Elliott and the Vote Leave team triumphed against huge odds in  and last year helped orchestrate Boris’s ­decisive win at the polls.Nigel Farage, the controversial former Ukip chief whose pressure forced David Cameron in  to offer a referendum — and whose Brexit Party then terried the Tories into getting serious about delivering Brexit in full . . . out of the single market and customs union.Dan Hannan, the brains behind the project for  years, whose powers of persuasion rallied Tories to the cause. His ally Douglas Carswell was pivotal too.Jacob Rees-Mogg, Iain Duncan Smith, Steve Baker, Bill Cash and their ERG of Tory backbenchers whose refusal to compromise was admirable, evenThe Sun did despair of it when it threatened to destroy Brexit entirely.They have been vindicated. As has the ERG’s founder, the late ex-Tory MP Michael Spicer.We salute the Tory Cabinet ministers who campaigned for Brexit — notably Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, Home Secretary Priti Patel and Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers.From the Labour benches, Gisela Stuart and Kate Hoey shattered the Left’s bizarre consensus that the EU is a near-flawless bastion of liberal values and backed Leave.Ex-Labour MP Caroline Flint, like millions of other Remainers, insisted that upholding the result and our democracy was paramount.But other heroes and heroines planted the seeds of Brexit much earlier.Such as Corbyn’s idol Tony Benn, who before the first referendum on our Common Market membership in  rightly said it “would mean the end of Britain as a completely self-governing nation”.Margaret Thatcher, who in  discovered EC president Jacques Delors plotting to hand back union powers she had removed. She was having none of that — as her famous Bruges speech made clear.Later, as calls grew for yet more Brussels control, she told the Commons: “No, no, no.”The Sun’s “Up Yours, Delors” front page in  summarised our own feelings.Eurosceptic tycoon James Goldsmith launched the Referendum Party in  with just one policy: a vote on EU membership. Three years later Ukip picked up the baton.But not all our Brexit heroes backed Brexit.Many of its most outspoken opponents inadvertently steered millions towards Leave, hardened their resolve and even turned Remainers into Brexiteers:David Cameron, who promised a referendum he was far too confident he would win and catastrophically misjudged the electorate.George Osborne, whose apocalyptic predictions failed to terry Leave voters.Angela Merkel, whose refusal to give Cameron a better deal for Britain cost both dear.And the EU’s Jean-Claude Juncker, Donald Tusk and Michel Barnier, whose sneering and threats emboldened rather than cowed us. Likewise the EUParliament’s Guy Verhofstadt, who foolishly let a camera crew capture his team boasting of turning the UK into a “colony”. Imagine the effect that had.Then, of course, there’s Jeremy ­Corbyn, who damaged the Remain campaign and then gted Boris a stonking mandate.And ex-Lib Dem leader Jo “revoke Brexit” Swinson, who agreed to last month’s election under the delusion she could win it — but managed only to lose her own seat.There’s John Bercow, the ex-Speaker whose blatant bias and constitutional trickery convinced Leavers they made the right call. And his arrogant Tory co-conspirators Dominic Grieve and Oliver Letwin, who hoped to establish a Remainer pseudo-Government to enforce a second referendum — testing the public’s patience to their own destruction.Let’s not forget too the former Tories who merely pretended to “respect the referendum”, notably Anna Soubry, who then said single market and customs union membership was inevitable and charmingly told Leavers: “Suck it up”. And how about the glittering cast of Remoaner foghorns Take Tony Blair who, but for The Sun and others, would have forced us  years ago into the disastrous euro — the “burning building with no exits” as William Hague accurately described it.Blair, who then opened our borders to a flood of low-skilled migrants, ­further exposing the folly of free movement.Or his old spin doctor Alastair Campbell and former lackey Andrew Adonis, whose deranged doom-mongering and playground insults hardened Leavers’ hearts and repelled pragmatic Remainers at the same time.Or John Major, whose decision to adopt the  Maastricht Treaty, tying us even closer to the EU — but without a referendum — turbo-charged euroscepticism. A man whose increasingly shrill anti-Brexit outbursts merely convinced Leavers they were right.And how about the clueless celebs who thought abusing Leavers would compel them to think the “correct” thoughts  Or the BBC, whose routine europhile propaganda delivered vast numbers of votes for Leave  But there are Brexit heroes still greater than any of these:They are the .million voters, many Sun readers among them, who braved every threat and every slur, backed Leave in  and stuck to their guns last December.The Sun salutes you.Brexit will not be plain sailing. We are under no illusions. But we are convinced a fully independent Britain has a rosier future.And YOU made it happen. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At last we will take back control of trade, human rights and migration.You will forgive us I hope, Mr Juncker, a moment of celebration as we raise a glass to an independent and prosperous future.

The conditions are right to put the ­ision and rancour behind us. For our United Kingdom to be truly united.That will mean Leavers respecting and understanding their opponents’ sorrow. A tall order, perhaps, given the vitriol they have endured, but essential.It will mean the more extreme Remainers ending the abuse — and resisting the temptation to seize triumphantly on any setbacks that now arise. Indeed, it would be better to let the very terms “Leavers” and “Remainers” fall into irrelevance and disuse.Ours is a great country, of course, but one with substantial problems and a deep ­economic ide.The new freedoms over our laws, money, borders and trade — and our powerful new Government — can be catalysts for a vibrant, energetic, prosperous and more harmonious new era where wealth and opportunity are sp evenly across the country.It can be achieved by everyone coming together. By all of us getting behind Britain. That of course includes the millions of EU migrants who have made their lives here, make a vital contribution and must never misconstrue Brexit as a vote against them.Our island nation was simply never a good fit for the EU. We will be better off outside it — and the  other nations may well be too without our opposition holding them back. But it is vital, during this year’s standstill “transition period”, that they grasp what Brexit actually means.The omens for a trade deal look poor. The EU is living in the past, issuing bleak threats asstill dealing with the faint-hearted Theresa May Government and a country racked with self-doubt.It acts asBoris Johnson could even now negate Brexit by locking us into EU rules and ECJ judgments and allowing unfettered access to our fishing waters.But everything changed at the moment of his victory. His Government has a huge mandate and will sign the barest of free trade deals, or none, rather than sacrice ANY sovereignty.We will remain an integral part of the continent of Europe, physically and culturally. We can be the EU’s strongest friend as well as its neighbour.

And we’re not gods, and animals aren’t trash,” Newkirk said.She added: “We should all be in this together and really, consideration, respect, understanding, nonviolence — surely that’s something that everybody can embrace. Doesn’t matter what you look like.”An estimated  percent of Americans have a pet in their household, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.Advocating for calling animals “companions” rather than “pets” is just one of pushes for change of action from PETA.Last week, amid reports that the coronavirus outbreak may be linked to a food market in Wuhan, China, PETA encouraged people to go vegan.“We cannot expect to continue living on planet Earthwe continue to eat animals,” PETA said in a statement.“It’s really that simple. The easiest thing that you can do for your own health and the world we live in is to go vegan right now and persuade everyone you know to do the same.” PETA also advocated for the use of an articial groundhog to be used on Groundhog Day each year, as Newkirk said in a letter that Punxsutawney Phil endures great stress each year on the big day.Newkirk recently authored the recently released book, Animalkind.The book details research that animals are “astounding beings with intelligence, emotions, intricate communications networks, and myriad abilities,” a descriptor says.Do you have a story for The US Sun team Email us at exclusive@the-sun or call   .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s why I’m in here.I have to pee in a bag. I’ve got prostate cancer.“This country, you’ve always depended on justice, but I’ve never had justice. I’ve still not got justice. My le’s gone, it’s gone.I blame the justice system of this country, because it’s taken nearly  years for me to start, hopefully, to see some justice.Michael poured out his heart on Piers Morgan’s Le Stories and confessed he now lives the le of a recluse, with his Jack Russell, Dave, his only companion.He apologised for the first time over the death of party guest Stuart Lubbock in his pool and admitted: “I f***ed up.”In a tearful and emotional interview, Michael said: “I could not be more sad. I could not be more sorry that this event took place.“It was at my house and they don’t have all the answers to how he got these injuries. I could not be more sad or sorryI have to be for the rest of my le.“Of course it goes through my head and I want things dferent. I wish I could change it for them.“I f***ed up.

Brexit parties were held from Cornwall to Cumbria.Parliament Square was awash with Union Jacks as Nigel Farage had a beano that he had been planning for  years, chucking a metaphorical milkshake over everyone who ever dissed him.But this was not VE Day.Where Brexit was celebrated, the mood was one of patriotic pride rather than euphoria unbound.This was a very British departure — respectful, self-effacing and anxious not to cause offence.We refrained from sticking up two fingers. We were scrupulously polite.The UK started le outside the EU with no Big Ben ringing the chimes of freedom, no firework display setting the post-Brexit sky ablaze, no laser show on the white clfs of Dover.The big moment came at pm rather than midnight — the UK, now as always, a little out of step with our continental cousins in Brussels — so it did not even feel like New Year’s Eve.By midnight — already am in sleepy old Brussels — the party was winding down.As we left the EU, Downing Street lit up with red, white and blue lasers and an image of Big Ben, complete with a recording of the bongs.But the door of  Downing Street stayed firmly shut as the Prime Minister hosted a private party for staff.For all the nation knew, Boris could have been having an early night with Carrie and Dilyn the dog.Downing Street was as deserted as the Marie Celeste.Here was the strangest thing about Friday night — the total absence of Boris Johnson.The PM had recorded a speech full of optimistic talk about making Brexit a “storming success” and bringing the nation back together.But the BBC and ITV both refused to broadcast the speech, as Downing Street aides had refused to let them film it.Soyou wanted to see what the British Prime Minister said about this truly momentous moment in British history, you could not have seen it on our state broadcaster’s channels. UNBELIEVABLE.The BBC news studio was bathed in Brussels blue, asin mourning — so censoring Boris felt small-minded, ­churlish and petty beyond belief.I strongly suspect that ­refusing to broadcast Boris’s big Brexit-night speech will turn out to be the beginning of the end for the licence fee.If the BBC cannot look like a state broadcaster on a night of historic national importance, then it never will.But we didn’t need the Beeb to tell us that this was history happening before our eyes.The biggest mandate for anything in British history had FINALLY been honoured. Democracy had triumphed.After more than  years inside the European federalist experiment, the British people were masters of their own destiny once more. And while the national mood on Friday night was respectful for the feelings of the losers, perhaps that was because there is no need for ­triumphalism when you know you have won.The clock struck pm and Leavers and Remainers were all suddenly extinct.All those eye-swivelling nutjobs threatening to shove a Brexit p coin up their pious rectums in protest no longer seemed like a threat to ­democracy.They seemed worthy of pity.But after all the toxic ­isions of the past four years, the wounds will not heal quickly.The most vicious insult thrown at those of us who dared to vote to leave the EU was that we would all soon be dead. And so it is a bitter irony to reflect that Tony Blair, Michael Heseltine, John Major, Lord Adonis, Gina Miller, Anna Soubry and all the rest will never live long enough to drag us back into the European Union.At long last, Brexit’s uncivil war is done.And why Because the roots of British democracy run deep.Once we had voted to leave, it was ultimately unthinkable that we would ever remain — despite the fervent wishes of almost the entire British establishment, from the House of Lords and House of Commons to the civil service, the BBC and big business.Once the people had spoken, in the end they had to be obeyed.No parliamentary paralysis could ever stop Brexit. No clever lawyers could thwart it forever.That historic moment on Friday night felt it had an historic inevitability about it.British democracy could not be denied. How did the arrogant, out-of-touch establishment ever imagine they could overrule the largest vote for anything in our history So au revoir, monsieur, and adios, senor and bye-bye, mein liebe herr. Except — we are not leaving Europe, are we We are only leaving the European Union — that unloved, corrupt, expansionist empire.And the British people have nothing but love in their souls for Europe.Here’s the great Brexit irony. The British are probably the most pro-European nation on the continent. We revere European culture, drink their wine, holiday at their beaches, cities and moun-tains, eat their fruit, vegetables and cheese and buy their cars.But the British have always been a lousy fit in the EU.We do not like having leaders who we cannot kick out.We do not enjoy unelected old geezers in foreign cities telling us who can and can’t come into our country.We — one of the oldest democracies in the world, a country that has not been invaded for , years — truly do not need anyone  to make our laws or to tell us what justice looks like.The EU just lost its second-largest contributor while the largest contributor — Germany — teeters on the edge of recession.We should try to be understandingthey sound bitter.Our stormy relationship with the EU has lasted all my adult le.The first time I ever voted was in the  referendum, when I girded my flared jeans and enthusiastically voted “Yes to Europe”.But like my nation, over the course of the decades I fell out of love with the EU.Like my nation, I began to feel that I had been lied to about what the project really meant.Like my nation — and around .million of my countrymen in  — the thought of “ever greater union” made my skin crawl. For I believed with all my heart and soul that my great nation’s identity is worth preserving.Leo Varadkar, the Irish premier, sneers that the UK must “come to terms with the fact that it is now a small country”.Leo’s line is that the UK is now an isolated little rain-lashed rock, cowering timidly off the coast of the mighty European Union empire.But it doesn’t feel like we are a small nation today.It feels like we are a global nation once again, open for business with the world.It feels like we are the world’s sixth-largest economy, a cultural superpower, a warrior nation with a nuclear deterrent and the best armed forces in the world, the oldest parliamentary democracy on the planet and the longest-reigning monarch in history.All of that, plus the new added ingredient of post-Brexit va-va-voom.And in a Europe blighted by fragile coalitions and leaders with feet of blancmange, the UK boasts a popular Prime Minister presiding over the strongest, most stable government in Europe.British democracy has a far longer history than the European Union.If we were a small nation, then we would never have had the guts to leave the EU.If we were a small nation, then after the EU referendum of , we would have done what all those other EU countries did when they came up with a referendum result that Brussels didn’t like.We would have voted again, until Michel Barnier put down his cane.But the UK was always dferent.Unlike so many of our neighbours, we have not known the terror of fascism and communism, we have never experienced the jackboots of an invading army on our land, we have never seen our country chopped up by cruel foreign conquerors.We are a small nation in size but, through the centuries, we have always proved too big to bully.And what now The extremist voices — on both sides of the Brexit debate — will fade away because extremism is never the British way.Even with a year of transition and haggling about trade ahead, Brexit feels like it is slipping into the history books.The EU referendum in the summer of  seems long ago now.But as I recall, all we ever wanted was for our country to be a self-governing, sovereign nation once more and to restore the freedoms bought with the sacrice of the generations who came before us.Big Ben was silent on Friday night, but did you hear the church bells ring in all the faraway towns That is the sound of a country that just got its mojo back.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He doesn’t like being wet and,it rains, he comes in through the cat flap and wakes me up — evenit’s the middle of the night — to be towelled down.“So the first time he helpd me out, he was smacking my face and I thought, ‘Oh, he’s wet’ — but I then realised he was dry.“But he would not shut up and he kept smacking me around the face with his paw.“In the end I put my light on. The room felt really blurry and I realised my blood sugar level must be low. I checked, and it was at a potentially le-threatening level.“I realised he was telling me. Since then, the same thing has happened over and over again.”Hazel’s husband Darren, , works for United Biscuits in distribution, and does a lot of night shts, so Walter now stays by Hazel’s side as she sleeps, as her “warning system”.Hazel said: “When Walter comes in at night and settles on the bed, I know that I’m safe.” Cat behaviourist Clare Hemington explains that cats’ sense of smell is  times stronger than humans’.She said: “When someone is suffering from a disease such as ­diabetes, chemical changes take place in their body that produce a smell that is too subtle for our noses.“But it’s likely cats can detect this smell and this is the reason ­Walter is able to detect when his owner’s blood sugar drops.”Doctor Marios Anastasiadis said: “While I’ve heard of dogs being able to do this, this is the first time I’ve heard of a cat.”Animal lover Hazel has another cat, two rabbits and a Labrador called Chloe — who she had got to try to help her with her condition.She said: “When we first got Chloe, we were going to get her trained to help with my diabetes.“But we quickly realised that while she is lovely, she hasn’t a clue.“Wally is the one that we thought would be thick and he’s turned out to be just amazing.“Normally dogs are renowned for this . . . but I’ve got a cat instead.”NERVOUS Ned is a three-year-old German Shorthaired Pointer who suffers from epilepsy brought on by anxiety.His owner Iain Gorton, , from Congleton in Cheshire, had a shock when he first saw Ned fitting in the garden.Iain says: “One minute he was his usual happy self, then he got really disoriented, collapsed and started fitting.“The vet told me being anxious could bring on an episode.”Vets said Iain should limit Ned’s salt intake to reduce the risk of him having a seizure and to keep him calm.Iain adds: “As well as following a strict diet, we’ve also put him on medication. But he is a star – despite what he suffers, he’s still a wonderful boy.”Gemma Hidge, , from Nottingham, recently left home and wonders how her five-year-old Labrador Nell will react when she FaceTimes her parents.Q: Does my dog understand that it’s my friends and family on the other side of the screen I’m video-chatting with  Will it upset her A: Lots of owners let friends and family talk to their dogs on FaceTime. Nell will recognise their voices but on a small phone screen, dogs will struggle to recognise faces.If they associate your friends’ and family’s voices with fun experiences, FaceTime can be as positive for them as it is for you.Some dogs, however, might get frustrated or confused as to where the voices are coming from and may even get distressed. If you think your dog might enjoy an occasional video chat, there is no reason not to include them and see how it goes.Kyle cane, , from St Albans, Herts, has a two-year-old boxer called Kiki, which twitches a lot when she falls asleep. Q: As soon as Kiki dozes off, she starts to fidget, moan and kick her legs. Is it possible for dogs to have bad dreams  What do they dream about While nobody can know for sure what they are actually dreaming about, sometimes – because of their movements – we can take an educated guess.If their legs are going like the clappers, they might be running after squirrels or even fleeing monsters. Who knows If Kiki looks distressed when she sleeps, wake her up and give her a cuddle.But there is no need to worry or interrupt her sleep just because she is twitching or her legs seem to be chasing something.LET your cat follow its instincts to climb, rest and watch from up high with the Catipilla starter bundle.We have three up for grabs, each worth £ and purr-fect for inside or outside the home.

I am profoundly anti-empire.”Ms Nandy’s call to change the honours system came after she and leader favourite Rebecca Long-Bailey urged the party to accept Brexit and move on.The pair, who both represent Leave voting constituencies, said efforts should now be made to ensure a good trade is struck with the EU.But shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said talks with the bloc were doomed to fail and Labour would need Remain-backing leader who had been on the right side of the argument all along.Ms Long-Bailey told supporters at the hustings in Bristol that the party could not campaign at the next general election with the message of we told you sothe countrys economic fortunes took a dip after leaving the EU.She admitted it was sad to see the UKs orce from Brussels finalised this week but said the debate is over on Brexit.We cannot spend the next four years waiting to tell our constituents we told you so and that we knew it was going to be this bad all along, the Corbynite MP urged.Ms Nandy accused the leadership under Jeremy Corbyn of looking backwards after the result rather than looking forward to the country we can be.She said: We completely missed the point of that political earthquake, which was a clamour for more power, more control and more agency across this country.”The former shadow energy secretary, who voted for the PM’s Brexit deal, admitted she had failed in her push for a Brexit deal that kept a close relationship with the EU.But Ms Thornberry said Mr Johnson would not be able to broker a deal with Brussels and claimed the country would be back in no-deal territory by the summer.She told the hustings: What do we do at that stage  We need to have someone leading the fight who was on the right side of the argument all along.”Remainer Sir Keir Starmer, one of the architects of Labours second referendum policy, said the ide between Leave and Remain voters must end.However, he accused the Government of failing to address the underlying reasons why the electorate voted out before Fridays historic moment. "},{"url":null,"title":"ayia napa brit says 12 israelis ran away like rats","story":"The woman, then , also revealed she doesn’t know how many of the group allegedly raped her during the horric ordeal.Recalling the moments after the alleged assault, she revealed how she broke free and sprinted onto the street in the clubber’s paradise.But the gang followed her out onto the street, she said.The teen told the Daily Mail: “I was so frightened I wouldnt get past them, that I wouldnt have another opportunity to escape, I absolutely screamed my head off and ran.“I could see in my peripheral vision they were running after me. I sped up and there was a puddle.I ran through it and slipped ason a banana peel. I landed on my elbow and hit my head, and by then the Israeli boys had caught up with me.“I was screaming and crying, then some of my English friends, whod heard all the commotion, came out to help me and the Israelis ran away like rats.”In horric detail, she also recalls one of her attackers used his knees to pin down her shoulders on a grimy bed as his friends “lined up” to rape her.The brave victim, who was eventually given a suspended sentence, said: “I thoughtI don’t get out of here now, I’m going to die.“I don’t know how many of the  raped me. You don’t count, you couldn’t count.“They were lining up, excited, talking and shouting in Hebrew. I was trying to fight them off but I just couldn’t.“They were like a pack of ­animals — a pack of wolves.”Now  and back home in ­Derbyshire with her dog, the girl details how Cypriot cops forced her to sign a “confession” that she had lied about the gang rape.A six-month court battle followed, and she lost ½st locked up for five weeks in a hellish Cypriot jail.She also shares extracts from her harrowing prison diary — which she wrote to cope with the trauma of being locked up on remand while suffering post-traumatic stress.Speaking exclusively to The Sun, she also paid tribute to the “overwhelming” support of our readers, who helped raise more than £, to fund her legal fight.She has now lodged an appeal to overturn her conviction.The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, vowed: “I told the truth. The fight has just begun.”Her ordeal unfolded after she and pals flew to Ayia Napa hoping to get work while holidaying.After a few days partying, she and five friends were drinking in their hotel when a group of  Israelis approached them.She later hooked up with an Israeli boy nicknamed “Sam”.Describing it as “a normal holiday romance”, the teen recalled how it later turned sinister.She agreed to go back with him to the “grotty” hotel room he shared with at least four others at about .am.The girl said: “I knew he was leaving the next day so we started kissing. About five minutes later, I heard the sound of the room door opening and turned around.“He grabbed me and threw me on the bed.“He pinned my shoulders down by kneeling on them — he was well-built, strong — I couldn’t move. From under his knees, I turned and saw the light growing from the doorway.“I was flailing around, trying to move and cross my legs because I was now really panicking.“The others, there were  of them, came over to the bed.“Some of them grabbed my ankles, some held down my knees and they ripped my bodysuit.“I was trying to cross my legs all the time and every time I did, Sam would get angry. He grabbed one of my knees himself at one point. Then they took it in turns.”THE teenager’s mum was on a train when her daughter called to tell of her ordeal.The mother’s voice trembled as she told The Sun: “It was awful, awful.”She then jetted to Cyprus and battled the prison system for the right to visit her daughter. At the same time, she was liaising with campaigners back home to raise money.The teenager’s family helped raise , euros to win bail. She stayed in  Airbnb properties while not allowed to leave Cyprus, with her mum almost always at her side.After watching in disbelief as a “kangaroo court” convicted her daughter, the mum became a spokeswoman for their fight to get her home.Her face expressionless, the girl’s eyes deadened as she described the horror. “The whole thing lasted about  minutes. Somehow I managed to get off the bed and I crawled like a crab across the floor.”After she escaped and raised the alarm, cops accused her of making it up.They called her into a deserted police station and held her without a lawyer for eight hours.Terried and unable to speak to family or friends, she was then ordered to write and sign a confession — dictated to her by a male cop who stood menacingly over her.She questioned some of the wording and recalls: “He just lost it and shouted, ‘No! You write what I tell you to write!’”She told The Sun: “I knew straight away I’d done something really, really wrong by signing it.“I was panicking by now and I told a social worker in the police station what had happened. But she just said, ‘There’s nothing you can do now.’”The Israelis had been arrested but were released to fly home while she was charged.She was convinced a judge would see her “confession” had been ­written under duress.But there followed a six-month ordeal, with the teen slung first into prison and then held under house arrest.She wrote in her diary: “I dream during the day of my cold duvet at home, the plush feel of the down between my fingers and against my face. I have nightmares every night, I dream I’m being raped again.“The doctors prescribe me drugs, I take them in the morning, at lunch and finally at night.“Maybe half an hour or an hour or so after I take them, they numb everything. I still feel scared, I still feel their touch but now I want to sleep — but I have nightmares every time. I’m constantly scared.”Her extracts went on: “At night I lie awake, sleep will not take me.“I can see their hands grabbing me, touching me. It makes me sick.”The girl was suffering from PTSD and became dangerously thin. She added in the interview: “I lost ½ stone in prison. I was really thin when I came out.“They put me on drugs, on Xanax, even though I didn’t want to. Most prisoners were drugged, it seemed they thought that was ­easier. It gave me horribly vivid dreams, hallucinations.”She was released on bail after almost five weeks. Her family had to raise , euros to secure her freedom.The girl and her mum then moved around  Airbnb’s across Cyprus, paid for entirely out of their own funds as the court process dragged agonisingly slowly.Finally, despite the flimsiest of prosecution cases, she was convicted of a “public mischief” charge last month by a male judge who sat alone without a jury.Her ordeal finally ended on January  when she flew home hours after getting a suspended sentence.The girl’s lawyers hope huge flaws in the prosecution case will eventually clear her name.Meanwhile, the Israelis, aged between  and , were back home within days of the attack.Some celebrated with champagne and chanted: “The Brit is a whore.” No one was charged over the rape.She had dreamt of becoming an anti-terror cop and had won a place at university to read criminology last September.But her shattered health means she faces a long road to recovery.Her PTSD can be triggered just by the sound of men speaking in a foreign accent nearby.She can also spend up to  hours asleep a day, a known symptom of trauma.July : Gang rape horror takes place. She reports it and  Israelis are later arrested.July : Five Israelis freed without charge.July : After eight hours of quizzing the girl and denying her a lawyer, police dictate a statement retracting her story and order her to sign. She is charged and taken to a detention centre. Remaining seven Israelis are released and fly home.July : Girl appears in court charged with “public mischief” and is put on remand at Nicosia prison.August : The Sun is the first to reveal details of how police had pressured the teenager to sign a confession.August : Teenager freed on bail of , euros but not allowed to leave island.December : She is convicted by a male judge of public mischief.January , : She gets four-month jail sentence, suspended for three years, and finally flies home.January : Her legal team lodges appeal at Cyprus’s Supreme Court.The teen is being treated by top consultant psychologist Dr Christine Tizzard and has been warned her therapy could take years.But she said: “I’m getting to know my friends again. We’ve been out and I’m thinking about my future. I’d like to go back to college maybe but I just need time to breathe.“The most I can manage is going to the gym with friends and spending time with my collie Kai. I can’t think further ahead than that yet.”"},{"url":null,"title":"prince charles flew 125miles in a private helicopter to give climate change speech on aircraft emissions","story":"The royal was picked up in the chopper up at Highgrove, Glos, and flown to Cambridge, it is reported.After landing in the helicopter a chauffeur-driven Bentley then dropped him off at Cambridge University’s Whittle Laboratory on Friday, according to the Sunday Mirror.It was there that Charles, , told scientists to “act quickly to rescue this poor old planet”.He said during a speech: “We havent got time to waste.We have run out of time now to rescue this poor old planet from man-made emissions and all the complications were now facing, all the challenges were facing.”But just moments after giving his eco-friendly speech he was in the air and being ferried  miles back to Sandringham to see the Queen.The full helicopter journey caused carbon emissions of around . tonnes, used hundreds of gallons of aviation fuel and cost at least £,, according to experts.If the Prince had travelled by car he could have slashed his carbon footprint down to around .tonnes.He has been blasted for the trips by eco groups who have accused him of not “walking the walk” on his pleas for people to watch their carbon footprint.Graham Smith, CEO of campaign group Republic, told the Mirror: “He wants to play the role, but not walk the walk. His view seems to be that it’s one rule for him and one rule for the rest of us. Driving or using the train would have been pretty easy.”Dr Lucy Gilliam, aviation and shipping campaigner for environmental group Transport  Environment, said: “He could have used a private car with a chauffeur, ideally an electric onehe really wanted to walk the walk. He can definitely afford a Tesla.“I don’t doubt that Prince Charles really does get the message, buthe wants to be really effective, he must make those changes that will send such an enormous signal to the world.”A Clarence House spokesman said: “The Prince is not personally involved in decisions around his transportation arrangements, though he ensures all carbon emissions are offset every year.“They are made based on what is possible within the constraints of time, distance and security.“In order for him to undertake as many engagements as he does across the UK and around the world he sometimes has to fly.As he has often said, as soon as there is a more sustainable way of making these journeys, he’ll be the first to use it.”Charles chopper journeys come after Prince Harry and Meghan Markle came under fire for using private jets despite lecturing the public on the effects of climate change.In September it was revealed the Duke of Sussex had used private jets for six out of ten flights since marrying Meghan - despite claiming to travel commercial  per cent of the time.He and we Meghan, , used a charter flight six times this summer while urging the public to watch their carbon footprint.Launching his new eco-tourism project in Amsterdam in September, he argued he always ensured his travel was carbon neutral.The Prince said: Occasionally, there needs to be an opportunity based on a unique circumstance to ensure that my family are safe, its genuinely as simple as that.As I said in my speech - it is about balance. If I have to do that - and its not a decision I would want to take - I would ensure, as I have done previously and I will continue to make sure I do, is balance.

The peer drafted the text in case a fascist leader took charge of a country and quit in a huffbut he didnapost expect it would ever be used. It wasnapost long after [Jörg] Haider had been in power in Austria, he said. He was very far right, and we were worried about the paradox that we had very good criteria for testing whether a country could join do you have an open market, a free press, an independent judiciary  but once a country was in, it was possible to roll those back. We imagined a situation in which we withdrew a memberaposs voting rights because of a move towards autocracy, and in a huff that leader stormed out, leaving a chaotic legal situation.

I decided against getting smashed in front of the TV watching Johnson’s Churchillian B-Day speech, although I stuck a tenner on him saying “we’ll kick them off the beaches”. I didn’t get down to the Parliament Square gloat-fest to hear everyone do a Vera Lynn as it looked a bit Eartha Kitt. And I wasn’t invited to the anti-elitist Vote Leave celebration in venture capitalist Jon Moynihan’s £million Cha mansion, so I missed Jacob Rees-Mogg dressed as Prince singing “tonight one’s going to party like it’s ”. I just sat at home, making bonging noises with the cat’s litter tray at pm, thinking of the future. And I decided to embrace it. That’s right. No more Brexit angst from me. No more remoaning. It’s time to move on. So as I wrap myself in my Got Brexit Done tea towel, let me raise a glass of Wetherspoon’s Sparkling White Clfs of Dover wine, and point out all the reasons we have to be cheerful now we’ve left the EU. Homeless beggars will get a boost as half the country refuses to have the new Brexit coin in their pocket and tosses it to them. The epidemic of coffee-fuelled halitosis in workplaces will be wiped out as Eastern European baristas go home and the obesity crisis will be addressed as people refuse to feed their kids President Slander’s ­Chlorinated Fried Chicken. "},{"url":null,"title":"ex playboy model christina carlin","story":"w.mantis  Ex-Playboy model Christina Carlin-Kraft beaten to death in her home by drug dealerJust months after her engagement, Christina Carlin-Kraft,  was living blissfully in the happiness she shared with her partner. Then, she met the wrong man on a night out, and a le filled with glamour and promise came to a brutal endChristina Carlin-Kraft was strikingly beautul. With her stunning looks, enviable figure and a love of fashion, it came as no surprise that she became a successful model.  nChristina, , was a small-town girl from New Jersey who worked her way up to appear in top magazines such as Vanity Fair and Maxim, and model for brands including cosmetic companies and Victoria’s Secret.  nChristina had even been a Playboy model and had been photographed with the late Hugh Hefner at events.  nIn her profile she described herself as having an ‘olive complexion and green eyes’ and said she was of a ‘Russian and German background with a hint of Swedish’.  nChristina said she was looking for work in high fashion and enjoyed tasteful lingerie and swimwear shoots.  nDespite living a glamorous le in New York for a while, dining at top restaurants and carrying designer handbags, Christina’s loved ones knew her as a kind, graceful, animal lover who made time for her friends and family.  nHowever, she did have a fiery personality and in , it had got her into trouble when she had a physical argument with a manager of a Manhattan restaurant over a bill. Reports said she was drunk at the time.  n  n   n  nCold case murder of camping trip lovers unsolved for  years until phone call  nMum found dead with bag over head just weeks after sending husband ultimatum  nCharges were eventually dropped on the condition that she stay out of trouble for the following six months, which she did.  nBy , Christina was engaged to her long-term boyfriend Alexander Ciccotelli.  nHe had bought a condo in an affluent area in Ardmore, Philadelphia, for her to live in, and she was there when they weren’t at their other home at the beach.  nChristina hadn’t been at the condo for long when she told police she’d had a drink spiked by a man in a bar, who had come back to her home and stolen some of her jewellery and designer bags.  nThe man, Andre Melton, was later found guilty of burglary, criminal trespassing, theft by unlawful taking and receiving stolen property.  nIt had shaken her, but Christina refused to shut herself away. In the early hours of August , she got a Lyft taxi – a ride-sharing service – into the bustling city centre.  nLater that day, Alex arrived and couldn’t get into the condo. It was dead-bolted from the inside, so his key didn’t work.  nChristina wasn’t answering her phone, either. Worried, he called the police and they went to the apartment to investigate.  nWhen police entered, they found Christina dead. Her bloodied, beaten body was under a blanket.  nHer nose was broken, her eyes were black where she’d been brutally beaten and punched. An autopsy revealed Christina had died from strangulation.  nIt was a devastating discovery and because of Christina’s work with Playboy, her death quickly hit the headlines.  nPolice set about working out Christina’s final movements. CCTV showed she’d met a man outside a pizza shop in downtown Philadelphia in the early hours and a Lyft driver confirmed they’d come back to her apartment together.  nThere was CCTV at the property that showed them entering and the images were released to the public.  nSeveral tip-offs led them to a suspect – Jonathan Harris. A man who had recently been released from prison after serving time for armed robbery.  nRecords showed that in the early hours of August , he’d messaged a friend to say that he’d just met a ‘sexy’ woman and that he was at her house.  nSuspected drug dealer Jonathan, , was hunted down as he’d fled across state, and after a week, he was apprehended as he got off a bus in Pittsburgh.  n  nWhen questioned, he didn’t deny going back to Christina’s flat. He said he’d met the model and she’d invited him back.  nJonathan said they’d drunk some wine, had done some cocaine and had consensual sex before he’d left.  nToxicology reports confirmed Christina had high levels of alcohol in her system but there were no illegal substances. There were also no drugs in her home.  nCCTV footage didn’t show Jonathan leaving the property either. When confronted with the inconsistencies in his story, Jonathan suddenly gave a dferent version of events.  nJonathan said that he did go back with Christina, where they drank wine and had sex – but then a fight had broken out.  nHe claimed he’d brought with him an ounce of cocaine that Christina wanted but she’d refused to pay the , for it – saying that she didn’t owe him any cash as she’d just had sex with him.  nJonathan said that Christina had hit him on the ear with a wine bottle, and he’d struck back. ‘I slapped her in the face, and she fell to the floor,’ Jonathan told police.  nThere were no injuries to the side of his head when he was arrested. He described the struggle that followed.  nHe said he carried Christina to her bed and bound her hands so that she would stop hitting him. When she continued to refuse to pay for the drugs, he said he punched her in the face.  nThen when she tried to call the police he ‘began choking her’ according to his confession. ‘I panicked,’ he said. ‘I was scared. I didn’t know what to do.’  nJonathan said that once Christina was leless, he covered her body with a blanket. Then he’d fled the scene through the back door around am before jumping from the balcony.  n‘I never meant for this girl to die,’ he said. ‘When I left the apartment, she was not dead. I would do anything to take this back.’  nBut later, a man who stayed in a hospital bed in the same room as Jonathan shortly after the killing revealed something shocking.  n  nHe said that Jonathan had told him there ‘is nothing like squeezing somebody and feeling the last breath leave their body’.  nJonathan was charged with murder. While Christina was buried in a white coffin, surrounded by beautul flowers.  nDespite going into great detail about how he’d beaten and strangled Christina, he pleaded not guilty to her murder at the trial in May .  nJonathan’s defence argued that he was high ‘out of his mind’ on cocaine, marijuana and K at the time of the killing and didn’t know what he was doing – or that Christina was dead when he left. ‘Everything was done out of panic,’ they said.  nChristina’s family had to listen to a description of the model’s final moments at the hands of her attacker as his confessions were played in court.  nJonathan admitted that he left Christina so battered, even he couldn’t look at her after what he’d done.  n‘I covered her with a blanket because I didn’t want to see her like that,’ he was heard saying in a recorded confession. ‘I knew she was hurt really bad.apos  nJonathan didn’t testy and his lawyer called no witnesses or disputed the confession. They just asked the jury to find Jonathan guilty of third-degree murder, instead of first.  n‘This wasn’t a specic attempt to kill,’ they said. ‘He didn’t go there for that. There was no evidence of that.’  nThey even suggested that Christina had invited him back simply to get cocaine for free. But the prosecution argued Jonathan’s version didn’t add up.  n‘His story was that it was over cocaine, but given the circumstances around this murder, it makes no sense that this was about drugs,’ they said to the jury.  n‘Was it over sex  Was it over money  We don’t know because the only person who did know was killed in that bedroom that night.’ No one knows why Christina brought Jonathan back to her home.  n  nThey reminded the court there were no drugs in Christina’s system and of the violence she endured at his hands. They said Christina’s last moments were terrying as she’d been ‘beat, bound and strangled with intent’.  nJonathan’s hospital conversation was brought into evidence, when he’d talked about the feeling of squeezing out someone’s last breath.  n‘That statement says he was conscious and aware that she was taking her last breath,’ they told the jury. It could have taken more than three minutes to choke the le out of Christina.  nThe jury deliberated for over five hours before finding Jonathan guilty of first-degree murder. He was also found guilty of kidnapping, possession of an instrument of a crime and strangulation.  nAs he was led out of the courtroom, he told reporters that he felt that ‘justice was served’.  nLoved ones said Christina was an ‘absolute light in this world’ that had been snuffed out.  nAt the sentencing in August, Jonathan was given the automatic punishment of le in prison without the chance of parole.  nJonathan spoke to express his ‘deepest condolences’ and blamed the drugs for his actions.  n‘I’m not looking for sympathy or making a plea for my le,’ he said ‘I’m standing here, taking responsibility for the things I’ve done, and I’m willing to accept the punishment, evenit’s death.  naposI cannot bring this person back, I cannot change the way you view me.

With her stunning looks, enviable figure and a love of fashion, it came as no surprise that she became a successful model.Christina, , was a small-town girl from New Jersey who worked her way up to appear in top magazines such as Vanity Fair and Maxim , and model for brands including cosmetic companies and Victoria’s Secret. Christina had even been aPlayboymodel and had been photographed with the late Hugh Hefner at events.In her profile she described herself as having an ‘olive complexion and green eyes’ and said she was of a ‘Russian and German background with a hint of Swedish’. Christina said she was looking for work in high fashion and enjoyed tasteful lingerie and swimwear shoots.Despite living a glamorous le in New York for a while, dining at top restaurants and carrying designer handbags, Christina’s loved ones knew her as a kind, graceful, animal lover who made time for her friends and family.However, she did have a fiery personality and in , it had got her into trouble when she had a physical argument with a manager of a Manhattan restaurant over a bill. Reports said she was drunk at the time.Charges were eventually dropped on the condition that she stay out of trouble for the following six months, which she did. By , Christina was engaged to her long-term boyfriend Alexander Ciccotelli. He had bought a condo in an affluent area in Ardmore, Philadelphia, for her to live in, and she was there when they weren’t at their other home at the beach. Christina hadn’t been at the condo for long when she told police she’d had a drink spiked by a man in a bar, who had come back to her home and stolen some of her jewellery and designer bags. The man, Andre Melton, was later found guilty of burglary, criminal trespassing, theft by unlawful taking and receiving stolen property. It had shaken her, but Christina refused to shut herself away. In the early hours of August , she got a Lyft taxi – a ride-sharing service – into the bustling city centre. Later that day, Alex arrived and couldn’t get into the condo. It was dead-bolted from the inside, so his key didn’t work. Christina wasn’t answering her phone, either. Worried, he called the police and they went to the apartment to investigate. When police entered, they found Christina dead. Her bloodied, beaten body was under a blanket. Her nose was broken, her eyes were black where she’d been brutally beaten and punched. An autopsy revealed Christina had died from strangulation.It was a devastating discovery and because of Christina’s work with Playboy, her death quickly hit the headlines.Police set about working out Christina’s final movements. CCTV showed she’d met a man outside a pizza shop in downtown Philadelphia in the early hours and a Lyft driver confirmed they’d come back to her apartment together. There was CCTV at the property that showed them entering and the images were released to the public. Several tip-offs led them to a suspect – Jonathan Harris. A man who had recently been released from prison after serving time for armed robbery. Records showed that in the early hours of August , he’d messaged a friend to say that he’d just met a ‘sexy’ woman and that he was at her house. Suspected drug dealer Jonathan, , was hunted down as he’d fled across state, and after a week, he was apprehended as he got off a bus in Pittsburgh.  When questioned, he didn’t deny going back to Christina’s flat. He said he’d met the model and she’d invited him back. Jonathan said they’d drunk some wine, had done some cocaine and had consensual sex before he’d left. Toxicology reports confirmed Christina had high levels of alcohol in her system but there were no illegal substances. There were also no drugs in her home. CCTV footage didn’t show Jonathan leaving the property either. When confronted with the inconsistencies in his story, Jonathan suddenly gave a dferent version of events. Jonathan said that he did go back with Christina, where they drank wine and had sex – but then a fight had broken out. He claimed he’d brought with him an ounce of cocaine that Christina wanted but she’d refused to pay the bodygt Christina Carlin-Kraft was strikingly beautul.

Christina said she was looking for work in high fashion and enjoyed tasteful lingerie and swimwear shoots.Despite living a glamorous le in New York for a while, dining at top restaurants and carrying designer handbags, Christina’s loved ones knew her as a kind, graceful, animal lover who made time for her friends and family.However, she did have a fiery personality and in , it had got her into trouble when she had a physical argument with a manager of a Manhattan restaurant over a bill. Reports said she was drunk at the time.Charges were eventually dropped on the condition that she stay out of trouble for the following six months, which she did. By , Christina was engaged to her long-term boyfriend Alexander Ciccotelli. He had bought a condo in an affluent area in Ardmore, Philadelphia, for her to live in, and she was there when they weren’t at their other home at the beach. Christina hadn’t been at the condo for long when she told police she’d had a drink spiked by a man in a bar, who had come back to her home and stolen some of her jewellery and designer bags. The man, Andre Melton, was later found guilty of burglary, criminal trespassing, theft by unlawful taking and receiving stolen property. It had shaken her, but Christina refused to shut herself away. In the early hours of August , she got a Lyft taxi – a ride-sharing service – into the bustling city centre. Later that day, Alex arrived and couldn’t get into the condo. It was dead-bolted from the inside, so his key didn’t work. Christina wasn’t answering her phone, either. Worried, he called the police and they went to the apartment to investigate. When police entered, they found Christina dead. Her bloodied, beaten body was under a blanket. Her nose was broken, her eyes were black where she’d been brutally beaten and punched. An autopsy revealed Christina had died from strangulation.It was a devastating discovery and because of Christina’s work with Playboy, her death quickly hit the headlines.Police set about working out Christina’s final movements. CCTV showed she’d met a man outside a pizza shop in downtown Philadelphia in the early hours and a Lyft driver confirmed they’d come back to her apartment together. There was CCTV at the property that showed them entering and the images were released to the public. Several tip-offs led them to a suspect – Jonathan Harris. A man who had recently been released from prison after serving time for armed robbery. Records showed that in the early hours of August , he’d messaged a friend to say that he’d just met a ‘sexy’ woman and that he was at her house. Suspected drug dealer Jonathan, , was hunted down as he’d fled across state, and after a week, he was apprehended as he got off a bus in Pittsburgh.  When questioned, he didn’t deny going back to Christina’s flat. He said he’d met the model and she’d invited him back. Jonathan said they’d drunk some wine, had done some cocaine and had consensual sex before he’d left. Toxicology reports confirmed Christina had high levels of alcohol in her system but there were no illegal substances. There were also no drugs in her home. CCTV footage didn’t show Jonathan leaving the property either. When confronted with the inconsistencies in his story, Jonathan suddenly gave a dferent version of events. Jonathan said that he did go back with Christina, where they drank wine and had sex – but then a fight had broken out. He claimed he’d brought with him an ounce of cocaine that Christina wanted but she’d refused to pay the , for it – saying that she didn’t owe him any cash as she’d just had sex with him. Jonathan said that Christina had hit him on the ear with a wine bottle, and he’d struck back. ‘I slapped her in the face, and she fell to the floor,’ Jonathan told police. There were no injuries to the side of his head when he was arrested. He described the struggle that followed. He said he carried Christina to her bed and bound her hands so that she would stop hitting him. When she continued to refuse to pay for the drugs, he said he punched her in the face. Then when she tried to call the police he ‘began choking her’ according to his confession. ‘I panicked,’ he said. ‘I was scared. I didn’t know what to do.’ Jonathan said that once Christina was leless, he covered her body with a blanket. Then he’d fled the scene through the back door around am before jumping from the balcony. ‘I never meant for this girl to die,’ he said. ‘When I left the apartment, she was not dead. I would do anything to take this back.’ But later, a man who stayed in a hospital bed in the same room as Jonathan shortly after the killing revealed something shocking.  He said that Jonathan had told him there ‘is nothing like squeezing somebody and feeling the last breath leave their body’. Jonathan was charged with murder. While Christina was buried in a white coffin, surrounded by beautul flowers. Despite going into great detail about how he’d beaten and strangled Christina, he pleaded not guilty to her murder at the trial in May . Jonathan’s defence argued that he was high ‘out of his mind’ on cocaine, marijuana and K at the time of the killing and didn’t know what he was doing – or that Christina was dead when he left. ‘Everything was done out of panic,’ they said. Christina’s family had to listen to a description of the model’s final moments at the hands of her attacker as his confessions were played in court. Jonathan admitted that he left Christina so battered, even he couldn’t look at her after what he’d done. ‘I covered her with a blanket because I didn’t want to see her like that,’ he was heard saying in a recorded confession. ‘I knew she was hurt really bad.apos Jonathan didn’t testy and his lawyer called no witnesses or disputed the confession. They just asked the jury to find Jonathan guilty of third-degree murder, instead of first. ‘This wasn’t a specic attempt to kill,’ they said. ‘He didn’t go there for that. There was no evidence of that.’ They even suggested that Christina had invited him back simply to get cocaine for free. But the prosecution argued Jonathan’s version didn’t add up. ‘His story was that it was over cocaine, but given the circumstances around this murder, it makes no sense that this was about drugs,’ they said to the jury. ‘Was it over sex  Was it over money  We don’t know because the only person who did know was killed in that bedroom that night.’ No one knows why Christina brought Jonathan back to her home.  They reminded the court there were no drugs in Christina’s system and of the violence she endured at his hands. They said Christina’s last moments were terrying as she’d been ‘beat, bound and strangled with intent’. Jonathan’s hospital conversation was brought into evidence, when he’d talked about the feeling of squeezing out someone’s last breath. ‘That statement says he was conscious and aware that she was taking her last breath,’ they told the jury. It could have taken more than three minutes to choke the le out of Christina. The jury deliberated for over five hours before finding Jonathan guilty of first-degree murder. He was also found guilty of kidnapping, possession of an instrument of a crime and strangulation. As he was led out of the courtroom, he told reporters that he felt that ‘justice was served’. Loved ones said Christina was an ‘absolute light in this world’ that had been snuffed out. At the sentencing in August, Jonathan was given the automatic punishment of le in prison without the chance of parole. Jonathan spoke to express his ‘deepest condolences’ and blamed the drugs for his actions. ‘I’m not looking for sympathy or making a plea for my le,’ he said ‘I’m standing here, taking responsibility for the things I’ve done, and I’m willing to accept the punishment, evenit’s death. aposI cannot bring this person back, I cannot change the way you view me. But this was never my intention.’ Christina’s fiancé Alex, , said that Jonathan had tried to slander her and said that during their -year relationship she had never used drugs. He urged him to tell the truth about their encounter.  aposYou killed a kind, loving, generous, amazing person who is sorely missed by everyone every day,’ he said. ‘You murdered a -pound defenceless female. aposYou destroyed the lives of so many people and inflicted needless pain on our family and your family, and for what ’ Stuart Kraft, Christina’s dad, said she was ‘the brightest light that ever lived’ and that her death has had a heavy impact on his family. The judge added an additional -and-a-half to  years of consecutive time for other charges including kidnapping and strangulation. He said that Jonathan deserved to spend the rest of his le in prison, and that he would send that message to governors and parole boards who might consider freeing him in the future. Christina had lived in a world of glamour and beauty, but her final moments were as ugly as le can get., for it – saying that she didn’t owe him any cash as she’d just had sex with him.Jonathan said that Christina had hit him on the ear with a wine bottle, and he’d struck back. ‘I slapped her in the face, and she fell to the floor,’ Jonathan told police.

Growing up only a few miles south of Imperial War Museum Duxford, home to one of the most iconic airshows in the country, his obsession with aviation began from an early age. His father, who worked on an RAF base during the Second World War, would often tell him stories about the planes and pilots he had seen there. Then when Chris was five, his dad took him to see the filming of the Battle Of Britain movie at Duxford. It was his first glimpse at the world of display flying, and it was a day that changed the course of his le forever. ‘I came from a pretty humble background, we lived in a council house, but for some reason I was very attached to the idea of flying,’ says Chris, now . As an eager teen, he joined the Air Cadets, where he got his first taste of flying – and a love of aerobatics. ‘The first time I flew upside down was when I was . After a few months in the Air Cadets they let us do a loop and barrel roll. aposI felt queasy initially, and I remember being worried that I wasn’t going to like the very thing I’d been wanting to do my whole le – but seeing the world above me for the first time was spectacular,’ admits Chris. From there, he joined the RAF. Over his -year career with the military, he worked at a iety of postings, serving as a flight instructor while also flying combat aircrafts transporting essential military resources across the world. But the thing he was truly passionate about was display flying.‘When I first joined the air force I flew a Hawk, which I loved, and I managed to do a season doing aerobatics as a display pilot. That was when I realised it was the kind of flying I enjoyed the most. aposIt’s nice to be on the other side, and be the pilot rather than the spectator, especially after going to watch so many shows growing up.’ Chris says it’s the challenge of this type of flying that he loves the most. ‘Being a display pilot tests your pure flying skills, but that’s why I fell in love with it. You get satisfaction from overcoming the dficulties that come with it. aposWe fly airplanes lower than most other pilots are allowed to, and keeping it in the same place across dferent wind speeds while performing aerobatics makes it very dficult.’ Performing these technical manoeuvres in the sky can come with big risks – but Chris is quite philosophical about any potential danger. ‘One of the key aspects of being a pilot is being able to think through the what-s. If there are little setbacks, you take them in your stride and it doesn’t really affect the overall success of what you’re trying to do. ‘Sometimes you can’t account for a random light aircraft flying through the middle of your display, or a sudden weather change that makes things a bit more complicated, but as a pilot it’s important to be prepared for the occasional hiccups. ‘Thankfully Iaposve not had any near misses, just a few bird strikes on the fast jet planes because we fly at low levels. They can be a bit of a nuisance!’ After his time flying the Hawk, Chris moved on to the faster Jaguar, instructing in Scotland before another season as a display pilot.  Then Chris set his sights on the ultimate goal of aerobatics – to become a Red Arrow pilot. ‘I got to see a lot of the Red Arrows at the display shows we flew at. I realised that they were pilots just like me, so I started applying. aposIt took years of experience, and at the time there were around  applicants for three spaces on the team. ‘It’s not just about being a good pilot. You have to get on well with the rest of the team because you spend months on end living in each other’s pockets.’ Chris’s ability as a pilot and his personality made him a great fit for the job, and he was eventually chosen. In three years he flew in nearly  shows, all of which he remembers fondly, but some carry more signicance than others. ‘We displayed at the British Grand Prix one year which was great, and did some overseas shows in Toronto and Dubai. They were amazing, but the most memorable trip for me wasn’t even an air display. ‘I was lucky enough to be involved in the formation fly-pass alongside the Concorde for the Queen’s Golden Jubilee in . aposIt didn’t even involve any aerobatics at all, it was just flying straight for  minutes!  ‘To see the crowds and the camera flashes on the ground, and to be alongside such an iconic plane was something truly special.’ It would take a lot to top that day, but it was a show a bit closer to home that Chris remembers just as fondly – flying with the Red Arrows at Duxford. ‘Being able to go back to Duxford as a Hawk pilot, a Jaguar pilot and then as a Red Arrow was really memorable for me. aposThose shows were a chance for my dad, who’s now no longer with us, to come and watch me fly. ‘It was really great to be able to share that experience with him in the crowd and have my name read on the PA system as I flew past.’ After leaving the Red Arrows, Chris switched the small planes for a much bigger one – a Boeing  – and says there are similarities in flying commercially. ‘An awful lot of airline pilots are ex-military, and we always find the transition interesting. aposIn some ways it’s like becoming a bus driver after driving a race car, but the passengers on the bus need to get to where they’re going safely. It’s also still a flying machine.  aposIt’s up there in the elements, at the mercy of the weather, and you’re in charge of it. ‘There is an added pressure when you’re carrying passengers, but you always set out to do the same job, and make people feel as comfortable as possible. ‘It may not seem like it, but flying commercially can be just as challenging. We have to pick the best route to avoid turbulence, and navigate through all sorts of weather that we usually wouldn’t have to negotiate in as display pilots.’ Now, things have come full circle for Chris, as he shares his passion for flying with his we Louise, and their sons, Archie, , and Jake, . ‘They always come to the airshows and they will sometimes come to Duxford on a day when I’m doing some passenger flying or practising. aposThe kids still enjoy watching me fly. Sometimes we head out in a light plane around our local area, which is a really nice way to spend time together.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"woman locked syndrome cried loudly","story":"NewsWoman in locked-in syndrome cried so loudly for mum to kill her that neighbours moaned about dogFormer model Kati van der Hoeven, , has been trapped, immobile, in her own body for over  yearsShareCommentsByNatasha HoltEmma Jones:,  FEB NewsKati Lepisto enjoys the simple things like feeling the sun on her face \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailWatching TV with my mum, I suddenly started feeling so dizzy the room began to spin. I’d been enjoying some precious time with my parents, away from my hectic modelling career, and thought exhaustion had got the better of me. But as I got up and attempted to walk to the bedroom, I felt as though I was drunk. I tried desperately to speak, but all I could do was mumble, so my worried parents rushed me to hospital. There, to my horror, I started losing control of my body and could no longer move my arms or legs. ‘I’m not paralysed,’ I told my mum, ‘I’m just too tired to talk.’ That was  January , and those were the last words I would ever say out loud. Before long, I couldn’t move anything except my left eye, and for the next eight hours baffled doctors ran tests. I remember hearing the word ‘stroke’, but a doctor dismissed it, saying, ‘She’s too young.’ I was only  they were convinced there must be a dferent explanation. The feeling of terror and panic was indescribable. I couldn’t understand what was happening and I was even struggling to breathe. I tried to move, but my body wouldn’t respond, and although I wanted to speak, no sound came out. My mum told me to blink once for yes and twice for no, and that was the only way I could communicate. Three days later, I had an MRI scan and the news was catastrophic. A neurologist explained I’d suffered a stroke and that the damage was so severe I’d never be able to move again. ‘What happened to Kati is as unlikely as winning the lottery jackpot,’ he said, as he explained I had locked-in syndrome, where the messages from the brain don’t get through to the muscles. He told us the average stroke takes six minutes, but mine had lasted  hours, so the damage was irreversible. It’s hard to react when you can’t move, but I remember feeling utter shock and misery. It was too much to take in. I had a successful career as a model, I worked in amazing places, like Italy, America and the Bahamas, and was living my childhood dream. But now everything had been cruelly ripped away. I spent a month in hospital and regained the use of my right eye, so a speech therapist taught me to communicate using a letter board. I could also breathe better by then, so doctors removed a tube from my throat and I was transferred to a rehab clinic. Emotionally, though, I hit rock bottom. Every time I woke up and realised nothing had changed, a fresh wave of despair and agony washed over me. I was grieving for my old le and felt utterly heartbroken. At the clinic, I made small improvements. I was able to make tiny movements in my neck, jaw and legs, which meant I could support my own neck and make tiny kicks.  I learnt how to chew food and how to use a hands-free computer, where an infrared camera is mounted on the monitor and picks up the reflection of a little sticker on my forehead, which allows me to move the mouse. After seven months there was nothing more the therapists could do for me, and they advised my parents to put me in an institution. Horried, they refused and took me home, where a day nurse cared for me. I might not have been able to speak, but I could make noise and cried constantly, howling so loudly a neighbour askedmy parents had a new dog. I wanted to die and begged my mum to kill me. I felt embarrassed, humiliated and demeaned. A few months later, I started a diary and it became a sort of therapy. Little by little, I started to heal emotionally.  Writing gave me a purpose and eventually helped me see that I could still have a le worth living. I tried every therapy and treatment, but nothing worked, and after three years of crushed hopes, I’d had enough. I wanted to live and be happy, so I had to adapt to my new circumstances. I started a blog to help others dealing with complex medical needs, and slowly began to appreciate the small things in le. It’s amazing how much pleasure you can get from feeling the sun on your face. My attitude to le changed again in , when I met a man called Henning online. We talked about music, our homes and families, and I was struck by how similarly we viewed le. I was reluctant to tell him about my condition straight away, but he noticed my wheelchair and said, ‘You must be an extraordinary person.’ I told him I had locked-in syndrome, expecting him to beat a retreat, but he carried on our conversations. Eight months later, I was on my way to Calornia via Amsterdam, where Henning lived, and decided to stopover for a night so we could meet. I was with my mother and care assistant, and Henning met us at check-in and took me for a stroll. Instantly, we felt like two old friends.  We got on so well that I stopped over on my way back too. Henning visited twice that summer and we fell so deeply in love that on Christmas Eve, , he moved countries to be with me. We stayed with my parents while renovating our own home to make it wheelchair accessible. Initially, living together was harder than I expected. I felt under enormous pressure because I was concerned about losing my privacy and my sense of self. Most of all, I was worried things would end and I’d be heartbroken, but they never did. Instead our bond grew deeper, and Henning got so good at using my Plexiglas ‘air alphabet’ board to communicate that soon he didn’t need the board, as he could just follow my eyes. Henning and I married on  December . It was a beautul, snowy day, and as we said our vows in an old mansion house, I can honestly say I’ve never felt happier.

The two were so close her three siblings used to joke she was his favourite. After he died in a motorcycle crash in  when she was , Emma was devastated. And, because of her wonderful memories of him, she put a disturbing nagging doubt she had always felt to the back of her mind. Why did she look so dferent to the dad she loved  Twelve years later, as Emma planned her wedding, her suspicions were further aroused when she ordered her birth certicate for the wedding paperwork, and she found no father listed. Those childhood doubts came rushing back – and Emma was unconvinced by mum Frances’ explanation that she and Ray had not been together when she was born. Last year Emma finally gave in to her curiosity and took a £ ancestry DNA test, and she uncovered the bombshell family secret her mum and some other family members had kept from her – Ray wasn’t her real dad. She eventually discovered that her biological father was Trevor Ranger – an -year-old her mum had had an affair with when she was in her s. And it turned out he had lived just down the road from her throughout her childhood. Now she has traced him – and they are making up for those long lost years apart. “I’ve been brought up on a lie – the family secret,” said Emma, now . If I had been told the truth, it would never have been as hurtful as what I’ve been through emotionally. “The lies have been so damaging compared to what the truth would have been.”  Now she is thinking about renewing her wedding vows with husband Pete,  – so her biological father can walk her down the aisle. “All of a sudden I’ve got this parent who’s like me – we keep the same breeds of dogs, we both like our cars and we both like sailing,” she said. “We even have the same crap taste in wine. It’s wonderful.” Hugging her, Trevor, , said: “I was really pleased to hear from her. We need to make up for lost time.” Both share the same blue eyes and fair skin – it was Ray’s black hair and olive skin that always confused the young Emma. Yet Ray had always treated her as his own, and as she grew into her late teens he taught her guitar and also took her for spins on his motorbike.  “We were so close, but it always really bothered me I couldn’t see any similarities,” said Emma, of Rochester, Kent.Her insecurities were reinforced after his death at  when she claims her mum, now , went cold on her. Their relationship deteriorated and they haven’t spoken since . At Easter last year, Emma persuaded her older sister to take an ancestry DNA test with her. The results showed her sister could only be a half-sibling – meaning Ray was not her birth father. She decided to ask her aunts what they knew, and finally discovered the truth.  Emma was told her mother had slept with -year-old Trevor when she was in her early s. “When I knew the truth, I couldn’t really take it in,” Emma said. “All sorts of things go through your head.” The aunts also told Emma some of her family members had known all along and had been sworn to secrecy. She used social media and the electoral roll to find out where Trevor lived and then she wrote to him with contact detailshe wanted to see her. “I agonised over what to put in it,” she said. “I didn’t want to give too much information away about myself. I was frightened. “Was he a good person  Was he going to be some strange drunkard ” Trevor emailed her saying he was surprised but pleased to hear from her. He revealed he had always felt ashamed about how things had gone with her mum.  The moment they met, Emma stared into his matching blue eyes and knew he was her birth father. As they hugged for the first time, she says she thought about all of the family moments she had missed out on over the years. “He could have been there at my wedding,” she said. “I always wanted someone to walk me down the aisle. I’ve missed out on grandparents. I’ve been looking through his family photo albums, and I’ve not been part of any of it.” Trevor’s family have welcomed her with open arms. She has a new half-sister a few years younger than she is. Now Emma and Trevor enjoy sailing together on his boat along the River Medway. “There’s a security in spending time with close family members, and I didn’t appreciate how much I craved that,” said Emma.Trevor added: “A lot of time has been lost. I expected her to come looking when she was  or . Now we’re hoping to go on holidays together and spend a lot more time together on the boat.” He hopes she goes ahead with her idea of renewing her wedding vows. “I would love to walk her down the aisle, it’s something I’ve missed,” he said.

Staff at Partick Superstore in Glasgow claim to have been deluged by customers since the posters were put up on Thursday, Daily Record reported. Infectious disease specialists have said that face masks are pointless in preventing the spread of a virus. The store manager, who asked not to be named, said they had so far shted  boxes of  masks, price at £ per mask. “We put the posters up outside the shop on Thursday and it’s been crazy ever since, he said. “I got  boxes of masks from a pharmacy distributor and the demand has been huge. “So many pharmacies across the country have sold out so I thought I’d try and do my bit for the local community and offer what I could from here.  “I’ve had loads of customers who want to buy masks as protection from the virus to send home to their families. “However some customers have bought them to wear here straight away. “Other local customers have bought them as a bit of a laugh. “Mostly the customers buying them up have been Chinese.”  The “Don’t die, please buy’ slogan was the brainchild of the store manager. He added said: “I’ve seen lots of videos of people collapsing in the street in China. “It has become a global epidemic. “So I came up with the idea of buying in masks and putting some posters together.

Lewis Seaman, , ran over Tom McConnachie, , before speeding off to an isolated spot and torching his friendaposs Kia Rio he had been driving. Mr McConnachie, a talented footballer, had been walking to his nearby home when he was fatally hit. He was later rushed to hospital but tragically died that night from a head injury. Dad-of-one Seaman handed himself in to police about seven hours after the collision, Plymouth Live reported. He claimed that his view in the long Whitleigh street was hampered by fog patches – but other witnesses said it was clear that early morning. Jailing him for ten months at Plymouth Crown Court, judge Paul Darlow said: “The surest thing about this case is that you will have to live with the consequences of your actions and that is something that will not go away when you have served your prison sentence.” Seaman, of Manadon, pleaded guilty to driving while unfit through drink on February  last year. He also admitted failing to stop after an accident where injury had occurred and driving without insurance. Seaman finally pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice by setting fire to the car on isolated ground near Okehampton. Lee Bremridge, for the Crown Prosecution Service, said Mr McConnachie took a taxi to his home in Whitleigh after a night out with friends in Plymouth.  He added that the driver dropped him at the junction of Taunton Avenue in Whitleigh at about am. Mr Bremridge said the cabbie reported that his passenger had been drinking but was happy, did not fall asleep and was not staggering. The barrister added: “He joked with the taxi driver and shook his hand.” Mr Bremridge said Mr McConnachie stopped in the middle of the road and lted his arm asto hail the taxi as it turned in Budshead Road. He added that he started to say something but was then hit by the Rio driven by Seaman. Mr Bremridge said that both the taxi-driver and a passer-by reported the road was dry and visibility clear at the time. He added that Seaman drove the car to a quiet spot near Okehampton and set it on fire to destroy the evidence. He handed himself in to police at about am the next day. Seaman told officers he had drunk about three cans of lager and two single whisky shots at about pm and considered himself safe to drive – though he was not insured. Mr Bremridge added that he borrowed a friend’s car with her permission to pick up her partner.  Ali Rafati, for Seaman, said: “He on that night made one of the most stupid decisions of his le ever, which was to agree to pick up a friend. “Regardless of reports of clear visibility, my instructions are that he drove through pockets of fog and ended up where he did and for a iety of reasons failed to see that man in the road. “He talks about how he does not know where to begin to express the way that he feels about effect he has had on Mr McConnachie’s family. “Nothing I say on his behalf will turn time back he cannot undo what he has done. He more than most comes to this court expresses his remorse beyond what is normal. “Having committed this offence and having become aware of the collision, he lost all sense of reality, driving into the middle of nowhere and setting fire to that car. “No sentence this court can pass which will punish him in a way that he will have to suffer for the rest of his le.” Seaman was also banned from the road for three years and five months. Relatives released a statement about the man they adored at an inquest hearing into his death in March last year. Tom was born on th September  in Munster, Germany, they said. He grew up and went to school in Callington, both the primary and secondary schools and was commonly known as Conners growing up. He loved playing football for Callington Colts and continued playing throughout his le and was still playing five-a-side. Tom was a huge Liverpool FC fan. He enjoyed meeting with friends and attempting to win at FIFA. Tom was looking forward to being groomsman to his closest friends in August this year . Tom previously worked at Duchy Desserts in Launceston.

Iris, , says of the PM: “He has got a young girlfiend... he should understand.” She claims UK diplomats in Cairo blocked her marrying Mohamed Ahmed Irbriham, . Iris says Mohamed “is an Adonis... I call him my pharaoh – and he calls me Cleopatra”. She went viral after the Sunday Mirror revealed her story last week, then she appeared on TV revealing details of her first night with Mohamed – and how they used “a whole tube of KY Jelly”. Now Iris hopes Boris, who at  is is  years older than partner Carrie Symonds, will sympathise. Iris says: “I wrote to Boris because I was desperate. I said, ‘Boris, we’re two people much in love. We just want to be together’. “I wrote, ‘Dear Mr Johnson, I know you are a man with a heart. I want to marry this gentleman from Egypt. We’re meeting obstacles and setbacks. Time isn’t on my side now. I just want to spend my last days with him’.” She tells the Mirror: “People don’t like him as PM, but he’s still a man with needs and desires like all of us. I’d write to the Queen too but she’s enough on with Harry, Meghan and Andrew.”This Morning hosts Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield were in stitches as Iris gave fine detail on bedding Mohamed. But the romeo was mfed. Iris, from Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, explains: “He wrote a message and said, ‘I am angry. Why tell them about our personal le ’ I said, ‘it just suddenly came out. You have to take the rough with the smooth’. “He is putty in my hands, I can easily calm him down. He said, ‘Thank you my angel’.” Iris has bought her wedding outfit – a £ charity shop bargain. The jacket was £, the dress £. and the fascinator £.We told last week how the pair “met” through a Facebook page. Iris flew to Cairo in November.They went to the British Embassy to check whether they could marry in Egypt. But she didn’t have her orce papers and they also needed a certicate of no impediment to show there was no barrier to getting married.  Iris say she has since sent numerous emails but claims to have been blanked by officials. She meets a registrar tomorrow about a certicate of no impediment and plans a spring wedding in Cairo. Iris hopes towith Mohamed, visa permitting. Her sons, in their s, accept the situation. Iris adds: “At first they hated him.

Jake, a devoted Birmingham City supporter, was diagnosed with Leighaposs Syndrome when he was  months old. “Jake couldn’t sit up or anything,” says Debbie. “It gradually takes bits of the body – the longer it’s there, the more goes. “He had dislocated hips and knees. He was so brave, such a warrior, he was exceptional. “And he was the biggest flirt,” she beams. “He made everyone around him smile. “In January , we took him to hospital because he’d lost the ability to swallow. He was fed through a peg in his stomach. He lost a hell of a lot of weight in . “We were petried to sleep because he had seizures all through the night. We lived on a kne edge. “If he hadn’t woken before us, which was very unusual, we would be petried that he had died.  “He had three words – Blues, yes and no – but he understood everything. He was so mischievous. He knew how to do, what I call the one-finger and two-finger salutes. If someone said something about Blues, or supported another team, they’d get the salutes.”A Birmingham City fan has launched a GoFundMe campaign to find the cash needed for the burial.So far, £, have been raised. This is not the first time the public have got together to help the family in need. In , Debbie launched an appeal fund for an operation - not available through the NHS - to relieve his agony and £, was raised in a matter of days.  The -year-old mum wants to give her son a send-off that reflects everything he loved in le. He loved motorcycles, so his body will be conveyed in a motorbike hearse. He was fanatical about Birmingham City  so the coffin will be decorated with a team shirt. It will also feature a selection of superheroes. The heartbroken parents had hoped to place Jake in the same place as his brother, but that is not possible. “We want him really close to his brother,” says Debbie. “They promised they’d get him as close to Robert as they possibly could.  “In my mind, they’re now in heaven, anyway. “We took Jake to see Robert. We never told him how ill he was – we tried to make his le as positive and happy as we possibly could, but we think he knew.” Leighaposs Syndrome, which attacks the central nervous system, is characterised by progressive loss of mental and motor abilities. It typically results in death within two to three years, usually due to respiratory failure, according to Genetics Home Reference.Jake’s grandparents and aunt are also buried at Woodlands. “I wish the council took things case by case,” Debbie says.  “I understand there must be rules, but they could maybe, when there are terminally ill children, stick to the normal price. “The lady from the council I spoke to on the phone was heartbroken, she was in tears. But it seems it’s a case of ‘the computer says...’ “I just cried and cried and cried. I feel guilt that, because it’s genetic, it’s more than likely from me.” A spokesman for Solihull Council said: “This is a very sad case and we have every sympathy with the family.  “We explored the option of burying their son at the same plot with their first son, but, unfortunately, this isn’t possible as it is only suitable for one person. “The charge is higher for a separate plot, but is in line with the cost where. “We have advised the family that there may be support they can get from the Department of Work and Pensions.” "},{"url":null,"title":"humble british bank clerk recruited","story":"w.mantis  Humble British bank clerk recruited by MI to spy on the Nazis during WW n EXCLUSIVE: Eric Roberts was recruited by MI and was so successful he gained the trust of  Nazi ­sympathisers and stopped vital information going to Germany n He was nothing like the spies you see in countless Hollywood films.  nEric Roberts worked as a humble bank clerk while secretly posing as Gestapo agent Jack King to infiltrate UK fascist groups during the Second World War.  nThe MI agent was so successful he gained the trust of  Nazi ­sympathisers and stopped vital information making its way to Hitler’s Germany.  nBut his family had no idea about the extent of his espionage until it was revealed in National Archive papers in .  nGranddaughter Marilyn said: “As a child I knew grandad was a spy during the war but our family had no idea what that really involved.  n“He never talked about it and it was never spoken about, other than in ­whispers during sleepovers with my ­cousins. n  n   nVeteran sweet maker turned WWII hero immortalised on tin of mints  nWar hero, , gets free pints for le after  yearsapos loyal service to one pub   nWe would make up all these pretend ­stories about his adventures.”  nGranddaughter Marilyn said: “As a child I knew grandad was a spy during the war but our family had no idea what that really involved.  n“He never talked about it and it was never spoken about, other than in ­whispers during sleepovers with my ­cousins.

Eric Roberts worked as a humble bank clerk while secretly posing as Gestapo agent Jack King to infiltrate UK fascist groups during the Second World War. The MI agent was so successful he gained the trust of  Nazi ­sympathisers and stopped vital information making its way to Hitler’s Germany. But his family had no idea about the extent of his espionage until it was revealed in National Archive papers in . Granddaughter Marilyn said: “As a child I knew grandad was a spy during the war but our family had no idea what that really involved. “He never talked about it and it was never spoken about, other than in ­whispers during sleepovers with my ­cousins. We would make up all these pretend ­stories about his adventures.” Even her dad Max, , knew nothing about his ­father’s double le. Marilyn, , of Toronto, Canada, said: “My dad remembers his father ­disappearing for days but he had no idea what he was up to.  He also recalls going into London with his dad who insisted on walking five feet in front of him. “When the phone rang, Dad was told to hand it over to his father, no matter what name the caller gave.” Author Robert Hutton approached the family to tell Eric’s story and his book Agent Jack was released last year.  It has echoes in a new Amazon drama about Nazi hunters in America due to be shown this month. In the series Hunters, Al Pacino leads a team bringing secret US Nazis to justice in the s. Britain’s real-le Nazi hunter was a far cry from Pacino’s tough guy image but no less daring.  Eric was recruited by MI spymaster Maxwell Knight – said to have inspired Bond character M – in the s. At that time fascism was on the march all over Europe and MI was worried about its popularity here. Eric joined the British Union of Fascists, led by Oswald Mosley and got to know many of Hitler’s British sympathisers.  While working at Westminster Bank he posed as a Gestapo agent under orders to recruit people to Germany’s cause. Hutton says: “People ­trusted Eric implicitly. “He was fantastically ­outgoing, a real practical joker and very charming. His personality got him out of a lot of scrapes.”  For example in  a gang of fascists in Leeds rumbled him when he gave a  job and ­address. But he managed to talk his way out of it.Hutton said: “He wrote that they were ‘hostile’ but explained ‘I was able to set their mind at ease.’ I think they trusted him because they wanted to. “He had that quality of being a nice guy. It’s not very James Bond but it’s the way he made spying work for him.”  Eric took early retirement in  aged  and moved with we Audrey to Vancouver, Canada, with their two sons Max and Peter and daughter Crista.

Ocado has been accused of risking children’s lives as it steps up its battle to match Amazon’s Prime Now service to drop off food to homes within an hour. The Zoom site will use  vans to ferry goods to customers. And similar city depots are expected across Britain. But parents fear toxic fumes from idling vehicles queuing to load up at Ocado’s first dedicated UK Zoom site in Islington, North London, will pour into the playground. It will even have its own diesel pumps. Mum Natasha Cox, whose -year-old daughter has severe asthma, said: “You wouldn’t get planning permission to build a school next to a diesel facility – but apparently the reverse is possible. And she alleged: “Air pollution at the school is already just under the legal limit, but could tip overit [the depot] went ahead.” Air quality analyst Andrew Grieve, who has children at Yerbury Primary –which is close to London’s busy and polluted Holloway Road section of the A – added: “The children will be  metres from the pumps. “Research in Spain shows there is a six times higher than normal incidence of tumoursyou live within m of a petrol station.” Parents have already staged a ‘Nocado’ protest at the site where work has begun and Ocado officials were blasted at a heated meeting held at the school.

newborn baby was just hours from deathThe parents of the baby, whos considered lucky to be alive, are now campaigning for the test to become available on NHSShareCommentsByCharlotte Nisbet:,  FEB

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe parents of a newborn baby diagnosed with Strep B through an £ test are urging the Government to make the testing available on NHS.Jodie and Nathan Ashmore purchased the test for their son Oscar at Licoln County hospital shortly after he was born, when his health began deteriorating and he contracted sepsis.It revealed Jodie and Nathanaposs baby had contracted Strep B - a type of bacteria called streptococcal bacteria which can be passed onto newborn babies during labour. Oscar was given lesaving antibiotics, and seven days later the first-time parents were allowed to take him home with them.  He might have died had the bacteria not been diagnosed when it was. Jodie, a -year-old accountant from Lincolnshire, had no idea Strep B was something to worry about during pregnancy.  This was crazy considering one in five people carried the le-threatening bacteria, she said. Itaposs £ to pay for the test privately andIaposd have known about the risks, I would definitely have paid for it as Iaposd had two miscarriages before Oscar. My pregnancy and labour was pretty straight forward but soon after the birth Oscar became agitated.  We were first time parents and didnapost know anything was wrong but compared to the other babies on the ward he was acting dferently. He was refusing to drink milk and began grunting while flaring his nostrils which we now know is a symptom of Strep B in babies. Thankfully another NHS member of staff who was changing some bedding recognised that something was wrong and despite a nurse from paediatrics not initially being concerned, Oscar was taken to a neonatal unit at just nine hours old. NormallyStrep B isnapost treated within the first  hours of their le they are likely to die or have serious brain damage from the infection.  We didnapost know what was wrong with Oscar but once we realised the Strep B has caused our baby to contract sepsis, we knew how serious it was. Jodie said she couldnapost be more thankful to the NHS for saving Oscaraposs le. The little family spent seven days at Lincoln County Hospital before being discharged. With the experience behind her, Jodie was hoping she could raise awareness of the bacteria. If Iaposd have known about Strep B Oscar wouldnapost have been fighting for his le at just a few hours old.  Heaposs now  weeks old and is doing really well but it will be a worry until heaposs a bit older as to whether the Strep B has affected him long term. I know the NHS have to make cutbacks but the neonatal care for babies is much more costly when they are fighting the bacteria. Group B Strep Support founder Jane Plumb MBE said Oscaraposs story highlighted how important it was for pregnant women to be informed. When women know about group B Strep, they may choose to be tested. The ECM [enriched culture medium] test is the best test to detect GBS but itaposs not widely available within the NHS. The estimated cost for this on the NHS is £.

Before that this cruel illness will rob him of his voice – the ability to talk and laugh with his we Lindsey, and children Macy, Jackson and Maya. So Rob has been spending time recording phrases so he can “speak” to them, with an automated communication aid. Just simple things like “stop doing that” and “get down” as “they’re the normal things I say as dad.” And, of course, he’s recorded “I love you” - although Lindsey and the kids won’t ever need reminding of that, I’m sure, not even when he’s gone.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailTo tweet or not to tweet  That is the question. And Alastair Stewart will be kicking himself for the rest of his le for his misjudged answer. Alastair, the nation’s longest- serving male newsreader, stepped down from his ITV role this week after tweeting a ­Shakespeare quote during a row over the Royal Family. The quote to follower Martin ­Shapland contained the words “angry ape”, which was all Martin needed to seize the ­spotlight, play the victim and accuse him of racism. So in a matter of seconds, Alastair Stewart OBE went from talented journalist and ­broadcaster with more than years experience to being a racist because one black man on Twitter said so. Alastair apologised for any harm he caused with the ape line from the play Measure For Measure, admitting it was “a misjudgment I regret”. And he should regret ever joining Twitter – where you hold views on parenting, religion, race, politics and body image at your peril. The place is a bear pit, with no end of users happy to poke the bear and twist their meaning. And even the smartest people will rise to the bait. I have worked with Alastair in the past and while I would say he was foolish to get into a Twitter scuffle with a member of the public, I know the man isnot a racist.Tens of thousands of people have so far joined a petition calling for ITV to reinstate him, with an army of colleagues jumping to his defence too. I find it appalling that people are calling out racism in ­situations whereyou took a step back, breathed and looked at it, you could sensibly conclude there was no race agenda.  But instead, people are lobbing in comments and angry hashtags, stirring things up, publicly shaming innocent people. Martin Shapland and people like him who want to play the race card to silence opinions they don’t agree with need to be very careful. Because it is these kind of oversensitive reactions that make a mockery of people who are facing genuine racism. It belittles their battles. And on the other side, being called a racist when you are not one is devastating. There is also the danger of making people too afraid to confront serious issues – reporting on them, asking for help, whistleblowing –they involve ethnic minorities.

country to care for her mother \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA teacher told of her horror last night after travelling to China and contracting the deadly coronovirus. Muying Shi, who has been living in London for five years, is in quarantine in locked-down Wuhan after CT scans showed the infection was in her lungs. The -year-old, the first British-based person to talk about the virus while in hospital, said: “I am really scared. “I fear for my le but I can’t think about it because I would just break down. I feel like I’m hanging on by a thread.” Muying contracted the disease after flying to her birthplace in early January to help nurse her mum Liping Wang, , who was already dying of cancer. She is now in the sprawling city’s Hospital , where her father Xianqing, , is also being treated for the virus. Her voice shaking with emotion, she told the Sunday Mirror: “I am sharing a room with two elderly people and one is using an oxygen tank to help her breathe. “I’m not allowed out of this room and, what’s worse, is that I’m not able to see my mum who is in a dferent hospital three miles away in the last stages of rectal cancer.” Nearly  million people are under lockdown in Chinese cities as researchers race to develop a vaccine for the virus, which has so far killed  people and affected , worldwide. It has spread to  countries and UK officials confirmed two cases on Friday. In pandemic epicentre Wuhan, China’s seventh-biggest city with a population of  million, hospitals are straining under the weight of thousands of panicking patients who fear they have the disease.  Muying said: “It’s grim to say the least. Nobody knows anything about the virus so there’s no proper treatment. My dad are I are being given painkillers and antibiotics, but there is no cure. “Some patients get no medicine at all and I can hear them through the walls, yelling at the doctors. “The doctors and nurses are wearing full protection suits but you can tell they are nervous too. The staff who deliver our lunch and dinners are speculating the food is contaminated. “There are around  people with the suspected virus in the hospital and there’s no information coming from anywhere. I’m just trying to hold it together for my mum and dad. “I’m sitting here knowing I’m going to lose my mum and I just can’t stand the thought of this virus taking my father.”  Muying, who works as a private language tutor in Colindale, North London, flew out to Wuhan on January  after being told her mum did not have long to live. She said: “Mum told me there was some sort of pneumonia-type disease going around but that the Government was saying it was not serious and they could contain it. In mum’s ward there were people coming in and out without masks all the time. “It was only last week that doctors started going privately to patients and asking their families to wear face masks that I started to really worry. “Then one day men in Hamza suits marched in to my mother’s cancer ward and said she needed to move to another floor within  minutes. They didn’t tell us why, it was just an order. “We now know they were making space for coronovirus patients.”  Muying went out and bought a box of face masks but it failed to stop her and her dad getting sick. She fell ill with a fever and diarrhoea on Monday whie he got ill the following day. They attended a “fever clinic”, one of several centres set up to test residents for coronovirus. CT scans on Muying’s lung showed a shadow and doctors confirmed she had the virus Her father, who showed the same symptoms, was suspected to have it. Both were admitted to hospital later in the week. Chinese officials have been accused of trying to cover up the extent of the virus and Muying said she will only be added to the recorded statistics once she has tested positive through a test kit being handed out by the State.  But she said: “Nobody is handing out the kits. The doctors say they have run out but I don’t knowthat’s true. “The news here says there are around , people in hospital or at home suspected to have the virus. But doctors in the hospital are saying that figure is closer to ,. She added: “I talk to dad in the other ward on my mobile, and he keeps crying because we can’t visit my mum. She’s just taking painkillers and waiting to die. We are heartbroken we can’t be with her.” Muying has no ideashe will be allowed toto Britain. She said: “I’ve no idea what the future holds. Right now I have to stay alive and stay strong for my parents.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast met office","story":"w.mantis  UK weather forecast: Met Office predicts snow on high ground as temperatures plummetThe Met Office has said snow could hit higher ground as temperatures plunge over the coming days.

There is no suggestion that I personally falsied this email.“The suggestion is that I forwarded the email after it had been falsied by someone .“I refute the allegations made against me and I can confirm I will be appealing against my removal from my post.Mr Christie also said he felt that the penalty seemed to be “disproportionate” to the accusations made against him.“No other allegations have been made against me,” he said.“I have worked in my current role for  years and have had an association with the council for  years.“I continue to have a huge respect for my council colleagues, council officers and elected members.“This is a very unfortunate time for me and I will need to take time to look at things moving forward.“I don’t wish to say anything further at this stage but will be making my intentions clear in due course.”Blue Parrot had provided sound equipment for DSMT for previous shows.DSMT producer and manager Lina Waghorn said: “I am shocked and saddened that Kenny Christie is no longer working with the council.“He was a great asset to DSMT and an inspirational teacher.”It’s understood students at DSMT were informed on Sunday January  that Mr Christie was “moving on to new projects”.It was made clear to students he was not ing and that Kris Mordente, a St John’s Academy teacher, would be taking over director permanently.A source at DSMT said: “It’s just a bit strange that he’s gone. Kenny was DSMT and DSMT was Kenny. I don’t think anyone knows how we’re going to operate without him.“He had been growing distant for a while, we have only seen him three times since August and at one point Lina mentioned bringing in an assistant director.“It’s not something we’d expect, I think everyone here including Lina would be reluctant to let him go.”A Blue Parrot spokesman said the company was not awarded the DSMT contract because “strictly speaking, we did not meet the deadline.”A Dundee City Council spokesman said: “We do not comment on inidual personnel matters.”Kenny Christie has been described as one of the most “sought-after” musical theatre directors in the country.He has worked with DSMT for over  years, producing several musicals like Les Miserables and Annie.His directing career began at the age of , producing a one-act play as part of the SCDA drama festival.In , Mr Christie became the world record holder for the fastest theatrical production, taking one piece from book to stage in just . hours.He has also taught and organised dance workshops ,in Dundee and Perth, and has worked with Dundee City Council to organise dance activities for school pupils.Mr Christie has also held the title of chairman of the Heads of Instrumental Teaching Scotland, as well as being the first Youth Adviser for Scotland for the National Operatic and Dramatic Association.Kenny Christie’s sacking comes in the wake of a separate fraud scandal that has rocked Dundee City Council in the past year.In October, the council’s head of construction Mark Ross quit in the midst of an investigation into claims he was treated to a golfing trip on the Spanish coast by bosses of a firm awarded an £ million local authority contract.The £.m deal to provide heat and smoke and carbon monoxide detectors was awarded to Edmundson Electrical without going out to tender.The trip to Spain took place weeks after the contract was awarded and included Mr Ross, a senior Edmundson staff member, another council employee and representatives of two other firms.It was later revealed that the second council employee was Kenny Muir, who also worked in the council’s construction department.He was sacked from his role earlier this month.Mr Muir is the fourth senior employee to leave construction services since September, following the resignations of Mr Ross and electrical supervisor Iain Gardyne, who is accused of selling thousands of pounds’ worth of council smoke alarms online."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.49770743-240x180.jpg

Berra went straight into the XI less than  hours after signing on loan, partnering Jordon Forster in central defence who made his first appearance in six weeks.Conor Hazard replaced Jack Hamilton in goal while Ollie Crankshaw made his first start since joining from Wigan on loan.Missing through injury were Jordan Marshall , who is out long-term, Paul McGowanand Andrew Nelsonleaving the matchday squad a man light.The Dark Blues started on the front foot with energy about them and went close early on as the ball dropped to captain Graham Dorrans inside the area but he sclaffed wide under pressure.On  minutes, they got the breakthrough with Berra coming up with the assist. It was route one stuff as the -cap Scotland international pinged a long ball up to Hemmings. He got the better of debutant Sean McGinty before spinning and firing the ball home.Despite their strong start, Dundee were pegged back on  minutes by former favourite McAlister. Shaun Byrne gave away the free-kick -yards out giving Nicky Cadden a look at goal. His effort took a deflection off the wall and Hazard could only palm the ball out, leaving McAlister with an easy finish.Seconds later Kalvin Orsi fired just over the bar as the home side had their tails up and the same player had the ball in the net from a superb overhead kick eight minutes before the break. The linesman#s flag, though, was already up for offside.After the break, Orsi looked certain to score only for Berra to get a vital toe on the ball at the last moment. The ball, though, careered off Forster#s leg before bobbling wide of the post.On  minutes, Morton were reduced to  men after Kyle Jacobs went in heavily on Hemmings on the halfway line to earn his second yellow of the contest. Home fans weren#t happy after referee Bobby Madden played an advantage before pulling the game back to book Jacobs but the tackle certainly warranted a caution.Moments later and Dundee were inches away from making the extra man count immediately as Declan McDaid curled a good effort off the far post and Forster headed the rebound wide.Hemmings went close two minutes later only for Chris Millar to block before Christie Elliott almost marked his debut with a fine goal after replacing Crankshaw.The former Partick man cut in from his left wing position and hit a fine effort that flew just past the far post.A man light, Morton were happy to hold their shape and sit back while Dundee played the ball around the middle of the park.With eight minutes to go, though, Ton had the chance to steal the points as Orsi rose in the centre of goal but headed wide of the post.In stoppage time, Elliott thought he had grabbed a late winner on his debut but his free-kick clipped the wall and drted just wide of the post with goalie Danny Rogers stranded.Morton: Rogers, Tumilty, McGinty, Jacobs, McAlister, Orsi , Strapp, Cadden , Sutton , Colville, Baird.Subs not used: Ramsbottom, McLean, McHugh, McGuffie.Dundee: Hazard, Kerr, McGhee, Forster, Berra, Byrne, Dorrans, Callachan, McDaid, Crankshaw , Hemmings.Subs not used: Hamilton, Meekings, Robertson, Anderson, Cameron.Attendance: ,"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.49770743-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.49770743-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.49770743-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.49770743-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"roadworks to cause five days of disruption in city centre","story":"Motorists will face major disruption when five days of city centre roadworks begin next week.Resurfacing and maintenance works are being carried out meaning the junction that connects Courier Place, Reform Street and Meadowside will be closed until Saturday.The work will cause problems for taxis drivers as it will cut access to the rank in the Nethergate.Rod Alexander, a -year-old cabbie, said: #It#ll definitely cause a disruption.#I think it#s going to encourage people to take a short cut through the taxis and buses-only lane, which is really not good for us.#People do that already, even though they shouldn#t, and I think that this is just going to encourage that.#It#ll be frustrating to get through.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets.

We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding.

Through time Willie and Jimmy both retired early from the firm through ill health and when Dan retired in  the business was taken over by Williersquos son, William , and long time colleague, Bill Reid . Graham became the fourth generation Williamto work in the business after leaving school and in  took over the business when his father, Bill, retired.The Douglas family took over the building of the annual Border Union Show and Kelso Ram Sales in  and the Championship Dog Show since the first Show in , completing  years for the former and  years for the latter respectively in .It is interesting to note they succeeded Messrs. Bulman, builders Kelso who had been involved with BUAS since . To have had only two main Contractors in over  years is indicative of their skills and loyalties.Graham was very clever at school with a good practical brain and I heard from his le long friend, Andy Shortreed, that he was an expert at, among other things, technical drawing and would make all manner of things out of wood and other material.He was encouraged to study and utilise these skills while at High School in Hawick but Graham was stubborn! All he wanted to do was leave school and join his father, Bill, and be a fencer, which he duly did in .Countless number of farms and estates throughout the Borders have benefited from Grahamrsquos skill, as have the three core events at BUAS. His younger brother, Neil, was in partnership with Graham for a number of years before ing to utilising his skills with heavy plant machinery.I cannot have more regard and respect for Bill and Graham and how they nurtured me when I joined BUAS as Secretary in . I listened and I learnt from them all the ins and outs of both the Showground and preparing these massive annual Events and bringing them together in such a professional manner and with an uncanny calmness that sometimes was frustrating but one knew that come the day the target was reached. The Ram Sales have evolved over the last  years with many changes and updates and it was a pleasure working with someone who was always conscious of the huge responsibility he had to the many thousands of people, whose livelihoods were often very dependant on a good Ram Sales or a good Show, whether buying, selling, exhibiting, a Trade Stand, providing a service or a member of the public.Grahamrsquos other passion in le was his racing pigeons, which he has bred and raced for over  years - and for the last  with his friend and near neighbour in Lilliesleaf, Bob Spearman. They had many years of great fun and indeed numerous successes with their birds and it was always a great pleasure and exciting for those at the Showground when in the spring Graham would very often bring a crate of young birds when he came to work and released them as part of their early training. A master breeder even he did not understand how the young birds knew which direction was home!He had a great eye and would spend many long evenings just watching the birds to learn which would be potential race winners and which to keep as breeding stock. They had their fair share of success in UK races, whether from Edinburgh or the south coast of England but their biggest success was when one of their favourites ndash Bonnie Lad ndash finished th out , birds released from the South of France. No-one does fathom how these incredible birds find their way home and I believe these two wise owls were also baffled but enjoyed the discussion and banter over a pint or two in the local pub.

meeting room and storage area for historic books and documents, as well as the towns vast array of Christmas lights.Attempts have been made in recent years to form a Trust to bring the Reading Room back to their former glory.And surveys have been carried out to establish the viability of a community facility.But a shock email from legal representatives of Mellerstain Estate towards the end of

a spanner in the works.Local councillor David Parker believes it is unlikely the community will be able to oppose the claims.He said: \"The community has had an aspiration to do something with the Reading Rooms, and in  I was handed some information about the historical operation.\"That information suggested that Mellerstain Estate had always had a claim on the building but the Reading Room had

I use this phrase to describe the spectacle of street lights at night when viewed from a vantage point.One of the best places in East Lothian to view the lsquoupside down skyrsquo is from the road by Farsquoside Castle. This vantage point gives you views over Wallyford, Musselburgh, Portobello and Edinburgh beyond.These urban areas create a sea of lights which look like a sky full of bright stars, except, of course, itrsquos lsquoupside downrsquo and theyrsquore not really stars. But it looks spectacular in its own way. In fact, views with bright city lights are these days often considered tourist attractions.But Irsquove recently realised something: while the lsquostarsrsquo of the lsquoupside down skyrsquo are getting more numerous and extensive every year, the real stars in the actual sky are becoming more dficult to see at least where I live.Literally thousands upon thousands of houses are being built in the western part of our county. Much of the rural landscape in this part of East Lothian, which I knew when I was a child, is going fast.Most of me understands and accepts the needs for this, but a part feels sad at the loss of a recognisable landscape. And already I have noticed that a by-product of this has been increased light pollution in areas close to where I live. It is going to get much more noticeable as more development takes place.I know many people will say there are many more things to think about, especially in late January, when the Christmas turkey is coming home to roost and all those bills have to be paid at a time when we are already financially drained from festive expenditure, and stressed out. Thank goodness for Burns suppers, a highlight of a month that often seems both the darkest and longest of the year.But this is all the more reason to pause. When was the last time you really had the opportunity to sit under a dark night sky full of visible stars  This is one of naturersquos free gts and stargazing has real benefits for our mental health and emotional wellbeing.I remember some years ago, when visiting a friend in a very rural part of Scotland, I went out to put something in the bin. My friend came out to seeI was OK, as I hadnrsquot ed after  minutes. I had been struck by the beauty and power of the starlit sky, unpolluted by city lights. Without noticing the time, I had sat just gazing at the universe above me.I can remember the sense of awe and peace it created. Sure, part of it was also the quiet and stillness in that area, but sitting under the canopy of stars is what overwhelmed me in that moment.Itrsquos an experience fewer of us can enjoy because of the increase in light pollution, but also noise and general busyness all around us. So we often donrsquot even realise what wersquore missing. Perhaps there is a cause and effect here: the less you notice the absence of something, the less you think itrsquos important or relevant.Our ancient ancestors understood its power. But I think we have lost the sense. I recently asked a group of young people how many of them had sat under the stars and just gazed and wondered at them. Sadly, none had done so, and some thought the idea ldquoweird. I think a lot of adults would share that opinion.But taking time to sit and really wonder at an unpolluted night sky can fill us with awe, as I experienced that evening at my friendrsquos house. It makes us feel small and in so doing it puts our worries and anxieties in perspective. It can promote inner peace and calm.For sure, the bills wonrsquot go away neither will the stress at work or whatever is dominating your thoughts most of the day. But in taking time to pause and wonder at the vast and almost timeless beauty of the stars, your soul gets time to catch up. It can help you see things dferently, in a more creative way. Itrsquos a form of meditation with something bigger than we can imagine, but also something incredibly beautul.And itrsquos fascinating, as you try to identy the dferent constellations, and perhaps realise how much you donrsquot know or have forgotten. Could you identy the northern star, and what constellations can you see  Sailors in days of old were experts at identying the stars to aid direction, but Irsquom sure they also marvelled at the unhindered beauty and mystery of them as well.There are still many places in our county where we can be wrapped in star-lit darkness. But as the lsquoupside down skyrsquo gets bigger and brighter, the real stars are fading in so many places.The real shame is, as the stars disappear from our sight, they may disappear from our consciousness as well.Letrsquos not let that happen. Let us gt our children, and ourselves, with the noticing and gazing at the real stars in our sky and somehow find the time, even briefly, to stargaze."},{"url":null,"title":"garry-oconnor-referees-haddington-amateur-teams-successful-charity-match","story":"Haddington Town FC took time out over the festive period for a special friendly in aid of Back Onside.Former Hibernian and Scotland striker Garry OrsquoConnor, who is an ambassador of the good cause, refereed the match, which saw members of the amateur teamrsquos squad come up against one another on January .Matt OrsquoConnell, chairman of the club, which was formed last year, said they were determined to help support the charity, which helps young people and adults who face mental health challenges.He said: ldquoWersquore a club that was founded on the idea of bringing local guys together into a positive social and active environment.ldquoItrsquos well documented that the highest proportion of suicide across Scotland is men aged - and thatrsquos something we hope to positively redress in our town by facilitating a great environment in which local guys can improve not only their physical but also their mental health.ldquoOur connection with the charity Back Onside was really born of their slogan, #SupportThroughSport, a powerful statement that really resonated with us.ldquoTheyrsquore a great charity who are doing a hell of a lot across the UK and so for us, a small amateur club barely nine months old, to play a small part in helping a charity who share our ethos was immensely rewarding.Haddington Town play on Sunday mornings in Division Two of the Lothian and Edinburgh Amateur Football Association , alongside fellow county side Meadowmill.The charity match, played at Knox Academy, finished - in favour of the lsquoawayrsquo Haddington Town team.Libby Emmerson, founder and CEO of Back Onside, said: ldquoWe are beyond grateful for the support received from Haddington Town Amateur Football Club and guest referee Garry OrsquoConnor.ldquoAs a small charity with a huge clientele, community events such as the Haddington Town AFC charity match are key to raising funds and awareness so that we can continue to support those facing mental health challenges.Mr OrsquoConnell thanked everyone for their support, with the match raising pound, ndash more than double the target.He said: ldquoHuge thanks to Libby Emmerson, FES FM and Garry OrsquoConnor.

Eight weeks would be acceptable  is not.Naturally, this eyesore wont be published on any VisitScotland website. Most sightseers wont ever catch a glimpse of this inglorious aftermath. Meanwhile, between now and the middle of May, those who live and work in Edinburgh must pass by and avert their gaze, wondering how their city became a mere pawn of the entertainment industry and not an illustrious capital of which they could once be proud. As one of many disgruntled locals tweeted, this is ruination \"in the name of greed\".I cannot think of a city of comparable elegance, venerability and wealth ndash a Unesco World Heritage Centre to boot ndash where the first thing you see as you emerge from the train station, or arrive from the airport is a wasteland. Welcome to Scotland! Here we dont roll out the red carpet, but ndash after an agonisingly long delay ndash we do renew the turf.Theres a palpable feeling at the moment that Edinburgh is undergoing seismic change, under our noses but without public consent. News last week that planning regulations could be relaxed to allow restaurants, cafes, and a host of other non-retail outfits to move into Princes Street is a fresh cause for concern. If approved, this new dispensation could mean that one of Europes most beguiling bouleds ndash the street that sells Scotland ndash could become home to a casino, cinema, or even a sports facility.Why should this concern us  Given the tawdry quality of some of the shops currently trading, wouldnt bright cafes or restaurants be a welcome improvement  After all, the array of tartan tat, cheap-as-chips fashion and even an emporium dedicated to sugary sweets ndash the smell alone could rot your teeth ndash is hardly in keeping with the magnicence of the venue.Yet given some of the poor decisions already taken by the councils planning committee, it is hard to feel confident that this incomparably lovely avenue is in safe hands. One member of the committee says the idea is to create a \"more authentic\" space. Im not sure what that means, but it sounds like double-speak for attracting lucrative footfall. And while pubs wont apparently be allowed onto the street, this relaxing of regulations extends to George Street, Hanover Street, Frederick Street and Castle Street. Like it or not, the face of the New Towns commercial district is set for a facelt.With the demise of House of Fraser at the West End, now transformed into a whisky experience, and towards the East End the once-beloved Jenners department store due shortly to close , the heart of the city is struggling to keep up with bewildering change. Fortunately, nothing so awful is in the pipeline as the notorious proposal some years ago to build an elevated shopping mall in the gardens. Perhaps the most worrying aspect of a less stringent commercial climate is the signal it sends, and the trend it looks set to deepen.Wherever you go, Edinburgh is turning into a visitor attraction, a living museum and gallery. Useful shops for locals are a rarity. In their place is a proleration of chic cafes, glitzy on-trend eateries and luxurious hotels, all pandering to the tourist market. Thanks to the make-over of old premises and investment in new, the capital has a superficial shine, a high-cost stylish patina. But as Dickenss Mr and Mrs Veneering showed, putting your faith in appearances is risky. Yes, it creates jobs, though mostly of a lowly-paid, transitory kind. But at what cost  Do people make the trip to Edinburgh for its pubs and coffee shops, or to soak up the atmosphere of culture, history and daily le that, over centuries, have made its name Princes Street has undoubtedly been in need of improving its image for a long time now. Some initiatives are to be welcomed, such as the Quaich project, to renovate the run-down Ross Bandstand, and to \"wild\" the western part of the gardens, so they look less like a postcard from the s and rather more invitingly freeform. While that is a laudable aspiration for one side of the street, however, the other is in danger of losing whatever soul it has left.I understand that the council is in a dficult position, trying to safe-guard the future of a district caught in the retail nightmare of swtly changing, quixotic customer behaviour. That it is hoping to welcome a greater ersity of trade suggests that in one aspect at least, human habits are unchanged: eating and drinking and watching the world go by. In fact, we are consuming far more than we ever did before, willing to spend money as well as countless hours sipping lattes and beer and scoffing burgers and sushi. So much for austerity. When it comes to leisure, wallets fly open.There would be nothing wrong with broadening Princes Streets commercial scopeyou could trust those at the controls. Sadly, I have no such faith. On the evidence of recent years, the citys development is geared towards immediate gratication, mainly for migrating flocks of cash-splashing customers. Where is the long-term perspective, tailored to the true character of the city, and to the requirements and concerns of those who live in it  Why bother to ask. Such a perspective requires serious thought, knowledge and imagination, luxuries the current decision-makers dont want to afford. As they say, Rome wasnt built in a day ndash but a theme park could be."},{"url":null,"title":"feel-like-come-2020","story":"I had already talked to my parents and closest friends and word had spread to the close family. This was designed to finish the job, ensuring everyone heard it from the horsersquos mouth, not on the rumour mill, and more than a little self-indulgently I admit, as catharsis after  years too many of trying to ensure no one would ever know.I touched the lsquopostrsquo key, threw my eyes shut as adrenaline, dread and relief filled me, then slowly opened them to assess the damage from the G-Bomb I had dropped. I anticipated that it would garner attention and elicit praise from my young, liberal peers, but I hadnrsquot realised the response would explode like a giant confetti canon at Pride.It turns out a lot of people are refreshing Facebook at three in the afternoon at the beginning of February. With  likes, a thread of congratulatory comments a mile long and an inbox inundated with more heartfelt messages expressing the same, I was overwhelmed, overjoyed, and filled with exactly the love and support I needed to close the door behind me for good on the ghastly closet and get on with living. I even received a hand-written letter from a university friend. I still have it somewhere.A few weeks later, a straight guy at university with whom Irsquod rarely spoken made a point of telling me he was so moved by my coming-out post, made four years ago tomorrow, he was punching the air at his desk. I was incredibly touched as I set about navigating the dating scene as a gay man for the first time, keen as I was not to waste any more time. Because I did feel dreadfully behind my friends, something I later learned I was wrong about. That misconception is a common feeling, gay or straight.Coming out is a journey, and itrsquos one children begin to undertake from a young age and face alone. Before I could feel the slightest attraction for anyone, I was immersed in a society where all around the message is that opposite sexes attract. Before you can even conceive of coming out, you realise yoursquore not how yoursquore ldquosupposed to be and walk unknowingly into the closet where it feels safest. Everyonersquos experience is dferent, but there are certain commonalities.Some are most particularly afraid of how their friends will react, while often itrsquos family. Catholicism is part of my family fabric, and I worried about how readily my parents would go through the cognitive gymnastics often needed to reconcile the two. While my family is English on one side and American on the other, the reality is most families in Scotland have a religious influence, practicing or not, that helps inform instinctive attitudes on the transgression from ldquothe norm that is being LGBT.Eventually I realised that just as it was a journey for me in learning to embrace and love my gay self, so too is it a journey for our parents, wider family and friends. My parents, Paul and Lisa, had concerns my le would be harder, focussing on my welfare, particularly in those first few weeks while at university after breaking the news on Facebook. At the same time they could at last begin to reimagine how the future would play out.For many families, having an LGBT member does not fit in neatly with their hope of appearing at once perfect and ndash rather contradictorily ndash normal. The gossip at the school gates far outlives a parentrsquos years standing at them, and many bend over backwards to keep up appearances. But the picture painted in programmes such as Modern Family, with its gay members, interracial marriages, orce, and adoption has long been much closer to reality.But sexuality is far from the only area in which notional normality eludes us, or at the very least, eluded me. This next anecdote forms a key part of the emotional roller-coaster that was that immediate post-coming-out period but I havenrsquot previously shared it beyond a few friends.On a trip to China in the summer that year, I hosted a party in my hotel room at a remote conference venue for the British, American and Canadian students I was with on the first night of a week-long stay.After everyone  had left the room, I found myself alone inside with a male student Irsquod met that day but had barely spoken to. He crossed the room towards me and began kissing me. He pushed me on to my bed and lay on top of me. I told him to stop, thinking an unambiguous message was needed. Whenever he freed my mouth to breathe, I eked out a ldquostop. Sometimes I alternated it with ldquoplease stop, asmanners could charm me out of the situation.I pushed upwards to no avail. I was never going to be able to bench press his body weight. Not least when I was so drunk. As I realised how defenceless I was, and he moved to undress me, I knew the fear so many people, predominantly women, have experienced before me.As his weight on me eased for an instant, I slipped out from under him, ran for the door and collapsed in the hallway as it shut behind me.ldquoWhat happened  an American boy who was still outside said to me.ldquoNothing, I said panting.ldquoThat did not look like nothing. The words hung in the air as I let them go unanswered.For six days none of us left the complex as there was nowhere to go. The attackerhad the good grace not to come to the next party the following night.A week later in central Beijing, we all went clubbing to celebrate his birthday.I dredge up this memory because the simple and happy story of a boy who came out to rapturous applause was only ever going to be part of that tale. I do not know what form othersrsquo earliest sexual experiences take, but I would imagine a greater number resemble mine than they do a Disney fairy tale. But I could be wrong. Sadly I think most parents and grandparents know very little about what is really going on in their young loved onesrsquo lives.So where do we go from here It is our shared moral imperative to fathom othersrsquo experiences of the world and to be amongst those dragging society forwards. Irsquom under no illusion that the average Scot reading this is free of all misgivings about having a child who is LGBT. But all LGBT children will be highly perceptive to any commentary on these issues. The passing comments. Do you remember everything you said out loud about gay marriage legislation when that was debated  From the comfort of your living room, how do you react when gay characters or gay kiss scenes appear on TV shows It is not acceptable to assume a child is or will be straight. Firstly because we all know the fact is that not everybody is straight. In a  YouGov survey, % of respondents placed themselves somewhere other than zero on a scale of zero to six where zero is exclusively heterosexual and six is exclusively homosexual. Among --year-olds it was half.The conclusion I draw from this and the age group discrepancy is that far more people are LGBT, possibly bisexual, than they let on and certainly than older generations are prepared to acknowledge about themselves.When half of young people surveyed say they arenrsquot entirely straight, basic maths says itrsquos time to stop assuming your children or grandchildren are straight.But beyond this it is incumbent upon every one of us to embrace the likelihood of gay, bi or trans loved ones, whatever personal feelings one might have, because of the occurrence of mental illness amongst LGBT people, particularly in the closet, which I can only call an epidemic. Nine in ten young trans people have thought about killing themselves and % have self-harmed at least once. That isnrsquot an alarm bell you hear ringing itrsquos an air-raid siren.A key catalyst for my coming out was the realisation my past bouts of depression would most likely only recur with increasing duration and depth possibly one day ending in suicideI didnrsquot. The decision was made.What comes next after that decision certainly doesnrsquot go as well as hoped for everyone, with a quarter of homeless young people being LGBT. Far more progress is needed to eradicate the rejection LGBT people face from their families.While in the legal context we have made great strides since the Stonewall uprising of  and the social movements of that era, these statistics make me despair at my straight peersrsquo complacency, seeing our more liberal generation and gay marriage and appearing to think wersquove pretty much arrived at the society we need to build.When talking in the office about the cover photoshoot for this piece, one gay colleague older than me made a point of saying how much he admires my openness in talking at work about being gay. I was very appreciative, but it reminded me that while my generation is likely the most consistently visible and outspoken, we stand on the shoulders of generations whose struggles were far greater than young LGBT people in the West today will ever know on a societal level.As recently as , people in Britain were arrested and convicted for having gay sex, the cornerstone of any gay rights. A group of men, the Bolton Seven, were convicted under the Sexual Offences Act , since only sex between two men ndash not three or more ndash had been legalised in England and Wales in . But Scotland did not even see that most basic change until .Thankfully Scotlandrsquos slow start to LGBT liberation was turned around when around  it gained attention worldwide for having the ldquogayest parliament and party leaders of any country.In researching Britainrsquos march away from rampant and state-sanctioned homophobia, two quotes stood out for me. At the Conservative Party conference in , prime minister Margaret Thatcher said: ldquoChildren who need to be taught traditional moral values are being taught that they have an inalienable right to be gay.One year later she brought in legislation that would deny a generation of LGBT children any form of recognition that their sexuality or gender identity was valid at school in their most formative years. After the removal of ldquosodomy laws, this was two steps forward, one step back.Then in  the Supreme Court ruled two gay men from Cameroon and Iran had a right to asylum in the UK. With striking echoes of Thatcherrsquos language  years earlier, Lord Hope instead said reading the judgement: ldquoTo compel a homosexual person to pretend that their sexuality does not exist or suppress the behaviour by which to manest itself is to deny him the fundamental right to be who he is.Real change does happen. We have seen it in our own letimes as we see it in these quotes. But it is not handed to us. Queer history is a story of fighting for our rights, in courts and in the streets. Pride is one such protest, and the LGBT community must continue to question the genuineness of companies all too keen to exploit our struggle and achievements as an opportunity for virtue-signal advertising.And just as the movements of the th century began with trans women of colour, white gay men like me must remember the raised status we have won is worth nought without trans and minority ethnic members of our community seeing those gains.It is just as important, though, that the fight takes place in the home ndash for those who feel able ndash and at the pub, club and office desk ndash calling out our friends and families for the small indignities and inequities which chip away at that fundamental right to exist and holding them to the highest standards we deserve, not just for our own sake but for that of their future children, nieces and nephews too.One challenge on the road to coming out is letting go of the safety and unquestioned esteem of straightness. But it is a safety and esteem maintained through exhausting pretence and denial.In doing the cover photoshoot for this story, we used nakedness to recreate some of the vulnerability of that Facebook post and place it alongside a stoic pride. Buta vulnerability is perceived, it was scarcely felt in that moment. For all the energy once spent trying to be straight, I wouldnrsquot swap being gay for love nor money.Four years out, Irsquove had one loving boyfriend, introduced him to my family, dated, taken up sports, earned two degrees, and at my auntrsquos invitation I hope to go over for New York Pride this summer. A bit further along in my journalism career I want to marry and adopt children. In other words, at this point in time, Irsquom exactly where I want to be."},{"url":null,"title":"unspun-political-diary","story":"WEIRD news arrives of Scottish Labourrsquos election finances.

We just live in a very touch-deprived society. Itrsquos just awful.ldquoYou see people after theyrsquove hadlots of touch and theyrsquore really peaceful, content and happy and they lose the jaggedness that lots of people have.As a lawyer for more than  years before retiring last May to focus on his therapy work, Mr Fraser dealt with countless acrimonious orces and saw first-hand the effects of touch and affection deprivation.He said: ldquoOne of the things cuddle parties try and do is break the unfortunate connection that people have got with affectionate touch and sexual touch, with the consequence that people are simultaneously over-sexualised and touch deprived.As adults, who do we get touch from, he asks, especially without demand. One cuddle party-goer who was only ever touched when her husband wanted physical intimacy and received no affectionate contact was ldquoessentially starved of touch.Mr Fraser said: ldquoComing to the cuddle parties enabled her to experience affectionate, consensual touch with no sexual agenda.A hug that lasts for  seconds releases the hormone oxytocin, known as the cuddle or love hormone, which can lower blood pressure, slow heart rates and improve mood.Researchers have found that the same areas of the brain that respond positively to gentle touch also help to develop a sense of body ownership, or what Mr Fraser calls ldquoembodiment, the sense of inhabiting onersquos own body and setting healthy boundaries.The first cuddle party was held in  in the United States and soon migrated to British shores where the y started with regular events in London, facilitated by Ms Sonnenbaum.She said: ldquoA cuddle party is a way to ask for and receive loving touch in a safe non-sexual setting. This helps with finding out about our own touch preferences and communicating about them effectively without fear of being judged or rejected.ldquoWe practise saying both lsquoyesrsquo and lsquonorsquo confidently to each other. Strong personal boundaries and the ability to say lsquonorsquo are the prerequisite for letting people come close to us ndash or  this wouldnrsquot feel safe.She added: ldquoWith the rise of one-person households in big cities people donrsquot get a lot of touch which is non-sexual and my suspicion is that people have casual sex just to satisfy their skin hunger.Mr Fraser said: ldquoPeople have said things like, lsquothis is my worst nightmarersquo. But itrsquos only touch that you wish to receive ndashyou donrsquot want to get hugged by somebody, you donrsquot get hugged by them.ldquoThis is the opposite of being indiscriminately touched by other people. Itrsquos reprogramming people and itrsquos empowering people.Consent is vital and never more so than in the post #MeToo era when even consensual physical intimacy can be shadowed by fears of accusation and abuse.Mr Fraser said: ldquoThe traditional idea of consent is a bit like an army besieging a castle and the people inside surrender and open the doors and then the army can come in and do whatever they like. You agree to something and then yoursquove got to just accept whatever follows. Our idea of consent is entirely dferent ndash itrsquos based on enthusiastic consent in the moment.The importance of being able to say no to touch of any kind canrsquot be underestimated, said Mr Fraser. He added: ldquoIf a person canrsquot say no then they and the person in contact with them are both fundamentally unsafe.

STY SMITHPic Gordon Terris The HeraldLeonie Paterson, archivistThe garden was established in  and the records we have come from the memoirs of our founders, two Scottish doctors called Robert Sibbald and Andrew Balfour. They had seen gardens on the continent where doctors trained in botany and medicine so they rented a piece of land in Edinburgh to do the same here.The garden would have looked beautul when it first opened, but it was strictly for the training of doctors and the public werenrsquot allowed in. I donrsquot think even now a lot of people realise the research and the science that happens here and whatrsquos been involved in bringing a lot of these plants to the UK ndash the work of the Scottish botanist George Forrest for example.Some people have called Forrest the Indiana Jones of botany and he really does deserve that title. He was a plant collector who became associated with the garden in  and went out to China. It was very risky and he couldrsquove died on numerous occasions.In  hersquod settled just off the Tibet border at a time when a lot of people in that area were quite hostile to Western influences. He heard that there was a plan to besiege his mission and kill everyone so he and two missionaries tried to escape and made their way down the river in pitch darkness on narrow paths ndash one slip and they would have been dead. They were surrounded and cut off. They had to run for their lives.Forrest was running towards the river on his own and did a five-hour climb but discovered sentries at the top so had to head back down. They were trying to track him by his footprints so he had to bury his shoes and wade up the river and hide during the day. He spent five or six days doing this but eventually, some locals helped him. Around , specimens in the Botanic Garden have Forrestrsquos name on them. We wouldnrsquot be in the shape we are nowit wasnrsquot for George Forrest.I worried when I started here that I knew nothing about plants, but for me itrsquos been about the people behind the plants and how incredible they were. Charles Austin for example was around at the time of Linnaeus and was horried at the idea that plants could have sexual parts. But Austin was a great lecturer ndash once, he self-medicated on coffee when it was unusual and described his blind spots and hallucinations to his students.I have a great love for the collection of plants. I can look at a plant and say lsquotherersquos the plant that Forrest named after his wersquo or lsquotherersquos a plant that someone almost died to getrsquo. My favourite is primula vialii. If you get a whole swathe of them together, itrsquos the most incredible sight.Hannah Wilson, Phd studentI grew up in Yorkshire and have always been interested in nature but it was quite haphazard me getting into botany. My undergraduate degree is in mathematics but I finished the course and decided I didnrsquot want to do maths anymore. I got a summer job in a garden near my parents and got into rhododendrons and ended up working there for four years. Irsquom now studying for a PHD looking at begonias in New Guinea.Begonias are a very interesting group to research because theyrsquore so erse and we have a very good collection here at the Botanics. Later this year, Irsquoll be going on the Botanicsrsquo th anniversary expedition to the central range of mountains in Papua New Guinea. Wersquoll be starting in the north and heading south and wersquoll be ascending m. The idea is that all along the -mile route, we will set up base camps and survey the incredible ersity of plants there. We will be camping in the forest and sleeping in hammocks because therersquos no flat ground. Irsquove never slept in a hammock before!We are definitely going to find new plants on this trip. New Guinea is still very much under-studied itrsquos incredibly erse. Papua New Guinea makes up only about . per cent of the global land area but itrsquos estimated to harbour up to  per cent of all global plants, animals and insects. People have always assumed that the flora of Papua New Guinea is safe because itrsquos so remote and dficult to get to, but there is a global threat from climate change. But the more immediate threat in New Guinea is logging and mining and palm oil plantations.Itrsquos exciting to be at the Botanic Garden this year and itrsquos humbling when I remember that Irsquom a tiny part of such a huge institution. Historically, itrsquos been a lot about the plants themselves and collecting them and we still do a lot of that, but now I see us moving towards bioersity loss and the climate crisis.Martine Borge, conservation horticulturistI grew up in Norway and went up into the mountains a lot and always felt connected to the vegetation that was all around it gave me a sense of place. We would pick things to take home and I love working with my hands. Irsquove got mud under my nails right now. Some of the sites we work in are dficult to get to but I love that side of the job. Sometimes we have to use drones just to get a look at a plant.I work on the Scottish Rare Plants project and Scottish rare plants that are threatened. We have  per cent of Scotlandrsquos threatened species growing here within the gardens and I look after them the other side is having some of that material available for reintroduction and bringing the plants back into the wild to try to establish more healthy populations. Getting things re-established can be a challenge ndash all the threat may still be present and we are facing climate change as well.One of our big projects is with a plant called alpine blue sow thistle which is only growing in four sites in the Cairngorms. Itrsquos on the brink and all the sites are tiny little ledges where itrsquos safe from grazing from sheep and deer. Itrsquos a big problem for most threatened plants in Scotland. We collect material and itrsquos grown here and wersquove been able to cross-pollinate between dferent populations. It can be sad to see them clinging to ledges but we have five new sites for the thistle. You feel very attached to the plants you work with ndash they are so charismatic and having a connection to plants is good for your general wellbeing.I am worried about where we are in Scotland ndash we have a lot of beautul wild looking spaces but actually a lot of those spaces are grazed and you can see that they are very bare and botanically quite poor. We need links between populations and habitats and a reduction in the number of deer.The Botanics mean so much to me and I feel proud to work here. Wersquore very much ahead of the curve on conservation. We have so much to learn from plants ndash they are making use of renewable resources all the time and doing their thing. A big thing is not taking plants for granted some of them have uses that they havenrsquot even worked out.David Knott, curator of the living collectionsI was born in Edinburgh and actually learned to walk in the Botanics. My grandfather was an old-style pharmacist and grew a lot of plants in his garden my parents werenrsquot terribly keen on gardening so it skipped a generation. I came to the Botanics as a student of horticulture over  years ago. If you have a passion for plants, the Botanics is one of the finest plant collections in Scotlandnot the world. We have , plants over four gardens.In our gardens, therersquos definitely been a sht to more ecological planting. We have a Chilean hillside at Benmore, a Tasmanian forest at Logan, Nepalese planting at Dawyck and here in Edinburgh we have a Chinese hillside. Growing plants that are endangered is an increasing part of what we do ndash understanding the threats as well. We want to explain and conserve for a better future.One of my favourite plants is the Scottish primrose which grows up on the Sutherland coast. The emotional connection to plants was brought home to me when we had the storm of  when we lost a number of substantial trees in each of our gardens. What was interesting to see were the emotions of regular visitors to the garden. They were horried to see the extent of the damage and the support we got surprised me ndash I could see how much people enjoy and respect the gardens.Recovering from the storm is a process of replanting but the timelines are very dferent from human timelines ndash yoursquore planting not just for one or two generations but five or six. When we lose trees, itrsquos sad but itrsquos obviously an opportunity to replant as well.The effect of climate change in the gardens is something wersquove been aware of for - years. In the last ten years, wersquove had our windiest, coldest and warmest weather. Wersquove just installed a rain garden to mitigate some of the impacts of climate change ndash the aim is to capture and reduce the run-off.Gardeners are by their very nature optimistic. Losing a tree in a storm or a plant to a disease leaves a gap and an opportunity. We have to garden more sustainably so we mitigate some of the impacts of climate change. Itrsquos about going back to the basics that our parents or grandparents were using.Dr Mark Hughes, researcherI am from Cumbria originally and worked in industry for years before I quit and went to university to do botany and Irsquove now been working on begonias for  years. My interest started when I was an undergraduate and was the botanist on an expedition to Ecuador and spent a lot of time looking for begonias. I became fascinated by them.What fascinates me most is the massive ersity ndash itrsquos the fastest growing group in terms of the species that are being discovered.

Itrsquos normal in other parts of the world too. In Tunisia and Morocco, everyone ndash literally everyone, from elderly peasants to small children ndash speaks French as well as Arabic. Years ago, I met some Congolese engineering students while working in China. They spoke French, Lingala, their own tribal languages and, yes, Mandarin Chinese.In all, around % of the worldrsquos population speak more than one language. And yet, here in the UK we cleave to the eccentric belief that it is normal ndash desirable even ndash to be monoglot.ldquoThey all speak English, donrsquot they  is a common but lame excuse for not engaging with other tongues. And sadly, our aversion to learning foreign languages seems to be growing rather than abating.Despite initiatives such as the Scottish Governmentrsquos + programme, which aims to ensure that every child has the chance to learn two modern languages in primary school, language entries at National  and  level have dropped by a fth since . In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, GCSE and A-level language entries have been declining since the turn of the century.:Alan Simpson: It is time to rip up the Gaelic blueprint and start againItrsquos almostas we think that learning another language might somehow corrode us, chip away at head space meant for greater things. Nowhere is this more evident than in attitudes to Gaelic here in Scotland.Gaelic is not a foreign language it is a native language. Without it, we cannot properly understand our history or pronounce the place names in our own country. Whether we live in a Gaelic-speaking area or not, Gaelic is part of our collective Scottish heritage.It is a joyous miracle that Gaelic has survived as a living language despite the slings and arrows chucked at it by outrageous fortune. And yet, people moan about dual-language road signs, which would be considered normal anywhere , and rage against the spending of pound million a year by Bograverd na Gagraveidhlig to promote the Gaelic language.This is an amount that would scarcely keep some English Premier League footballers in designer undies for six months. Or to put it another way, itrsquos pound a head. I personally feel Irsquove got more than my poundrsquos worth from all the Gaelic words Irsquove learnt from the road signs.Recently, we hit a new low in linguistic ignorance when MSP Liz Smith, the Scottish Conservativersquos education spokeswoman, suggested that Comhairle nan Eilean Siarrsquos Gaelic first policy in primary schools would disadvantage children. Her remarks called to mind my -year-old neighbour on Harris who was punished as a child for speaking Gaelic in school and was not taught to read and write his first language.That harms children ndash and the adults they become. Teaching them in their native language first does not.Of course, children in the Hebrides can and must learn English too. They will then be in the hugely advantageous position of being bilingual. And when you are bilingual, you become like my Swiss friends you find it easy to learn further languages.:Homes for Gaelic speakers and a Google office in South Uist... what will it take to revive Gaelic in Scotland We desperately need people who can do that. Adult minds can be prised open to accommodate language learning, but the best time to do it is childhood. All language learning enriches us, and we should welcome any initiative that encourages multilingualism, be it the Comhairlersquos Gaelic first policy or the Scottish Governmentrsquos +.This is partly about economics. You can do business in English in a lot of countries. But you can do it much betteryou have people who speak the language of your target market and understand its culture. Research from the British Chamber of Commerce shows that % of UK SMEs that export have no foreign-language ability for the markets they serve. This kind of monolingualism shaves some .% off Britains GDP.Itrsquos not just about economics, though. Itrsquos also about how we are in the world.For to be an English-language monoglot is to live in a gilded cage. You donrsquot have to make an effort other people do that. You donrsquot have to struggle for words and make mistakes others must expose themselves. But in the end, you are the loser.You miss out on the opportunity to see the world in an alternative way that learning a foreign language brings. People understand your language, but you donrsquot understand theirs. Which effectively means that they know you, but you donrsquot know them.This is how the UK came fatally to misunderstand Germany in the Brexit negotiations. German language learning in the UK is in a parlous state. Only a tiny minority of British people can read German newspapers and books or watch German TV. And so, it became possible for UK politicians to think that for Germany the EU is all about flogging expensive cars, when in fact it is about peace our time, and Germany ainrsquot going to compromise the latter for the former.Yesterday, we left the European Union. If more people in the UK had engaged in the mind-expanding business of learning another language, we would perhaps never have voted to leave. Not just because we would have been better able to take advantage of the colossal economic and cultural opportunities that free movement offered, but also because we would have better understood our neighbours.Now wersquore out, and itrsquos brave new world time. English will no longer be as important a language in the EU as it was, possibly spelling the end of what might be termed the English language century.It could be time to embrace multilingualism or die. Here in Scotland, we can start at home by respecting our Gaelic culture, not as a pretty relic with some good tunes, but as a living, breathing part of us. Not to do so is a form of self-starvation. Gaelic is a gt to treasure, not a burden to shoulder."},{"url":null,"title":"rab-macneil-phrase-coin-grammar-drama","story":"First, as I understand it, many of you are worried about the economy. To some, this is such a dficult subject that economists themselves always get it wrong .But the economy is perfectly simple. Herersquos how it works. Somebody makes things. Somebody buys things. We all live happily ever after. Irsquom sure you can grasp the gist.However, in order to buy things, one must have coinage. And, even though much of this is now electronic or virtual, clunky coins in the hand or pocket seem fittingly symbolic to celebrate the past that we are now about to enter.Accordingly, a p commemorative Brexit Day coin has been issued. A harmless gesture, you might think, in normal times. But these are not normal times. People have become unhinged. A coin has been issued, and they have gone doolally.Opponents of Brexit ndash people with a passionate interest in trade agreements ndash have reacted with uncharacteristic extremism and irrationality, some even threatening to decorate the coins withswastikas ndash yup ndash this referring to the historical fact that the Nazis once held a democratic referendum to find outGermanyrsquos citizens wanted to invade Europe.Among those exercised disproportionately is fantasy author Sir Philip Pullman, who called for a boycott of the coin on the grounds that the rubric was allegedly ungrammatical. He lamented, in particular, the lack of a so-called Oxford comma after ldquoprosperity in the words ldquoPeace, prosperity and friendship with all nations.What an interesting and surely well-meant phrase. Who coined it, as it were, originally  Was it Hitler  At any rate, the grammar Gestapo goose-stepped all over it though, soon, a Resistance sprang up, arguing that the comma was purely optional and even ndash look away now, Martha ndash an Americanism, presumably being named after the famous university city there.Nothing is simple any more. Although a simple man myself, I was ndash seriously ndash once accused in a bookof knowing what an Oxford comma was, but it turns out that I did not.I thought it separated phrases. Thus,I write, ldquoIt was blue and hellip, without a comma after ldquoblue, the expectation is that more description of ldquoIt will be forthcoming. However,Irsquom intending to say, ldquoIt was blue, and I wanted one, the comma is neededso as not to lead people up a garden path that promises more adjectives but doesnrsquot deliver. Similarly, yoursquoll see that, earlier, I bunged in a comma when saying: ldquoA coin has been issued, and they have gone doolally. Thatrsquos because, without the comma, the expectation is of more verbiage about the coin, whereas the subject has now changed . Drsquoyou see Most people donrsquot do this and, as a bit of a grammar stormtrooper myself, that irritates me, though not intensely. At any rate, thatrsquos what I thought an Oxford comma was, and I donrsquot see anyway why a commq is necessary in lists such as ldquopeace, prosperity and friendship. Using it to separate the last and penultimate items serves no purpose.But, truthfully, I donrsquot have a clue about such stuff. I just sound sentences in my head and shove in punctuation where I detect a hellip pause. At the end of the day, all thatrsquos required is that you make your meaning luculent.One wonders what Sir Philip would have made of the rubric on the old threepenny bit which read: ldquo+Elizabeth.II.Dei.Gratia.Regina.F:D: Latin  Itrsquos all Greek to me.In the meantime, perhaps he could spend his unwanted coinage in the new p lavatories at Drumnadrochit. At least there, he would know that his colon was in the right place.++++IN these dystopian times, I live by the motto: ldquotwo wheels bad, two legs good. I might also make a casefor: ldquotwo wheels bad, four wheels good. At the time of going to press, I cannot find anything particularly meaningful in ldquotwo wheels bad, four feet good.However, perhaps dogs might find it useful. At any rate, yoursquoll notice the common denominator in each motto: ldquotwo wheels bad. Hitherto, this has applied only to cyclists, those narcissistic bullies who cause danger to pedestrians and motorists alike.However, they could soon have an ally in other equally irresponsible road-users: to wit, hooligans gadding about on E-scooters.The British Government will shortly hold a consultation on allowing these satanic conveyances on roads used by normal people, despite warnings from abroad that the result will be ldquoanarchy.In France and Germany, E-scooter users have been accused, as with cyclists here, of ruining green or scenic footpaths. They also share with cyclists a predilection for pavements.George Orwell wrote about ldquoold maids bicycling to Holy Communion through the early morning mist. That was bad enough. Think how much worse it would bethe old louts were on E-scooters.++++AS someone who dislikes controversy, Irsquom not going to comment specically on the Mystery of the Alastair Stewart Tweet. The ITN newsreaderrsquos communication was allegedly racist, evenall indications suggest otherwise.Some perspective: As noted previously, the original equality campaigners were good, enlightened iniduals slowly, they gained the ascendancy and, for a while, all was well then the original ideals were twisted back on themselves and are now misused to damage innocent parties.However, this third stage has gone on a while now. In the s, I wrote in my local paper about a menace who drove about the town in the wee smarsquo hours waking people up with his street-cleaning machine.My description of himincluded, inter-alia, the observation that he was black-haired, which caused his union branch to raise the possibility that this was racist.A few years later, I confronted some clots about their incompetence, saying the job would have been better carried out by chimpanzees at the zoo. Whereupon, they pointed out that one of their number was of mixed-race. Cue jaw hitting floor. Why make such a connection Lesson: many people become so obsessed with racism that they become racist.++++OFFERED a choice of carrot or stick most Earthlings would opt for the former. The stick breeds resentment, the carrot happiness, and the happy learner scores higher than the resentful one.This has been proven in a study of , American children by Brigham Young University. Dr Paul Caldarella found that pupils in classes with the highest praise-to-reprimand ratio paid attention  to  per cent longer than those where scolding was prevalent.That said, my feeling is that humiliation and shame are better weapons in the battle to educate the nationrsquos nippers.True, it would breed resentment in many. However, it worked for me. A shy child, I blushed madly whenever I was the centre of attention, prompting the other inmates to point at me and shout: ldquoBeamer!Accordingly, I figured the way to avoid this persecution was to get things right. I was shamed, effectively, into becoming the knowledgable and wise figure you see before you today.Spare the rod and spoil the child was always poppycock. The correct formula is shame the child and watch it learn.

In each case, however, this is above all a time for pragmatism.The UK may now be set upon a dferent path from the EU, but the degree to which it will erge will not become clear for months, indeed years, to come. It may take decades before it is clear whether we are heading in an entirely new direction or, like other European nations currently outwith the EU, on a parallel, perhaps fairly closely aligned, path.Setting aside previous dferences is essentialthis journey is to proceed as smoothly as possible. It was welcome that the former Brexit minister Steve Baker should say this was no time for ardent Leavers to gloat, and should recognise that many are saddened by the outcome. By the same token, the most fervent Remainers should accept that the new circumstances will not be improved by constant carping and doom-mongering.Scotland, where a sizeable majority voted against Brexit, has dferent needs and concerns from much of the rest of the UK. The priority must now be to focus not on previous preferences, but on protecting those interests.That will entail the government at Holyrood working with Westminster in order to make the new settlement work. Those whose ultimate goal is independence need, for the moment, to focus on the immediate challenges facing Scotland. Ensuring a stable future for agriculture, healthcare, immigration needs, fisheries and a host of other areas will mean making responsible choices, rather than obstruction in order to further ision, or foolish gestural politics about EU flags and the like.Similarly, Westminster must demonstrate genuine respect for the way in which those sectors may require special attention, accommodation and support, rather than attempting to strongarm Holyrood. Boris Johnsonrsquos government must also adjust to the fact that,those who ndash like most Scots ndash voted Remain should accept Brexit and move forward, there can be no justication for stirring up English nativist feeling.The national interest of Scotland, England and the UK as a whole will be served only by a willingness to accept, with equal vigour and honesty, the opportunities and dficulties we all now face, not by amplying or denying them.It may be that those challenges will increase the pressure for independencethe Prime Minister intends to maintain a United Kingdom, let alone forge the new spirit of unity and optimism his rhetoric suggests, he will have to acknowledge them ndash as he has done for those in the north of England.

The day-to-day priorities of voters all across the UK have been obscured by years of wrangling on this issue its resolution, for good or ill, makes it the more urgent that politicians across the boardtheir focus to them. And whether it proves to be for good or ill will depend on a clear-eyed view of the real priorities of most voters.There is no longer any point in painting le outside the EU as a triumph or a disaster: it is where we are.

The whole exercise was to make rail as opposed to car the attractive option, particularly for commuters.It builds upon the expansions since the late s starting with Edinburgh-Bathgate, and the extension to Larkhall, through Stirling-Alloa, Laurencekirk and Conan Bridge stations, the extension to Galashiels and Tweedbank, and most recently Robroyston.But even with the forthcoming promised new stations at East Linton, Reston, Leven and Cameron Bridge, that still leaves much of Scotland marooned from the railway.Suggested extensions, not all on old routes, include: Comrie via Crieff and Forfar to Laurencekirk, Dumfries to Stranraer including branches to Kirkcudbright and Cairnryan, and Aberdeen-Banchory. These could really open up the country, for commuters and tourists alike.But it is not just a matter of new stations or laying new track. Trains have to run frequently enough to attract motorists, so while a headway of  minutes is sufficient for a journey of  miles, a  minute frequency is needed for those less than  miles.Junction improvements such as at Bellgrove and Portobello, plus capacity enhancements and speed improvements, e.g. Perth-Inverness, Kilmarnock-Dumfries and Edinburgh-Tweedbank, are required, and the electrication programme, already well behind and such that the  target looks exceedingly unlikely to be met, needs to be doubled, to include the Fe Circle and the Borders to Tweedbank, rather than just connecting the Seven Cities.It is an ambitious scheme and will clearly take many years to achieve. However it is the only way of achieving a step change of the magnitude required by the looming climate change that will enable people to travel around Scotland without causing excessive damage to the environment.Roderick McDougall and Railfuture Scotland have proposed a bold solution it remains to be seen whether the powers-that-be will rise to the challenge.bull Jane Ann Liston is secretary of Railfuture Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-power-pandemic","story":"THE outbreak of the coronavirus in China poses one huge and terrying question: are we heading for a full-scale pandemic The World Health Organisation has declared the outbreak a global emergency, and the coronavirus has already come to the UK.So far, there have been nearly , cases in China with at least  deaths. The virus has spread across the Far East, and made it to France, America, Canada, India and Finland.Pandemics ndash defined as diseases which spread rapidly over a large area of the planet ndash arenrsquot just killers which claim the lives of millions. The death toll, the panic, and the grief unleashed by pandemics fundamentally reshape the societies they ravage.Our best modern example is HIV Aids which has killed around  million people worldwide. The disease reshaped how the world talked about sex, and caused a revolution in medicine. Cholera brought about advancements in public sanitation.Here we look at some of the most virulent outbreaks in human history, and unravel why they happened, and how they changed the face of history, society and culture.The plague of AthensThe history of the Western world would have been very dferentit werenrsquot for an outbreak that turned the city of ancient Athens into the set of an apocalyptic horror movie.To the ancient Greeks, the Peloponnesian War between Athens, the seat of democracy, and the militaristic state of Sparta, was the equivalent of the First World War. It was a titanic struggle between two superpowers and it engulfed the entire Greek world.When the war began in BC, the Athenians, a naval power, knew they would be outmatched on land against the fabled Spartan army. So under the command of their famed leader Pericles, the people retreated within the walls of the city. The plan was to allow the Athenian fleet to grind down the Spartans.The city was overcrowded with refugees from the countryside, and supplies were flooding in from across the Mediterranean to the Athenian port of Piraeus to keep the people fed.In BC, a ldquoplague ship ndash carrying probably either typhoid or typhus ndash entered Piraeus unbeknown to the port authorities. Soon , people would be dead ndash at least one-quarter of the cityrsquos population.Chaos broke out in the city. The ancient historian Thucydides wrote in his History of the Peloponnesian War: ldquoThe catastrophe was so overwhelming that men, not knowing what would happen next to them, became indferent to every rule of religion and law.The rich blew their money before they died. The sick were left unattended for fear of contagion. The bodies piled up. The people believed the Gods had abandoned them. Nobody was safe. Pericles himself died, leaving the Athenians rudderless. The plague ed twice more. Spartans watched while disease destroyed their enemies.Sparta was eventually victorious, and the Athenian empire entered terminal decline ndash with it, democracy would soon be stled. Who knows how the future of Europe might have been shapedplague had not come to Athens, and it was democracy which triumphed over Sparta.The Antonine plagueIt was early globalisation which turned the Roman Empire of the second century into a mass graveyard. Romersquos troops were besieging the Mesopotamian city of Seleucia, now found in modern Iraq, in AD when illness began to sweep through the ranks. Roman legions were made up of soldiers recruited from across an empire which spread from Hadrianrsquos Wall to Syria.Troops ing from Seleucia to their homelands brought the illness with them. Itrsquos thought the plague was smallpox. In Rome, the plague was killing , people a day. One in four people died in the city, and across other areas the mortality rate was one in three.The entire world had a population of around  million at this point. Itrsquos thought that the plague claimed five million lives in Europe and the near east. The plague may even have spread to China.The outbreak claimed the le of Emperor Lucius Verus. He had co-ruled with Marcus Aurelius Antoninus ndash who had the misfortune to find the plague named after him. The plague fatally weakened the Roman Empire, crippling the army, and disrupting trade and commerce.When the illness hit what is now Germany, it brought refugees fleeing the plague south, piling pressure on the borders of the empire. It would be ldquobarbarian tribes which eventually brought Rome to her knees.The virulence of the plague is thought to be down to the fact that this was the first major incursion of smallpox into Europe and inhabitants had zero resistance to the illness.A century later, from around AD, the Plague of Cyprian further exhausted the Roman Empire, also hastening its collapse. Named after St Cyprian, who witnessed the suffering, the outbreak seems to have begun in Carthage, in what is now modern Tunisia. Identication of that plague ranges from measles to ebola.At the time, early Christians were made scapegoats for the disease, and persecuted and murdered. At its height, the plague killed ,a day.The plague of JustinianBy the reign of Emperor Justinian, the western half of the Roman Empire had collapsed. Justinian ruled in the east from the Byzantine city of Constantinople. But Justinian was ambitious, and planned to reunite and rebuild the shattered superpower.However, in AD, the first recorded outbreak of bubonic plague ndash Yersinia pestis ndash threw the emperorrsquos plans into disarray. Constantinople became the epicentre of the outbreak.At its height, the plague was said to have killed , a day in Constantinople alone, and claimed up to % of the cityrsquos population. The plague could have killed up to  million people in total, during multiple bouts of recurrence. It is thought the disease came on grain ships, bearing rats that carried infected fleas, from Egypt.Agriculture broke down as farmers died and there was no-one to till fields and raise animals. The tax base collapsed as there werenrsquot enough people alive to fill treasury coffers. Expansionist tribes like the Goths and Lombards began claiming chunks of the old western empire as their own. Some believe that the plague hit Britain particularly hard and allowed for the success of the Anglo-Saxon settlement of England.The strain of bubonic plague which would devastate Europe in the s was a distant cousin, it is believed, of the plague which ravaged the reign of Justinian.The Black DeathBubonic plague has long been with us. Evidence of Yersinia pestis has been found in skeletons up to , years old. But never has the plague had such a profound effect on history as the toll wrought by the Black Death between  and .The plague swept from the Russian steppe and Persian gulf to the highlands of Scotland and north Africa. At the upper end of estimates, around  million people died. Europersquos population was cut by up to %, and about one-fth of the entire worldrsquos population was lost.The Black Death came down the trade route known as the Silk Road from China and then hopped on ships travelling the Mediterranean and throughout Europe. No other illness has so radically altered the course of humanity. It changed everything from culture to commerce, from economics to politics.In most major European cities about half the population died. Archaeologists are still discovering plague pits used for mass burials today.European culture was highly developed in the s, and writers and artists responded to the plague with works like The Decameron by the Italian writer Giovanni Boccaccio, which tells of a group of aristocrats who lock themselves up in a country villa to weather the duration of the plague. Works of art began to feature skulls and skeletons. Ordinary people joined the ranks of the Flagellants, who would beat themselves with ropes and chains in order to purge the sins which they believed had brought the plague down on them. In essence, society went mad.When the plague finally burned itself out on the land, Europe had been changed forever. With so many workers and peasants dead, survivors were able to demand much higher wages than before, severely weakening the feudal system, creating more social mobility and an emerging middle class. In England, such changes almost led to civil war in the clash known as the Peasantsrsquo Revolt.There have even been claims by academics that the sheer number of dead brought about a cooling of the climate. Less human activity and more free land led to reforestation, which some believe contributed to the Little Ice Age.Inevitably, in an age with little science, scapegoats were sought during the Black Death, and in Europe those blamed were the Jews. In Strasbourg in , , Jews were murdered. The same year the Jewish populations of Mainz and Cologne were exterminated. As a result, many Jews moved to Poland, where a large population built up, until the Second World War and the Nazi Holocaust.The Great Plague of London was the last major outbreak of bubonic plague to occur on the British Isles. It claimed , people, which was about one-quarter of the cityrsquos population, between  and .In September , the Great Fire of London devastated the city. Many still think that the inferno brought an end to the plague. However, most scientists believe the plague had all but run its course by the time fire struck.In the wake of the plague and the fire, London became the epicentre of a semi-Golden Age, with a flourishing of the arts and science as the city was rebuilt as a modern European capital.The third pandemicScience now refers to the events of  which began in China as The Third Pandemic. If the first pandemic was the Plague of Justinian, and the second was the Black Death, then the outbreak of plague centred on Asia and the Far East in the mid-th century is the third plague pandemic.At least  million people died in China and India alone, but nearly all parts of the world were affected. The plague spread to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, San Francisco, Australia, Russia, the Caribbean, and South America. Officially, the outbreak lasted until .There was even an outbreak in Glasgow in . It arrived in the Gorbals in August that year. Soon  were infected. Sixteen died. Rats were killed en masse in the city, even though it seems the infection in Glasgow was spread by human contact. Coins, trams and ferries were disinfected.Rapid industrialisation in China helped spread the virulent disease at its outbreak, as workers began moving across the country. This coincided with a period of social unrest which saw more movement of people ndash both troops and refugees ndash on a greater scale than before. In March , the plague killed , in Canton in just a few weeks.The plague soon spread to India where special measures were put in place to contain the outbreak by the British. Quarantine, isolation camps and travel restrictions were enforced by colonial soldiers. Indians found the conduct of Britain highly repressive and it helped fuel the desire for independence.Spanish fluThe th century took all the contributory factors to the worldrsquos previous pandemics and brought them together in one great confluence of bad luck and biology that became the Spanish flu pandemic of .War, globalisation, trade, transport ndash they all contributed to making Spanish flu, or the HN virus, the most deadly outbreak of the th century.The flu pandemic, which lasted until , killed up to  million people ndash around % of the worldrsquos population. Spanish flu claimed the lives of more people in  weeks than Aids killed in  years.More people died from Spanish flu than in the First World War, which had an estimated death toll of around  million.Science suggests that the possible epicentre of the outbreak was the Etaples military camp in France in . Up to , soldiers passed through the camp each day. There was a hospital there, as well as a farm with pigs and poultry. Both animals harbour flu viruses which can mutate and jump to humans.In the overcrowded conditions of the First World War, the contagion spread, moving among soldiers from dozens of countries. Thatrsquos when it went global, reaching even into the Arctic.During wartime, newspapers in Germany, America, France and Britain censored material on the outbreak to keep panic low and morale high. The neutral nation of Spain was free to report as it pleased, and so many thought the outbreak had hit the Spanish hardest ndash thus the flu pandemic acquired its name.With many soldiers badly debilitated by le in the trenches, the flu was able to claim many more victims than a ldquonormal flu. Spanish flu was made especially deadly as it hit out of winter season, was highly infectious and played havoc with the bodyrsquos immune system.Although most flus kill the very young, very old and very sick, the elderly were partially protected from Spanish flu. A previous influenza pandemic ndash known as Russian flu ndash which hit in  , gave older adults partial immunity to the  outbreak. So, in America, the vast majority of deaths were in the under- age range.Victims had a bad death. There were cases of bleeding from the ears, and most deaths were down to pneumonia. At least % of those infected died, whereas ldquonormal flu kills about .%.There have been theories that Spanish flu aided the victory of the allies, and even helped speed up womenrsquos rights, as so many victims were men. However, what it certainly did was set a template for what a modern pandemic looks like. It taught us that the one thing which imperils humanity is human activity. Transport, war, trade, travel ndash these are the things which the next great pandemic will exploit in order to spread and kill when it finally comes."},{"url":null,"title":"rab-mcneil-neds-er-trousers-talking-politics-secret-passwords-ban-say","story":"I apologise for introducing a pooperous note to this lecture or article so early in proceedings.

We have been helpless passengers in a reckless drive towards the Brexit clf-edge.:Town in Netherlands replaces Union Jack with Saltire in EU flag line-upScotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU, voted overwhelmingly to be an open and welcoming nation, and voted to protect the countless rights we have enjoyed and benefited from along with our EU partners.The grim reality of Brexit is that it is far from being done. In fact, today marks the beginning of a complex and y process which will see the UK government roll back on rights we have benefited from, it will continue to undermine and threaten the devolved governments, it will harm our economy and society with regressive immigration plans, and it will jeopardise the livelihoods of EU nationals who have made Scotland and the UK their home.And with the UK government refusing outright to extend the transition period beyond the end of the year the threat of a No-Deal Brexit is still firmly on the horizon ndash putting thousands of jobs on the line.In all its forms Brexit will be deeply damaging, leaving us poorer and worse off, and signalling a decline in the UKrsquos standing on the international stage.That is why as the UK steps down, Scotland must have the choice to step up and play its part as a progressive and independent European nation.Time and time again we have been told Scotland is part of a union of equals ndash yet instead of respecting Scotlandrsquos democratic decision to stay in the EU, the Tories have chosen to ignore the people of Scotland and ride roughshod over the devolution settlement.For as long as Scotland remains in the UK we will never be treated as an equal partner.People in Scotland have consistently rejected Brexit at the ballot box, and after winning % of Scotlandrsquos seats in  General Election, the SNP has a cast-iron democratic mandate to give Scotland a choice.:Brexit Day: The state of the parties as Britain enters final hours of EU membershipYet, Boris Johnson has chosen to deny democracy and ignore the people of Scotland. His position is not only undemocratic, it is utterly unsustainable.It is crystal clear that Scotland must have the choice over its future on being an independent country so that we can take our place alongside other independent European nations, rather than being dictated to by a detached and broken Tory government with no mandate to govern in Scotland.Until that day comes, we ask that Europe leave a light on for Scotland.\"It has been said many times before, but there are huge opportunities from leaving the EU. That gets lost too often in the endless negativity from SNP politicians\"David Duguid, Scottish Conservative MP for Banff and Buchan:The  referendum campaign was dferent in Banff and Buchan than in most other parts of Scotland. Up here, there was ndash and still is ndash strong support for coming out of the EU. In fact, a study carried out by the University of East Anglia into the result found that % voted Leave.Brexit appeals to voters in this area for several reasons.For some farmers, itrsquos a chance to improve upon the constraints of a \"one-size-fits-none\" Common Agricultural Policy.Some long-time independence supporters voted Leave because they saw little point in casting adrt from London only to remain anchored to Brussels.And, of course, there are those in our fishing communities who are desperate to escape the shackles of the Common Fisheries Policy, which has been disastrous for Scottish fleets.Many of those people voted Conservative in  and a greater number did so last December. I campaigned very strongly in the general election on \"getting Brexit sorted\" and moving forward as a country.In Scotland, the SNP took home another country-wide victory, claiming  seats out of its  on offer.It has been said many times before, but there are huge opportunities from leaving the EU. That gets lost too often in the endless negativity from SNP politicians.Last week was a case in point. The UK Fisheries Bill was presented to Parliament, detailing new powers on fisheries management for Scottish Ministers ndash powers which were specically asked for by the Scottish Government.However, the reaction from the SNP Fisheries Minister was to complain that Scotland would not be leading the UK-wide negotiations.There seems nothing that can happen at Westminster that cannot be turned into a point of grievance by the SNP. And of course, the Nationalists endlessly predict that there will be a \"sell-out\" of fisheries.The SNP would like nothing more than a UK \"betrayal\" of our fishermen just to score political points. They are only too happy to parrot the EU spin that fishing rights will be linked to financial services and bartered away.Unfortunately for the Nationalists, our Prime Minister and senior Ministers in the Cabinet like Aberdeen-born Michael Gove, are resolute that full UK control over access to our waters is a red line issue. And as of pm on Friday, under international law, the UK reclaimed its status as an independent coastal state.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"The EU flag replaces the Union flag in Brussels after Brexit\",\"description\": \"The EU flag replaces the Union flag in Brussels after Brexit\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media CdyttI poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests CdyttI.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Just like Norway, Iceland, The Faroe Islands, and indeed the EU itself, we will negotiate annually on reciprocal access and quota share.

Striking a good trade agreement with the EU and deals with other countries around the world will provide opportunities for other sectors of Scottish business ndash including our whisky industry.I understand that many who voted Remain are unhappy about leaving the EU, and that the SNP are using the  result to bolster the case for separation.But the last thing Scotland needs is more constitutional ision. There is no appetite among the Scottish public for \"indyref\" any time soon.Instead, it is time for us all to move on.:Iain Macwhirter: There wonrsquot be a legal and legitimate referendum next year or for many years after that. Get used to it\"Slowly but surely people will see they have been sold a pup. Prepare for buyerrsquos remorse\"Lord Foulkes, Labour peer, and former MP and government minister:I well recall the sense of euphoria in  when the British people confirmed our membership of what we then called the Common Market by a two-thirds majority. It was then mostly Tory governments that deepened our involvement with the Maastricht Treaty and the Single European Act.It seemed at times that only Bill Cash and thewanted us to leave as we prospered and developed as a leading member of one of the most successful economic unions ever.But resentment was growing within the Tory party, fuelled by myths of straight bananas and Brussels bureaucracy touted by journalists, including Boris Johnson.David Cameron, now seen as one of the most inept PMs ever, thought he could silence the critics within his party and motormouth Farage by holding a referendum. It was a monumental mistake.A lacklustre campaign by both the Government and the official Opposition gave the Brexiteers a victory of which they were as surprised as anyone. Corbyn must share the blame with Cameron.As a result there followed three years of confusion and disarray. Prime Ministers came and went, parties disintegrated and a damaging ision between Parliament and Government has soured our politics for years to come.The Tories were then gted a big majority by the foolish decision of Corbyn and Swinson to agree to an early election and a brilliant Tory campaign with the one simple message ndash ldquoGet Brexit Done ndash repeated incessantly.Opposition leaders failed to point out that the Tories had not managed to do this for three years and failed also to have a simple alternative message.We are now on a journey where no one knows the destination, least of all the Government.Already there is a growing awareness of the dangers ahead. The Archbishop of Canterbury prays and pleads for unity. Tory MPs see the looming dangers and are trying to share responsibility for any disasters caused.The ldquocelebrations in Parliament Square have been boycotted by all but the fanatics and, not just because of the lack of fireworks, are a damp squib.Slowly but surely people will see they have been sold a pup and ldquobuyerrsquos remorse will grow.Fisherman will realise they are not protected, tarfs and form-filling will bedevil trade, travel in Europe will get more dficult as guaranteed free health care is replaced by expensive insurance, British expats and EU immigrants in the UK will suffer continued uncertainty, and our economy will fall behind the rest of Europe.Already those of us who believe that withdrawal was a mistake are regrouping and preparing to campaign to re-join. The European Movement is mobilising. Young people in particular are eager to restore the opportunities they believe they have lost by our departure.When the reality of Brexit dawns, as the EU prospers and the UK declines, I believe the momentum for ourwill be unstoppable. I only hope I live to see the day.Far from being done, the dficult politics of Brexit may be just about to start.Alistair Carmichael, Liberal Democrat MP for Orkney and Shetland:Our departure from the European Union on Friday night is not the end of the story but it is the start of a new and even more challenging chapter in the Brexit saga. The war may be over, but for those of us who still believe in a United Kingdom that is an easy trading partner with its European neighbours, there is still a peace to be won.It is dficult to see how, in the time available, any ldquodeal with the remaining EU members can be anything more than a mechanism for keeping us aligned with the rules and decisions of the Union we have just left.Last week in Brussels, the talk from civil servants in the UK Permanent Representativersquos office was all about ldquoDynamic Alignment. Their definition of this was less than clear, but it appeared to allow us to move in the future when the remaining  member states decided to move.In fact, alignment is about far more than trade rules and regulations. Staying close to our European neighbours in cultural and scientic projects is in all our interests. It is not something that can be limited to figures on a spreadsheet.Data protection is one small illustration of the challenges we face in negotiating a final deal with the EU. It underpins how we move information around the world ndash crucial for our increasingly digital economy. Securing a continuity deal on data with ongoing alignment is the right course to ensure continued growth. Even here, there are signs of frustration in Brussels as basic questions remain unanswered.If answers about something as technocratic as data protection are dficult, what hope is there when it comes to the really contentious subjects like fishing  Many in our fishing communities were persuaded to support Brexit as it would bring back control of our own waters. After decades of mismanagement under the Common Fisheries Policy you can see the attraction. Whether or not these promises are delivered is now down to sheer political will.We know that our former partners are not just going to walk away from fishing in UK waters and will want to exact a pricethey are to do so. Will Boris Johnson and his ministers be prepared to pay the price necessary to honour their own promises, or will they reach the same conclusion as their predecessors in the s, that fishing is ldquoexpendable Time will tell. The problem for the Prime Minister is that time is not on his side. The decision to insist on doing a deal or leaving without one by the end of this year looks like another example of the old Etonian self-belief that led David Cameron to land us in this mess in the first place.Commission officials will again enter the negotiations knowing that the UK team across the table have already handed them a major advantage. By the time Hogmanay comes around again, the choice is likely to be a deal that effectively keeps us aligned with the EU, or  to crash out without a deal at all.Far from being ldquodone, the dficult politics of Brexit may be just about to start."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-historic-windows-lost-pvc-replacements","story":"THEY are the work of master craftsmen who toiled long before the days when industrial production and lightweight synthetic materials became commonplace.But now it has been warned that the often unique windows of Scotlandrsquos listed buildings are disappearing fast, as councils nod through upgrades which see them ripped out and cast on the scrap heap.A study by heritage experts at Heriot-Watt University has claimed that local authorities across Scotland have a ldquoculture of consent when it comes to the most vulnerable features of the countryrsquos listed buildings.There are around , listed buildings in Scotland, and their status means certain features should be retained and not replaced, such as original fireplaces, slate roofs and even windows.But planning permission to remove and replace historic windows from listed buildings is being given at the same rate as for non-listed homes, with little regard for their protected status.While international and national heritage organisations have been working to promote the repairing and upgrading existing windows, in Scotland the decision takes place at a local level. Owners of listed buildings apply to their local authorityrsquos planning department for permission to remove windows, or other historic features of the building.The study looked at Glasgow and Edinburgh, and found that from  to , the number of listed building applications relating to windows in the capital increased steadily from  to , with an approval rate of almost %. In Scotlandrsquos largest city, which has the third-highest number of listed buildings of any council area, approvals rose by %.Dr Craig Kennedy, of Heriot-Wattrsquos Institute for Sustainable Building Design, said: ldquoWindow glass is often overlooked compared to other historically important building materials like stone, metal and timber.ldquoAs such it is most vulnerable to being replaced, and with that a listed building begins to lose its character and aesthetic.Kennedy added: ldquoThere is no dference in approval rates between listed and non-listed buildings ndash itrsquos around % across the board at the three councils. What struck us was the increase in approvals from  to . The number of applications related to windows in listed buildings almost doubled, as did the number of approvals. The approval rate rose to almost %.ldquoWe interviewed officers in planning departments across Scotland, and some in England. The story was the same everywhere ndash since , conservation officers have left the organisation and havenrsquot been replaced, planning departments are under-resourced and under pressure. The result is a culture of consent.Many of the windows in listed buildings pre-date the industrial manufacture of glass on a wide scale, meaning each pane is unique and carries imperfections which often enhances their appeal.They will often be sash or casement windows, wood-framed and moved through complicated weighted pulleys hidden in the walls which can be dficult to replace.These windows are usually replaced by PVC frames with modern glass, for a iety of reasons. Householders may believe they are more energy-efficient or cheaper than restoring older windows. However, timber windows are often a cheaper and more environmentally-friendly option.But Kennedy believes that a decision to allow the replacement of historic windows should only ever be taken as a last resort. He said: ldquoThe importance of retaining original windows cannot be overstated. They contain a wealth of information on historic practices and manufacturing techniques.ldquoNowadays we are used to the glass in windows being perfectly clear. Older windows often contain tiny bubbles, known as seeds, or curved striations that came from the crown glass method of glass-making.He added: ldquoThe replacement of historic windows must be seen as a last resort instead of a first choice. Our research shows that the efforts of heritage agencies to promote repair and upgrading of historic windows may have been ineffective. They should refocus efforts to ensure that this message reaches the local planners who are in charge of our architectural heritage. Wersquore concerned that, at the local level, nobody is advocating for historic buildings.The Heriot-Watt team developed its own software to conduct the survey, as each of the local authorities recorded window-related applications dferently, even within their own organisation.The team hopes heritage professionals across the UK will use its software to examine decisions affecting listed buildings in their own local authority, and determine the scale of historic feature loss on a national scale.Both Edinburgh and Glasgow city councils defended their record on protecting listed buildings, with Edinburgh planning convener Councillor Neil Gardiner saying: ldquoWersquore very lucky to be home to not one but two World Heritage Sites in the capital. As a planning authority, wersquore ultimately s of our historic built heritage, and our listed buildings guidance seeks to protect the character and aesthetic appeal of period properties in the city.ldquoWe recognise that windows are an important feature in the elevation of any building and are vital to the history and architectural integrity of all historic buildings. Not only that, but their replacement with dferent designs can seriously affect the historic and architectural character of a building. Thatrsquos why our guidance on window replacement in listed buildings in Edinburgh emphasises a general presumption against the removal of original timber windows. The repair and rehabilitation of original windows is preferred in terms of sustainability, as well as protecting historical character.A Glasgow City Council spokesman said that it was important to note replacing windows in unlisted buildings does not need planning permission outwith conservation areas, meaning that a direct comparison is impossible as this type of work is not recorded.He added: ldquoOur guidance requires that proposals for the replacement of an original window to listed buildings and properties in a conservation area should be accompanied by a statement to demonstrate that the original window is beyond repair to justy its replacement.A spokesperson for Historic Environment Scotlandsaid: ldquoOur Managing Change guidance, which was created for planning authorities when making decisions, states that original or historic windows should be retained wherever possible. In the guidance, we highlight several ways to upgrade energy efficiency, including draught-proofing and secondary glazing. Our guidance states that original or historic sash windows should only be replaced when they are beyond reasonable repair. If replacement is required, the new windows should be as close a match to the original designs as possible."},{"url":null,"title":"many-hickory-memories-golfing-great-james-braid-remembered-special-tribute-tournament","story":"James Braid was a five-times Open Championship winner in the early years of the th century, who went on to design courses theof the UK, counting some of the most fabled fairways and greens among his creations.The man was behind the toughest holes at world-renowned courses such as the Kingrsquos and Queenrsquos at Gleneagles, Carnoustie in Angus, East Lothianrsquos Royal Musselburgh, the Highland links at Brora, Bruntsfield in Edinburgh, founded in , and the Championship course at Dalmahoy.And now the th anniversary of his birth is to be honoured with its very own open championship, played just as the great golfer would have known ndash with traditional hickory wood clubs, plus fours and bunnets.The James Braid th Anniversary Hickory Open will tee off on February , Braidrsquos birthday, and see players tackle the course using equipment from a bygone era which would seem archaic today but would have been the stock in trade of players in Braidrsquos time.Born in Earlsferry in Fe in , James Braid was a founder of the worldrsquos first Professional Golf Association and a member of the ldquoGreat Triumvirate of British golf, who along with Harry Vardon and JH Taylor dominated the Open Championship from  to .Said to be ldquothe shining example of the dference between the golfer and the hitter of golf balls, Braid was the first person to score under  at the tournament and was famed for his quiet courtesy on the course and sense of fair play.His  victory in the Open Championship was the last successful defence of the title by a European until Paacutedraig Harrington replicated the feat in . Dressed in a Tweed cap and Norfolk coat, always accompanied by a collar and tie, he cut a dignied figure, and his game was said to have only suffered from a relatively poor skill at putting. But when he switched to innovative aluminium-headed putters on hickory shafts, he is said to have become lethal on the greens, banishing his early problems completely.Yet while his golfing ability was said to be remarkable, it is his for eye for the architecture of golf for which many hold him in high esteem today.With his vast experience of tournament play and his understanding of design and construction, Braid set the standard in golf course design which the rest of the world would follow, inventing such features as the dog-leg hole and the pot bunker.During a career which stretched more than  years, he had a hand in designing around  courses, and helped revitalise many more. The total number is vague, but it is reckoned his influence can be found on  dferent courses in the UK, though a lelong dislike of travelling meant he never visited the US, and only one course in America was made to his specications, though he never visited it. As well as being one of the top tournament players of his day, Braid was a club professional at Walton Heath in Surrey, where he lived from  until his death in . The last course he designed was Creachmore in Stranraer, which opened shortly after his death.The James Braid Anniversary Open is the first match in a Scottish ldquohickory tour taking place throughout the year. The tour is the first time since the s a group of golfers have staged a multi-course competition using the sort of clubs and equipment professionals would take to the greens with before technology took a hold of the game from the s on.The tour will see the worldrsquos top  professionals and best  amateurs compete to qualy to participate in a final in October. Players will tee off at the Anniversary Open at Braid Hill in Edinburgh, and will also gather at the nearby Thistle Club, where Braid was a member in , at noon for a toast. Hickory golf has become increasingly popular in recent years, and the World Hickory Open Championship is staged in Scotland each year. Sandy Lyle, winner of the Open in  and US Masters Champion in , has won the event twice. The current champion is Swedish professional Johan Moberg.Playing a round using traditional equipment is said to require a greater degree of skill than modern clubs, as the ball cannot be hit as far or with the same accuracy.Boris Lietzow, organiser of the James Braid Open, runs Scotlandrsquos only specialist hickory golf shop, Jack White in Gullane, East Lothian. He said the tournament would be played in the same spirit as the game was in Braidrsquos day.Leitzow said: ldquoThe Scottish Hickory Tour has been created after a tournament culture in hickory golf has been established over the past  years by bodies such as the British Golf Collectorsrsquo Society, the Society of Hickory Golfers of America or the World Hickory Open Championship.ldquoThe vision is to create a circuit on which hickory golf is played to a high level by professionals and amateurs, and to play golf with wooden shafts brings the etiquette and style of the game in the s into the foreground. If hickory is played with vintage clubs, the carbon footprint of the equipment is zero, since it is based on % recycled material.He added: ldquoThe inaugural match of the Scottish Hickory Tour will not count into the tourrsquos points system, but is an anniversary celebration.ldquoIt is a social event in which about  players will participate, among them players from Switzerland and the United States, along with several professionals.Peter Stanbrook, captain of the James Braid Golfing Society, said: ldquoEven while he was winning tournaments, Braid turned his talents to golf course design. He originated classic courses and a number of lsquovillage gemsrsquo ndash smaller courses up and down the land which are known for being lsquothinking menrsquos golf coursesrsquo.ldquoHe developed this into a y and outstanding career, both originating courses and revising existing layouts. In all, nearly  courses have felt the benefit of his design expertise in some way. His legacy remains and he is up there with the very best of golf architects through the ages. To all of these achievements he added personal characteristics of charm, common sense and integrity. He was an enormously well-respected figure in th century British golf.Stanbrook added: ldquoSo, it is quite fitting to be remembering him and celebrating his legacy in , the th anniversary of his birth.ldquoI am delighted to see that the hickory golfers are undertaking this extended tour of golf courses with Braid connections.

It requires a coordinated approach, led by Government throughout the UK. Those changes must start now.pic eUJYFjYDpEmdash CCCJanuary , The run-up to the talks will require a major diplomatic effort from the UK to secure ambitious climate action from countries ndash at a time when Britain is also negotiating trade agreements with the EU and other nations.The UK Governmentrsquos first move as the year gears up saw the removal of former clean growth minister Claire OrsquoNeill as president of the talks ndash saying it will be a ministerial role going forward.:COP: Cost of policing climate summit in Glasgow could exceed poundmExperts have warned that the new holder of the job will need to be skilled in diplomacy.Very sad that that the role I was offered by @BorisJohnson last year has now been rescinded as Whitehall ldquocanrsquot cope with an Indy cop unit. A shame we havenrsquot had one Climate cabinet meeting since we formed. Wishing the cop team every blessing in the climate recovery emergency.mdash COPPresidentJanuary , Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said with leaders such as Donald Trump and Australiarsquos Scott Morrison in power, it was clear the summit would not deliver emissions cuts of the scale the science demands.ldquoBut itrsquos not all bleak: -odd governments have already indicated their desire to hit net-zero emissions by , and the UKrsquos central diplomatic job is to cement that ambition into a process that ensures those nations deliver on their net-zero pledges, he said.As hosts and the first major economy to set a target to cut emissions to net-zero by  ndash so that any remaining pollution by then is offset by measures such as planting trees ndash the UKrsquos own domestic agenda will be under scrutiny.Mr Black said: ldquoThe other big thing the Johnson government can do to help deliver an ambitious global agreement is to get the UK on the path to its own legally-binding net-zero target well before the summit opens.ldquoThen he will legitimately be able to tout Britain as an example of a healthy major economy that is on track to eliminate its carbon footprint, and ask others: lsquowhy donrsquot you join us rsquoIn late June, the Committee on Climate Changewill give its annual progress report to Parliament on how the UK is doing on tackling climate change.Last year they accused the Government of a ldquoramshackle, Dadrsquos Army approach to preparing the country for climate change and warned action to slash emissions is lagging far behind what is needed ndash even before the net-zero target was set.With the political focus on the general election and Brexit, there has been little in the way of major new climate policies since then.So, unless there is signicant action before June, the report could damage Government claims over its leadership on climate.The CCC will be following the progress report with its advice on the ldquosixth carbon budget for the needed emissions curbs between -.It has moved forward the delivery of the advice ndash which will put the UK on a path to net-zero by  ndash to September so it comes ahead of the climate talks.Greenpeace chief scientist Dr Dough Parr said: ldquoAs the host of the next UN climate summit, the UK Government has a tremendous responsibility to make sure progress will be made.ldquoFor this summit to be a success, itrsquos crucial that the UK Government leads by example. And that means first and foremost that ministers need to get their own house in order.Britain will also need to work with the EU ahead of the blocrsquos summit with China in September, with serious European moves to cut emissions required to encourage the worldrsquos biggest polluter to take more action.But one thing likely to set the tone of the talks will be out of the UK Governmentrsquos hands: the US presidential election.President Trump has initiated proceedings to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement, with the withdrawal coming into final effect the day after the election on November  ndash less than a week before the talks begin.His re-election could strengthen the hand of other countries that have argued against strong climate action, but a newly elected Democrat president would likely want to send a clear message that the US is back in the climate-fighting game."},{"url":null,"title":"john-mcdonnell-brands-scottish-independence-completely-counterproductive","story":"Askedhe accepted Brexit was not going to be reversed, he told BBC Onersquos The Andrew Marr Show: ldquoYes, we have to accept not just the referendum result, but the general election result.ldquoNow itrsquos a matter of making sure that we get the best deal we possibly can to protect jobs and the economy.On the prospect of Scottish independence, Mr McDonnell told BBC Onersquos The Andrew Marr Show said: ldquoI desperately donrsquot want them to, I want a United Kingdom.

The species were chosen for their conservation or cultural value, importance for food and medicines or because they provide crucial ecosystem services such as carbon storage.The research found that four of the assessed species – wildcat, ash, great yellow bumblebee and freshwater pearl mussel – were classed as being at risk of severe genetic problems as a result of factors including non-native species, disease, habitat loss and pollution.David O’Brien, SNH bioersity evidence and reporting manager, said the method can be expanded to more species and in other countries. He said: “Often when we talk about bioersity the focus is on species and ecosystems, but genetic ersity is also essential for nature to be resilient in the face of pressures such as climate change, and it’s great that Scotland is leading the way in this field. For the first time, this report sets out a clear ‘scorecard’ method for assessing our most important plants, animals and birds.”Dr Rob Ogden, head of conservation genetics at the University of Edinburgh and co-author of the scorecard report, said: “It allows every country to assess its wildle genetic ersity what we measure in Scotland can now be compared around the world.”The report has been endorsed by the International Union for Conservation of Natureand submitted to the Convention on Biological Diversity ahead of the Kunming summit, which will see  countries meet in China to adopt a new global framework.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"insight eu expats sense of betrayal","story":"As Britain prepared for its raucous Brexit party Scotland#s European expats shared their feelings of loss, abandonment and anger with Dani Garavelli.Andrea Wieler Goodbrand remembers the first time she became aware of hostility towards her as a European living in the UK.“It was a few weeks before the EU referendum,” she says. “The campaign had passed me by because everyone I knew was going to vote Remain. But then I was out walking and I saw a Brexit stall and it really offended me. I said to my husband, Paul: ‘I am really upset now,’ and he said: ‘Why ’ and I answered, ‘Because this is about me.’“It was a big realisation for a white European. In the past people had always been benevolent to me. I was the quirky Swiss girl. And that’s completely unjustied. It’s disgraceful that my nationality meant I was treated more favourably. But that is the way it was.”Wieler Goodbrand is talking to me in the kitchen of her home in the south side of Glasgow where she lives with Paul – a Scot – and their two-year-old son. The UK is poised to leave the European Union after  years. The following day will be a festival of triumphalism: government buildings will be lit up in red, white and blue, Michael Gove will talk of his “relief and his delight”, and a digital clock will count down the minutes until the country “takes back control.”Some of this triumphalism will push its way north. A few dozen Leave voters will gather in Glasgow’s George Square to wave their Union Jacks and toast their new-found “freedom”.In Wieler Goodbrand’s flat, however – and where in Scotland, which voted  per cent to Remain – there is a visceral grief, not only for the EU as a political entity, but as a symbol of peace, tolerance and collaboration. Those who feel European to their core – those who come from immigrant stock and prefer their passports maroon and their borders open – are seeking catharsis.As the appointed hour draws near, some wag will co-opt the Duke of Wellington – Tory stalwart that he was – to the Remain cause by placing a pro-European cone on his head. The hashtag #LeaveALightOnForScotland will trend all day. Outside Holyrood, pipes will be played and candles lit.No-one, however, will be in greater need of solace than the new Scots: those Europeans who – like Wieler Goodbrand – have built their homes here and have spent almost three years in a state of uncertainty.These immigrants staked their futures on the UK, and yet their loyalty and investment is being disputed, not by the Scottish Government, which has consistently expressed its gratitude, but by Westminster, which controls their fate.Having to apply for “settled status” has been a source of humiliation. So too has seeing themselves portrayed as freeloaders when they have worked so hard to make a contribution.Few have worked harder to make a contribution than Wieler Goodbrand. Her homeland is not a member of the EU, but has a bilateral agreement granting freedom of movement. She moved to Scotland in , after five years in Italy, to do a master’s degree at Heriot-Watt University. Very quickly, she fell in love with Paul and – after finishing her studies – she started freelancing as a translator and interpreter.Post-Brexit, this route will be closed to EU citizens, who will have to be able to prove they earn £, to be eligible for a work visa. Wieler Goodbrand didn’t come close to earning this sum when she started out. And yet today, she runs the Language Hub – a social enterprise offering affordable language classes and promoting bilingualism in Glasgow’s West End.“It’s brutal what you see online and in the newspapers,” she says. “We are told we have treated this country too much like our home. Well, it is our home and this is a good thing. When people treat the country like their home, they treat it well.“If I don’t care about my community, then nothing good comes from it. But I do care about it. I run a social enterprise because I think this community is lovely and deserves care.”The way the UK government talks about immigrants has made her question her decision to settle here.“I have lived in Scotland from the age of  to . I have had my career here,” she says. “But now I wonderI made a mistake because,I am being told I should not be here, then why did I give you my time and the best years of my professional le ”Wieler Goodbrand has not experienced much personal abuse – like the other EU citizens I speak to she believes living in Scotland is a protective factor – but she has faced logistical hurdles and much hurt.Last week, she finally applied for settled status. Then she downed two whiskies because she knew she wouldn’t be able to sleep. Her application has been accepted, but with no documentation to prove she is legally here she does not know how much help it will be. This is particularly worrying for her as her son suffers from a chronic illness which requires regular treatment.“Nothing has changed yet. But people started making things up as soon as the referendum was over,” she says. “When I was pregnant, I phoned the midwe and I was askedI had been here for  months. I was angry. No-one from the government had told staff to ask that question, so why was it being raised ”She is worried she will be forced to defend herselfshe turns up with her son at AE. She is also concerned employers will start to discriminate against those who are not British, not out of malice, but because they are confused about the rules or to avoid extra administration.Days earlier, she watched Nigel Farage bid goodbye to the European Parliament with an undignied display of flag-waving Auld Lang Syne. But she says greater hurt has been inflicted by those closer to home. “OK, there are these people who think it’s about flags. I don’t agree with that. I find it childish, but I don’t identy with them,” she says.“What is more problematic is that the people in whose community I live don’t understand how awful the last three years have been. When they read headlines in the Daily Mail, they don’t realise it is me they are talking about.“When they discuss, on social media, whether or not immigrants are an economic benefit, again it is me: the person who is their friend or relative.“Even those who are pro-immigration who think they are being helpful when they point out immigrants contribute . times [more in taxes than their indigenous counterparts] can be hurtful. I want to say to them: ‘I am so much more than this. I am a mother, a we, a human being. I am not a . times contribution.’ It is horrible to be reduced to a statistic.”Artist William Saraband had never visited Scotland when he made the decision to move from Portugal four years ago, but he was smitten with the image that had formed in his imagination. His early fascination, kindled by reading Walter Scott and listening to Celtic music, was reinforced by friendly customers in his mother’s café in Tavira in the Algarve.“Compared with other parts of the UK, the Scottish customers would be the ones who would always say: ‘Oh, you should come over. It’s brilliant in Scotland. We need young people just like you,” he says.By , Saraband and his boyfriend had decided there was no future for them in Portugal, which was still suffering the after-effects of the economic crash. There were few job opportunities for someone with a master’s degree in medieval history, so he was serving tables in his mother’s café while his dentist boyfriend worked six days a week for € a month.They moved to Edinburgh, knowing no-one, but immediately felt at home. Within a few months, they both had jobs, Saraband in the marketing department of a tech company, his boyfriend as a dentist.That was in November . By February , the anti-immigrant rhetoric was already being ramped up.“I started seeing something very dark. EU citizens were being talked about more and more in relation to NHS waiting times,” he says. “It led me to do something I had never done in Portugal: join a political party. The SNP wasn’t the only party to reject the xenophobia early on – the Greens and the Lib Dems were also good on the issue – but the SNP had the strongest non-apologetic voice. It was saying quite clearly that immigrants were valued.”Still in Portugal, Saraband’s mother is already feeling the impact of Brexit. The number of British tourists frequenting her café has decreased. So too has the number of expats. “Four families – three Scots and one from Northern Ireland – have come to say goodbye because they are selling their apartments and moving home,” he says. Friends who moved where in the UK have also been affected. He tells me about researchers in Liverpool who ed home in . “They told me that after the vote people were saying to them, ‘Aren’t you leaving now ’ asthat was what they were supposed to do.”In his Edinburgh bubble, Saraband feels insulated from the toxicity of Brexit, but says he is an optimist, not an idiot. “I know it is the Home Office, not the Scottish Government, that will take the decisions that affect my future.”Brexit will have no impact on his own relationship with Europe or cause a disconnect with his family. “I keep reminding myself that it is not me who is losing out. I still have  other countries where I can exercise my freedom of movement,” he says. “And yet, the one country where I want to exercise it is the one in which it is being denied to me. That is the irony”Eight-week-old Luna De Luca is lying on a changing table in her home in Maryhill, Glasgow. She is wearing a pretty hand-knitted dress and gurgling contentedly. Luna means “moon” in both her parents’ languages. In a week of symbols, this eight-week-old baby – born a fortnight before Boris Johnson won his victory, making Brexit inevitable – is a beacon in dark skies and a powerful testament to the European ideal.Luna will grow up to be tri-lingual. Her father Manuel, a university lecturer, will speak to her in Italian, her mother Caterine Arrabal, a lawyer, will speak to her in Spanish, and she will speak English in school. “She truly is a European breed,” says Manuel.Brexit poses no greater threat to the De Luca family than to anyone  in the UK. As the Spanish-born daughter of a Scots mother, Caterine already has dual nationality. Manuel, from Sicily has become a British citizen. Having moved to Scotland together  years ago, they have good jobs and a comfortable home.Yet none of this has made them complacent. They are shocked at the way attitudes to European immigrants have changed over the past few years and dismayed by the way the benefits of being a member of the EU have been so casually discarded.“What I love about Europe is the potential it offers for meeting people of other nationalities and doing all sorts of dferent things in dferent countries,” says Manuel.“When I moved to Spain, I saw lots of European people making new lives, mixing together having children. It is one of the highest achievements. In the UK, however, it is going to change. There will be quotas and fewer Europeans mixing with people here.” What frustrates Manuel is the lack of an angry fight-back. “We have seen some marches against Brexit, and some marches for independence, but there doesn’t seem to be a culture of demonstrating here. In France, they demonstrate all the time. People in France went on strike for a month over changes to the pension system. Those changes happened here and nobody said anything. Why can we not make more noise  Why can we not speak out with one voice ”While he and Caterine are upset by the UK’s departure from the EU, they believe Brexit might be the catalyst required to shake the country out of its complacency.“If you see this strategically, it could be a chance to change a system that is pretty old and not fair and not working any more,” says Manuel. “There is an Italian saying: ‘Si chiude la porta, si apre un portone’ or ‘sometimes a door will close, but an even bigger door will open’.“A door has been closed with Brexit, but maybe there will be a bigger door – an even stronger relationship with Europe in the future because people will have come to appreciate it more.”“I hope so, for this one’s sake,” adds Caterine, who has been breast-feeding her baby daughter on the sofa. “I want her to have all the opportunities that I had and more.”Luna lies milk-drunk and blissful in her mother’s lap.

I don’t think it’s OK to just give up and roll over and wait for Brexit to damage to our society and our economy.”He continued: “My best guess is the Tories will reach a point of recognition. The longer they hold out and say: ‘You’re not allowed to make this choice’, the stronger the support for independence will become.“They will recognise thatthey have any chance at all of persuading people not to opt for a positive future, as an independent member of the European Union, they are going to have allow that question to come sooner or later. The longer they leave it, the more determined people will become.”The SNP leader announced in a speech to party members last week plans to set up a new “constitutional convention” to establish a new Claim of Right and forge a broader campaign for a Yes vote.But the speech was branded “utterly predictable and entirely wrongheaded” by pro-Union leaders.The Greens, meanwhile, used an event in Glasgow on Friday to launch a renewed campaign in favour of independence, with the eventual aim of a new Scottish state joining the EU.Ska Keller, co-president of the Green group of MEPs in the European Parliament, used a speech in Glasgow to tell supporters that Scotland would be welcomed as a member state.Outlining his continued push for an indyref, Harvie added: “Greens are used to arguing against the odds and maintaining a principled position evenothers are saying no.“It is important that we do continue to assert the right of Scotland to decide the time-scale of the transition period. Every other member state has had a say, the UK has had a say. Scotland has tried to have a say and been ignored.“I think there is a principled argument to be made, that during the transition period, Scotland should have a say.”The First Minister has previously spoken of her desire to keep the “gold standard” of the  Edinburgh Agreement – which laid down the rules for the  referendum – but has so far refused to rule out a consultative ballot.“Should the UK government continue to deny Scotland’s right to choose, we may reach the point where it is necessary for this issue to be tested, she said last week. I am not ruling that out.”But the Greens list MSP maintained that calls for such a vote should not be heeded.“I don’t think anyone should be rushing towards that as an option,” he added.“I think it’s far betterwe can have this choice on a democratic basis without going to court, because I think that’s the best way to make sure both sides of the argument accept the rules and the legitimacy of the outcome.“If at some point it becomes utterly impossible and the UK becomes intransigent, even after , well possibly you might have to look at that. But it’s by no means an option we should be enthusiastic about.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"euan mccolm nicola sturgeon s knack keeps both sides on message","story":"If you thought Nicola Sturgeon had appealed for calm after Brexit, that#s not what her supporters heard, writes Euan McColm. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon possesses an ability for which other political leaders would sell their souls. She has the power to tell her party members one thing and for them to hear another.We’ve witnessed this happen, time and again, in recent years. Whenever Sturgeon has raised the subject of independence, she has left SNP members convinced they’ve heard the repetition of a promise to hold a second referendum in the immediate future.But those listening closely will have heard the First Minister say something dferent. Sturgeon’s speeches on the matter are full of shoulds and my intentionses, qualiers that loosen the wheels on her wagon.In a speech delivered to SNP members on Friday, Sturgeon really went for it when it came to the constitutional shake-up that she predicts is imminent.Quoting the late Nelson Mandela, Sturgeon said: “It always seems impossible until it is done.” She believed that, in Scotland, we are on the cusp of such a moment. Whether the battle to end apartheid in South Africa and the fight for Scottish independence are analogous is one to wrestle with. Doubtless, many Yes campaigners see their cause as a righteous crusade to overthrow Scotland’s oppressors. Others may think the First Minister might want to get a grip.Anyway, the Sturgeon speech, her reaction to the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union, was full of red meat for the nationalists. There was the usual stuff – which has so far failed to sht polls in favour of the independence movement – about Scotland being dragged out of the EU, and there was a flirtation, too, with the question of the Scottish Government holding a consultative votethe UK government continues to reject the nationalists’ request to have the power to hold a referendum transferred to Edinburgh.Sturgeon was not wildly enthusiastic about the idea but many of those in the audience, including a number of elected members, think the First Minister should push ahead with a referendum and let the government at Westminster try to stop her. They will have heard Sturgeon say she was not ruling out testing the Scottish Government’s ability to hold its own referendum and been satisfied that the possibility of radical action was real and present.When she succeeded Alex Salmond in , Sturgeon pledged to be a First Minister for all Scots, regardless of how they had voted in the independence referendum. But her talk of uniting Scotland didn’t last long as the SNP membership soared and she came under intense pressure from all those new activists to hold a second referendum as soon as possible.Since then, Sturgeon has engaged in a relentless process of marching her troops halfway up the hill and then back down again and then back up and then back down. She dangles in front of the SNP membership an indyref that she is unable to deliver and tells Scots we yearn to put right the mistake of .But, despite the First Minister’s insistence that the Yes movement is moving forward with growing momentum, polls stubbornly refuse to sht in the nationalists’ favour. Sturgeon’s crystal ball told her that ious political outcomes would boost the independence cause. Theof a majority Tory government at Westminster in  was supposed to do it victory for the Leave campaign in the following year’s EU referendum was supposed to do it and the elevation to Prime Minister of Boris Johnson was supposed to do it. None of these things appears to have done it.Though more excitable nationalists will have heard Sturgeon refuse to rule out a referendum held without the permission of the UK government, others will have heard a dferent speech. They’ll have heard Sturgeon call for a calm and level-headed approach they’ll have heard her say there is no shortcut to independence and that victory for the Yes campaign in any future referendum was dependent on a number of Scots changing their minds on the constitutional question.I wonder for how much longer Sturgeon believes she can continue to face both ways on the matter of another independence referendum  Her current strategy of ratcheting up expectations among supporters and then immediately letting them down is becoming positively sadomasochistic. Surely someone’s going to shout the safe word.Sturgeon looks like a politician who has run out of ideas. She might say she understands the need to win the confidence of pro-UK voters but she shows no inclination towards shting the political agenda on to the domestic matters that these voters prioritise. Perhaps unwilling to invite real scrutiny from those voters, Sturgeon gives all of her attention to those already persuaded by the arguments for independence. How this approach is expected to increase support for the breaks-up of the UK is anybody’s guess.Sturgeon’s speech on Friday was supposed to be a reflection on Brexit but it was no such thing. No matter how the UK had voted in , the SNP would always have argued in favour of independence, Of course, Sturgeon was going to say that Brexit enhanced the case for independence. There has been no reflection on Brexit beyond the wording of arguments about how it impacts on the case for independence.Here, I think, the First Minister will find herself truly out of step with many Scottish voters. Only a minority of Scots wanted Brexit but that doesn’t mean the majority will think the answer to this outcome lies in more constitutional uncertainty.There are those within the SNP who would have liked the First Minister to have used her speech on Friday to apply the brakes on the independence charabanc. They’d have liked to hear her talk about the need to see the lie of the post-Brexit land before making a fresh case for independence.Instead, we got more of the usual preaching to the converted that we’ve been hearing for more than five years.Sturgeon’s big speech on Brexit told enthusiastic nationalists that independence was imminent, it told gradualists that independence was a time away. And it told the rest of us that the First Minister is running low on ideas for shting opinion in favour of the break-up of the UK.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"independent scotland would get enthusiastic welcome from eu says donald tusk","story":"But the comments came under fire from Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab who hinted that it may encourage other \"secessionist\" movements in Europe.Askedthe Scottish Government could expect encouragement from the EU,it sought to rejoin, Mr Tusk told the BBCs Andrew Marr Show: \"Emotionally I have no doubt that everybody would be enthusiastic here in Brussels and more widely, more generally in Europe.\"Mr Tusk added that he felt \"empathy\" for the position of Scotland.Scotland would not be automatically accepted into the Brussels Bloc, with\"formalities\" and treaty agreements requiring to be adhered to.But he added: \"If something like, for example, the independence of Scotland happens then we need a regular new process.\"Its a new situation, a new country, then it means a new process.\"But Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab hit out at Mr Tusks comments.\"I think it was frankly un-European and irresponsible given the secessionist, separatist tendencies in Spain, France and Italy,\" he said.\"Im not sure that European leaders, let alone here in the UK would actually welcome thatkind of language.\"Mr Raab insisted that Scotland will have a \"great opportunity\" to take advantage of the UKs \"levelling up\" agenda.He added \"At the same time, we ought to expect the SNP to live up to its commitment to honour the outcome of the independence referendum, not to keep coming back and asking for a second one.\"Mr Raab also dismissed the Scottish Governments call last week for a separate visa system for Scotland to ensure immigration levels hold up after Brexit.He said: \"Either its unworkable or its going to be so draconian you would have to require people in the United Kingdom to stay in one part of the United Kingdom.

He is in thehot seat this week, speaking to us about his love of music and choosing his top ten tracks - not an easy task by any means.Vincent enjoys a busy family le AND has five children and five grandchildren.He is a finance and property expert, and in his spare time helps out as a quiz master, which keeps him sharp!However music has always been a big part of his le, and he has had an interest in it since he was only a boy.“Music is a passion and something that has followed me since childhood,” explained Vincent.He confesses that his top  favourite songs are constantly changing, so when revealing his list, he decided to focus on a top  that brings back the strongest memories for him throughout his le.At number one is the Beach Boys with ‘God Only knows’.“This was released in  off the incredible Pet Sounds album. “Although I didn’t discover it until my teens, this is an enduring song of beauty.” Number two on his list is ‘The Long and Winding Road’ from The Beatles.He said: “It’s impossible not to have a Beatles track in here. This is just before my time but this song from the  ‘Let it Be’ album is my pick from many contenders.Number three is Love Affair – Everlasting Love. “This is my earliest memory from the  pop classic. “The remake of a ‘ hit for Robert Knight sung by the wonderful Steve Ellis.” The number four spot is reserved for ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’.“Coming up to its th anniversary, my constant favourite song of all time by Simon and Garfunkelis Bridge Over Troubled Waters.” Number five goes to Sam Cooke with ‘Bring it On Home to Me’“What top  couldn’t contain this amazing singer and composer who contributed to the success of Aretha, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and Al Green.” Number six belongs to a Pink Floyd classic.“Probably in the mid ’s my favourite group was Pink Floyd. It was during this period that I began to collect albums.“Dark Side Of The Moon being my first Floyd purchase, however my pick is ‘Wish You Were Here’ off their ‘ album of the same name.”Seventh spot goes to The Eagles. “Sticking my mid ’s periodof music and my infatuation with The Eagles.“I rather quickly acquired their early albums ‘Desperado On The Border One Of These Nights’, however my selection is ‘The Last Resort’ off their th studio album Hotel Calornia.” For eighth spot, Vincent stays with The Eagles.“I’m still in my teenage years and sticking with the Eagles theme, although I’ve moved sideways to select an album I listened to nightly for a couple of years from Jackson Browne.“It was his fourth album and I’ve picked the title track, which is the wonderful ‘The Pretender’. As the list draws to a close, Vincent says: “Running out of room as I juggle with The Four Tops, The Jam, Steely Dan, Stevie, Wonder, Elvis Costello, Al Green, Spencer Davis, The Rolling Stones, George Harrison and OMD.“But I have to stick with my memory theme and at number nine I’ve gone with ‘Supertramp’ which I overplayed at university.“Mainly Crime Of The Century and Breakfast In America and Crisis What Crisis.“My selection is from the latter album and I’ve gone for A Soap Box Opera, it’s orchestral feel just does it to me.”For the last place on his top ten list, Vincent has included a track from the legendary Bruce Springsteen.“I needed Bruce Springsteen in here.“Although how do I pick just one track  Born To Run, The River Nebraska, Born In The USA, The Rising “Again sticking with nostalgia and being a romantic I’ve picked the  ‘Dancing In The Dark’ because it was the year I married Catherine and she’s had to put up with my music ever since!”It’s often hard to think of your favourite  tracks! Vincent admits these “are not necessarily my favourite ever songs as the list changes constantly, but they certainly contain my strongest and fondest memories from down through the years.

Matthew Taggart, , who is in the first year of a foundation degree apprenticeship in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Translink in Belfast, said he believes the opportunity to gain qualications with no fees while getting paid to work is something that all young people should consider.Workplus, which helps employers develop talent through apprenticeships, estimates that almost poundm will be earned by the successful candidates over the period of their apprenticeships, some of which will last up to six years, with the possibility of permanent jobs.Those successful will take up positions at companies including Farrans, Translink, Atkins, Liberty IT, Jacobs and McAdam Design in the autumn to gain on the job training in career areas including engineering, construction, IT, administration and accountancy.Matthew said: “After my AS Levels at Ballymena Academy I went straight into a Workplus apprenticeship with Translink and spent two years doing a Level  BTEC. “Now I’m in the first year of a foundation degree, working on projects at Translink which are both interesting and challenging four days a week and attending classes at South West College in Omagh one day a week.“The greatest benefit of being an apprentice is that I’m able to work and learn on the job, while also working towards the qualications I need to apply for jobs within the industry.“Some of my friends who are at university wish they’d taken the same path as me because I’m earning a wage and as my fees are being paid I’ll have no debt at the end. I’d recommend that all young people considering higher education take a look at the apprenticeship opportunities available with Workplus.”Gavin McFarland, Programme Manager at Translink, said: “Workplus gives us access to a large pool of talented young people. Our Civil Engineering apprentices are valued members of our Infrastructure and Projects team. They take full advantage of opportunities to develop their academic learning and professional qualications, while earning an attractive salary. We are pleased to support Workplus and would recommend it to other employers seeking to attract talented young people. “Richard Kirk, Director of Workplus, explained: “Many of the young people who are applying for Workplus Apprenticeships are telling us that full time study along with the debt and career uncertainty at the end is not the right route for them.“Our apprentices get real jobs, good pay with a starting salary between pound, to pound, depending on entry level, as well as access to training and professional networks that will transform their lives.”Applications for this year’s Workplus scheme are open until February  at www.workplus.app "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2719899.jpg--.jpg?1580378297000\n","title":"my top 10 artie mcauley s musical memories","story":"THE next rambler on our new musical meander down memory lane is the inimitable Mr. Artie McAuley.

I’ll try where I can to find outanybody nearby owns the property. These places are almost always in a bad state of repair – broken windows, roofs and doors missing. “If it’s somewhere that’s been left open you’re not breaking and entering and you’re not going in to commit a crime so you can’t be prosecuted for that either. Michael likes to tell a story through the items that have been left behind“You’re going in at your own risk. If you can’t get in you write it off and move on. Like I say it’s a grey area so I prefer to keep a low profile and let my pictures speak for themselves.”Michael shares the photographs he takes via his Facebook and Instagram pages entitled Forgotten Places NI: “I respect people’s privacy andI’m ever asked to take any photos down I do it straight away.“I do it for the love of old buildings and their contents, it’s as simple as that. It’s a hobby and I don’t try to make any money from it. “I had been taking photos for my own pleasure to start with but when I showed them to other people they said I needed to share them online because they were so good. That’s why I started up Forgotten Places NI.”An old ambulance found at a derelict propertyMichael’s photographs are posted with a short description of the property but little detail about the location unless it’s somewhere that’s easily recognisable. He said he likes to keep his best finds to himself: “I know a couple of other guys who do this. There’s ones who take photographs and sell them. Mine is purely a hobby.“I’ll get messages from other people asking where I’ve been. I don’t always tell them. It’s dog eat dog. It sounds stupid because there’s nothing to gain from it. It’s one-upmanship to find somewhere that no one  has posted about.Masonic supports Charity work Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“I don’t get why people would exchange locations. I don’t see the point. It’s finding the places and not knowing what’s going to be inside that does it for me. If you go somewhere that’s already been documented it takes the excitement out of it.”Most of the properties are in a bad state of repairHe said: “What I do I call it documenting. I go in take pictures and write a wee blurb about the place I’ve been. “Sometimes it’s a property that’s got a ‘for sale’ sign at it. You’ll come back in three months and it’s gone, it’s been flattened for redevelopment. It’s sad because when you’re in it you get a real sense of the character of the house, the essence of it.”Michael said he used to have a penchant for ghost hunting, but with his new pursuit he tries to steer clear of the paranormal: “I used to have a bit of a fascination with paranormal investigation, though I think it had more to do with the old buildings. I love walking round old places as you can pick up so much of the history from just walking around. “I used to do a few paranormal investigations so that gave me an appreciation of old buildings, the character of them, just how dferent they are to the ones now.“With Forgotten Places NI I don’t like to spook things up to be scarier than they are. That said, there’s a post I put up just this weekend about a house that I called the House of Ambivilence. It really did have mixed feeling about it. “It looked lovely from the outside, a nice farmhouse. Downstairs had a nice calm atmosphere, but when you went upstairs, honestly, you wanted to get out again, something just didn’t sit. I felt uneasy about the atmosphere. A well lived in room“That’s not generally the case, mostly you get a good feeling about the place because of the items you find in them – kids’ toys, religious pictures, birthday cards. It’s that connection I like.”Michael’s photos are largely focused on derelict properties in NI but he has also ventured into the Republic of Ireland: “Banbridge is a good location to have as a base. I can be in the south in  minutes, quicker than to get to Belfast.“For me it’s trying to find places that haven’t been documented. Everybody’s done Cairndhuand because of its popularity it has been subject to vandalism. Nevertheless it’s a fascinating place. It doesn’t matter what people do to it.” Michael, who has three children, said: “My daughter would come out with me from time to time for a wee spin. We’d trek up country roads to seewe can find any or maybe I’ll have some place marked to check out. “I’ll maybe read around online about an area to seethere’s any stories relating to old mills, old schools. You can look at satellite images before you go. We’ll maybe have eight or  places marked.“These places that I’m going into, people don’t even know they’re out there. There’s hundreds of them. I mark them on my Google Maps – there’s five or six hundred on there to explore.”Michael said he has a bank of photos stored on his phone that he hasn’t shared yet: “If I didn’t go out for another three months I’d have enough to keep posting. “Looking back at some of my older photos, they aren’t great. I think I’ve got better. “In July or August I had , likes on the page, by December it had doubled, now I’m pushing towards ,. “It’s amazing because I’m not doing anything with it, I’m just publishing photos with a small bit of a story, I’m not promoting it or trying to make money from it.”Michael is quick to point out that he is not the first person to find beauty in the Province’s derelict properties. He said Abandonned NI set the benchmark for this sort of photography.Michael said his obsession was a year-round one: “I’ll be out in winter as well as summer. In winter it’s good because the foilage dies back and you’re able to see things that would previously have been hidden. I remember once crawling through a hole and the hedge to find this property that you’d never know was there.” Asked what led him to begin searching for old houses Michael said: “It was my son who got me started, it must have been about three or four years ago. “He showed me this video on YouTube of a guy in America who was exploring this derelict mansion that used to belong to a drug dealer. “It looked fantastic, all the broken windows and doors hanging off and the stuff that was left inside. “My son said we should try to find something like that here. I said, ‘you’re not going to get something on that scale but we’ll have a look’. “What we did was we went to Cairndhu which is near Larne. It’s pretty much where everybody that does this starts. It’s so well known, it’s such a tragic story of how it fell into such disrepair. It’s so vast. As soon as I got in I was hooked.”Cairndhu which was built around  is the former home of Sir Thomas Dixon. It became a convalescent home before it was closed in .Michael said: “There are people on social media who tell me about a derelict house near to them, sometimes it can be just a shell. For me that’s not that interesting. “What I find interesting is somewhere that has personal possessions still inside. It could be furniture, it could be letters, there’s houses you go into and you’d think people had just walked out and left everything still in it.Michael said his passion was driven more by what people had left behind inside the properties rather than the buildings themselves.He commented: “Some people would look at a man in his forties out exploring the country like this as stupid, but for me it’s just that sense of adventure. “It’s good to be out and about. It’s a healthy interest and no one is harmed.“It’s like how you feel when you’re a kid when you go out exploring. “I’m not sure I was even this adventurous as a kid. Maybe I’m making up for it now.“It’s that excitement of the unknown, that danger of not knowing what you’re going to find. That’s why I do it. “It’s those wee unassuming houses that look like nothing and you go in and they’re just filled with stuff. You find out all about the owners, the le that they led.”Discussing some of the remnants of the past he has uncovered, Michael said: “You see so many of the old Singer sewing machines.“There was one house where I found the shell of a Mk II Jag. I found an old ambulance as well.“For me the best finds are the wee personal things like a Valentine’s card or a kid’s note that says ‘mummy has been mean to me and daddy’ – you’re hoping that was just a wee fleeting moment.”He continued: “I try to capture those items as they sit to tell the story of the house. “I take the photos on my phone, maybe I’ll upgrade to a fancy camera someday though photographers will tell you it doesn’t matter what you use, it’s your eye for a photo.“People say to me they can imagine a story around my posts. In my wee blurb I’ll not give the location away unless it’s a well known building. I’ll just describe it a wee bit as best I can and let the pictures tell the story.”Offering suggestions as to why houses end up derelict yet full of possessions, he said: “A lot of the time you’ll get an elderly person who will pass away, they may have nobody to leave it to or they may leave it to the family and they can’t agree what to do with it so it just sits.“Sometimes you get people who buy the property for the adjoining land but don’t knock down the original property.”Some of the items left behindThe scene in an abandonned kitchenBoots no longer made for walkingThis cupboard remains well stockedAn Evening Prayer"},{"url":null,"title":"orangemen aim to scale kilimanjaro","story":"A dozen Orangemen from Co Down are planning an ambitious trip to Africa during which they will attempt to scale Mount Kilimanjaro.The men from Banbridge District No  have a proud history of undertaking gruelling fundraising ventures, with this particular challenge requiring two years of groundwork.Deputy District Master Stuart Magill said: “In this last  years at Banbridge Orange Hall we’ve raised over £, for dferent causes and charities.“Drumming For Heroes from LOL  has raised £,. They’ve carried a Lambeg drum up to the top of Ben Nevis and cycled from John O’Groats to Landsend with a Lambeg on the back of a bike. “They also did the four peaks of the UK in four days, and walked the route of King Billy from the south of England to Carrickfergus and down to the Boyne, also bringing the Lambeg.”Banbridge Orange Hall is home to several dferent lodges including LOL  and LOL  of which Stuart is a member. “This time it will be our lodge that’s doing Kilimanjaro though we won’t be bringing a Lambeg – it’s going to be hard enough as it is,” he continued. “It’s a follow up to the Walk of Remembrance when we walked  miles from Thiepval Memorial to Menin Gate.”The -year-old added: “It was my idea to climb Killimanjaro. I’ve never done it before, that’s why I want to do it. “There’s  of us doing it. My biggest worry was getting .

There’s a big build to allow us to pay for it, the cost of the trip is coming out of each person’s pocket so that every penny raised is going to the charity. It also gives us plenty of time to train for it, and also to raise money for the two charities.”Two charities are set to benefit – the Children’s Cancer Unit in Royal Victoria Hospital and Angel Wishes which helps children with cancer and supports their families.He said the two charities were close to the hearts of those taking part in the trek as they were good friends with a family from Banbridge who are indebted to the services provided by the organisations.In pictures: NI man finds beauty in derelict properties around the Province Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Stuart said: “The oldest person taking part is in his sixties and the youngest is in his twenties. “The majority of training will be in the Mournes for fitness and stamina, but there’s no training over here really for the altitude.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"janines wedding day is captured on camera","story":"WELL-known local woman Janine Howard will feature in tonight#s edition of the popular BBCNI documentary series, True North.‘Saving Face’ follows the story of -year-old Janine and her preparations for her marriage to fiancé Matthew Light in October.Janine was just two years old when she was diagnosed with leukaemia.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mclaughlin pays tribute to reds second half hunger","story":"CLIFTONVILLE boss Paddy McLaughlin paid tribute to his side’s second-half effort in their dramatic injury-time County Antrim Shield comeback win against Ballymena. The Reds battled back from Leroy Millar’s early opener in the second half to stage a smash-and-grab - win and McLaughlin felt his side emptied everything into their search for a route back into the game. “I’m delighted,” reflected McLaughlin. “You saw how much effort that players put into the second half and you’ve got to give Ballymena credit – they were good on the break, got their lead with a soft goal we gave away and they defended their lead really well. But you saw how much our boys put into the second half, they emptied their heart on to the pitch and gave us everything.“To get the equaliser, we were happy with that and to go into extra time because I thought the momentum was with us. But to go and win it a minute later was an incredible finish to the game. It’s a sore one for Ballymenayou’re a Ballymena fan or player tonight. I’m sure they’re going back absolutely devastated at losing the game in the th minute. Unfortunately someone had to lose and you don’t want to see young players going off with their heads down but you can’t take it away from our boys. They gave it everything and they probably slightly deserved it in the end.” McLaughlin refused to take any credit for substitutes Thomas Maguire and Ryan Curran popping up with the late goals, but he praised the duo for putting their personal disappointment to one side for the good of the team. “The players on the pitch did the business,” he added. “The players on the pitch worked Ballymena really hard, they tried their best to work opportunities, Ballymena defended brilliantly well, you can’t deny them that, but when the seven minutes went up we looked like we had a goal in us. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to be one of those days where it would be a sad story – could we have done this and should we have done that “I felt we would get one chance in that seven minutes and take it to extra time, I felt we were finishing the game the stronger. For Thomas [Maguire] and Ryan [Curran] to pop up, fair play to them because I’m sure they were disappointed not to be starting the game. They put their own personal disappointment to one side to go and do a job for the team.”Such was the intensity of that seven minutes of madness, McLaughlin was unable to remember his feelings during the late drama but acknowledged the backing of the Red Army and paid tribute to their “incredible” support. “I pulled two hamstrings running on to the pitch celebrating and anything after that, I don’t know what happened,” admits McLaughlin. “Your emotions take over you because you can see what it means to the players and what it means to the supporters. You can’t go through any interview and not talk about the supporters tonight. “That was incredible support that Cltonville brought tonight in the County Antrim Shield on a Tuesday night. I think there is only one team in the ision that has that support and it’s Cltonville. You saw what it meant to the players and supporters from the goals went in. My mind went blank straight away and only now am I settling down.”Tuesday’s victory ends a four-year wait for silverware and McLaughlin hopes it will give his players a taste for future success. “Sometimes the first trophy is the hardest one to get. “I didn’t come here to make up the numbers, I came here to try and establish Cltonville back as a contender for the ision and as a team who should be challenging to win trophies. “If I didn’t see that potential in them, I wouldn’t have come up,” said the Derry man. “When I see the quality within the playing squad and the support they get when things are going well, when I see how hard they work, I know they’ve got potential to win trophies. All that hard work’s been justied tonight. “It’s one trophy but we’re not going to rest on that, we want more. It’s such a young squad and for a lot of them it’s their first senior medals. Hopefully now they’ll get that appetite for success and to challenge for trophies even more and you never know where this team might go.” "},{"url":null,"title":"belfast telegraph transfer test guide reveals scores accepted by every northern ireland school","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

gone, out, orced, over.\"That moment is without doubt the biggest political moment in a generation, quite a night then for the DUPs Arlene Foster to make her Late Late Show debut, Northern Irelands First Minister joining us on the couch and you can stay with us and witness that little piece of history as it happens live.\""},{"url":null,"title":"girl saved by air ambulance after being knocked down by own mother","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

he is prepared to accept border checks in a no-deal like scenario as tensions ratcheted up between the sparring sides..pushAs the dust settles on Britain’s formal EU withdrawal on Friday, attention has turned to the impending trade talks as the Prime Minister prepares to lay out his post-Brexit vision on Monday in a speech in London.The Government is understood to be privately infuriated by what it perceives to be attempts by Brussels to change the terms of the deal struck in October as part of the Withdrawal Agreement.Reports have surfaced in recent days suggesting EU chiefs want the UK to continue to follow Brussels-made rules on standards and state subsidies, while accepting the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justiceover matters relating to any trade deal.But in what promises to be a combative speech, the PM is expected to tell the EU he will accept no alignment, no jurisdiction of the European courts, and no concessions to any Brussels’ demands when talks start in March.A Government source told the PA news agency that the PM would be prepared to accept a Canada-style free trade deal – a checks-lite trade arrangement that would allow tarf-free trade for the majority of goods, but that would not include the UK’s dominant services sector.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The Government is set to lay out its negotiation stance for the EU trade talks on Monday Analysis undertaken by the Treasury in  predicted that Britain’s economy would be .% worse off under such a deal within  years, when compared with expected growthit had remained in the EU.If a Canada-esque deal cannot be signed-off, insiders say the Government is gearing up to walk away with what is dubbed an “Australia-style” arrangement – a re-branding of a no-deal Brexit.It would see the UK revert to World Trade Organisationrules, with additional mini-deals tacked-on to ensure travel arrangements, such as international flights, can continue.A Government source told PA: “There are only two likely outcomes in negotiation – a free trade deal like Canada or a looser arrangement like Australia – and we are happy to pursue both.”European leaders have already set out their own warnings to Mr Johnson over the upcoming talks.French President Emmanuel Macron used an article in the Times to outline how the level of single market access granted to the UK would “depend on the degree to which the European Union’s rules are accepted”.Another area of trouble could be Gibraltar, with Spain reportedly laying down a gauntlet to EU negotiators over the terms of any deal in the offing.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Gibraltar could used as a pawn by Spain and the EU during the trade talks, according to reports According to the Observer, the EU will back Spain over its territorial claims to the British overseas territory by giving Madrid the power to exclude its population of , people from any potential trade deal.In his keynote speech in London on Monday, Mr Johnson is preparing to rule out relaxing rules on workers’ rights, food hygiene standards and environmental protections.He is also expected, according to Government sources, to confirm UK negotiators will pursue free trade agreements with the likes of the United States, Japan, Australia and New Zealand at the same time as dealing with Brussels.The Sundayreported that a trade deal is earmarked to be agreed with Japan by Christmas, followed by more agreements with Australia and New Zealand in mid .On top of the tough stance on trade, the Sunday Times reported that British diplomats have been ordered to make a break with their former EU allies in a bid to “adopt a stance as a confident independent country”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab According to a leaked telegram quoted by the paper, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK should be free to “dis-apply EU foreign policy positions” during the -month transition period, as Britain prepares to move away from the bloc.It comes as the Mail on Sunday revealed the PM toasted his Brexit success on Friday evening with a £ bottle of rare vintage red wine.The paper said the Conservative Party leader opened a bottle of  Chateau Margaux that was left to him in a supporter’s will, gted with strict instructions for it not to be drunk until Britain was no longer an EU member.Dominic Cummings, the PM’s chief aide and the mastermind behind his “get Brexit done” slogan, is said to have teared-up after the UK’s departure was confirmed at pm.Taking to the microphone at a party at Downing Street, the Sunday Times said the Vote Leave strategy guru had to compose himself by clutching a hand over his face, before addressing those in Number  for the historic occasion."},{"url":null,"title":"uk gears up to host crucial

It requires a coordinated approach, led by Government throughout the UK. Those changes must start now.pic eUJYFjYDpE— CCCJanuary , The run-up to the talks will require a major diplomatic effort from the UK to secure ambitious climate action from countries – at a time when Britain is also negotiating trade agreements with the EU and other nations.The UK Government’s first move as the year gears up saw the removal of former clean growth minister Claire O’Neill as president of the talks – saying it will be a ministerial role going forward.Experts have warned that the new holder of the job will need to be skilled in diplomacy.Very sad that that the role I was offered by @BorisJohnson last year has now been rescinded as Whitehall “can’t cope” with an Indy cop unit. A shame we haven’t had one Climate cabinet meeting since we formed. Wishing the cop team every blessing in the climate recovery emergency.— COPPresidentJanuary , Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said with leaders such as Donald Trump and Australia’s Scott Morrison in power, it was clear the summit would not deliver emissions cuts of the scale the science demands.“But it’s not all bleak: -odd governments have already indicated their desire to hit net-zero emissions by , and the UK’s central diplomatic job is to cement that ambition into a process that ensures those nations deliver on their net-zero pledges,” he said.As hosts and the first major economy to set a target to cut emissions to net-zero by  – so that any remaining pollution by then is offset by measures such as planting trees – the UK’s own domestic agenda will be under scrutiny.Mr Black said: “The other big thing the Johnson government can do to help deliver an ambitious global agreement is to get the UK on the path to its own legally-binding net-zero target well before the summit opens.“Then he will legitimately be able to tout Britain as an example of a healthy major economy that is on track to eliminate its carbon footprint, and ask others: ‘why don’t you join us ’”For this summit to be a success, its crucial that the UK Government leads by exampleDr Dough Parr, Greenpeace chief scientistIn late June, the Committee on Climate Changewill give its annual progress report to Parliament on how the UK is doing on tackling climate change.Last year they accused the Government of a “ramshackle, Dad’s Army” approach to preparing the country for climate change and warned action to slash emissions is lagging far behind what is needed – even before the net-zero target was set.With the political focus on the general election and Brexit, there has been little in the way of major new climate policies since then.So, unless there is signicant action before June, the report could damage Government claims over its leadership on climate.The CCC will be following the progress report with its advice on the “sixth carbon budget” for the needed emissions curbs between -.It has moved forward the delivery of the advice – which will put the UK on a path to net-zero by  – to September so it comes ahead of the climate talks.Greenpeace chief scientist Dr Dough Parr said: “As the host of the next UN climate summit, the UK Government has a tremendous responsibility to make sure progress will be made.“For this summit to be a success, it’s crucial that the UK Government leads by example.

I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It’s not an easy thing to do but the plan is on February  and  from pm to pm in the Nerve Centre there will be a photography exhibition, short film showcases and, obviously, a gig. The event will be a creative arts festival following the completion of the Education Authority’s CADi scheme that provides young people with qualications and key skills in the creative arts such as film, live sound, photography, graphic design and events management. Live sound is underlined because, obviously, it’s the most important thing in the world.The festival will contain an exhibition of photography, showcase of short films and two days of music including  bands highlighting the musical talent throughout Northern Ireland. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED: Megan Watton and Oisin Clenaghan. This celebration of youth culture has been completely organised by the young people involved with the CADi project to showcase youth within the arts. This should be just about enough to keep the adults interested.Featured acts include Villa in FranceGrace Mullan,Vanilla Days, Meeks, Wasted Wild,Juno Hasson and Aimee Tourish, a bit of trad from Jordan Lively and songstress Maya Patterson, all who have been paving their way through the music scene across the north coast and Derry and in recent months.I spoke to one of the organisers, Megan Watton, and first asked what does CADi mean and what made you all want to do it in the first place  “Well, I joined three years ago it stands for Creative And Digital Innovation.“The course is one year and you get an OCN level one, two or three, depending on what age you are which is the equivalent to an A level or GCSE. “I, personally, wanted to do it because it would give me new skills and quality’s I could use in the future. It has been a programme run by the education Authority for three years and the numbers grow each year The Nerve Centre has been a fantastic help as they provide the tutors of each discipline events management, film, photography, graphic design and sound.They also have connections in the music scene which helps when booking bands,” she added. “Just that this programme has aided so many young people with their mental health and self-confidence and the out of school conditions helps. Without CADiI wouldn’t have gotten into my tech course.” Ethan Martin, who also helped organise it, said: “CADi means working with others in a small group to achieve the same goal. It’s been hard as we had to learn how to run an event, the Nerve Centre has been a huge help.”Events manager team member Clodagh McKenna, said: “The CADi Youth Takeover is an event for young people by young people. “It’s a chance to show how talented the youth of Northern Ireland is particularly in its music scene which has so many hidden gems. It also contains amazing work from the photographers, and film makers from the CADi programme.“CADi is a cross community programme aimed to give young people aged - the opportunity to gain skills in areas they wouldn’t usually get an opportunity to within school. “These include photography, graphic design, live sound , film and events management. The bulk of the programme consists of three residential weekends which lead up to the final event.“We’ve worked hard over the past couple of months to produce an event we hope the public will love. CADi really is like a second family to lots of us and you can see that when we come together. “We’ve created friends and memories that will last a letime.” AdultMarty Coyle said: “The CADi courses are a fantastic opportunity for young people to get some real-le experience in arts related subjects whilst gaining a qualication at the same time. “The upcoming two-day event at Nerve Centre will showcase the hard work they have put in throughout the course, showcase their own work as well as presenting a broad demographic of their peers within the arts throughout Northern Ireland”.

I got this cold off all the little two and three year olds in nursery, not that I actually wanted it you understand. Of course I understand we can’t keep our children off nursery because of a snfle, butthey’ve a proper cold with coughs, sneezes and that yucky green stuff it means they are not well - not well enough to be in nursery. For just as I didn’t want this cold neither did they, but because a few decided to come in with their nasty cold germs, with the yucky green stuff, we’ve now all had it - thanks. googletag.cmd.push Of course, I understand this is not the children’s fault but, and sorry to say, it is down to those few parents who think ‘go to nursery however snotty and yucky you may be’. So I’m writing this article, for a few reasons, the first to say please do keep your child off nursery they aren’t well, it’s no fun for them and no fun for anyone  when they get the bug too. I know le can be hard with a sickly child, I know how much we need that break sometimes but please, please keep your bugs at home. googletag.cmd.push My next reason is to share with you some tips, ideas and thoughts that I’ve heard and used over the years to help with coughs, cold’s and sneezes, please do remember though I am not a doctor soyou decide to use one of these ideas that I’m passing along to you then do check with a pharmacist or doctor that is is okay to do this with your baby, toddler and  or child. . DO make your child wear a vest or t-shirt under their jumper. Believe me I have met a few children this winter who just wear t-shirts, and always look and feel cold, winter clothes are for winter and summer clothes for summe.!  . TEACH your toddler how to blow through their nose, yes literally show them how to blow, this makes runny noses so much easier to manage. Yes of course you have to hold the tissue for them, butthey can blow then that means less of the runny stuff.  . DO put a little vaseline around their noses when your little one has a cold - this stops their nose getting sore, but also makes it sooo much easier to wipe. . Do keep this little pot of vaseline just for their nose though. . TREAT, some people do use medicines, paracetamol, baby Sudafed etc and this is a personal choice, it’s up to you as parents. But as my mum said, ‘with medicine the cold will be there a week, without medicine it’ll be there for a week’. The medicines are designed to make your little one feel better, they won’t necessarily cure the cold. Remember you know your child best, whether this be they need a little something, or an appointment at the doctor.  . WHEN your little one goes to nursery do pack a spare outfit including socks, shoes or wellies and trousers - not for toilet accidents but because it is till nice to play outside but it can be wet or muddy and it is not nice to sit about later in damp clothes.  . HELP your two and three year olds learn how to blow their nose AND put the tissue in the bin not back in the box- it is a skill and does need practise but the sooner they learn the more comfortable they feel. . TEMPERATURE, a normal temperature in babies and children is about .C but this can y slightly. A fever is usually considered to be a temperatureof C or above’ . It is handy to have a thermometer at home for these worrying times - do ask for advice from a pharmacist about which is best to buy and easiest to use. But always be mindful of your little one’s temperaturethey are poorly - and especially mindful with babies.  . PLEASE don’t wipe their nose with kitchen roll - this can make it sore, use tissues with balm in them - yes I know they can be more expensive but bargain shops do great deals.Be careful wiping noses with wet wipes as some can sting - soft tissues and vaseline don’t! . EXTRA, sometimes people use a vapour, like Vicks, to rub onto their baby, toddler or child’s chest, or feet, these can be soothing when applied to the body but you can also get them as a humidier, or as an oil to pop in the bath - it’s up to you to choose what is right for your little one. Please do be aware that there are age restrictions on them and not all are suitable for all ages.  . DO make your child wear a coat and a hat for very cold weather and maybea scarf and glovesit’s very chilly.  . DON’T force your child to eat too muchthey are poorly, little and often is best, snotty noses can often lead to sickly tummy’s, but do make sure they are getting plenty of fluids so they do not become dehydrated, water, water and more water or failing that juice. . . EVEN though it’s cold outside and your little may be full of cold sometimes a walk in the fresh air for a short time can help - fresh air can make you feel better and help your little one sleep better too - just remember to wrap up warm.  . DO encourage your little one to eat lots of vegetables and fruit, all the time not just when they have a cold, these are full of vitamins that will help them to develop a good immune system. Fingers crossed these few little things help, good luck fighting the cold bug. Atishooooo!

Myself and councillor Brian McGuigan have been putting this on the agenda with local maintenance teams frequently, and since Brian was first elected to council back in  the resurfacing of these roads has been a common request from him.Whilst we can understand that the Tory governments policy of austerity has left the budget strained, and that the department have been in a dficult position, there is no denying that some of the roads in our locale are in a condition unfit for use in the st century.We in Sinn Feacutein will continue to demand upgrades to rural roads, as it is our belief that rural dwellers should not have to put up with sub-par services just because they live outside the cities. At the minute, the Moneyneany Road, used not just by locals but for a number of commuters travelling between Derry Dungiven and Cookstown, is more like a patchwork quilt than a road.Emma Sheerin added: We have seen a lack of investment West of the Bann since the creation of this state, and the road network we have is a testament to that. When you see the state of some of the B and C roads across Mid Ulster, it is little wonder that roads are a constant bugbear for rural dwellers. The Assembly woman added: I have written to the newly appointed Infrastructure minister asking that some of the aforementioned routes are prioritised, and we will be meeting with Mr McKinley from the local ision in order to request this also. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Fr OKane has been involved with St Eithnes since the idea of a second school for the parish was first suggested. He was there through the years of planning and, no doubt, fought for finances from the Western Education and Library Board and Department of Education. Fr OKane was has been here for St Eithnes as a constant support to the entire school community as well as being a wonderful ambassador for the school.  PICTURED: Fr Paddy OKane, right, checking on the progress of the building of the new school. googletag.cmd.push I know that St Eithnes is very much in the heart of Fr Paddy as Fr Paddy is very much at the heart of the school. “I would like to thank him for all that he has done for the school and for his continued support in the future. From its small beginnings with a staggered intake of children in  the school has now grown to over  pupils,  teachers and  classroom assistants. Everyone has a part to play. We have parents and parents of former pupils who volunteer with us too and grandparents that are making all the costumes for the school show and have made a beautul quilt for the th anniversary. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED: The original staff of St Eithnes Primary School with principal, Gerry Cosgrove, seated centre.  This small army of helpers continue to provide a vital support to staff and our children, directly through support in class and indirectly by providing many resources for our school. They are always on hand to help and I know that whenever I need something for the school or for the children I can lt the phone and be assured that help is always at hand, and that is so very much appreciated.

You have Celtic Thunder and Celtic Woman but theres not one man doing this, like a young Tommy Fleming.This last couple of months it has all kicked off for me with the successof the album and my show at the Millennium Forum being announced.Ive always wanted to do my own show in my hometown.Ive supported The Fureys at the Millennium Forum and hada few other guest spots but to have my own show is amazing.It has storytelling and uses a voice from beyond, so its quite dferent.Conor is currently in rehearsals for theMillennium Forum show and there are still a small number of tickets available.His -track album, A New Dawn, is available from his Facebook pageConorMcGintyMusic and on iTunes and Spoty at pound..His show of the same name will be at the Millennium Forum on March  and tickets are priced at pound. from the Millennium Forum Box Office   . googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

victory at Bear Park.In a surprisingly entertaining game, both teams had half chances in the first few minutes with Olympicrsquos Damian Travers and Dylan McCartan unable to get shots on target.Forest should have taken the lead in the ninth minute when a Paul Kane corner kick was only cleared as far as Philly Flood, and his cross just evaded Ray Kendall who was sliding in at the back post.This was to be Floodrsquos last meaningful contribution to the game as he went over on his ankle and had to be replaced by McKibbin, with Jennings ping into left back.Tollymore started with almost the same team that was beaten last week with the exception of Paul Devlin, who was making his debut, and Mooney, Flood, and Paul Kane who were all unavailable last week.However, it was Devlin that made the dference in the first  minutes.The midfielder almost opened the scoring after  minutes when his sizzling free kick from the edge of the penalty area warmed the hands of lsquokeeper Dean Blackwood with Paul Kane heading the loose ball wide.Moments later a huge clearance from Tollymore lsquokeeper Imrie bounced over the Olympic defence, and Rory Walsh jumped with Blackwood only to see his header go wide of the target.Just as it seemed neither team was going to score, Devlin hit a wonder goal from  yards, with the power and swerve of the shot leaving Blackwood flat-footed.With the wind at their backs Tollymore stepped things up and in the th minute an astute pass from Kane picked out Rory Walsh who hit the Olympic crossbar.Devlin was replaced at half-time by Marty McCourt for his first game since early September, and while the big man looked rusty, he soon picked up the pace of the game.Both sides had half chances before Forest doubled their advantage in the th minute when a through ball from Kane saw Walsh nipping in behind the Olympic defence.The unlucky Stephen McConnell barged Walsh in the back with the striker tumbling into the advancing lsquokeeper and referee Mullan had no hesitation in awarding a sport kick.Paul Kane stepped up to take the penalty and lsquoThe Generalrsquo made no mistake to score his second goal in two games.Forest now started to take control and a terric run from James Jennings saw Maxwell and McConnell combining well to scramble the ball clear.In the st minute Walsh made the score - when he ran onto a pass from Marty McCourt to shoot past Blackwood.Forest replaced Kane with Matt McCormick and the young striker almost scored immediately, but was denied by an excellent save from Blackwood whose out-stretched leg prevented a certain goal.In the th minute McCormick did find the net after some excellent approach play from Burkowski.Moments later a superb run from Olympicrsquos Thomas Rogers almost ended with a deserved goal, but his shot flashed over the Forest crossbar.A good performance from Tollymore that resulted in a deserved win, but can they repeat the performance this weekend as consistency is whatrsquos important Best for Tollymore were James Jennings and a remarkable first half performance from Paul Devlin, but in truth it was a good team performance.Match sponsor: Diamond Patrsquos, Newcastle.Tollymore Forest Ballynahinch Olympic III NEWCASTLE LEAGUE DIVISION .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th January 2020 Flagship.jpg","title":"Flagship Festival of Flight set to return  ","story":"IT has been confirmed that the Festival of Flight will be ing to Newcastle in June.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos flagship tourist event will take place on Saturday, June .This festival, which comprises exciting displays both on and off the ground is expected to attract tens of thousands of visitors to the resort.It has not yet been confirmedthe RAF Red Arrows display team will be taking part.The Festival of Flight is part of the councilrsquos lsquoGiant Adventuresrsquo programme of events which was announced this week.They include Wake the Giant in Warrenpoint in August, and Footsteps in the Forest in Slieve Gullion Forest Park.The Councilrsquos tourism programme will also include the DownTime Festival in Downpatrick from June -, the Strangford Lough Skfie Festival from July -August , and the Strangford Lough and the Narnia Festival in Kilbroney Park, Rostrevor, from November -.Council chairman Charlie Casey said: ldquoThese flagship festivals are key events in our programme of tourism events.ldquoWe are very pleased that the Festival of Flight, Wake the Giant and Footsteps in the Forest are all scheduled toto our district in .ldquoThese festivals act as a catalyst to inspire visitors to visit our area.

Flooding peoplersquos lives with the hope found in the good news of the gospel, bringing out the God-colours into the world.That is to be your primary aim as a Bishop.The sermon was followed by the Rite of Ordination and for the ordination prayer and laying on of hands, Archbishop Clarke was joined by other bishops, the Methodist President and former Presidents.The new bishop was then vested in his robes and given a Bible before being presented to the congregation who greeted him with loud, sustained applause. The Dean of Belfast, the Very Rev Stephen Forde, then installed Bishop McClay in his cathedral stall.At the reception which followed in Ulster Universityrsquos Birley Building, Bishop McClay expressed his thanks to all those who had taken part in the service, his parents and family and the many people who had travelled a distance to be there.Bishop McClay said he looked forward to building on the work of two predecessors, Bishop Harold Miller and Bishop Gordon McMullan, who he had been ldquoprivileged to serve under.He added: ldquoIrsquom very grateful for all that they have put in place by way of a heritage to build upon.

It has been downgraded to a Type II emergency unit which we believe is not sufficient. The Downe was only one of two hospitals in the past  years which had had its needs fully assessed before it was built.ldquoThere is a clearly established case for a -hour emergency service in Downpatrick operating seven days a week and nothing has happened at the Department of Health or anywhere  to suggest otherwise. Service changes were made in the past due to staffing issues, nothing .Mr McGrady also revealed that changes are planned at the Downe with surveyors visiting the hospital recently to examine where the proposed new MRI scanner will be located.He said the provision of the scanner will result in an extension being built and also open the door to allow the hospital to do so much more in terms of diagnostics and other opportunities,Campaigners also insisted at last weekrsquos meeting that space is needed to reopen  beds closed in the same week of the new Downersquos official opening in , highlighting the need for everyone mdash including politicians and Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash to work together on this particular issue and that it was time for the ldquoinjustices of the past in terms of local health care provision to be addressed.Mrs Anne Trainor highlighted the lack of investment in local hospital services in the past and said it was time that the Downe Hospital was firmly on the ldquolips of the decision makers and that the local area got its fair share of funding.Looking to the future, she saidthe Downe does become a centre of excellence for the elderly, this will pave the way for other new services to add to those already in place.She also backed calls for more beds to be provided in the Downpatrick hospital and is keen to see the local council taking an active role on health and working alongside campaigners.ldquoHealth is the single most important issue and we have been hammering home this message for years, she declared.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council needs to play a serious role in the delivery of healthcare. The former Down Council put its hands in its pocket to help the hospital campaign but its successor has been lacking in this regard.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoWe want a fully ing hospital that provides this community with the services it needs.

I also work with those who are being bullied or who are bullies themselves.Laura, who offers a free consultation with parents, said children can release their inner feelings through play.She explained that play is a childrsquos natural medium of self expression, highlighting the number of times children ask their parents to play with them and have a chat. Laura said children feel most comfortable in this environment.ldquoAs play is what children are comfortable with, it makes sense that you would use this method to help them through a dficult time. This is particularly effective for children who cannot or who do not want to talk about their problems.ldquoThey can play out their feelings and problems anda child wants to talk to me here of course they can do that. Some children say that they do not want to talk about whatever trauma is in their lives and I say to them that is great because they do not have to.ldquoHowever, they will still express those feelings through play and may in fact not be aware that this is what they are doing. The metaphor is very powerful in the play therapy room and children can hide behind a mask to demonstrate their feelings and using a puppet is a very good example of that.Laura said her work is a method of helping children with behavioural and emotional problems to help themselves, explaining that is the children do all the work.ldquoI am just here as a facilitator, she said. ldquoPlay therapy is not always fun and sometimes the children will encounter dficult feelings. I adopt a child-centred approach where the child leads the way and the therapist follows which is non directive.ldquoOne of the most important aspects of play therapy is the element of control. For some children when something has happened in their le or environment it is a thing which they cannot control which causes trauma. When they come here, this is the one place they can come in and say lsquoright we are doing this my wayrsquo and it can take back control.Laura described play therapy is ldquonon judgemental and said children know they are in a safe environment and can express themselves in any way in which they will be accepted or who they are.She added: ldquoThe children will learn that while here they can be themselves and they will feel comfortable to be themselves.Laura can be contacted on   or via her social media page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th January 2020 New.jpg","title":"New minister at Lissara church  ","story":"A NEW chapter in the history of Lissara Presbyterian Church opened last weekend with the installation of the Rev Alan Burke.A large congregation attended last Friday eveningrsquos service in Crossgar with the new minister looking forward to his time working in the area.For the past two and a half years, Mr Burke was assistant minister at the Loanends and Killead churches near Aldergrove.

They are sharing knowledge and best practice in tackling some of the many global challenges we face today.ldquoIt is a pleasure to have the opportunity to both enjoy these celebrations and indeed to visit the school here in Newcastle.Ms Gross told her audience: ldquoAs language students and teachers at Shimna College you all hold the key to a peaceful and rich future and have a crucial part to play, especially in the coming months and years as Brexit unfolds.ldquoYou are the bridge builders and communicators of tomorrow.\"Judging from your school motto ndash learning from each other ndash the spirit of solidarity and friendship is already firmly rooted in your schoolrsquos DNA.She added: ldquoYour language skills will help ensure our countries remain close neighbours, good friends and vital partners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th January 2020 Tasty.jpg","title":"Tasty double for Gainford  ","story":"THE East Down Foxhounds got the spring point-to-point season underway in cold, but dry conditions at David Corbettrsquos Tyrella estate on Saturday.Despite the cold, the meeting drew the largest attendance in years and also the biggest entry for the January meeting at the long-established venue.One man who will long remember the meeting is young Wexford jockey Jordan Gainford as he recorded his first ever double mdash it is also worth noting that his two winners under rules have come at Downpatrick and Down Royal.It was also a good day for Templepatrick owner trainer Warren Ewing, both his winners being ridden by Gainford.The first of these came in the second race of the day, the Armstrong Auctions  year-old geldings race.

Last night you probably raised a glass at midnight to celebrate – I certainly will have – and now that the United Kingdom, that wee country the Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar chose to insult last week, has successfully extricated itself from the European Union – we can breathe a sigh of relief that democracy finally won through.I had been keeping back a bottle of champagne from my Christmas stock for that moment, mindful of the words of William Hague this week in his Dailycolumn: ‘democracy is not just one item in a menu of equally desirable systems. It is the only means civilisation has ever discovered of reconciling governing with human dignity and freedom. It has to be fought for and defended every day’. A celebration coin was OK. But, a medal for every supporter of Brexit would have been better..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button That awful anti-Brexit mob who hung around Westminster each day in the run up to the crucial final vote forcing we, the viewers, to turn up our TV sets can now be forgiven. It was, after all, their absolute democratic right to protest. In what other country would they have had such freedom without been sprayed with fire hoses, beaten with truncheons and whacked over the head with a military baton. Think of Hong Kong recently. The Westminster mob has long gone, no doubt to enjoy the eventual benefits we can expect from extricating ourselves from a concept which deprived us from making our own decisions and whose military might, had the vote been lost, could have beensubsumed into something too big and with too many competing interests to be effective.Ireland’s prime minster, Leo Varadkar, doesn’t quite get it. Britain, he said “must come to terms with the fact it’s now a small country”. I say to him that big organisations fail because they become too big and the EU was an example of that. Mr Varadkar has the temerity to suggest also the UK “could re-join the EUBrexit doesn’t work out for them”. Such attempts to poke fun at the Brits is the sort of thing you expect from a spotty teenager who hates his history class.Now that we’re unleashed from the too-big-for-its-boots EU, I expect great things from our United Kingdom. I certainly expect to continue our decent working relationship with our neighbours in the south and a realisation down there that we have Sinn Fein members in government here. President of Sinn Fein, Mary Lou McDonald says the party wants a border plebiscite by  and an all-party forum on unication to convene in the next parliament. She may start praying. Jim Allister: Our pleasure at our departure from the EU is blighted by the betrayal of Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland was swept aside in Brexit so we can only now make most of it Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Northern Ireland is part of one of the most influential countries in the world. The UK might now be ‘a small country’, according to Mr Varadkar, but the south of Ireland deserves better than to have a leader which insults and makes fun of the now unfetteredUK.Earlier in the week we were ravaged by wind and rain. I had hoped I might have a nice show of early daffodils to greet this historic first day outside the EU. I had to settle for potted hyacinth grown indoors grieving along with all my other pots of ious plants which have struggled in this extreme weather. I read Monty Don’s published gardening page every week but still I have not retrieved that gardening skill I had nurtured in my last four homes. My mother, a great gardener, will be tut-tutting in her grave. She never had any bother producing flowers out of season when someone special was expected to visit.My gardening attempts here in the house I moved to nearly three years ago have been nothing short of disaster. Maybe I should be more worried about my upcoming visit to the grandchildren living in Europe. Since I never gave in to signing up for an Irish passport to aid my visits to Europe I may, of course, be left at the end of the queue clinging to my British passport. I will grin and bear it. Freedom always has a price.try catch  TrendingAlastair Stewart tweet: Julia Nightingale pays tribute to ITV news presenter forced to step down after social media error of judgementNI snow alert: Heavy snowfall expected overnight - temperature to feel a bitterly cold -degCNI snow  ice alert: Hour-by-hour NI weather forecast for duration of Met Office yellow status weather warningStephen Nolan challenges everyone to join him in weight loss challenge afterdisappointment of putting weight back on remains profoundMan stabbed in face - PSNI deny tongue cut from mouth after gruesome image appears on social media        v.. -  applyImgSrcs\" i sb  for   sb* sb u  o.dataset.srcu  u.replaceo.setAttributeo.setAttributedocumentwindowapplyImgSrcs JP  JP  JP  \"NA-BELFNEWS-\"JP  \"Opinion\"      Follow Us On       Explore News Sport Irish League Football Whats On Lestyle   Farming Le   More from the Belfast News Letter  Announcements Buy a Photo  Directory Jobs Homes Cars Local Guide  Public Notices  Reader Shop Must Read Read This Events   Useful Links Contact Us   Place your Ad Advertise a Job Subscribe  Readers Charter        ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

There’s the new brick house with tin roof she’s built, a massive improvement on her old home, a rudimentary, grass-roofed mud structure prone to rat infestations.Agnes Ebulet outside her new homeShe shows us her kitchen in another building, proud as punch of her two-pot Lorena stove, an innovative design which requires only a small amount of firewood and has a chimney, drawing smoke outside, a saviour for her eyes.

Rickety-looking lorries double as taxis with crowds of people clinging precariously atop a snappably-thin man transports a sofa on the back of his pushbike another has two live goats riding pillion. Images that could have been lted straight from the pages of National Geographic.Passing ramshackle towns and villages on pot-holed red-dirt roads, which turn to mud baths when it rains, we arrive at Ngora to meet Agnes, who is part of the Aingang Eidunyet Women’s group - the name translates as ‘Support your Neighbour’ and this is exactly what this collection of women are doing with the upmost wholeheartedness.The -strong group of female farmers, dressed beautully in resplendent blue dresses , welcome us effusively with singing, dancing hugs and infectious smiles. It is clear they are indebted to Self Help Africa for giving them the skills to flourish. In Uganda, women shoulder the primary responsibilities for childcare and play a central role in the agricultural sector, engaging in a myriad of ways as producers, labourers, marketers, and entrepreneurs. The Aingang Eidunyet Women’s group is just one of  collectives which Self Help Africa supports through training, education and financial assistance, for this is a region with a dark past and plenty of present challenges, not least climate change.The area is still recovering from the ravages inflicted by a brutal rebel movement, the Lord’s Resistance Army, led by Joseph Kony.In  the group sowed terror in northern Uganda, killing civilians and abducting and enslaving children to be rebel soldiers. Orangemen aim toscale Kilimanjaro Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"People fled their homes, taking refuge in squalid ‘protection camps’. Eithne McNulty, Self Help Africa NI’s overseas officer said: ‘‘People were in the camps for so many years, they were unskilled, disempowered and used to hand outs. They didn’t know how to work the land, didn’t know the boundaries of their land, didn’t know where their farms were, so they were coming back to all of that lack of structure and lack of any kind of authority.’’They were also dirt poor, many living on just p a day. The hunger season in the region can be as long as four or five months in some less fortunate communities, with March, April, May and part of June as the critical months. ‘‘It’s dry, you can’t plant anything, nothing can grow and food supplies are running short,’’ said Eithne.‘‘Our ambition is that during the hunger months people will have at least two meals a day. People are telling us that they will struggle during May and early June, the food supplies will have diminished. It’s been a bad year because of water logging, so they lost a lot of crops.’’As its name suggests, Self Help Africa is about educating people to become self sufficient. It has instigated ElumCentres - literally training centres for the group. These are hosted by one farmer in the group and they have demonstrations from Self Help Africa on how to save water, how to irrigate crops, how to grow a kitchen garden.‘‘There is no point in giving people seeds for their kitchen gardensthey don’t know what to do with them,’’ said Eithne.‘‘We spend a lot of time training the farmers on good agri-economic practices and good marketing practice. It’s about education, it’s about going in there to help build their capacity.’’Agnes has learnt so much from the charity she jokes she’s like a ‘‘schoolgirl’’.‘‘Formerly, we had lost hope, but when we came into a group, we are now very active, now we are doing things, we are very happy. It is good to share ideas with people. Now, I have everything, I have all the vegetables. I pick and cook.’’Other women in the group are eager to share their experiences and their successes.Harriet said before the formation of the group in  they were ‘‘badly off’’ in their families.‘‘Le was very dficult. This group has eased our le.’’Self Help Africa taught the women how to save their money, so that collectively, as a group, they have bought eight sheep with their savings, some have even bought cows for themselves. In the future they hope each member will each have her own sheep. Their food stores are plentul too, with a good supply of sorghumand ground nuts. Another farmer, Agwang, said: ‘‘Some of us did not have houses, some did not have any businesses for survival and some did not have mattresses, but now all the members have at least mattresses and most of the members have small-scale businessesthat we can survive on. Most of us have built houses. ‘‘Some of us can hire gardens that we can cultivate, sell the produce and get a living. Some of the crops can be retained for home consumption. We can now afford to put our children in school and plant trees.’’ Thanks to the intervention most households now also have toilets and a tap. The women have also been taught how to cook nutritious food for their families. The main crops grown in the region include sorghum, cassava, ground nuts, cow peas, sweet potatoes, maize and finger millet. All are at the mercy of climate change and pests and diseases .Denny Elliott, head, Self Help Africa NI, said: ‘‘The area will be scorched now for a few months, then the rains are meant to come, butthey don’t come and you’re trying to get ready for ploughing, there is no point opening land with the oxen we’ve given the communities,it isn’t going to rain.’’Each farming group is based on a five-committee model, which includes marketing, procurement, advocacy, monitoring and evaluation, and a village saving and loans association- which becomes a huge part of how people manage and survive.Eithne said: ‘‘The idea is that long after we are gone that structure will remain in the community and they will able to self-manage it’s almost like a mini co-operative. They appoint their own officers, they keep their own records.’’Gender-based violence is a huge problem in the region it is thought to affect one in two women. Self Help Africa has introduced a novel programme called Gender Action Learning Systemwhich aims to tackle the scourge.‘‘Self Help Africa focuses on empowering women because they are the future,’’ said Eithne.‘‘It’s been statistically and research-proven thatyou give resources to a woman, those resources will find their way inside the family household. If you give them to the man, it is much less likely that the children and the family will benefit.‘‘The GALS methodology works at the household level, with the woman and the man and together, they’ll plan what they’ll save, what they’ll borrow, how they will spend the borrowing. One of the welcome offshoots is that domestic violence is reduced because there is a much better understanding by the man of what exactly is happening within the family. It is a really powerful tool.’’The farmers I met in the Aingang Eidunyet Women’s group contend with insanely tough conditions, yet they are joyous, strong and entrepreneurial. My overriding memory is of their generosity and heartfelt gratitude. They are women planning and saving, taking charge and progressing.It was completely humbling and unbelievably inspiring to meet them. l Our Self Help Africa series continues on Monday with a visit to a group living with HIV.If you would like to donate to the charity visit their website, www.selfhelpafrica.org. try catch  TrendingAlastair Stewart tweet: Julia Nightingale pays tribute to ITV news presenter forced to step down after social media error of judgementNI snow alert: Heavy snowfall expected overnight - temperature to feel a bitterly cold -degCNI snow  ice alert: Hour-by-hour NI weather forecast for duration of Met Office yellow status weather warningStephen Nolan challenges everyone to join him in weight loss challenge afterdisappointment of putting weight back on remains profoundMan stabbed in face - PSNI deny tongue cut from mouth after gruesome image appears on social media        v.. -  applyImgSrcs\" i sb  for   sb* sb u  o.dataset.srcu  u.replaceo.setAttributeo.setAttributedocumentwindowapplyImgSrcs JP  JP  JP  \"NA-BELFNEWS-\"JP  \"People\"      Follow Us On       Explore News Sport Irish League Football Whats On Lestyle   Farming Le   More from the Belfast News Letter  Announcements Buy a Photo  Directory Jobs Homes Cars Local Guide  Public Notices  Reader Shop Must Read Read This Events   Useful Links Contact Us   Place your Ad Advertise a Job Subscribe  Readers Charter        ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"politics","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

It was Powell who monumentally overestimated his influence with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button When on  November  the treaty was signed in Hillsborough Castle, giving the Republic’s government for the first time a say in the internal affairs of Northern Ireland, Powell was stunned and bitter, denouncing Mrs Thatcher in the Commons as a Jezebel.Almost three and a half decades later, unionism again finds itself betrayed on a constitutional issue by a British Prime Minister who once boasted about his unionism.But there the comparison stops. This time unionism’s response has been radically dferent from that of Ian Paisley and Jim Molyneaux.The s attempts to boycott government, refuse to pay TV and dog licences and try to make councils ungovernable descended into farce while the street protests and ‘third force’ paramilitary organisations did more harm to unionism than they did to the Agreement.This time the DUP, which is far more dominant within unionism than the UUP was in , appears to have few ideas about how to undo damage which stems not only from a decision – Brexit – which it backed, but which comes in a period where Arlene Foster has had more power over the government than any other unionist leader since Edward Carson. While Powell believed he had the ear of the Prime Minister because of his intellect, ideological affinity with Margaret Thatcher and his deep roots in the Conservative Party, Mrs Foster relied on sheer political power for her influence.The DUP leader and many of her senior colleagues weren’t afraid to flaunt that power, humiliating Theresa May by forcing her to fly back from Brussels in December  when she was about to sign up to a deal which would involve Northern Ireland maintaining regulatory alignment with the EU in order to avoid a hard Irish border.Ultimately, Mrs May secured the insertion of a new paragraph to that key document – but even at the time it appeared to simply introduce ambiguity over whether Northern Ireland would in fact leave the EU on the same terms as the rest of the UK.But another aspect of that Joint Report was nodded through by the DUP even though its implications were remarkable.Paragraph  contained a commitment from the UK to the avoidance of a hard border and then crucially for the first time defined a ‘hard border’ as “any physical infrastructure or related checks and control”. It was a sweeping definition which went far beyond the images which the phrase ‘hard border’ would conjure up for most people – customs posts, passport control, barbed wire and soldiers.‘Dawn of a new era’ as Brexit gets doneBrexiteers at Stormont sing God Save the Queen as clock strikes  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"So sweeping was the definition that it went beyond the dictionary definition of ‘hard border’ – and also meant that the current arrangements at the border, where cameras are already in place at key locations, is a ‘hard border’, something most people would regard as absurd.That lack of attention to detail was reminiscent of Mrs Foster’s approach to RHI and on its own would have been deeply problematic.However, it was accompanied by behaviour from some of her colleagues which undermined the party’s interests.Several months earlier, in February , senior DUP figure Nelson McCausland was dismissive of the implications of his support for Brexit, saying of the post-Brexit border: “I wouldn’t care what sort of situation I face as long as I’m out of Europe”.Less than a year later,North Antrim MP Ian Paisley Jr boasted that the Joint Report – which was riddled with ambiguities and bear pits – meant that the DUP had “done over” Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.In a statement, the arch-Brexiteer accepted that the document was “imperfect”, but went on to claim that as a result of what had been agreed Northern Ireland “has not been designated some purgatorial relationship of neither being in our outside the EU but will be treated completely the same as every other component part of the UK”.With what even at the time appeared unwise bragging, he said: “Frankly, whatever efforts are made to characterise this week Leo Varadkar was done over by the EU, the UK and the DUP.”Talking bullishly about the possibility of the UK quitting the EU without a deal, the North Antrim MP said that should “put the fear of the almighty into the Republic” which would see its economy “crippled”.The absence of any humility in what Mr Paisley mistakenly believed was his moment of triumph was typical of how many in the DUP have a tendency to swagger when they think they are on top. Not all in the party exhibit this characteristic and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson was among those who overwhelmingly adopted a more measured tone, perhaps realising that the hubris of some of his colleagues had become – and remains – a strategic liability.A lack of sympathy at the DUP’s plight, extended to schadenfreude in some cases, meant that when the party had a valid concern it found few open ears. Ultimately Boris Johnson, who they enabled to become Prime Minister, came to support the UK leaving in a way which creates a trade border – the extent of which is still unclear – in the Irish Sea.He proposed that Stormont would approve that arrangement by a simple majority vote, rather than allowing both unionism and nationalism to each have a veto, as envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement. That gave the DUP the chance to argue that this was a profoundly problematic abandonment of the principle that Northern Ireland cannot operate as a majoritarian society. But, having thrown about its weight for more than two years, the party found few willing to listen to its concerns.There has been some evidence in recent weeks of the DUP softening its rhetoric and last night Arlene Foster attempted to make a conciliatory gesture by travelling to Dublin to be interviewed on The Late Late Show. But while tone can be changed to suit circumstances, the more alarming issue for some unionists will be the lack of attention to detail which has consistently marked Mrs Foster’s approach to Brexit.Having backed Brexit on a whim without even the pretence of having considered its practical implications, and in the face of warnings from other unionists that it could tear apart the Union, there is still no evidence of humility, still less contrition, from the DUP leader.But regardless of Mrs Foster’s future, the events of the last four years have wrought a legacy which will linger.The Union has been, perhaps irreversibly, undermined.And not only have soft nationalists and many centrist voters been enraged, pushing them towards Irish unity, but there has been a deep imprint left on many unionists. Overwhelmingly, they do not support Irish unity, something which shows how great the task of nationalism will be to persuade them in a future border poll.But, yet again, they have had their faithin a British government shattered. Even within the DUP, some were so stunned by Boris Johnson’s betrayal that it caused them to question the value of the Union itself.In myriad senses, Brexit has loosened the ties that bind Northern Ireland to Great Britain – and none of those responsible are yet prepared to accept their role in that.try catch  TrendingAlastair Stewart tweet: Julia Nightingale pays tribute to ITV news presenter forced to step down after social media error of judgementNI snow alert: Heavy snowfall expected overnight - temperature to feel a bitterly cold -degCNI snow  ice alert: Hour-by-hour NI weather forecast for duration of Met Office yellow status weather warningStephen Nolan challenges everyone to join him in weight loss challenge afterdisappointment of putting weight back on remains profoundMan stabbed in face - PSNI deny tongue cut from mouth after gruesome image appears on social media        v.. -  applyImgSrcs\" i sb  for   sb* sb u  o.dataset.srcu  u.replaceo.setAttributeo.setAttributedocumentwindowapplyImgSrcs JP  JP  JP  \"NA-BELFNEWS-\"JP  \"Politics\"      Follow Us On       Explore News Sport Irish League Football Whats On Lestyle   Farming Le   More from the Belfast News Letter  Announcements Buy a Photo  Directory Jobs Homes Cars Local Guide  Public Notices  Reader Shop Must Read Read This Events   Useful Links Contact Us   Place your Ad Advertise a Job Subscribe  Readers Charter        ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic and travel","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Itrsquos more crucial than ever we re-elect a Welsh Labour Government in . But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win. Keir fits the bill. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/JM.jpg","title":"were in for another busy year ahead","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Are we in, or out  By the time you’re reading this, the UK is likely to be – from a technical perspective at least – about to leave the EU, and go it alone.In the four weeks or so since the last edition of the magazine, we’ve had a strong Tory majority pushing Brexit over the line and the restoration of devolution after three years without elected officials on the Hill. As we enter a new year and decade, there’s a sense, or a hope, of ato some form of normalised business environment. Brexit isn’t what business wanted, speaking generally, but it appears it’s what we’ve got. The minutiae of trading arrangements are still not worked out. Some sectors are more content than others, but we shouldn’t forget that Northern Ireland had a previous withdrawal deal on the table – largely backed by business – little over a year ago which could have set us apart as a unique trading environment, maintaining strong links with the Republic and the wider EU marketplace. But some of those in the political sphere seemingly put their own self interest and ideology above the future of the economy, and those who live in it. Tonight, some will take to the streets in and around the heart of the UK Government to show to the world their joy – perhaps misplaced – over the exit from the EU. For some, purely from a nationalistic perspective, its a chance to satisfy all the cliches that have plagued us over the last three years or so and for others, a chance to revel in an perceived brave new world – forged and fuelled by thoughts of a rose-tinted Britain gone by, Crystal Palace, heaving smoke stacks, heavy industry and fish and chips served up in newspaper on a pebble beach. For Northern Ireland business, and many people here, much of that platonic ideal is dficult to comprehend – especially among a younger generation. You just have to look at the breakdown in demographic of voters in the last General Election to see that. For some, tonight will be a time to mourn. Leaving the largest trading bloc in the world and, for better or worse, going it alone. Regardless, tomorrow and after the transition period in less than a years time, the hard work begins in trying to re-establish trading relationships with our EU partners which would see as little friction or duty as possible. Well know in the coming months whether the new market opportunities we have been promised will materialise, how long the processes will take, and what the immediate impact of exiting the EU will be for business across the UK and Ireland.We can now welcome the fact that we now have a working government at Stormont. Our MLAs are now back in their seats, committees up-and-running, and ministers staring at burgeoning in-trays. There seems to be some form of contentment and agreement among our parties on a range of important issues, including mental health. We are, however, already seeing the odd ergence, including whether we should continue the move to devolve and reduce corporation tax here – Finance Minister Conor Murphy pushing it into the long grass, while Economy Minister Diane Dodds has suggested that it remains on the policy books as an option.It’s just one of the myriad of areas of the economy and business which need to be addressed in the coming weeks and months – including a close look at the draft rates revaluation, which has certainly got the dander up among some of our best-known hospitality businesses.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
