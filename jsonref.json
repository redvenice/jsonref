Photograph: iStockIn absolute terms our national expenditure on education looks eye-watering. Yet we seem to be making a habit of coming bottom of the OECD rankings for investment in education. Why?Whatever the importance and scale of other items on the expenditure list, the largest single item is salaries of school staff. As a profession, we teachers feel the full weight of every non-teacher’s expertise on all things pedagogical. We live with the total oxymoron of everyone claiming to know all about what we do while simultaneously demonstrating an entire arsenal of evidence that they have never ever stood in front of a class of young people.Many who have done so end up leaving teaching, proving that the fantastic holidays do not balance out the pressures and demands involved in our role. However undeniably wonderful the volume of time away from the classroom might be, those of us who are committed and delivering full value know that we have earned every moment of it.As public servants it is important that we deliver value, and that our fellow taxpayers feel they are getting good bang for their buck. The best way to get that is to look after us, to ensure that we are able to perform optimally. The open abuse the teaching profession is subjected to runs entirely counter to that.For many, when your name is already mud it’s hard to see the incentive in attempting to convert the deep-rooted doubter. It is too often entirely evident that there is no point in trying. I know numerous teachers who actively avoid saying what they do for a living until it is absolutely necessary. Interestingly, they are among the cream of the crop and have earned reputations for their excellence. They give of their best as a matter of conscience.If we have unhappy public servants, and taxpayers who are unhappy with their public servants, isn’t that better addressed than shoved under the carpet? The reality is, we as taxpayers appear slow to ask for more and better of our teachers.A number of alternative avenues seem more appealing.Astronomical feesPaying for the same service a second time elsewhere is most definitely one. Enrolments in fee-paying schools exceeded 26,200 this year, reaching an all-time high. Despite demanding fees of between €5,000 and €10,000 for day pupils, many of these schools have waiting lists. €15,000 is not unusual for five-day boarding, nor €20,000 for seven-day boarding. What makes so many so ready to pay astronomical fees for something they are entitled to courtesy of their taxes?Grinds feature further down the scale but are nonetheless big business. While I’m in no doubt that there are many effective private teachers out there, I’m in even less doubt about how many are doing more damage than good. Parents rush to suggest that they will “get her a grind”, and I usually wince at how obvious it is that they have completely missed my point.The very last thing a student who is not working hard enough needs is yet another person working hard on their behalf. Grinds are far too often well-intentioned but disempowering. Many parents are so relieved to find someone available that they do not find out enough about that person’s suitability. And the youngster getting the one-to-one assistance is not best placed to filter what they are being told.When I see evidence that a student may be being poorly served, I offer to speak to their private teacher. Only once in my career has that offer been accepted and on that occasion the person was entirely suitable. He proved himself an excellent collaborator when we liaised and worked together for our mutual student’s benefit.Regrettably, I often correct work which has clearly been dictated, and which my student has little hope of being able to reproduce and understands only minimally, if at all.When engaging a private teacher and investing additional funds in what is already available via your child’s school, it is essential to establish that person’s suitability for preparing for the specific exam your child will take. We teachers engage in a lot of training for a reason, but there is every chance that the teacher you are paying privately is not accessing that training. In that situation, there is every reason to ensure that you are getting your money’s worth. You could very well be paying someone to unhelpfully contradict what is in fact correct.Keeping schtumWhile we Irish have a reputation for staying quiet and not wanting to make a fuss, there are limits. It is one thing to go out for a meal and decide to keep quiet about being dissatisfied. Chances are, you’ll simply never return to that restaurant. To clearly see flaws in how we provide for educating our youth and yet let those flaws remain makes little sense. Isn’t this precisely the time to seek only the very best? Does it honestly make more sense to keep schtum and throw good money after bad? Or worse still, bad money after bad?It is time we established an inclusive forum for open and courageous exchange around how Ireland could “do” education better. These days mental health, wellbeing and leadership are increasingly linked to growth and learning, which is what our young people are at school for. In the interest of serving them better, that forum would do well to conduct a thorough audit of what we are currently doing and explore ways to improve both what we offer and how we rank in terms of education."},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"first full programme of st patrick s day ministerial visits since before pandemic","story":"Ministers will travel all over the world again for St Patrick’s Day.

project","story":"The Duchess of Cambridge made fruit kebabs and accepted pretend cups of tea from toddlers, as she spoke of the vital importance of play to building healthy children.The Duchess, who spent time with mothers and toddlers at PACT (Parents and Communities Together) in Southwark today, said she wished she had been able to attend a similar group when she was expecting her first child, admitting she would have “learned a lot”.Helping young children chop and eat fruit to the soundtrack of a catchy song about bananas, she spoke to parents about the importance of a “holistic” system to ensure isolated new mothers and their babies do not “fall through the cracks”.Hearing how PACT runs “Parent University” courses for expectant parents and those with newborn babies, the Duchess heard how mothers were learning about social and emotional development as well as the basics about labour and feeding.“Do you feel there’s enough awareness and understanding around social and emotional development among under 5s?” she asked Josephine Namusisi-Riley, who leads PACT in Southwark.“There’s perhaps more about what they’re eating and what parents are doing about physical milestones?”Josephine and health visitor Simonette Guerra described how the course dealt with the importance of the early years, including brain and language development and play.“As a new mum I would have liked that,” said the Duchess. I think I would have learned a lot.“The importance of play!“What’s so fantastic is seeing the amazing work that’s going on here. That support you’re providing is amazing. The science backs it up.”The Duchess has made a lifelong commitment to working in Early Years Development, reading academic literature that underlines the importance of play as well as closely following new research.Hearing how some new parents worry about their children being “naughty” despite them behaving in a developmentally-appropriate way for toddlers, she agreed: “Behaviour is communication.“Throwing things is all about learning.”She arrived at St Michael’s Church in Camberwell on Tuesday morning, walking around the corner for a low-key greeting while the usual royal police escort parked discreetly out of sight.The mothers taking part in the weekly play session had not been told of their VIP guest until they arrived at the session with their babies that morning.The Duchess was greeted by Josephine Namusisi-Riley, who leads PACT in Southwark, and Mena Amnour, parent organiser of MumSpace, who told her about the group.PACT was set up by Citizens UK in 2014, after local mothers signalled the need for a real-life group to make new friends and receive support.In the pandemic, it provided emergency help to isolated families from giving out laptops to help those who were homeschooling to food parcels, training in how to order prescriptions online, and a regular Zoom meeting for parents to socialise.Josephine told the Duchess they had noticed the particular difficulties of “digital exclusion”, where families with multiple children were trying to work and home school with one laptop between them, did not have Wi Fi connections, and did not speak good enough English to find help.She also told of the numerous barriers local parents faced in reaching support, including stigma, fear of approaching official services or even registering with a GP.“Has the conversation changed since the pandemic?” the Duchess asked, guessing: “It’s exacerbated everything.”“Feeling connected to each other as humans and being able to listen to each other helps with the isolation.“Where families go to find a holistic support system.“So much we say is mental health is having someone to talk to and listen.”She added: “For the child’s journey, being able to link up health with then education, through the community programmes and services like this, is really vital.”Hearing about the baby bank of clothes for struggling families, the Duchess asked: “For the parents and families who come here, are their needs related to food and clothing for the children, as opposed to emotional needs?”She heard how parents usually came with a physical need, before being welcomed with a hug, a cup of tea and a listening ear.The Duchess was invited to join a small group of toddlers and their carers, who were making fruit kebabs for fun and a lesson in healthy eating.The Duchess helped one little boy, Jonathan - who was wearing a smart shirt as he celebrated his second birthday - chop up his banana.His grandmother Grace told her that the sessions were “a lot of children and many, many toys - it’s find to be here”.“Has it helped your relationship with him?” the Duchess asked, breaking off to say “Good job!” to the little boy who was eating nicely.Going to shake the hand of another mother, she laughed “Sorry, now I’ve got a sticky hand” before pulling a face of amazement at one-year-old Zoe who was busy eating strawberries.“I can see why everyone likes it here,” the Duchess said.Later, she joined the main room where new mothers were socialising as they fed their newborns, while volunteers played with older babies and toddlers so their parents had a moment to talk.The Duchess watched children climbing up a frame to go down a slide, and accepted a make-believe ‘cup of tea’, actually full of kinetic sand, from a little boy called George - the same name as her own eldest son.Playing along, she took her mask off for a pretend sip before saying thank you and passing it back to him.The Duchess spent time with Laura Barber, mother of two-year-old Rebecca, who talked about mental health and the challenges of parenting in isolation.“She said if she had had something like this, she would have appreciated it too,” Ms Barber added.Before leaving, the Duchess told staff and volunteers, many of whom arrived at the group as new mothers themselves: “Thank you for your hard work, it’s really impressive. It’s such good fun, I want to go back in there!”Of her work in early childhood development, and making generational change for the children of the future, she added: “It’s going to take a long time, joining the dots. It’s not a quick thing.”Early evidence from a study by King’s College in 2020 suggested that the model used by PACT improves parental mental wellbeing, reduces social isolation, and improves child language outcomes.They found that 40 per cent of the mothers who came to the Mumspace group were at the threshold of getting some form of mental health intervention, with 68 per cent of those assessed as fully recovering within six months.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Row erupts over Cabinet reshuffle as Boris Johnson seeks to reset No 10Farmers told to make countryside more accessible by replacing stiles with gatesThe Tory MPs who have publicly submitted letters of no confidence in Boris JohnsonDonald Trump \u0026#39makes $20m\u0026#39 on coffee table book containing put-downs of his enemiesRussia-Ukraine latest: Emmanuel Macron hails Minsk breakthrough as Moscow and Kyiv agree to talksWes Streeting goes too far... and Sajid Javid cuts him down to sizeMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"must end reliance chinese cctv cameras","story":"How would it feel to know that when you are walking down the street you are being watched by the same cameras that support the Chinese surveillance state? For many in Britain, this is not hypothetical. Hundreds of thousands of cameras made by Hikvision and Dahua, whose equipment have been linked to the persecution of Uyghur Muslims, make up the backbone of Britain’s CCTV infrastructure.Last year the US government blacklisted the two companies over national security concerns, but here in Britain the Government failed to heed calls from the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee to follow suit. The dominance of Hikvision and Dahua in Britain puts the country’s security, privacy and moral standing in the world at risk.Big Brother Watch has found that thousands of public bodies, and some of the UK’s biggest businesses, use these CCP-linked cameras. Three quarters of local councils are equipped with Hikvision or Dahua cameras, as are more than half of schools and universities and a handful of government departments.Although doing nothing illegal, both companies offer much more than video recording. In Xinjiang, they have developed technology that was once the stuff of a science fiction nightmare and tailored it to the all-encompassing mass surveillance state – from facial recognition on every street corner to cameras sending “Uyghur alerts” to the authorities.Similar tools are on offer in Britain. Some schools have CCTV capable of face or gender detection and the coronavirus pandemic has led to a spike in temperature-scanning camera sales. One school in Yorkshire has much more advanced Hikvision technology, capable of searching CCTV footage by clothing colour, tracking people and even using AI to detect schoolyard scraps or if children are wearing face masks.We are already one of the most heavily monitored populations on the planet. Now, low-cost CCTV cameras are stationed across the country, with Hikvision and Dahua’s pile ‘em high, sell ‘em cheap business models fuelling a boom in high tech surveillance cameras on the side of every other building. For little more than £100, it is possible to buy a camera powered by algorithms that claim to analyse our behaviour, vehicles, and much more.People should be free to go about their daily lives without being watched by such cameras. Britain must push back on the creeping growth of Chinese-style surveillance and do more to protect against backsliding into a world where privacy is a mere afterthought.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Row erupts over Cabinet reshuffle as Boris Johnson seeks to reset No 10Farmers told to make countryside more accessible by replacing stiles with gatesThe Tory MPs who have publicly submitted letters of no confidence in Boris JohnsonDonald Trump \u0026#39makes $20m\u0026#39 on coffee table book containing put-downs of his enemiesRussia-Ukraine latest: Emmanuel Macron hails Minsk breakthrough as Moscow and Kyiv agree to talksWes Streeting goes too far... and Sajid Javid cuts him down to sizeMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"wagatha christie case rebekah vardys aide says leaked coleen","story":"Rebekah Vardy’s aide claimed “it was me” who leaked a story about Coleen Rooney to the press, in a series of text messages, the High Court has heard.In the latest round of the “Wagatha Christie” legal battle between the two footballers’ wives, the court was shown text messages between Mrs Vardy and her PR adviser Caroline Watt.According to Mrs Rooney’s written case, messages exchanged between Mrs Vardy and Ms Watt in January 2019 involve the pair discussing a post on Mrs Rooney’s private Instagram account which showed where her car had been damaged.Mrs Vardy told Ms Watt she “would love to leak those stories x”.In January 2019, Mrs Rooney posted on Twitter that one of her Instagram followers, who she had trusted to have access to her private account, was selling stories about her.In a text exchange later that day with Mrs Vardy, Ms Watt said: “It wasn’t someone she trusted, it was me,” followed by a laughing face emoji.David Sherborne, lawyer for Mrs Rooney, told the court on Tuesday: “What we say is that the inference to be drawn from that is that Mrs Vardy knew perfectly well what she was doing, and was behind it and was encouraging it.”The row between the two celebrities started in October 2019, when Mrs Rooney took to social media accusing Mrs Vardy of leaking stories about her private life after carrying out a months-long “sting operation” which became known as “Wagatha Christie”.The wife of former England star Wayne Rooney claimed Mrs Vardy had shared fake stories she had posted on her personal Instagram account with The Sun newspaper.Mrs Vardy, who is married to Leicester City striker Jamie, denies the accusations and is suing Mrs Rooney for libel.Mr Sherborne said Mrs Vardy and her agent Ms Watt were “routinely” looking at Mrs Rooney’s private Instagram stories with a view to having them published.He also said: “Mrs Vardy encouraged her to do this, she knew it was happening. The lack of criticism, let alone surprise, shows it was agreed between Mrs Vardy and Ms Watt.”The barrister told the High Court that Mrs Rooney was making a claim for further information to be disclosed.He added Ms Watt’s phone had fallen into the North Sea after a boat she was on was rocked by a wave.“(It was) most unfortunate, because it was only a short time after the court ordered that the phone should be specifically searched,” he said.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Row erupts over Cabinet reshuffle as Boris Johnson seeks to reset No 10Farmers told to make countryside more accessible by replacing stiles with gatesThe Tory MPs who have publicly submitted letters of no confidence in Boris JohnsonDonald Trump \u0026#39makes $20m\u0026#39 on coffee table book containing put-downs of his enemiesRussia-Ukraine latest: Emmanuel Macron hails Minsk breakthrough as Moscow and Kyiv agree to talksWes Streeting goes too far... and Sajid Javid cuts him down to sizeMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"boris rishi need good neighbours","story":"Neighbours, everybody needs good neighbours... but the Boris and Rishi fairytale is going to end in tearsDowning Street has found the perfect blend of bluster and billionaire, says Fleet Street Fox.

No-one knows what to call something worse than a crisis, but the dictionary will probably need updating to include something like crisaster.The second is the energy crisis, in which the taxpayer has been forced to compensate corporate giants for not being able to steal money immediately, and instead letting them steal it over  years.

It might work in an Australian daytime soap, but it ainapost going to last in a world where people donapost come back from the dead after  years lost at sea. Johnson thinks heaposs saved his skin by ceding control to his most ambitious enemy, and boasts it would now take a Panzer ision to get him out of No. Sunak, meanwhile, is quietly lining up his tanks in the Downing Street garden, which he has always had a great view of from his No office. The PM is being infantilised by enemies saying his we wields all the power, and potentially criminalised by his friends claiming that she has nothing to do with his work, but nevertheless attended a lot of work events.And the only PR expert who can be persuaded to enter the fray is someone who considers the PM sexually incontinent, throws Benny Hill salutes at world leaders, quotes Gloria Gaynor, and on his first day gives the press the headline: Heaposs not a COMPLETE clown. But the fundamental flaw with this great reset, which is probably more of a breather to allow Rishi to liquidate assets, is that it involves trying to instil discipline in a man who has spent a letime shucking it. The fact he needs to be taught the self-control of a toddler is why he lives in Errorsborough - a town twinned with Débâcle.Fans may think these two have found the perfect blend of bluster and billionaire, but itaposll last only as long as it takes for Johnson to take back being out-of-control, and Sunak deciding that his tanks are ready to evict.

The majority of British nationals see their pension go up yearly as high as . percent, in line with average earnings or inflation under the triple lock. Even though this policy has been temporarily suspended, most will be expecting a rise this year. The Government says increases are only guaranteed for those living in the UK, the European Economic Area , Gibraltar, Switzerland and countries with a social security agreement with the UK . Mr Green and his we - who did not wish to be named - were born and lived in the UK all their lives before emigrating. Speaking to the End Frozen Pensions campaign, the pensioner said: Our pensions have been frozen for some  years. I receive £., and my we receives £..Are you affected by a pension freeze  Let us know at webnews@mirror This, I believe, is immoral. If we had chosen to live in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo or Turkey, or indeed  other countries with which the UK has a bilateral or reciprocal arrangement, our pensions would not have been frozen. Mr Green appeared to accept the idea the UK Government will not pay backdated pensions to impacted expats across the globe. However, he added: But they could start paying the full and entitled pensions from now. Today. Since leaving their home shores, Mr Green and his we have ed annually for two months. But Mr Green highlighted their pensions undergo a temporary change when they reach Britain. He continued: “During that stay, we received an increased entitlement to our pensions.  “So on Monday, when I set off, my pension is frozen in Australia. On Tuesday, when I arrive, my pension is thawed. “What does it matter where I am ” Mr Green is keen to highlight the issue which is thought to affect hundreds of thousands of people across the world. He concluded by urging the government to take action, and said: “I paraphrase the words from Sir Henry Newbolt’s splendid poem: Vitai Lampada. “Government - pay up! Pay up! And play the game.” A DWP spokesperson previously said: “We understand that people move abroad for many reasons and that this can impact on their finances. “There is information on GOV.UK about what the effect of going abroad will be on entitlement to the UK state pension. “The Government’s policy on the up-rating of the UK state pension for recipients living overseas is a longstanding one of more than  years and we continue to uprate state pensions overseas where there is a legal requirement to do so.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Department for Work and PensionsFrozenState pension\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The current Housing Minister, Chris Pincher, was shunted aside. Until now heaposd been the longest-serving Housing Minister for more than a decade, with two yearsapos service. Housing campaigners have previously reacted with dismay at the constant churn of dferent ministers while England faces a housing crisis.Mr Andrew faces a bitter battle with the Tory grassroots as he and Housing Secretary Michael Gove rework controversial plans to tear up the planning system. Mr Gove shelved the plans to split areas into development loans and theyaposre being examined again.He will be in charge of meeting the target to build , homes a year. A post on Mr Andrewaposs website declares Save Our Greenbelt, opposing a plan for , houses in the next  years in and around Leeds.

The amendment to the Housing and Planning Bill was voted down - on  January  in a major row. Tory ministers said the amendment would cause unnecessary regulation and cost to landlords, and councils already have strong and effective powers to police poor-quality homes. Minister Marcus Jones said at the time that it would deter further investment and push up rents for tenants. Of course we believe that all homes should be of a decent standard, and that all tenants should have a safe place in which to live regardless of tenure. But local authorities already have strong and effective powers to deal with poor quality and unsafe accommodation, and we expect them to use them. But Labouraposs Teresa Pearce said at the time: Although it is true that the majority of properties are safe and fit to live in, it is unacceptable that, in , we still have people up and down the country living in properties unfit for human habitation. This clause would change the lives of many tenants and provide a more robust, secure and safe private rented sector, which surely we all desire.  It later emerged  of the Tory MPs who voted down the amendment were also landlords. Pudsey MP Mr Andrew owns a house in nearby Leeds which brings in more than £, a year in rental income.It comes after Jacob Rees Mogg was sacked as Commons leader and made Brexit minister as Boris Johnson launched a mini-reshuffle to distract from weeks of Tory chaos and scandal.The Prime Minister is reshaping his top team after being deserted by a series of No aides and the Met Police launching an investigation into  rule-busting parties in Downing Street during lockdown. Arch-Eurosceptic Mr Rees-Moggaposs full title will be Minister for Brexit Opportunities and Government Efficiencies and he will be a member of Cabinet. Meanwhile, Chief Whip Mark Spencer replaces Mr Rees Mogg as Commons leader and Tory MP Chris Heaton-Harris will head the whips office. Mr Spencer has kept his seat at the Cabinet table, however, despite weeks of criticism over the top Toryaposs handling of the Owen Paterson lobbying row.

Heres everything you need to knowThe DVSA has proposed six changes to driving tests Image: Getty Images iStockphotoBySurena ChandeSEO Editor:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsPreparing for driving tests can be daunting, with Highway Code revision to cram into your brain and hopes of a smooth run when out for the test itself. After a range of new Highway Code changes were enforced on January , , it seems budding drivers will have to brush up on their knowledge of the rules. And, with the pandemic causing chaos for driving test and theory test bookings, it seems there could be more trouble ahead for those looking to pass their test and get behind the wheel. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency DVSAhas proposed a range of changes to driving tests due to demand being at the highest it has aposever knownapos. Due to the scarcity of test slots, it has caused many learner drivers to book in tests far earlier than they are ready for.So, here are all of the DVSAaposs proposed changes for driving tests that could be enforced in just months. What are the DVSAaposs six proposals for driving test changes in   . Ensuring learner drivers are prepared for their driving test  Perhaps the most crucial element for budding drivers is that being prepared for your upcoming driving test is more vital than ever. The proposal suggests extending the amount of time you will need to wait before rebooking a car driving test, after failing one, to  days — you currently need to wait just  days.This move is also being pushed to allow for more training time to prevent retakes from being done with no further training. The DVSA states that, due to long waiting lists for lessons, slotting in time for extra training is tricky for driving instructors.With the proposed -day extension, there is a greater window of opportunity for learner drivers to take top-up lessons so they are better prepared for the car driving test.  This change would apply solely to car driving tests. The following would not be affected by this:other types of driving tests, such as motorcycle tests, heavy goods vehicleand bus driving tests theory tests approved driving instructortests. Forcing learners to give more notice for car driving test cancellations Finding time for a driving test booking can be tricky due to shortages of slots, and all sorts of surprises can crop up in day-to-day le leading to test cancellations. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that , driving tests were cancelled between April , , and December , , alone. The new proposal suggests forcing learner drivers to give  days of notice when cancelling their car driving test to avoid losing their fee. They currently only need to give three days of notice when cancelling a car driving test.  This would not be enforced for reasons like bereavement, illness and other circumstances decided by the DVSA. The change would allow for fewer driving test slots being wasted, and therefore it could potentially lead to a higher volume of tests being available to book. When the fee loss policy was temporarily lted during the pandemic, the DVSA found that there was an increase in tests being cancelled at the last minute. This reduced signicantly upon the fee loss police being reintroduced for short notice period cancellations. . Identying data surrounding how well driving instructors prepare learner drivers  The DVSA has proposed a method to easily identy which driving instructors need the most help and support with providing high-quality training. It suggests introducing a legal requirement for them to display their approved driving instructoror trainee driving instructor registration certicate in the windscreen of their car when brining people to driving tests. The DVSA explained the reasoning behind this, and said it would:encourage driving instructors to only bring people for their driving testthey’re confident they will pass help us improve our ability to identy and prioritise which driving instructors most need help and support to provide high-quality training mean that we can treat all driving instructors bringing pupils for tests consistentlyCurrently, driving instructors are only legally required to do this when carrying out driving lessons, but not for driving tests. However, many do so voluntarily.  If enforced, DVSA driving examiners would record the instructoraposs personal reference number and the test results can then be linked back to them. This would then allow the DVSA to identythe driving instructor needed a standards check. The proposal could mean that driving instructors who refuse to display the certicate could lose the approval to teach. It would also help the DVSA to identy and remove instructors from the register who are not offering high-quality training. . Offer more information about driving instructors to learners  While learner drivers can currently see the name, phone number, email address and distance of the driving instructor, the DVSA is pushing for more transparency. The proposed changes are displaying the following information deduced from a rolling -month period:average number of driving faults their pupils make per test average number of serious faults their pupils make per test percentage of the driving instructors’ pupils tests where the driving examiner had to take physical action in the interests of public safety overall pass rate for the driving instructors’ pupils. Changes to learner driver eyesight checks during driving tests  The DVSA has suggested a change in the law surrounding driver eyesight checks during driving tests, with the ability to do eyesight checks in dferent levels of light and use ious methods to test eyesight. At present, the law only allows for eyesight checks in good daylight and the test involves reading a registration plate on a parked vehicle up to  metres away. The changes would apply to car, motorcycle, tractor, specialist vehicle and approved driving instructorand part driving tests.  The move would allow for more flexibility for driving test times offered, and to ensure drivers meet eyesight standards under a range of conditions. Additionally, it would prevent test cancellations when there is poor light. . Swapping paper pass certicates for digital pass certicates The DVSA has proposed paper pass certicates for driving and theory tests should be swapped for digital versions. If passed, this will apply to all driving tests and would be in-line with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agencyefforts to create a digital driving licence.  The move would not only prevent people from losing physical copies, but it is also likely to help the environment with a lack of need for over two million sheets of paper printed annually. Why are the driving test changes being proposed by the DVSA and when would they be enforced  The DVSA has proposed these six driving test changes due to a a range of factors, but it is predominantly due to a vast increase in demand for driving tests. The website states additional reasoning for the change proposals, with the hopes that they will:encourage learner drivers to be better prepared for their driving test help to reduce the number of driving test appointments that are wasted give us more flexibility in how and when we can carry out driving testsWhen will the DVSA driving test changes be decided and how can I have my say The DVSA encourages people across the UK to have their say about the driving test changes on its website.The consultation vegan on January , , and will close at .pm on March , . Following the responses, the next steps will be decided and published within three months of the consultation closing, so by June , .

Kate joined families at the activity and wellbeing session run by PACTat MumSpace in Southwark today. Kate, a champion of research into early childhood, heard about the challenges faced as she joined in with a cooking workshop during the visit. She helped young children chop and eat fruit to the soundtrack of a catchy song about bananas.Have your say on the latest royal developments in the comment section She spoke to parents about the importance of a “holistic” system to ensure isolated new mothers and their babies do not “fall through the cracks”. Hearing how PACT runs “Parent University” courses for expectant parents and those with newborn babies, the duchess heard how mothers were learning about social and emotional development as well as the basics about labour and feeding. Josephine Namusisi-Riley, who leads PACT in Southwark, and health visitor Simonette Guerra described how the course dealt with the importance of the early years, including brain and language development and play. “As a new mum I would have liked that,” the Duchess said. “I think I would have learned a lot. The importance of play.”  She added: “What’s so fantastic is seeing the amazing work that’s going on here. That support you’re providing is amazing.

His grandmother Grace told her that the sessions featured “a lot of children and many, many toys”. “Has it helped your relationship with him ” Kate asked, breaking off to say “Good job” to the youngster who was eating nicely.  Going to shake the hand of one mother, she laughed: “Sorry, now I’ve got a sticky hand,” before pulling a face of amazement at Zoe, a nearby one-year-old, who was busy eating strawberries. “I can see why everyone likes it here,” Kate added. Kate watched children climbing up a frame to go down a slide, and accepted a ‘cup of tea’, full of kinetic sand, from a boy called George – the same name as her eldest.

Jack McDonough watched keenly when workers from Cadent Gas and BCH Civils were working outside his house in the Childwall area of Liverpool. Having brought out cups of tea and chatting to engineers Simon, Dave, Ian, Andy and James while he was on his way to and from nursery, the three-year old was rewarded with his own hard hat, high vis jacket and his first ever pay packet.Jackaposs mum Steph told Liverpool Echo : He just loves anything and everything to do with construction so, on the way to and from nursery every day, he went to say hello to them and they would say hello back.He was just in heaven and the fact that they were so kind to him - we stood on our wall and just watched them dig for about an hour - they were just talking to him every day. They would involve him and talk to him - they were just really kind, asking him about his day at nursery. We gave him some cups of tea and biscuits to take out when they were working outside ours because they were so kind to him.Jackaposs involvement and interest in their work paid idends. Steph added: One day as we were walking down to nursery, one of the engineers said that he would come and knock on later because they had a gt for him. It was a little hard hat, a gt bag, a little high vis jacket and a wage packet with £ in for him to say thank you for being so helpful. It was just lovely - it absolutely made his day. They had been so kind to him the whole time but that was above and beyond. Compensated for his labour and with his interest in construction bolstered further, Jack still keeps an eye out for his colleagues, who Steph said left a lasting impact on him. She added: Now whenever he sees anyone in an outfit that’s sort of similar, he’ll say ‘there’s my friends’. Though he has not yet started primary school, Steph says Jackaposs heart is set on a career in engineering. She added: Whenever we take him out and there are roadworks, he makes us drive the way of the roadworks so that he can watch them. He absolutely loves it. Our house is full of construction-related toys. He’s got a ride-on excavator that he goes out and ‘digs’ with, so to have them outside our house was amazing.Jenny Moten, North West Network Director, Cadent, said: “This all went a bit under the radar - the team didn’t go looking for any praise, they just wanted to make Jack’s day. So it was lovely to hear Jack’s parents speak so highly of them. Let’s hope we can maintain Jack’s interest and have him a fully-fledged member of the team in years to come.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HousingPeople\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Leonnie Shinells and Jamie Scott from Hull knew they faced tough challenges ahead.But within weeks of daughter Madison arriving, the cost of living crisis had already hit home. Jamieaposs working hours in retail were suddenly cut so much the pair turned off their heating so they had enough money to eat and feed their baby.Jamie, , said: I know there’s talk at the moment between people having to choose between heating and eating and we’ve literally been in that situation recently. Itaposs not a choice any new parents wants to have to make. Are you struggling with the cost of living crisis  Email webnews@mirror to tell your storyI work in retail and my hours were cut, so we decided to go without heating. Leonnie, , and Jamie say there is little comfort in the Governmentaposs promises of a -year plan to level up the North and give -week-old Madison the same opportunities as a child born in the relative comfort of the south.Their story was highlighted by Hull Live in the newspaperaposs shocking coverage on the cost of living crisis.A photo of little Maddison featured on the front page with the headline: Donapost Leave Us Behind.

The Bransholme area in Hull is on paper an area which will benefit from the Government promises delivered by Mr Gove last week to level up some of the Northaposs most deprived towns and cities within the next decade. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said the plans heralded the beginning of the end of decades of deprived areas being forgotten and left behind. The plans, spearheaded by Secretary of State Gove, promises more powers for local areas, better public transport, greater investment and an end to illiteracy and innumeracy.  Levelling up promises to improve parts of the North such as Bransholme, one of the most deprived parts of Hull according to the Index of Multiple Deprivation . The IMD, which scores areas based on education, health, housing, crime, employment, their living environment and access to services, ranks Hull itself as among the most deprived cities in England. In contrast, Office for National Statisticsfigures which compare dferent places on a range of measures exposes the gulf between Hull and Mr Goveaposs southern constituency Surrey Heath. The IMD shows that Madison and other Hull newborns will grow up in a city with the th highest levels of income deprivation affecting children. A baby born in Surrey Heath meanwhile would live in an area which ranks th on the same measure. The Government has promised to close the gap by , but Jamie and Leonnie do not have the luxury of years when it comes to raising Madison. They said they already felt they had been left to bring up their baby daughter on their own, with worries about work, housing and education a part of daily le.For both Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Levelling Up Secretary Mr Gove, their plans for people like Jamie and Leonnie should give them hope.The prime minister said: It is the most comprehensive, ambitious plan of its kind that this country has ever seen and it will ensure that the government continues to rise to the challenge and deliver for the people of the UK. Mr Gove said: Levelling Up and this White Paper is about ending this historic injustice and calling time on the postcode lottery.

NHS Grampian has confirmed that  out-of-date Covid vaccinations were administered in Stonehavenaposs town hall on  February.Those who were affected by the botch are now being contacted directly by the health service.

We are offering re-vaccinationthose affected want this. We are contacting them directly to apologise and to offer them this, according to their personal circumstances. We would like to take this opportunity to apologise publicly for any distress or inconvenience. This comes as Professor Sir Chris Whitty has written to unvaccinated NHS staff telling them it is their professional responsibility to get vaccinated. The chief medical officer for England tweeted out the letter on Tuesday, saying: I have written to NHS colleagues about the professional responsibility to protect patients from Covid-. This includes getting vaccinated, as the great majority have. It has also been signed by chief midwery officer Professor Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent, chief nursing officer Ruth May, and NHS medical director Professor Stephen Powis, among others.Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the Commons last month that ministers plan to scrap a legal requirement for frontline NHS staff in England to be vaccinated against Covid. He said ending the policy, which also affects social care staff, is now under consultation in light of the Omicron iant, which is less severe than the Delta iant.In the letter, Sir Chris and others say that professional responsibility and legal mandate are separate things, adding: Our professional responsibility is to get the Covid- vaccines as recommended, to protect our patients. At the same time, the vaccine protects us. The great majority of healthcare workers have already done so. We hope that those of you who have not will consider doing so now.

The young boy suffered fractures and was saved thanks to two blood transfusionsCharlie Golden pictured in hospital after the car collisionByMartin BagotHealth and Science editor:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |comments The family of an -year-old lad who miraculously survived a horror car collision have told how heroic blood donors saved his le.Charlie Golden was crossing the road outside his home when he was knocked down by the car. The ferocious impact tore off the youngster’s scalp and left him with his pelvis fractured in four places. Medics had to hold his head for five hours because they couldn’t stop the bleeding. Two blood transfusions eventually saw him pull through. His mum, Lauren, explained the then eight-year-old Charlie was leaving their house in Aylesham, near Canterbury, Kent, on his way to show friends a shortcut to a local park. “His dad Paul called out to Charlie to be careful on the road, like he always did, and watched them cross from the window,” she told the Mirror.  “That’s when he saw the car hit our boy, right outside the front door. “He just shouted, ‘He’s been hit’, and ran out of the door. “Paul and a neighbour basically held his head together and started to stem the bleeding.” Charlie’s injuries were so severe he was put into a coma on the roadside before being airlted to King’s College Hospital, in London. He remained in a critical condition for  hours while two blood motorbikes sped extra blood to the hospital to keep him alive. “He would have diedthere had not been enough blood available,” said Lauren, who has since become a champion of giving blood, encouraging friends and family to become lesavers as well. “I remember lying next to Charlie in his hospital bed and really wishing that I had donated,” she said. “A few days after the accident, I put an appeal on Facebook to family and friends pleading with them to donate as I knew the generosity of others saved my little boy’s le. “Blood is one of those things you just expect to be there when you need it, but I hadn’t stopped to consider where it comes from.” As it stands the NHS is , regular blood donors short of what it needs to recover from Covid-.With stocks in England now supplied by the smallest ever pool of donors this century, the Mirror is campaigning for readers to help make up the critical shortfall.Around three quarters of a million people kept hospitals in stock at the height of the pandemic, but this was , fewer than the year before.A third of blood given goes to patients undergoing emergency surgery. A stranger’s generosity meant Charlie survived. His brain injury means he has some learning dficulties. And Lauren and husband Paul now regularly give their own blood. Lauren said: “The other day, I received a text telling me which hospital my blood has been issued to. “All I could think of were those amazing people who received that same text when their donation saved my Charlie’s le. “Without someone, somewhere, donating, he would have died.” How you can help Register as a blood donor today and play your part in the NHS recovery.

He was found to have caused or contributed to violence or disorder while at Stoke City games, and now cannot attend any football match here in the U.K or abroad. He will have to surrender his passport when England play away games and is prevented from watching England play at Wembley stadium. Jack is a huge Stoke City fan, having even tattooed aposI love Peter Crouchapos on his bum, referring to the professional footballer who played for the team between  and . He revealed that he got the tattoo while on holiday in Magaluf last year, captioning an image shared to social media with: It must be true loveI think about you when Iaposm drunk, tagging Crouch at the end. The full tattoo reads: Oopsy Daisy, Stoke are crazy, I love Peter Crouch. The former striker replied to Jackaposs post by saying: Iaposm proud of you Jack. Iaposm sure you will never regret this. The case was brought to the North Staffordshire Justice Centre by Staffordshire Policeaposs Football Policing Unit, whose evidence prompted the sentence. PC Ben Greensides, from the Football Policing Unit, said: We welcome the outcome and hope this sends a strong message that this sort of behaviour at football matches will not be tolerated. Incidents of poor behaviour will be investigated and those seeking to ruin match days for genuine supporters will face such consequences.A recent report by the BBC showed that arrests of football hooligans has risen in recent years, with the police attempt to further crack down on bad behaviour.Baroness Casey, who led a report into mass disorder at the Euro  final, called out the culture around disorder at football matches a big challenge and asked for a change in attitudes towards support behaviours.

Council worker Paula Allen had gone out looking for Marcus Simmons-Allen, , after being alerted about the impact near their family home. But she ended up being first on the accident scene and cradled the youngster in her arms as he lay fatally injured. Moments earlier Marcus, who was due to start his first day of college, had been run down at mph and left to die by Connor Matthews, , who was driving a stolen car. Despite the teenaposs mum and dadaposs efforts to revive him, Marcus succumbed to his injuries in hospital the following morning.At Manchester Crown Court, Mrs Allen who is in her s fought back tears as Matthews, from Stretford, was jailed for six years and eight months. The court heard how the motorist had no driving licence and had previously been issued with as ASBO. Mrs Allen said in a statement: aposFinding my son that night, like a bag of rubbish fly tipped at the side of the road, haunts me. aposaposI was the first person at Marcusaposs side, holding him, trying to find his pulse. His leless body, my son dying in my arms. Time stood still. My precious son was going, fading. I found myself running into the road, stopping the traffic and screaming, pleading for anyone to help, for anyone to save him. aposaposI knew he was in a bad way, really bad. As mothers we are there to love, mend, fix, provide and advise. I was now helpless trying to save my sons le.  Emergency services and strangers were fighting to keep Marcus alive. As the short hours passed, we had to accept that Marcus could not and would not ever survive. The tragedy occurred on October  last year after Marcus had popped out to buy a pint of milk with his friend Connor Kelly. Both checked for oncoming cars as they were about to cross a dual carriageway but as they set off, Matthews who was on his way to a party suddenly appeared in a VW Scirocco driving at high speed. Marcus attempted to jog across the road in an attempt to get to the other side but had barely got two paces when he was hit by the vehicle. Prosecutor David Lees said: aposaposHe was hit by the car and flung through the air landing some distance away. Matthews then slowed before driving off again.  Connor Kelly called out to a pedestrian to call the police then decided to run back to Marcusapos house to tell Ms Allen. He then ran back to the scene and stayed with his friend until the paramedics arrived. aposMs Allen recalled how she had just got into her car when she saw Connor in a state of panic, the court heard. He shouted aposcome quick, come quick it was Marcusapos and she drive off looking for her son, it was said. Mr Lees continued: aposaposShe could not see anything initially so turned the car around. It was then that she could see something that she initially thought was a bag of fly tipped rubbish on the road. To her horror she then realised that it was her son.aposapos  In her statement read to the court Mrs Allen told how she pulled up just before where Marcus was laying and put on her hazard lights. I think I shouted at Connor who had gone to the floor in horror upon arriving on foot to where Marcus lay, she said. aposaposHe was lying face down on the pavement approximately . metres from the lamp posts down from the crossing area where Marcus got hit by the car. I screamed at Connor to ring an ambulance and the police. The mum checked Marcusaposs body to seehe was responsive and noticed a gaping wound on his right eyebrow and his right eye was swollen, she said. She discovered a pulse and reassured her son including in the ambulance.  Marcus was described by his family as aposaposvery loving and joyousaposapos person who had been working towards his degree in engineering. aposUnfortunately the day he sadly passed away was supposed to be his first day at college, his mum added. His death has ripped our family apart. My son left the house to walk with his friend and never ed home. aposaposThe point of physical impact that caused Marcusaposs death is visible from my driveway, just a short  meters from our property. aposaposWe as a family are unable to leave our home to complete everyday tasks such as, buying bread and milk, leaving to attend work, doing the school run and other general errands without the reminder and the flashbacks of that horric night in which our lives changed forever.  aposaposSince the incident, Mrs Allen said the family have had to find another way around the estate because they cannot bear to drive past the site where flowers still lay at the roadside. The VW was found dumped a mile away and inquiries revealed it has been stolen from a house in Oldham the previous month. Matthews was arrested at a house in Liverpool five days later. He admitted knocking down Marcus before aposapospanickingaposapos and driving off. The court heard Matthews had  previous offences on his record including robbery, criminal damage and possessing cannabis and had been issued with an ASBO which he repeatedly ignored. He was banned from driving in  for driving without insurance or a license. In mitigation his lawyer Dominic Thomas said: aposaposThe defendant is profoundly sorry and he always will be for what he has done. It has been a deeply harrowing experience for Marcusapos family and there is no possibility of putting any of that right. He knows it will always be profoundly unfair he is here when Marcus is not.aposapos  Sentencing Matthews, Judge Hilary Manley told him: aposaposMarcus was just starting to find his feet in adult le and you took that le and all the promise and hope of his future from him. You have never held a driving licence, but that clearly hasn’t held you back from driving when you feel like it and it didn’t stop you from making the clear decision to get behind the wheel of a powerful, stolen vehicle and to casually treat it as your own, driving to a party, and thereafter, giving a lt to a friend. aposaposYou were travelling very rapidly and struck Marcus with force. I you had not been driving when you were not permitted to drive, and at such a grossly excessive speed, he would be alive today. aposaposMarcus’s mother had to find him where he had been flung, on the road, alone, looking like a discarded bag of garbage that had been fly-tipped. aposaposBy making yourself scarce, you have ensured that the police have not been able to establish whether or not you had been drinking or taking drugs at the party you attended before getting behind the wheel.aposapos aposaposMarcusapos brutal and untimely death has robbed him of his future. You have a young child but he will never know what it is to be a parent. You can look to a future that will start up again upon your release, when you are still only in your mid-twenties. He has no future and his family have nothing to look forward to which will not bring with it the searing ache of his absence.aposapos Matthews was also banned from driving for five years which will start when he is freed.

Joan Constantine, , had posted on a group called “We grew up in Salford” askinganybody knew of her father, Jim Harris, whom she had never met.Jean recognised the name and details, and quickly realised that Joan was her long lost half-sister that her father had in a previous marriage. The pair only knew rumours of each other’s existence.Have you got an incredible reunion story to tell  Email webnews@mirror Mother-of-two Jean had thought she was an only child after her older brother David, died when she was . Her dad, Jim Harris, was drove tanks during WW, and eventually became a bus driver in Salford until he passed away in  aged . While on a family holiday he told Jean, then , that he had been married before and had a daughter who was ten years older than her. Jean says that was all his father or mother Annie ever said about the situation, and she was hesitant to ask more after realising it was a contentious topic. Jean said: “He just came out with it one day and that was basically it, he wouldn’t really talk about it much, and I got more information off my mum that he wasn’t allowed to see his daughter. “I just became aware at the age of  that this woman existed, normally I’d be really happy to find out I had a sister, but there was something about this story that I knew I couldn’t go looking into. “Over the years I’d think about her, and they weren’t always friendly thoughts because I’d ask myself why she hasn’t tried to find us.” But older sister Joan, who also thought she was an only child, had been trying to find her dad for years.The -year-old mum-of-two now lives in Berkshire, and says she always wanted to know more about her dad but was unable to because of her ‘controlling’ mum who died in . She said: “I always felt a connection to my dad, he and my mother split up when I was very young, but I always felt that he loved me. “I knew he was there for my birth so I knew he would have held me and I think that connection always remained. “Me and Jean have lived two dferent lives, she comes from a very loving family and my mum was very controlling and I was never allowed to ask about my dad.” Joan spoke about a missed opportunity she had to meet her father, when she was  and rode the bus that Jim drove to work. Joan said: “I started working at , and I would take the number one from Langworthy Road to Pendleton Church and then the bus to Manchester. “Dad was a bus driver in Eccles and he drove the number one bus, he must have noticed me. “One morning I got on the bus and his we Annie was sat next to me, I didn’t know her at the time. “She tapped me on the knee and said ‘that bus driver is your dad, do you want to go and meet him  “I was in shock, I just panicked and didn’t say anything and just got off the next stop. “I was scared of my mum blowing upshe ever found out.” Joan eventually got married and moved out of Salford to set up her le down south with a husband and two children in her mid twenties. Cursing her missed opportunities but knowing her father’s name, she said she continued to look for him through registries, ancestry websites and even visited a mystic to askshe would ever find her father. She said: “I always felt like there was something inside me, I felt as though there was a thread connecting me and my dad.” She said she finally got the courage to put the post on the Facebook group after being encouraged by a friend. Jean added: “It was almost asit was fate. There’s this status from this lady and she started saying these things like her maiden name being Harris, like mine, where she lived, that her dad was a bus driver. “I’m reading this and I couldn’t believe it, I’m getting goosebumps now just thinking about it. “I had to read it several times, and the best thing about it for me was that she said she was so sad that she didn’t know my dad. “I couldn’t just do nothing, so I got in touch, I knew who she was, that was my sister.” Jean messaged Joan the next day sending photos of her dad and his driving licence. After a moment of ‘shock’, Joan called Jean the following day and the pair were beside themselves. Jean said: “She rang me and we were both as giddy as anything. “We spent six months talking on the phone and it was like we’d always known each other. “We just immediately got on, I was the one who had to prove myself, that I wasn’t just some random woman having a laugh.” Due to the pandemic the pair couldn’t meet as soon as possible and had to wait six months after making contact when restrictions were lted. The pair have been making up for all those years missed connecting the dots and introducing children and grandchildren to each other. Despite never meeting in person until now, both sisters inherited their father’s love for driving. Jean who now lives in Stockport was a driving instructor for  years and Joan, now retired, is an avid driver. So much so that Jean gted Joan their father’s driving gloves which she wears to feel close to him. Joan said: “Jean has been so generous. She’s let me into the family and given me things that belonged to my dad. “People search for years and they never find something they’re looking for. “Growing up I always thought I was an only child but my sister lived just  minutes away. “I’m so happy I feel like I could burst, it’s fabulous, just fabulous!” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON LoveRelationships\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Whilst more affluent areas in London and the south-east saw le-expectancies rise, and money pumped into services, areas in the south-west and north saw the reverse. The austerity cuts of the last decade from the Tory government gutted local government, leaving public transport, social services and other support dwindling.Now, Boris Johnson has promised to close the gulf and make the UK a country everyone can succeed in. Led by Michael Gove as minister Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, the government has promised to level up these areas.Now, a new tool released by the Office of National Statistics will let you compare your local area to those across the rest of the country.  You can see how you rank across a number of measures across three broad categories: boosting living standards, spreading opportunity and improving public services, and restoring local pride. The ONS used sub-national indicators to work out strengths and weaknesses of an area. The indicators give a good picture of where the country desperately needs to level up, and in what sorts of ways especially. The signicant range around indicators of good public transport services suggest that there is a lot of work to be done in many parts of the country here. Similarly, in the restoring local pride category, there are signicant numbers who are below the median local authority in terms of le satisfaction, feeling le is worthwhile, happiness and anxiety.  Use the tool below to see how your local authority ranks and tell us what you think in the comments below These are undoubtedly affected by the ongoing pandemic, but suggest the government has its work cut out to make people feel satisfied and like they can get ahead in their local areas. Using the tool, the same sorts of wealthier areas appear again and again towards the top end of indicators. Richmond upon Thames, a historically wealthier borough of London, comes out consistently near the top in two of the three categories. In spreading opportunities and public services and boosting living standards, categories measured by economic and social indicators like pay, access to education, and access to health care, the borough came out near the top repeatedly. In terms of access to education, le expectancy, pay and access to public transport and services, the borough ranked very high.  However, when it came to the third category, restoring local pride, which included factors like happiness, anxiety, le satisfaction and feeling le is worthwhile, the borough ranked noticeably below average. Despite this, according to the ONS’ tool, the borough needs little in the way of levelling up. At the other end of the scale, Middlesbrough finds itself often on the opposite side to Richmond upon Thames. The North Yorkshire town ranks flat worst in the country in terms of early access to education and ranks noticeably worse than the median local authority. Middlesbrough in fact ranks worst than the median local authority on every measure apart from anxiety. However, the story of levelling up is not a simple London pulling ahead whilst the north falls behind.  Large parts of the south west are often forgotten in the levelling up conversation, but West Devon is more reminiscent of Middlesbrough than Richmond. When it comes to local pride, the area scores strikingly high above the average local median authority, but it’s indicators in boosting living standards are incredibly low. Typical of south-western local authorities, it ranked especially low amongst public transport services, pay and employment rate, demonstrating that the need for levelling up was not limited to the north. Not all of London ranks like Richmond upon Thames or Kensington and Cha, but due to some of the best public transport links in the country, even the poorer boroughs are dragged higher up the ranks.

Michael Stone is currently serving three le sentences for the killingsLevi Bellfield claims he bludgeoned Lin and Megan Russell to death Image: ShutterstockByTom PettorCrime EditorPeter Kirkham:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb  Former Met murder detective Peter Kirkham has examined monster Levi Bellfield ’s claim that he bludgeoned Lin and Megan Russell to death.Michael Stone is currently serving three le sentences for killing mum Lin and her six-year-old daughter, who were found in a lane to death in Chillenden, Kent, in .Stone, , was also found guilty of trying to murder Megan’s sister Josie, then nine - but claims he is innocent. His solicitor says he has a statement by Bellfield, , describing how he carried out the double murder. He says he was wearing washing up gloves and holding a hammer as he stopped the family on a lane. He claims his intention was to “just attack Lin”, but changed his mind on hearing screams. He claims he threw the hammer in the river near Walton-on-Thames, Surrey. But is Bellfield – serving two whole le orders for the murders of Millie Dowler, Marsha McDonnell and Amelie Delagrange – telling the truth or playing a sick game  Here, ex-Det Chief Insp Kirkham provides his analysis – and verdict. The new statement  This will be the starting point for any potential review and will drive any further action considered necessary. Detectives would look at exactly what the statement contains and compare it with what is already in the public domain. As it runs for four pages, it sounds like it will contain a lot of detail. Bellfield will also know that the police will be expecting detailit is to be believed. The murders of Lin and Megan Russell, and the almost fatal attack on Josie, has received a huge amount of publicity over the last  years. The police would look for anything signicant in the statement which is not already in the public domain. I suspect there are very few facts left in this category, given the number of legal processes through which the case has passed and the amount of media interest and coverage. If there are any signicant dferences between Bellfield’s account and what is objectively known already then the statement will be seriously undermined. Credibility of Bellfield  Whether or not there is any new information in the statement, the credibility of Bellfield will be an important factor. If, as I suspect, there is little or new veriable information in the statement, this aspect will be of central importance. The police would ask “Is Bellfield a reliable source ”. In this case, we know he has a track record of making unreliable claims. In  he denied having anything to do with the Russell murders. He appears to like playing mind games with the police – the senior investigating officer who convicted him of the murders for which he is serving a whole le sentence, DCI Colin Sutton, below, has said as much in the past. This may well just be Bellfield’s latest attempt to confuse, embarrass or undermine the police. They will be extremely cynical and will take a considerable amount of convincing that his claim is true and reliable. Does it fit with Bellfieldaposs pattern of offending   Offenders tend to start off with more minor offences and work up to more serious ones. This also applies to the modus operandi in that they would tend to start with simpler and less dramatic methods and, over time, build to more complex methods. Unusually Bellfield is known to have committed a number of very violent murders and other attacks in the first few years of this century. Each of the offences involved Bellfield attacking a lone female in an urban environment so the circumstances of the Russell murders are very dferent. His potential involvement in these murders has been known for some time and the police have already looked at it and found no evidence linking him to them. Strength of the case against Michael Stone  The flip side of assessment of Bellfield’s admissions is looking at the strength of the case against any other suspects, in this case, Michael Stone. The case against him is not the strongest. It originally involved a number of prisoners saying he had made admissions and at least two of them have now been shown to have been mistaken or lying. The Appeal authorities are aware of this, however, and his conviction stands despite that being the case. There is very little actual, direct evidence against him but, that said, the absence of direct evidence is not evidence that he was not responsible. The circumstances of the Russell murders is such that an experienced investigator would not expect to find much,any, direct evidence. It did not take place in an area where CCTV footage might be expected. Bellfield is seeking to persuade us he is responsible for the murders for which Stone has been convicted. This means he will have to produce a very convincing admission to convince the police, the Courts or anyone  that it is true and Stone is therefore innocent. Credibility and reliability of witnesses  As well as the credibility of Bellfield himself, the police will have to look carefully at the credibility of the others involved in the case. Of central relevance in this regard is Bellfield’s ex-we who is definitely not someone who might be expected to be supportive of him. She has said that she was with Bellfield in the west London area on the day of the Russell murders, more than  miles away in Kent. She has a good reason to remember the exact day as it was her birthday and this helps to underpin her recollection. She is adamant that Bellfield had no opportunity to murder the Russells that day. Her account is about as credible and reliable as these things get. Stone’s lawyers have claimed that there is a witness who says they saw Bellfield in the area of the attack on the Russells. This witness has come forward long after the events and her “recognition” of Bellfield is based on pictures of him she has seen in the papers and on TV. Eyewitness identication is well known to be problematic as evidence. My View  As we do not know exactly what is in the statement produced by Bellfield, it is impossible to make a hard and fast decision as to whether it is likely to be reliable and true. It is, however, possible for me to give an informed professional opinion as to the likelihood of that turning out to be the case. And, in short, I have little doubt that it will turn out to be . Most,not all, of the actual checkable facts in the statement will undoubtedly turn out to be already in the public domain thanks to the acres of coverage that the murder of the Russells has received over the twenty-odd years since it happened. Bellfield has plenty of time on his hands to research the case in great detail and find even the more obscure facts, which have received little focus. He is also capable of constructing a convincing  narrative from the facts he has available and, as a murderer himself, he is well placed to come up with convincing things to fill any gaps.  He is known to lie to the police and run them around the houses. I very much suspect he doesn’t like the police at all and he might therefore be motivated to produce a  account simply to get at them. He is also known to play sick games with investigators which, intentionally or otherwise, have the effect of torturing the families of victims. It would be extremely unusual for the same offender to have committed the Russell murders as a first fatal attack, several years before falling back to a far simpler MO which he then used consistently.It would also be very unusual for him to have committed the murders so far away from the area of West London in whichhe feels confident and safe only tothere for his subsequent offending.The conviction of Stone is not based on the strongest of evidence but it has been subject to long and thorough review. Two juries were satisfied of his guilt having heard the evidence.Because of the nature of the evidence against Stone, I am not giving too much weight to the fact Stone has been convicted whenit comes to assessing the admissions by Bellfield.And, of course, evenStone were innocent, it would not mean that Bellfield is telling the truth. I do not believe that Bellfield’s admissions are convincing, on the basis of what we know right now. He has a track record of saying things and then retracting them and he is known to like playing mind games with the police. There are several “red flags” waving over his admissions. Taken together they make me believe the statement is just the latest in a long line of lies from him. Although I am pretty certain that Bellfield is very likely to have committed other serious offences for which he has not been prosecuted or convicted, I do not think that the  murders of Lin and Megan Russell are amongst them.

Levin compared the two women and described Meghan as a dficult woman who is not somebody who wants to work in a team.She said: When [the Duchess of Cornwall] is with Prince Charles, she takes a backwards step and sheaposs there to support him rather like Prince Philip was. She doesnapost try to interfere, she doesnapost try to outsmart him, or rush ahead and shake hands with whoever is there.Levin praised Camilla on GB News for talking to people during the Covid- pandemic using Zoom, allowing the public to see her in a way that they never had before.Sheaposs also never complained about anything, from the time she was most disliked, before she married Prince Charles, people were attacking her in every possible way, Levin said, adding that the Duchess simply got on with her le quietly.  She never blamed anybody and never tried to win people round, she just waited. I believe she felt thatyou give people time, aposThey will see what Iaposm like and then they can make up their minds.aposapos  Presenter Eamonn Holmes then asked whether the Duchess of Sussex should have followed in her step-mother-in-lawaposs footsteps. Levin explained: I think that the Duchess of Sussex needs to prove herself non-stop. She takes on everything she possibly can because she needs to be out there in the front. Sheaposs not somebody who wants to work as a team, where Camilla doesnapost want to put herself out in the front. Levinaposs comments come after the Queen celebrated her Platinum Jubilee of  years as the monarch and gave her blessing for Camilla to become Queen Consort when Prince Charles becomes King.  The Queen said: It is my sincere wish that, when that time comes, Camilla will be known as Queen Consort, the title given to the spouse of a ruling monarch. She works incredibly hard and I think the Queen feels quite rightly that she justies it, Levin said of the news. A spokesman for Clarence House, the official residence of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, said that the couple were touched and honoured by the announcement.

The ft-long beast was first spotted floating through the canal with the old motorcycle rubber tyre around its body just below its head in Palu City, in Indonesiaaposs Sulawesi province in .Experts feared that the saltwater crocodile would be strangled as its body continued to grow while the tyre refused to budge. A reward was put up in January  for anyone brave enough to remove the item and despite dozens of people trying, all of the attempts were unsuccessful.

They then hacked through the tyre using a saw - with onlookers erupting in cheers when it was finally removed. Hili said: Iaposve been preparing to catch this crocodile for several weeks. This is the best achievement of my le. He added the crocodile had not been seen for several months but reappeared in the river on Sunday February .

At around : pm, the crocodile was successfully caught in one of the traps with locals eager to help the animal catcher.

Luckily, today it worked. I am glad it is now free.

Between September  and , , she broke the mph temporary speed limit, driving between -mph on the M motorway, near Manchester. She tried to convince Tameside Magistrates Court that she needed her car because she clocked up around  miles a week driving to work, taking her children to school and her son to football games. The -year-old claimed that her family “relied” upon her for lts as her -year-old husband Chris, a director of an engineering firm, was “not much assistance” as he was too busy with his own work. Hubble admitted speeding but tried to dodge the driving ban claiming that she and her family would suffer from “exceptional hardship”. But she was disqualied for six months after a magistrate told her: We have heard about inconvenience - but not exceptional hardship. She was also slapped with a £ fine with £ costs. Hubble, of Knowsley, Liverpool, had been driving in her BMW D M Sport Auto when she broke the law. Her lawyer Charles Stansfield told the hearing that she had had a clean driving license for  years up until the offence. He added that: She has completed a speed awareness course for one of these offences and she has now learnt about the importance of following the temporary limit and how it still applies.”Stansfield also argued that she has three dferent drop off points for her five children, aged two, six, ,  and , on the school run. They added the points hanging over her head would be a sufficient punishment and that she regularly drives hundreds of miles a week to take her -year-old to football games. He said: The -year-old is a very good young footballer. In terms of miles per week she says in one week the total was . miles. “She says her son plays football for Blackpool academy and trains at Myerscough College twice per weekly, which is  miles. She said he played a match at Carlisle which that week was  miles. She says she travelled  miles for her academy job,  miles for her sht at the hospital and  miles for her mobile aesthetics plus . miles to take her son to football.  “This is pretty well an average driving week, maybe slightly less because of the trip to Carlisle.” Hubble also used her car to get to work, and for her mobile business, and Stansfield claimed her family le is “seriously in jeopardy”. He added: Her rough net income is about £ per week plus £ per week in child benefit. Her husbandaposs net income is £ per week but this will fluctuate. They pay expenses of around £, per month for their mortgage, council tax, house keeping, insurance, mobile phone contracts etc. That does not include clothing and the odd chocolate bar. I think what comes in goes out and in other circumstances, she would be applauded for what she does in an average week.

But this mildness is reportedly most noticeable in patients who have already been vaccinated. Most children have not been vaccinated, which experts believe has opened a route for Omicronaposs mutations to hit them harder.  Dr Andrew, who works at Primary Children’s Hospital in Utah, said: There is reason to think that acts dferently in younger children. We are seeing the sht towards more disease in younger children that probably has to do with changes in the virus.Dr Andrew says Omicron seems to attack the upper airways to a greater extent than the lungs, reports The Sun. And because younger children have smaller airways, it affects them dferently. The doctor said the children who became unwell enough with Omicron to need hospital care often presented with a specic cough - that sounds like a dogaposs bark, he said. This type of cough, described as croup-like by medics, is not thought to be harmful to the kids. But it is still unpleasant for parents hearing the harsh sound, which can naturally increase their concerns. The sinuses of children are smaller than adults, and can become blocked easily, and in turn cause inflammation that can spark a harsh cough. A common cold infection experienced as mild by an adult, could cause more problems for a child. When Omicron settles and causes inflammation in the upper airway, infected children will present a cough that seems more severe and may even need breathing assistance, Dr Andrew said.Omicron also infects patients in a dferent way to the previous strains - which ed deeper into the lungs where it could cause more le-threatening illness. At the end of last year, experts shared a list of the specic Omicron symptoms parents should watch out for in children.

It will cost us, the taxpayer, £,. That’s the price of the civil service and police time spent probing No parties that should never have happened. The nation is rightly furious that the Prime Minister cared so little for the Covid rules he himself imposed that he put living it up before his duty to protect lives and livelihoods. Our PM gave not one jot about those who were forbidden from saying a final face-to-face goodbye to a dying loved one – or the family get-togethers we all did without because we were obeying his rules. Patsy Stevenson is angry too. She was fined £ for breaking lockdown restrictions to honour the memory of murdered Sarah Everard.  There was no cheese and wine at the vigil Patsy attended on London’s Clapham Common. Yet police pinned her down to arrest her, while ignoring food and booze pouring into No. The cost of the Partygate inquiry would be better spent on shielding women and girls from the kind of predator who snatched Sarah’s le away. And this investigation would not be needed had Mr Johnson and his staff accepted that rules also apply to them. This PM is on borrowed time. We will party – legally – when it finally runs out. A great honour for Camilla Camilla Parker Bowles may have been a skilled horsewoman, but she had a rough ride of it when she became Duchess of Cornwall. Many people could not forgive her for the part she played in the break-up of Prince Charles and Princess Diana’s marriage. But that was nothing compared to the fences the Queen had to jump within her own family while trying to maintain the dignity of royalty and respect for the monarchy. Both were tarnished when grandson Prince Harry turned his back on royal duties and skipped off to America to give a toe-curling interview to Oprah Winfrey, and strike ­embarrassing deals with Netflix.  It pained the Queen greatly when she had to strip her favourite son, Prince Andrew, of his titles as he faces accusations of sexual assault in a US court. But her duty to the nation demanded it, and the Queen has always put that before personal feelings. Throughout, Camilla has been steadfastly by the Queen’s side, her support in times of trouble. And just like the Sovereign, she negotiates the pathways of public le without putting a foot wrong – a ready smile and a kind word are always on her lips. The Queen is not one to ignore such loyalty and dedication. And today, as she becomes the first British monarch to reign for  years, she wants the world to know that when the time comes, Camilla will be called Queen Consort. We are delighted Camilla is to receive the honour. As they say in royal circles, she’s a jolly good fellow. And so say all of us.

And royal fans are convinced she did this last week and used her outfit to drop a major hint that the Duchess of Cornwall was about to be publicly backed by the Queen to be Queen Consort - days before she released her bombshell statement. It came last Thursday when Kate joined Prince Charles and Camilla for a rare joint day out in East London.She was invited by her father-in-law to join him and his we at Trinity Buoy Wharf, a centre in East London run by the Princeaposs Foundation, where traditional textile skills are taught. For the occasion, Kate recycled a chic grey coat dress by Catherine Walker that she teamed with black tights and black heels. And royal fans have pointed out that another time she wore the same ensemble was in  during an engagement at Kingaposs College, London - where she was invited to join the Queen.According to Hello! one royal fan commented on Instagram : Does this mean that Kate made the appearance and wore the grey dress again with Camilla that she last wore with the Queen to a very subtle hint at the announcement about Camilla being Queen Consort   Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

And the first time she wore this coat was when she accompanied the Queen on an engagement. I donapost think itaposs a coincidencethat makes sense. Meanwhile, others pointed out it was noticeable that Kate opted for an outfit in a muted grey colour, while Camilla wore green, in order not to outshine her.On Saturday night, just two days after the royal trioaposs outing, the Queen released an extraordinary message on the eve of her Platinum Jubilee expressing her sincere wish for Camilla to be Queen Consort when Charles is King.  When Camilla wed Charles in , a statement said she intended to use the title Princess Consort, rather than Queen Consort, when her husband becomes King.It followed low popularity ratings after she was thrust into the spotlight when it was revealed she had been having an affair with Charles during his marriage to Princess Diana.However, following rising public opinion, the Queen issued an extraordinary statement on the eve of her Platinum Jubilee on Saturday saying it was her sincere wish for Camilla to be Queen. The monarch said: I remain eternally grateful for, and humbled by, the loyalty and affection that you continue to give me. And when, in the fullness of time, my son Charles becomes King, I know you will give him and his we Camilla the same support that you have given me and it is my sincere wish that, when that time comes, Camilla will be known as Queen Consort as she continues her own loyal service.

Heather Prentice was giving evidence at a General Teaching Council for Scotland probe into the behaviour of Melissa Tweedie at the event in Glasgow. Itaposs claimed the former PE teacher partied with pupils at SWG nightclub before going back with them to a Premier Hotel.The then -year-old allegedly danced inappropriately with pupils before having sex with the pupil, who was , reports Glasgow Live. Deputy head Ms Prentice, , told the hearing yesterday: I had concerns about Melissa from the start of the dance regarding her outfit. Later in the evening I saw her up dancing with a glass of wine. She was up with a group of sixth year pupils. She claims she also saw: Pupil A and her taking shots at the bar.When it was time to leave the prom in June , Ms Prentice asked Tweedie how she was getting home. The Deputy Head recounted: She said she was getting a black hack. I told her I would arrange something for her. I told Melissa that there was a lt organised . When it was time for Tweedie - now  and working as a yoga teacher in Dubai - to leave Ms Prentice claimed she was unable to find her: I was told that she had left with sixth year pupils. I caught up to her on Kelvinhaugh Street. She was very reluctant to take advice and come with us. We couldnapost make her come with us, so we had to let her go. The Deputy said she was called by a colleague to a hotel across the river from SWG. She said: I got to the hotel across the river at about :am. Staff were checking CCTV to seeMelissa was there. Pupils had said that they had seen her in a room drinking alcohol. Mr Nicholls [Head Teacher] asked Melissa to send a ping to her location. She did not reply.  When replying to the presenting officeraposs cross examination from Gary Burton, she said in relation to the teacheraposs outfit: I do remember it was quite loose, short, low cut. I do remember that she looked like she was going on a night out. When asked about the nature of the dancing she said: It was all male pupils she was dancing with. I didnapost see any contact between her and any pupil. On her level of inebriation she said: She was not that drunk that she couldnapost walk. She was not that drunk that she was out of control. I told her she needed to be more careful here and the way she was seeing the situation was not the way the pupils were seeing it. I wanted her to recognise that the pupils were getting a bit titillated by it. Hearing convener, Arthur Stewart, then askedshe thought that she had actually spoken to her flatmate on the phone to get them to pick her up. Ms Prentice said: With hindsight, I wasnapost sure it was her flatmate on the phone. Iaposm trying to say I think she was on the phone to the sixth year pupil [Pupil A]. I havenapost got anything to back that up other than that she was blowing kisses and saying aposlove, love.apos Another pupil who was present at the prom was heard by the GTCS this afternoon. The pupil recounted: I was sitting at my table and I remember a chat between teachers that she needed to calm down. She then spoke about what she saw when she was staying at the Premier Inn after the night: I went back into the room as everyone was leaving to get a drink. Pupil A had his arms around the base of her back and she said to me aposCan we just pretend for a minute like Iaposm not your teacherapos. I left because it was quite weird. I went down the stairs for some food and I saw Mr Nicholls. He said aposwhere is she, where is she apos I think he meant Miss Tweedie. When being cross examined by Presenting Officer Gary Burton, she said: They were sitting on the edge of the double bed. She was competent enough to say aposcan we just pretend for a minute like Iaposm not your teacherapos to me. The pupil also recalled how Mr Nicholls looked quite startled.

Danny Walsh and Rick Webster were driving along the M last month when a lorry moved into their lane before continuing to drt across and crushing the front of the van. Their van was dragged against the central reservation of the motorway and left Danny and Rick fearing for their lives. They said the lorry then drove away without stopping to seethe two dads were hurt by the incident. Dashcam footage from the tradesmenaposs van showed Danny, the driver, moving to the outside lane to avoid a collision.  But they were soon trapped by the large vehicle, with the front of the van on the passenger side being crushed by the lorryaposs impact. The vehicle then slammed them against the central reservation, straightened up, before driving off. Danny and Rick were left stranded and exposed to the busy morning traffic on the motorway as a result, with Danny saying they were a few metres from death. Danny had luckily braked quickly in order to stop the entire van being crushed and thrown over to the other side of the motorway.  Danny said: We were a few metres and a split second away from being crushed. It could have been a whole lot dferent. Weaposre lucky. At first we just thought aposlook at this t***er, not indicating,apos and we thought he just wanted to come into that lane but then he just started coming out again and again. Before we knew it, there was nowhere  to go. People say you see your le flash before your eyes but we didnapost have time for that. We just thought aposOh s***.apos He explained thathe was in a hatchback rather than a van, they wouldnapost have stood a chance, with an HGV driver later telling them thathe hadnapost braked in time, they would have died.  Its a lucky escape. It was just natural instinct to slam on. He must have dragged us  yards along the central reservation then he just drove off. The lorry belongs to British distribution giants Bunzl, who have confirmed that the driver has been suspended while they investigate the accident. However, Danny said: Bunzl said he had a medical incident, buthe did have, he would have stopped, He straightened the wagon and drove off quite competently. Danny and Rick were terried that someone  would drive into them as they couldnapost look out the mirrors. They were luckily able to get across the motorway to safety. He added that he was really shaken up by the incident and that the van has been written off as a result.  He could kill someonehe did that again. I hope itaposs a wake up call for his driving. It could have been a family in that care and they wouldnapost have stood a chance, the dad-of-two said. His co-worker Rick, also a dad-of-two, said that the incident has left him with sleepless nights. If you think about it too much, it can keep you awake at night, but I want to know why he nearly made my kids fatherless. I feel unlucky that it happened but lucky we survived it.  He explained: I thought, aposThis could be it.apos It scared the le out of me. I thought of my family and I didnapost know I was going to get out alive.Since the incident, Rickaposs we Rachel posted the dashcam footage from the van onto Facebook to appeal for witnesses.West Yorkshire Police confirmed an incident involving four vehicles was reported on the morning of the incident, while Bunzl said they would be looking into the claims of a medical incident by the driver closely.A spokesperson for Bunzl said: We are aware of an incident involving a Bunzl vehicle. We take road safety seriously and the incident is currently being investigated.

Mason James Cowgill was caught taking both hands off the wheel to crack open a bottle of Bollinger and chugging away at the alcoholic drink as he drove on the A in North Yorkshire.In the same footage, he is later seen rolling up a cigarette, which he puts behind his ear to smoke later, and using his mobile too. During both instances, heaposs distracted and takes his hands off the steering wheel. The terrying footage was captured on June , last year when he crashed into one car and nearly caused another crash. At one point in his journey, the van crashes into the back of a car which was stationary in traffic, police said.  The car was damaged in the collision but thankfully nobody was injured. Cowgill and the car driver exchanged details, but Cowgill left the scene before officers arrived. North Yorkshire Police said he was lucky he didnapost kill anyone as he continued his journey while making more phone calls to friends and almost caused another crash. Cowgill reported the collision to his boss, who owned the van, and he reviewed the in-cab footage. The boss sacked Cowgill, of Skipton, North Yorks., and sent the footage to the police. Cowgill pleaded guilty to dangerous driving in court, where he was disqualied for a period of  months including an extended retest. Speaking after his sentencing, PC Babs Parsons of North Yorkshire Police said: “Cowgill is lucky he did not kill or seriously injure someone that day.  “The manner in which he drove demonstrated a clear danger to other road users and I’m amazed he did not cause any more collisions. “This was not a momentary lapse in concentration, this is a sustained period in which Cowgill paid very little or no attention at all to the road and was clearly not in control of the van he was driving. “I thank the owner of the van for bringing this footage to our attention as it has enabled us to take a very dangerous driver off the road”.

Sasha Sasheva was propositioned by her boss Ala Uddin via text message and she says he stared at her so much in the office that it made her feel uncomfortable.The tech firm employee blocked his number and had to move home after she saw him hanging around her flat. Sasha was found to be a victim of sexual harassment due to a nasty and serious abuse of power by director Mr Uddin, an employment tribunal has ruled.She has been awarded £,. in compensation.  Sasha started working for the -year-oldaposs software firm All Techmart UK in October  as an administrator, the East London hearing heard. She was the sole employee and while the two of them were in the office Mr Uddin stared at her so much so it made her feel uncomfortable. The director also sent text messages to Sasha in November  saying I wanna hump you and Love...when are you going to f*** , the hearing was told. Sasha said she complained she could not have felt more uncomfortable and became so scared that she started to work from home more often.

Sasha says she then started to fear for her safety.for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.Mr Uddin then sent another obvious sexual proposition in the same month, this time asking Sashashe wanted to spend the night with him, it was said. At this point, Sasha told him this was unacceptable harassment and told him to stop. The tribunal heard Mr Uddin then tried calling her numerous times until she blocked his number. Sasha then resigned after the second proposition, because she was upset and angry with the harassment she experienced. Sasha felt so harassed she reported the incident to the police, the tribunal heard. Employment Judge Sarah Moor said: I have no doubt that at first the harassment made [Miss Sasheva] initially feel extremely uncomfortable, and nervous. She was too ashamed to seek support from members of her family initially. Most of them lived in Bulgaria and she did not wish to worry them unduly. I have no doubt that by the time she resigned she was scared, extremely upset and angry. She had been forced to leave her job because of unlawful sexual harassment in the form of propositions from her boss and only other member of staff. [Miss Sasheva] decided to move home because Mr Uddin had her address and she had seen him hanging around her flat. She did not feel safe coming and going. It is practically burdensome to have to move home, to pack, to find somewhere new, to change addresses and so on, but to do so because of harassment is even more upsetting. [She] has regularly had moments when she freezes because of anxiety. She calls these panic attacks and they have happened about three times a week since her resignation. They are attributable, in my view, to the harassment... [She] has had nightmares but these have eased. The behaviour was nasty sexual harassment by Mr Uddin in the form of sexual propositions and standing outside [her] home. It was an abuse of his power as her employer. In addition [Miss Sasheva] was made to feel uncomfortable by Mr Uddin staring at her and sending to her inappropriate texts about missing her. The impact on [her] was increased because she was a lone worker. This exacerbated her discomfort and feelings that she was unsafe. She did not want to be near Mr Uddin.

Diego, a black and white Great Dane, is taller than his six-foot owner when standing on hind legs.Almost everyone knows him near his east London home and taking the tube can be a nightmare with large crowds of doggy fans, reports MyLondon.Diego is so popular that even the police have even stopped him in the street to take photographs. Owner Carlos takes Diego with him everywhere, and the pair love riding through central London in a two-wheeled motorbike together. The Great Dane even has a pair of dog goggles that fit his head - so he can ride in style. to ourTeamDogs newsletterfor your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. Carlos, who is originally from Brazil, bought Diego in . His we, Ellie, was terried of dogs, and had taken some persuading . On Christmas Day, they got the call: a breeder had one Great Dane left. And so, at am, Carlos set off for Peterborough to collect Diego. Ellie may have had her reservations, but Diego has won her round. Now,I asked her to choose [between] me or Diego, Diego would stay, says Carlos. She does everything for them - they control the house. At kgs, Diego is taller than six-foot Carlos when standing on his hind legs.  Diego has been known to steal food from strangers. He steals food everywhere - heaposs not very well-behaved with food. If some guys are having lunch and they blink, Diego will grab it, Carlos said. Carlos has tried to put Diego on a diet, but itaposs tricky - strangers in the park will readily dispense treats to their favourite Great Dane, and thereaposs also the issue of pizza. If he sees pizza, his favourite food, he gets crazy - heaposs a dferent dog. Heaposll do anything for pizza, he explains. Six years after getting Diego, he and Carlos are inseparable. Everywhere I go, I take Diego, says Carlos, explaining that when he sits down - on the sofa, on the Tube, to put his shoes on - Diego will always sit on his lap. Docile Diego will happily accompany Carlos to the pub, on the Tube, or join him at a restaurant. At The Bike Shed, a motorcycle club in Shoreditch, Diego is the first dog in the venueaposs history to have become a Gold Member.When we go there, it says on the table: aposThis table is reserved for Diego and his human, Carlos says. Diego is well-liked. In Victoria Park, where he takes his morning walk, he has doting fans whoaposll slip him treats at work at Bravos Motorcycles, people will regularly drop by to see him or take him for a walk. Because of his size and black and white colouring, some children even mistake him for a cow. In East London, almost everyone knows him, says Carlos. If you have a Great Dane, everyone wants to come and talk and take pictures. This can be a liability. The Tube is a nightmare sometimes...one [person] wants to take a photo, and then another one, and then thereaposs a crowd, Carlos said.  Driving together on the motorbike, theyaposve also been stopped by the police. Carlos thought they were in trouble - but it turned out that they too just wanted a photo of the pair together. Sometimes when we stop, people donapost want to pass - they want to see him, and it makes a traffic jam, says Carlos, who has taken to wearing a balaclava to keep a low profile. That said, Carlos is pleased to have Diego by his side, and I sense that he enjoys some of the popularity that Diego and Nelson bring. He says: If you want to meet people and make friends, walk a Great Dane in London. Six year-old Diego has an adopted brother, Nelson, aged two. Currently, itaposs just Diego who travels in the sidecar, but Carlos is keen to teach Nelson to ride with him too. Nelson is a completely dferent dog, says Carlos, explaining that where Diego is calm, Nelson is jittery, afraid of smaller dogs. As a Great Dane, heaposs more active. Heaposs crazy - heaposs the opposite of Diego. In spite of their dferences, the two dogs are best friends, says Carlos - although Nelson, despite being around kgs lighter than Diego, is the alpha.Do you have a story to share  Email webfeatures@reachplc.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TeamDogsDogsAnimalsGreat DaneChristmasVehiclesAdoptionPizza\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Looking for advice, she wrote: “I’ll genuinely get this uneasy, unsettled feeling sometimes because I’ll look up and realise she’s just been staring me down. “I’ve had dogs my entire le. I’ve also worked as a kennel attendant. I’ve never had a dog make me feel so uneasy. I feel awful saying all of this, but it’s true.

I genuinely feel smothered by her. It’s stressing me out,” she said. The woman adopted the three-year-old dog with her boyfriend about nine months ago - but she is the primary caregiver. She added: “Being that I’m the one home most of the time, I’ve put in a lot of work with her. She very clearly has an attachment to me because of this. “She gets really anxious when I leave her. My boyfriend will try to console her when it’s just him at home with her, but she’ll just pace around the house and sit by the door waiting for me to get back. “She has such an anxious attachment to me specically that it actually makes me anxious.  “I know she looks to me for protection and safety, and I’m honoured she sees me this way. I’m proud of how far she’s come since bringing her home. “But, constantly being watched and followed is wearing on my nerves. I’m constantly having to say “Back up” or “Go get in your bed” or “Excuse me” just to get basic tasks done around my house.” The woman asked her vet to put the dog on anxiety medication - but they advised against this, instead telling her to seethe dogaposs symptoms ease in the coming months. Despite ensuring all her dog’s needs are met, and providing her with the love and attention she deserves, some have questioned the womanaposs level of care. One user said: Your dog is from two worker dog breeds that need hours of exercise a day ideally. I know it is a lot but it is what those dogs are bred to do - herd for hours and hours. With no outlet for her high energy then she will become nervous and anxious. I had a high energy dog that passed last year. He was crazy when he was younger until I started running him with an attachment to my bike. While another person said: “I have a blue heeler mix and he is literally always either eye on me or touching me. “This caused issues at first because he would try to guess where I was going so he could stay with me. “I think the moral of the story is to give it more time. She’s staring at you because she loves you, trusts you, and is trying to figure you out. “I feel like intelligent breeds like cattle dogs know that you saved them and want to be with you because they’re grateful.”Do you have a story to share  Email webfeatures@reachplc.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TeamDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A hopeless romantic, Elizabeth would love a whirlwind romance like the ones she sees on TV and in movies and is a fan of big gestures. She added: My dream date is being whisked away... a whirlwind romance. I guess you could even say I would model my perfect relationship to be like Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee, where you just run away and forget all the rules to fall madly and deeply in love. My dream is to find someone and it be like aposthat’s the oneapos and have a shotgun wedding. Elizabethaposs family are very supportive of her modelling career and are keen for her to find love too. She said: They think whoever I meet and fall in love with, whether it be online or in-person, they will be happy for me. The model broke up with her ex, not named for privacy reasons, six months ago but isnapost tempted to go reignite the flame with him – or any others. She added: Most of my exes try to keep in contact with me. Some are kind and we are friends but other ones I want absolutely nothing to do with.

Owner Lisa Kite, , began teaching her nine-year-old dog, Ivy, how to paint when she was just aged two. After noticing how quickly she picked it up, Lisa started trying her out with dferent types of paint, starting with watercolours before moving on to acrylics. Lisa, from North Carolina, US, said: It didnapost take long to teach her how to paint she was painting within a week. Initially, I trained her to get a beer from the fridge to impress my adult children when they came to visit and from there, I taught her lots of dferent tricks.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.  Sheaposll do the basic commands like sit, roll over and shake but sheaposs learned how to sort the washing, take my jacket off, wipe her feet, and put coins in the bank. We have a two-page spreadsheet of dferent tricks now. The Australian shepherd’s paintings have a range of names, from aposMeringueapos to aposJungle Catapos, and prices y, with her most expensive work of art selling for £.  Lisa added: Iaposve given so many paintings away but we sell them all over the world Iaposm blown away by how many people want one of her paintings. Despite not being an artist herself, Lisa loves seeing the art her pup creates and sets Monday as their day of the week to paint, with Ivy having five paintings on the go at once. Lisa donates the profits from Ivyaposs artwork to local charities and food banks in their area. She said: This is fun for Ivy she is trained using positive reinforcement and is putting good into the world. Iaposm not an artist but I love art and have learned a lot from Ivy. She only adds one colour to each painting per week to make sure weaposre not diluting the colours. As long as sheaposs busy, sheaposs happy and we make sure to walk her five miles a day on top of that. We give the profits away to charity itaposs usually animal welfare charities but also food banks. I love the idea that there is a dog working to help other dogs and pets in the world.Do you have a story to share  Email webfeatures@reachplc.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TeamDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The first image of Comet  UN  was spotted nearly eight years ago with shocked experts predicting it was among the biggest ever seen. At the time, early estimates thought it was around - miles wide. Now more precise calculations have indicated it is  miles across - around the same distance from London to Birmingham. It is more than ten times the size of the meteorite believed to have wiped out the dinosaurs more than  million years ago, put at around seven miles. But despite its massive size there is no need for concern as its orbit means Comet  UN will never cross Saturn, about  million miles away.Dr Emmanuel Lellouch of the Paris Observatory told New Scientist : “We have confirmed the estimate.“It’s the biggest comet from the Oort Cloud ever found.”  Dr Lellouch and his team discovered its true size by using the Atacama Large Millimeter submillimeter Arrayin Chile which examined the radiation created by the comet and allowed them to calculate its surface area. The Oort Cloud, according to Nasa, is the most distant region of our solar system and is described as a “big, thick-walled bubble made of icy pieces of space debris.” Some of the pieces are the size of mountains and larger, and there could be trillions of items. The comet is twice the size of the last celestial giant to hold the tile, Hale-Bopp, which was discovered in  by two amateur astronomers, Alan Hale in New Mexico and Thomas Bopp in Arizona. Mr Hale told Time magazine in : “As soon as I looked I saw a fuzzy object nearby. It was strange, because Iaposd looked at M a couple of weeks earlier and the object hadnapost been there.  The comet was visible to the naked eye for around  months, delighting stargazers in the s. Another space object known as P Chiron, which orbits between Saturn and Uranus, is technically larger at  miles but scientists cannot decideit is a comet or a small planet.It comes as NASA revealed it is considering whether to kill off the International Space Stationby crashing it into the ocean within the next ten years.The space agency plans to take the lab out of orbit in January  by sending it to a spacecraft cemetery. Point Nemo, Latin for no-one, is the ideal spot to sink decommissioned satellites, space stations and rockets as it is the furthest point from land on Earth. The nearest humans are the astronauts in the ISS who fly just under km above the zone which has been used as a dumping ground by space agencies since .US PresidentJoe Bidenpromised to keep running the ISS until  but its long term future is undecided as it gets older and unsustainable to repair.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NasaSpace\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Novosibirsk Zoo, in Russia’s third-largest city, announced a public vote to select its mascot after the area was named the country’s ‘New Year Capital’ this year. In thepoll , the city was given the choice between Aisha the cat, Batu the orangutan, Max the Amur tiger, Sayan the snow leopard and Shilka the polar bear cub.But what started as an innocent vote, quickly turned into a political battle that the Kremlin itself waded into. Sergei Boyko, the now exiled former Novosirbirsk coordinator for jailed Putin opposition Alexei Navalny, threw his backing behind Batu the resident orangutan to be chosen for the job. In a YouTube broadcast last month, he said: “Against the backdrop of everything going on in Novosibirsk, I think that the orangutan is absolutely the best option. Therefore, I urge you to support the orangutan.” The surprise addition to the ballot quickly garnered more and more support as a number of Navalny supporters online, as well as other journalists, and bloggers rallied behind him. Independent city council member Igor Ukraintsev alsocame out in support of the orangutan .Popular blogger Ilya Varlamov even dubbed the orange ape “the candidate of the people.”However, as Batu’s popularity skyrocketed, local mediaTayga.infoclaim that Putin’s administration took an interest in the vote.They report that the Kremlin, and Putin, wanted the orangutan to lose and claimed that Putin’s Siberian representative sent an urgent request to the Novosibirsk mayoraposs office to try and stop Batu winning.After this, Shilka the polar club edged into the lead, then Sayan the snow leopard suddenly received , votes in only four hours, despite thepolling websitereceiving only , unique visitors.  According toThe Insider , these votes were fraudulent.Local artist Artyom Loskutov who has long-documented political demonstrations in Russia, said: “The orangutan clearly won. Apparently, the authorities could not come to terms with this victory. Why — well, one can only speculate.” In the end, the zoo decided to scrap the vote the day before it was due to close, saying it would choose the mascot itself. At the time the vote was shutdown, Batu had .% of the votes, meaning the orangutan won the vote, but it is unknown whether it will be selected. Writing on its website, the zoo said: “We hoped for sincere interest and positive attitude towards our idea.“Unfortunately, today we see that our animals have become participants in a farce that people have organised. “The poll is used for purposes far from choosing a symbol of the festive Novosibirsk - a number of bloggers, deputies, journalistscalled on their audience to give the poll for the talisman a political colouring. The negative nature of what is happening towards the end is beyond doubt. “The Novosibirsk zoo is not interested in such attention to our pets, we do not like the creation of offensive memes, so we ask you to stop the survey and do not take into account its results.  “We have sent an official letter to the Deputy Mayor, Head of the Department of Sports Culture and Youth Policy Anna Vasilievna Tereshkova! And we already got support! “Thanks to everyone who took part in the survey without any ulterior motives. Max, Shilka and Aisha, Batu and Sayan are always waiting for you. Of course, they are animals, but to make them an instrument of their ambitions, in our opinion, is wrong.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON SnowZoosAnimalsRussiaVladimir Putin\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

long time already.

I also think this is what we need.“We had a very good autumn with these three camps, and now we need these games to really know where we are.“This is a tournament where we can really have a starting point for the preparations for the Euros – we’ve already done that, but now with these world-class opponents we’ll really know where we stand and from there, we will continue preparing for the Euros.

It was the Pupils who would concede it.In another move tinged with disappointment # the match referee failing to spot another offside in the build-up # a ball from the right flank was swung in to a player in an offside position, who held the ball up and worked it back to a central area where Finnart’s captain unleashed a strong strike high into the Pupils’ net.And while the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils continued to work hard to claw their way back into the match they were undone with only a few minutes remaining by a smart counter-attack at the other end, which allowed Finnart’s number  to score from close range with a low, side-footed effort.On reflection, the Pupils were undone by moments of business-like quality – certainly for goals two and four from their hosts # and perhaps their own naivety against a canny and disciplined side who are challenging to win the WoSFL’s Division Four.Nevertheless, the Pupils can reflect on a decent, determined performance for much of this match.

We called on both the UK and Scottish governments to appropriately fund the citys cultural collections through A Fair Deal for Glasgow.An Arabesque Carpet being reinstalled at the Burrell Collection The funding for the Burrell revamp is an example of groups coming together and last October the UK Governmnet announced a £million package for the museum.Nearly half of the funding for the £. million project was committed by Glasgow City Council with more than a quarter coming from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, and signicant donations from the Scottish Government, the UK Government, and from many generous trusts and private donors.Caroline Clark, Director for Scotland, The National Lottery Heritage Fund, said the revitalised building now showcases this extraordinary collection in a modern and open space that is accessible to everyone.\"Thanks to National Lottery players, our £. million in funding has secured strong outcomes for The Burrell Collection and the many people who will enjoy visiting in the future, helping to drive tourism to the area and ensure that this wonderful Collection can be enjoyed for many generations to come,\" Ms Clark said:Culture Minister Neil Gray said he was delighted it would reopen to the public again adding: \"The Scottish Government has contributed £. million in funding to the project which includes £, to support cost increases due to the pandemic.

While it was closed, objects from the Collection were seen by more than a million people on loan to museums in New York, Paris, Japan and London. "},{"url":null,"title":"letters-stop-causing-needless-alarm-elderly-pensions","story":"I don’t doubt the complexity, but have the authors overstated the uncertainty The UK Government’s own document “State Pensionyou retire abroad” states in its first sentence “You can claim State Pension abroadyou’ve paid enough UK National Insurance contributions to qualy”, making clear that following payment of contributions there is a liability to pay a state pension, consistent with the terms of the scheme at the time.Of course, these terms can change, “reduce, or even, in principle, eliminate”. Certainly, the state pension has ied in real value over the years, but it is no less clear that, in any post-Yes vote negotiation, pension liability could not be valued on the basis of something that might or might not happen several years later.As for elimination of pensions, the politics of telling the UK’s grey vote, and the expats all over the world, that they are not getting their pension any more is, in terms of political disaster, much worse even than Downing Street parties.Likewise, it is possible that the UK Government might challenge its liability on the basis that “the tax and NICs made by Scottish residents were used to pay for public services that they previously enjoyed”, but this is not what its own website says. Moreover, would this argument be applied to pensioners in the continuing UK Lastly, as the authors point out, “the UK Government can change the qualying rights for state pensions as it sees fit”. However, how can this be done to exclude only Scots. What would a requirement, for instance, to live in the continuing UK mean for British expats living in Spain Many of the uncertainties in the report are therefore just too horrible politically to contemplate, or involve so many dficulties that their complications would surely triumph. The logical solution is surely to negotiate an agreement about ision of assets and liabilities, and secure reciprocal agreements. I don’t doubt the complexity or that certainty is imperfect, but with goodwill on both sides, rather than weaponising the issue to cause fear among the elderly, I am sure a solution agreeable to both sides can be forthcoming.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.SNPS WISHFUL THINKINGI NOTE the debate on the SNP’s assertions that the UK would fund Scottish pensions after independence. This is an extreme case of wishful thinking, as today’s taxes pay pensions, because there is no pension pot to draw on.At present the workers in the  million population pay the pensions of that population. If Scotland were to be independent, surely the workers in the  million population of rUK would pay the pensions of that population and the workers in the six million population of Scotland would pay our pensions Why would the UK Government agree to fund, out of current taxation, the pensions liability of a dferent country, when that country is receiving the tax from their own workers at the same time Scotland has a demographic handicap with fewer working people supporting all forms of benefit. The SNP solution to this is large immigration of young people, which kicks the can down the road as they will all be old and entitled to a pension one day. Pension planning in the UK and Scotland is broadly similar to a Ponzi scheme, where increasing the population gives more workers to pay pensions and benefits. This lets politicians pass the problems associated with us all living longer down to the next generation.Nicola Sturgeon says that people will notice no dference or get a bigger pension this is extremely unlikely, given that it would need the UK politicians to completely capitulate to the SNP viewpoint.The experts writing in your paper on Saturday, David Bell of the University of Stirling and David Eiser of the Fraser of Allander Institute, seemed to suggest that a fudge agreement would be most likely .Certainly more of a drawback to, than an advantage of, independence.John Leonard, Falkirk.HAVE A PLAN BEFORE THE SPLITTHE dissolution of the United Kingdom brought on by Scottish independence means that the two newly-independent entities would have no claim to UK Treasury funding as the UK would have ceased to exist. In other words pensions for England, Wales and Northern Ireland would not be paid by the UK nor would Scotland’s pensions.Arrangements would have to be made prior to the split ensuring that the qualying conditions for pension payments to former UK pensioners apply equally to both new states perhaps continuing to be based on the qualying conditions of the former UK pension scheme.Payments up to the date of the split could be overseen by a joint board of the two new states and financed by the same mechanism as before. In effect all previous UK pensions would continue to be paid as normal and from the same revenue base. This revenue stream would be the same as before but now burcated. Both new states could then review the amount of pension paid within their jurisdictions.Don Ferguson, Kirkintilloch.WE NEED ALL THE ANSWERS EARLYI WOULD sincerely hope that all negotiations regarding finance, pensions, taxation, border controls and so on are satisfactorily settled before any independence vote. Otherwise the Scottish electorate will have no understanding of the effects of voting Yes.No intelligent person votes for something without knowing what they will get as a result.Previous voters were not told of the chaos which would ensue when voting to leave. We need the truth of the outcomes before there is a vote.Barbara Jarvie, Milton of Campsie.NORWAY MADE THE RIGHT CHOICESI ALMOST choked on my Corn Flakes this morning while reading Michael Sheridans letteron the subject of Norway.Norway, in his view it seems, is only a thriving economy thanks \"disproportionately\" to the might of Great Britain and the United States, who apparently have kept the \"free world\" open and alive to capitalist endeavour. That world order, it would appear, has provided infinite pathways, both physical and financial, for Norway to expand and flourish.No mention of the mighty \"free world\" heroes having invaded or plundered other nations, stolen their resources or having killed their indigenous populations throughout history, in pursuit of the great capitalist utopia. Mr Sheridan goes on to deride Norway for pursuing \"a long-standing policy of military neutrality and exclusion of nuclear weapons\". How very dare they!We are urged by Mr Sheridan to believe that the rest of the \"free world\" is to be grateful to the might of Great Britain and the United States for the free flow of capitalism, and that Norway is a political passenger and a fortunate beneficiary of our unparalleled might.Hilarious.Kevin Orr, Bishopbriggs.* I AGREE with Michael Sheridan that Norway is not a legitimate comparator for Scotland but disagree with his reasons for saying so. The crucial dference, which appears to have escaped Mr Sheridans notice, is that Norway is an independent nation and Scotland is not. He employs the blatant oxymoron of explaining thatall the nations of the free world shared Norways aversion to militarism and nuclear weapons there would be no free world.Norway, as a free and independent nation in the s, was able to make its own choices regarding North Sea oil and gas our Scottish nation was in a very dferent situation and it is now clear that great efforts were made by the UK Government at that time to conceal the full potential economic benefits of North Sea resources from the people of Scotland.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.WILL THE SPIN DOC SURVIVE BORIS Johnson’s new Director of Communications, Guto Harri, told the press that our beloved and boisterous PM sang \"I Will Survive\" when they met on Friday. I presume then that Thursday evening’s party was still in full swing.The PM clearly impressed his new flunky, who described him as \"not a complete clown\".

This helped to fuel republican sentiment and reawaken the independence movement – in the words of the Coronation Coronach, “Nae Liz the yin, nae Lillibet the twa, nae Liz will ever dae, and we’ll mak oor land republican in the Scottish breakaway”. Pillar boxes with the offending EIIR insignia were blown up by “Sky-high Joe” and the use of EIIR was dropped. As far as I am aware, this policy continues to the present day. Salt was rubbed into the wound in  when the name of the Clyde-built Q was revealed to be Queen Elizabeth the Second. My father, a staunch Tory Unionist, was so indignant that he said he hoped it would sink.Times have moved on and one wonderssuch a gratuitous insult would be repeated nowadays.

For example, why have a full catering facility on vessels with passage time of under one hour with all the attendant costs and requirement for crew accommodation  Why build a ferry for £ million when a suitable equivalent may be built in one-third of the cost in one-third of the time  Time for radical change and more careful husbandry of taxpayers money.J Patrick Maclean, Oban.DONT KNOCK SCOTTISH ACCENTI EMPATHISE totally with Amy Kinnairdand we should remember that the Scottish pronunciation of \"Standard English\" has a much closer relationship between spelling and sounds than most English speakers of English. I may get pelters for this, but for example the \"er\" sound at the end of words is often an \"a\" as in \"finga\", \"computa\", and so on. I taught English as a foreign language in three dferent areas in Spain and never encountered any problems with my Scottish accent – Ooviously modied and at a slower pace. The Scottish \"ch\" and our clear use of \"r\" helped their understanding. It also helped with my Spanish communication.So please, do not knock the Scottish language or any other non-Standard English accent. They all have a place to play in our increasingly erse nation. Language is about communication, as we are now seeing with increased interest in British Sign Language. We should also never forget that around  per cent of our communication is by body language.

It’s about Saturday. We’ve started off well, don’t even mention those two words! Honestly, let’s keep our feet on the ground.  “We’ve beaten England before – we beat them last year and we didn’t win anything . “I would like to think Scotland have got a very good chance of winning on Saturday and then we’ll worry about anyone  after that.” Scott was equally exasperated. “I look back to the squads of  and  when nobody was thinking ahead, it was literally about the next game,” said the former centre. “They just concentrated on what was in front of them next. Nobody got carried away, especially the media.” Perhaps there is more hype now than these two legends experienced in their pomp, but the game has moved on from those amateur days of dignied understatement, and they acknowledge that it would be much worsethere was no optimistic chatter surrounding the Scotland team this week because that would mean that they had come up short against England last Saturday. As it is, the Scots are flying high after achieving back-to-back successes against the Auld Enemy for the first time in  yearsand are looking ahead to a trip to Cardf to take on a Wales team reeling from their - drubbing at the hands of Ireland at the weekend. So, this refusal to jump on the hype train should not be mistaken for a lack of admiration for what Scotland have achieved so far – or a lack of belief in what is possiblethe players and coaching team keep their focus. “You look at that performance by Scotland on Saturday and there was a full understanding of everything that happened in that game: from Finn Russell’s kicking to the defensive , to the way they coped with England’s power up-front,” agreed Scott. “In the past, some of their games have been littered with simple mistakes, but there was a unity in that performance. When Scotland go down to Cardf, they must continue to turn the screw. “The Principality Stadium Stadium will be a tough nut to crack, so they just have to knuckle down and concentrate on their own game,” he added. “There have been times in the past few years when they have gone there, played that high-tempo style, and then fallen out the game. “You have to still be in the game in the last  minutes. On Saturday they stayed in the game, stayed confident in the way they carried the ball into contact, and it will have to be the same in Wales. It is going to have to be like Groundhog Day – repeat, repeat, repeat.\"Meanwhile,Gavin is frustrated that his son, stand-off Adam, was not involved in last weekend’s game and is not going to be involved in this coming weekend’s match having been left out of Townsend’s training squad for this campaign, then he was not letting on. “I thought Finn Russell [the incumbent stand-off] had a magnicent game against England and his goalkicking was key to that, as was his kicking from hand,” he said. “His thread-through in the second half when England had lost Luke Cowan-Dickie was a massive moment. His game management was terric.” The Grand Slam Dinner is being held at Edinburgh International Conference Centre on Saturday st May, with tickets now on sale. The event – which is being held to help raise awareness and funds for Hearts + Balls, a charity which supports former players who have suffered serious injuries – was supposed to take place back in  to mark the th anniversary of the  Grand Slam but was postponed due to Covid. “Rugby has sorely missed these big group celebrations - and charities have been hit hard by not being able to utilise vital fundraising streams,” said Scott.  “Of course, the evening will be incredibly enjoyable, but to be able to know that we’re making a real dference to members of the rugby community who need our support makes it all the more special. “Hearts + Balls is an incredible charity that every single one of us is proud to be able to support.”"},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeon-scotland-through-worst-omicron---date-set-new-covid-framework","story":"Nicola Sturgeon said the country is now \"on a good track\", although baseline measures including masks, vaccine passports, and advice to take lateral flow tests before socialising remain in place.Ms Sturgeon said these were \"basic precautions\" which would help to keep virus rates down as normal le resumes and avoid the highest risk iniduals being forced into \"effective isolation\".The First Minister confirmed that the Scottish Government will publish its strategic framework setting out how Covid will be managed over the longer term on February .: Tories publish alternative Covid roadmap calling for end to blanket restrictionsIt is expected to set out the future of measures such as testing, self-isolation, vaccination, vaccine passports and masks, as well as the circumstances under which additional restrictions including physical distancing may be reintroduced. A decision on whether or not to extend requirements for face masks in secondary schools will be taken before pupilsto classrooms following the February break. Updating the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: \"After almost two years of this ordeal, I know getting back to normal for short periods followed by further disruption to our lives, is not what any of us want.\"Ato normal that is sustained is what we want and are striving for.

Omicron iant \"In the past week there has been a further increase in the number of PCR test results showing positive for the S gene and a corresponding fall in the number which don’t have the S Gene,\" said Ms Sturgeon.\"This is likely to reflect an increase in BA. cases which, like Delta, are S Gene positive. In cases of the main Omicron iant, the S Gene is absent.\"Encouragingly, there remains no evidence at this stage that the disease caused by the BA. subtype is any more severe than that caused by the main Omicron iant.\"Nor does it appear to be any more capable of evading the immunity conferred by vaccination or prior infection.\"However there is evidence, from more than one country now, of a growth advantage for BA. compared to the main Omicron iant, which may mean it is more transmissible.\"All in all, however, there are no grounds at this stage for any signicant concern about BA. - and no reason to change our approach in response to it.

Does the minister agree with me that the UK Shared Prosperity Fund should be the source of replacement funding for organisations like EMEC, that no longer have access to Interreg funding  And what#s the Scotland Office doing to make that case within Government ”Responding for the government, Iain Stewart MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Scotland said:“I#m very pleased to say that I had the pleasure of visiting Stromness last summer, and saw for myself the huge potential that Orkney has to lead the country in renewable energy. I continue to speak with the Leader of Orkney Islands Council, to explore all the ways we can help fund these exciting projects.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said:“After years of success putting the Northern Isles on the map for green energy innovation, it could be easy to forget that the success of EMEC did not come out of nowhere. Consistent support through EU funding has reaped idends for our community and for the country as a whole. It is simply a no-brainer for the government to commit to continuing that backing in full – and I shall be making the case to the minister on this matter again.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

To say the team at Dounby have rallied is nowhere near thanks enough.”OIC executive director of education, leisure and housing, James Wylie, added: “The school is experiencing a high number of teaching and support staff absences due to sickness which includes COVID, and this is now coupled with an increasing number of pupils being off across some of the classes too.“Whilst there are  reported COVID-positive LFD and PCR cases within the staff and pupils at the school, it is the combination of all the sickness absences that has led to this decision. We are looking to all measures to try and ensure the school can operate in full from Wednesday, and this will be communicated tomorrow.“Please be assured that we are doing everything we possibly can to get back to normal as soon as possible. I want to also commend the Head Teacher and her team for stepping up in these dficult circumstances.”Despite a relaxation of restrictions nationwide, it remains vital for everyone to continue carrying out lateral flow tests and to report the result, whether positive, negative or void here: https:www.nhsinform.scot # coronavirus-covid-#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There are a few things structurally that we’ve looked at that will give us a little bit more momentum to help our ball-carriers.“But it’s a really tough place to go in terms of the physicality that theybring. It’s a big work-on for us that we need to improve before we play Scotland.“We are working hard this week in terms of trying to create that momentum to allow us to move forward on to the ball, rather than be static, as we were on the weekend. vw,vw,px, px\"Wales assistant coach Jonathan Humphreys is familiar with Scotland’s strengths “We can say we need to be more physical, but how are we going to be more physical  That is what we are working on.“We don’t just want people to run harder or tackle harder.

We are on about, technically, how do we get into those positions to be able to get dominance “You see Ireland on the weekend, they are winning collisions and they have quick ball.

We are hoping to see a big improvement this weekend.“Theywill be pretty confident. Over the last period of time, they seem to be making big strides forward.“They are a good team and they’ve got a lot of British and Irish Lions there now with a lot of experience.“We are expecting them to come at us physically, and that is where our improvement has to be. We are dealing with a team that are full of threats.”Wales head coach Wayne Pivac will name his team on Thursday, with centre Uilisi Halaholo, lock Seb Davies and wing Louis Rees-Zammit all training and available for selection.Halaholo was not considered for the Ireland game due to a hamstring strain, while Davies was a late withdrawal in Dublin due to a back spasm and Rees-Zammit had his ankle strapped during the warm-up, but played the whole game. vw,vw,px, px\"Ross Moriarty could be in line to start for Wales against Scotland Pivac is not expected to make wholesale changes, although there could be a start for Dragons back-row forward Ross Moriarty.Moriarty won his th cap off the bench in Dublin.

She came in in September, then she had to leave.“When she came out of the winter break, she played well, but still now she needs a little more time to get fit again.🚨 Here we go! 🚨Your #Lionesses squad for the @ArnoldClarkCup… 🏆 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿— LionessesFebruary , “She was really disappointed of course but you need to do smart things, andyou need more time to get fit you have to take that time, otherwise you’ll be out for a longer period and that’s what we don’t want.“She needs time and then hopefully she’ll recover good and in a short while and she can build up some playing minutes with her club first.”Cha forward Beth England is another out with injury, but there is a trio of fit-again players back in the England fold.Houghton’s City team-mates Lucy Bronze and Ellie Roebuck are included for the first time under Wiegman having recovered from knee and calf issues respectively, and Arsenal’s Leah Williamson is recalled after missing the last camp in November because of an ankle injury.In Houghton’s absence, Wiegman had Williamson captaining the team before Millie Bright took over in November.Askedfull-back Bronze was a potential captain this time around, Wiegman said: “I haven’t talked to the players yet. I first do this discussion with the players when they come in, and after that I’ll tell you.”Since Wiegman took charge last September England have played six World Cup qualiers, winning them all with  goals scored and none conceded, the most recent being a - thrashing of Latvia.The inaugural Arnold Clark Cup tournament will see them host three fellow sides from the top  of FIFA’s world rankings – Olympic champions Canada at the Riverside Stadium on February , Spain at Carrow Road three days later and then Germany at Molineux another three days on from that.Wiegman has emphasised the importance of the fixtures for the team to “really know where we stand” with less than six months to go to the Euros, which England also host.The Dutchwoman added: “I thinkthe toughest . I also think this is what we need.“We had a very good autumn with these three camps, and now we need these games to really know where we are.“This is a tournament where we can really have a starting point for the preparations for the Euros – we’ve already done that, but now with these world-class opponents we’ll really know where we stand and from there, we will continue preparing for the Euros. It’s necessary to play these matches.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Populations became more economically resilient, he said.The cost of using the Faroese tunnels was at first around the same as a ferry journey but over time as usage increased, tolls were slashed to less than a fth of that.Now, Mr Lamhauge said the debate was about whether to cut the tolls altogether.The meeting also heard questions from pupils at Mid Yell and Whalsay schools as well as input from some of the  or so people viewing the debate.Among the biggest subjects for debate was where would the first tunnel be builtMr Lamhauge said it took around  years to get such projects going.The Shetland Times.Here in Norway toll roads is common to finance such projects#get the funding from the Scottish Gov and get on with it.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of .

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

I would simply urge to the court that it is already causing a huge amount of anxiety, for reasons previously stated, and the sooner this process can be completed the better for all concerned.Ms Campbell said the quality of the material she has received from the PSNI is a constant source of concern, with some information illegible and not photocopied properly.I would press to the court again thatwe could have material in a legible format it would take a lot of heat out of the disclosure process, she said.Ms Campbell added: So far as we#re concerned, in terms of identying a date, from Noah#s mother#s perspective it is much more important to have everything completed, and comprehensively completed, in advance of the inquest.We are in no rush towards a date, from that perspective, but equally, knowing the pressures on the system, and indeed on all parties, to find a date - really the sooner the better. What we don#t want is a date too far in the future.

That for some years those people who would be travelling back from ious parts of the world through Aldergrove Airport would have seen a notice about bringing food in, or anything from third countries, what they’re supposed to do.“And the EU are expecting us to do that on food coming in from Britain. Now, how many planes, how many trucks, how many cars are coming in from Great Britain to Northern Ireland every day “And the EU are demanding that we go in and ask people to open their suitcases, to open their bags, andthere’s a few mandarin oranges that they bought for the children on the way home on the ferry, that’s an at-risk item.”Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson won’t be visiting Northern Ireland imminently, following calls from DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson to do so amid the political crisis.Downing Street said Mr Johnson was monitoring the situation at Stormont closely, but there were no plans for the PM to travel over.Related topicsUlster Unionist PartySinn FéinNorthern Ireland AssemblySDLPNI ProtocolPaul GivanMichelle O#NeillTraditional Unionist VoiceEdwin PootsBoris JohnsonMore On Ulster Unionist PartyBelfast City council set to launch legal action over Poots’ port checks move PremiumLisa SmythOpinionNow it’s up to one man to find a way out of the Covid rules tangleStormont crisis: We must salvage what we can from the chaos caused by reckless DUP, says Michelle O#Neill PremiumJon TongeOpinionGambling with future of NI politics will never pay off PremiumGrassroots unionists back my calls: DonaldsonMost ReadLow number of Queen’s University Belfast academics from a Protestant background a ‘cause for concern’Watch: Surging waves engulf cars at Benone Strand under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs harvesting the fruits of their hard work and endeavourEight members of notorious UDA murder gang were police informants, says Police Ombudsman‘Cost to my health of getting a sunbed tan just wasn’t worth it’: Belfast mum with stage four skin cancer in warning over dangers of melanomaTop VideosPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea PlayMark Thompson on the browning pistol used in the Sean Graham bookies killingsPlayFamilies of bookies atrocity vow to fight for justice on th anniversaryLatest Northern IrelandOperational costs of Northern Ireland Protocol checks ‘huge’, MLAs toldMum never recovered… she died from a broken heart, says brother of teen gunned down in  Sean Graham bookmakers attackStormont organ donation laws to be named for boy on waiting list for new heartCoroner says he cannot give assurance when Noah Donohoe inquest will take placeKenneth Branagh celebrates as Belfast takes on The Power Of The Dog for OscarsLatestPolice investigating online racial abuse of Anthony ElangaKate Forbes first member of Scottish cabinet to take maternity leaveSliding oil prices pull BP and FTSE lower at the closeJacob Rees-Mogg: I don’t recall feeding PM the Jimmy Savile attack on StarmerLatest Covid- case rates for UK local authority areas,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Jonathan Porter   Press Eye FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueHealth Minister Robin Swann. Credit: Jonathan Porter   Press EyeFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailJust a few weeks ago, the Executive announced the relaxation of a raft of Covid- safety measures and promised more were on the way.Describing his delight at the development, former First Minister Paul Givan said he hoped the Executive would be in a position to review remaining restrictions this Thursday.Read MoreRobin Swann hopes to lt Covid- restrictions in Northern Ireland but warns ‘both hands tied behind back’ on health reform“The February  date will be an important meeting now for those outstanding measures that are still in place,” he said. In particular, he said he wanted to see the removal of the controversial Covid certicate scheme: “The DUP has been opposed to its introduction, today we’ve made big progress in reducing its application and I want to see further progress.”Throughout the pandemic, a number of DUP members have been high-profile opponents to many of the Covid restrictions — think Sammy Wilson describing face coverings as muzzles and Paul Frew leading the charge against offering vaccinations to children and mandatory vaccination of healthcare workers.DUP politicians have increasingly raised concerns about the effects of restrictions on the economy, apparently keen to lt the measures as soon as possible.However, following Mr Givan’s resignation, it has been left to Robin Swann to find a way to lt remaining restrictions as hospitalisations and deaths linked to the virus begin to drop.Despite all its previous posturing about the damage being caused by the Covid restrictions, it appears the fight to rid Northern Ireland of the Protocol is the priority for the DUP.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up As a result, Mr Swann, like all remaining ministers, is having to navigate a unique environment at Stormont. Firstly, he has to ascertain whether he can remove restrictions without the collective support of the Executive.Then,he gets the green light, it has to be established how this can be achieved. But the headache doesn’t stop there — as Mr Swann pointed out on Monday, Northern Ireland is finally moving out of the latest Covid- surge. With fewer people requiring hospital treatment for a Covid infection, it seemed like NI was inching closer to the point where it could begin the long and onerous task of rebuilding our decimated health service.So, last week’s decision by the DUP to remove Mr Givan from his post has been a hammer blow to the thousands of NHS staff crippled by the ravages of the pandemic and the hundreds of thousands of people waiting for hospital treatment.When Mr Swann on Monday said “our health service urgently needs an end to political point scoring”, he was absolutely right.An inclination to put votes before support for much-needed reform has already caused untold damage to the health service, while waiting lists spiralled after the Assembly collapsed in .Mr Swann had the unenviable task of tackling the issue and he admitted on Monday that it was going to be a signicant challenge. Yet now he is not only in a position where he will be solely responsible for bringing to an end Covid restrictions so detested by many, but, as hundreds of thousands of people languish on hospital waiting lists, he will be able to blame the current political instability for their suffering too.Related topicsRobin SwannThe Executive OfficePaul GivanUlster Unionist PartyPaul FrewMore On Robin SwannRobin Swann speaks of own child’s heart condition while declaring organ donation bill ‘Daithi’s Law’Signicant danger from Covid- over ‘to a degree’, claims senior Northern Ireland medic PremiumViewpointOpinionNorthern Ireland’s health at risk after broken vowsCovid-: what are the remaining restrictions in Northern Ireland Robin Swann hopes to lt Covid- restrictions in Northern Ireland but warns ‘both hands tied behind back’ on health reformMost ReadLow number of Queen’s University Belfast academics from a Protestant background a ‘cause for concern’Watch: Surging waves engulf cars at Benone Strand under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs harvesting the fruits of their hard work and endeavourEight members of notorious UDA murder gang were police informants, says Police Ombudsman‘Cost to my health of getting a sunbed tan just wasn’t worth it’: Belfast mum with stage four skin cancer in warning over dangers of melanomaTop VideosPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea PlayMark Thompson on the browning pistol used in the Sean Graham bookies killingsPlayFamilies of bookies atrocity vow to fight for justice on th anniversaryLatest Northern IrelandOperational costs of Northern Ireland Protocol checks ‘huge’, MLAs toldMum never recovered… she died from a broken heart, says brother of teen gunned down in  Sean Graham bookmakers attackStormont organ donation laws to be named for boy on waiting list for new heartCoroner says he cannot give assurance when Noah Donohoe inquest will take placeKenneth Branagh celebrates as Belfast takes on The Power Of The Dog for OscarsLatestLatest Covid- case rates for UK local authority areasKenneth Branagh: ‘It’s been a hell of a day’ following Oscar nomination successSturgeon: ‘Sickening’ abuse of Starmer lays bare ‘toxic cocktail’ of politicsJames Anderson ‘overlooked’ for England’s tour of the West IndiesOwners can apply for grants to cover up to half cost of deep retrofit for homes,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A lot of people drive down and park on the beach. It was meant to be after high tide,” she said.“We have enough experience on that beach – you think we’d know better, but we walked up to go and get a coffee and the waves were coming right in, past the coffee area right at the top there.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “All the cars were getting completely swamped, there were a few animal baskets getting dragged away, luckily there were no animals in there, all animals were safe.“It was just crazy.“There were a group of ladies going in for a swim and a few of us were a bit concerned. We were saying ‘Be careful, maybe don’t go in or,you are, maybe don’t go too deep’. Then that surge came in, just before they went into the water, thank goodness, it would have been enough to take them off their feetthey had been in.”Anna said people need to be wary of strong currents.“The pull is so strong back out again,” she added.“That is why we have been putting up messages on social media for people to stay out of the water oryou are going into the water make sure you do an appropriate risk assessment and don’t go in far. I would just say don’t go in, to be honest.“When you first drive down you don’t think it is so bad but the waves out far are really big and they are breaking really big.“We drove round to Portstewart as well and because the waves are breaking so close to shore you can see the size of them.“I know the reports are that it is going to be building all day. Hopefully the surges won’t be coming up quite as far with the tide going out.”Locals said the surging waves can happen frequently.A spokesperson for Maritime and Coast Guard Control based in Bangor said further wave surges were expected into the afternoon yesterday, but the worst had passed.They encouraged the public not to put themselves into danger attempting to capture any photographs, never to turn their back on waves and to “stay high and stay dry”, by keeping away from dangerous and rough sea conditions.Most ReadLow number of Queen’s University Belfast academics from a Protestant background a ‘cause for concern’Watch: Surging waves engulf cars at Benone Strand under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs harvesting the fruits of their hard work and endeavourEight members of notorious UDA murder gang were police informants, says Police Ombudsman‘Cost to my health of getting a sunbed tan just wasn’t worth it’: Belfast mum with stage four skin cancer in warning over dangers of melanomaTop VideosPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea PlayMark Thompson on the browning pistol used in the Sean Graham bookies killingsPlayFamilies of bookies atrocity vow to fight for justice on th anniversaryLatest Northern IrelandOperational costs of Northern Ireland Protocol checks ‘huge’, MLAs toldMum never recovered… she died from a broken heart, says brother of teen gunned down in  Sean Graham bookmakers attackStormont organ donation laws to be named for boy on waiting list for new heartCoroner says he cannot give assurance when Noah Donohoe inquest will take placeKenneth Branagh celebrates as Belfast takes on The Power Of The Dog for OscarsLatestJacob Rees-Mogg: I don’t recall feeding PM the Jimmy Savile attack on StarmerLatest Covid- case rates for UK local authority areasKenneth Branagh: ‘It’s been a hell of a day’ following Oscar nomination successSturgeon: ‘Sickening’ abuse of Starmer lays bare ‘toxic cocktail’ of politicsJames Anderson ‘overlooked’ for England’s tour of the West Indies,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

calls from some Stormont parties.Speaking to the media on Tuesday, Mr Lewis said it is right that the election date remains May .Following the resignation of Paul Givan as First Minister and the collapse of the Executive last week, Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald said Mr Lewis should bring forward the Assembly election.DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson did not specically call for one but said his party were ready to fight an election.Other parties however rejected the idea of an early election, with fears that essential legislation could be stymiedStormont goes into an early period of purdah.Mr Lewis said it was already close enough to the current election period.The Assembly under the new rules can continue to , it#s right we allow MLAs time and space to pass legislation, I#ll be

resolved ahead of Stormont electionEarly Stormont election push follows condemnation of resignation of Paul GivanMeanwhile, a Northern Ireland Office minister has said the resignation of Northern Ireland#s first minister will not fundamentally alter the UK#s negotiations with the EU over the Brexit protocol.Conor Burns also repeated the Government#s call for the DUP to reinstate a first minister following the removal of Paul Givan over what the DUP regards as a lack of progress in negotiations to tackle issues with the protocol.I have to say very candidly that the Government is clear on our intentions with thecommission on the protocol and the withdrawal of the first minister will not fundamentally alter the Government#s determination to carry on engaging with the commission to find resolution, to find solutions to the situation in Northern Ireland, recognising the uniqueness of the position of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom single market but also buttressing against the single market of the European Union in the form of the Irish Republic, he told the Northern Ireland Affairs committee.From a UK Government point of view, in terms of protocol conversations, the plan is clear and the plan is continuing to be played out led by the Foreign Secretary.Mr Burns said the Government profoundly regrets the withdrawal of the first minister and have urged the DUP to get the first minister back in.He said we#ve been here before, but added there is a fundamental dference to the position now as ministers are still in place and the Assembly is still sitting.We have not actually witnessed a collapse of the institutions in the way they had before, he said, adding he noted a degree of positioning ahead of the Assembly elections.He said he believed there would be a very dferent reaction from partiesthey were two or more years away from the next election.Related topicsBrandon LewisMore On Brandon LewisNIO’s office move to city centre

They went through a few phases, allowing their out half to burst through a couple of tackles to score and take a - half time lead.Playing with the conditions in the second half, Ballynahinch started the on the front foot but fell foul of the referee at the breakdown, allowing Lurgan to pin them back in their own .The visiting forwards then went to work, carrying hard and scoring another try.The conversion left the home side  points down, but they hit back almost immediately with some great attacking rugby creating space for Callum McCargo to smash his way over.The game was on the line at this point, but a lack of composure allowed the excellent Lurgan full back to punish weak tackling and score a long range try.Left with a mountain to climb, Ballynahinch once again played some superb rugby with great interplay between centres James Graham and Harvey Campbell creating space for Sam Hamilton to dash for the line.He was stopped short but desperate Lurgan defending saw them receive a yellow card before Matthew McAuley reduced the deficit to five points with a try from a quickly taken penalty.A smash-and-grab victory against  men with only a minute on the clock demanded error-free rugby and after an excellent restart Ballynahinch moved upfield.However a knock-on saw the referee blow his whistle for full time and Lurgan earned a deserved victory.Both sides can be proud and the game was played in a superb spirit with the teams having lunch together in the clubhouse..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Mourne.jpg","title":"Beauty of local landscapes feature in exploration events  ","story":"SEVERAL familiar locations in Downpatrick, Newcastle and Strangford are at the heart of this monthrsquos Northern Ireland Science Festival.There will be a selection of events between February  and  with people across the district encouraged to explore something new as ious venues prepare to play host to a series of stirring events.The so-called STEM celebration mdash which has grown to become the largest of its kind in Ireland mdash boasts more than  events over  days.On February , the St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick is the venue for the Patrick  The Pagan Hills event which provides an opportunity to follow in the footsteps of both the patron saint and pagan in an exploration of the landscape that Patrick himself encountered when he ed to Ireland nearly , years ago.On February  and , the Strangford Activity Centre is hosting a ldquopaddle back in time kayak adventure to Mahee Island following a traditional smuggling route undertaken by Daft Eddie and the Merry Hearts.There will also be an opportunity to discover ruins of the monastic site of Nendrum, le in the monastery in the Middle Ages and the role played by the Vikings in the Strangford Lough area between the th and th centuries.The Strangford Activity Centre is also hosting ldquopaddle with a purpose on February  and  with participants invited to do their bit for the environment by joining a clean-up of Strangford Lough.And ldquoforaging afloat on February  and  at the same venue sees people joining with the Centrersquos Rory Martin and Andrea and Graham Gannon of Peninsula Kelp for a unique guide to the sights and flavour of the area as spring arrives on the lough and with it an array of seasonal wild food.On February , therersquos an opportunity to discover the wonders of the Mournes at a range of festival events.During the Diamond Rock Walking Tour on February , guide Peter Rafferty will explains how to identy erse rock types and how the Mournes were formed, alongside learning about the amazing geology and history of the area at the Geology on the Rocks event on February .The following day, the Men of Mourne ndash Stone  Steel hiking tour takes place with an opportunity to hear stories of hardship and endurance as participants take to rocky mountain tracks.During the Mourne Stone Walling ndash A Granite Kingdom event, therersquos a chance to experience the beauty and hard graft behind the ,-year-old craft of dry-stone wall building. A date for the event has yet to be confirmed.On February  at the Newcastle Community Cinema, Film Hub NI is inviting families to a special screening of lsquoThe Snail and the Whalersquo, a joyous, empowering story about the natural wonders of the world and discovering that no matter how small you are, you can make a dference.And to coincide with this special screening, NI Science Festival has organised an interactive seashore adventure with Beach Schools NI which will take place a short walk from the cinema and is included in the ticket price.Festival director, Chris McCreery, said the event exists to engage audiences, stimulate discussion, and ignite interest in the wonders of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.ldquoWe are confident that this yearrsquos erse programming will expand the horizons of festival goers of all ages and abilities across Northern Ireland, he added.The Science Festival is supported by the Department for the Economy, Belfast City Council, Tourism NI, Derry City and Strabane Council, Queenrsquos University,Ulster University, British Council Northern Ireland, MCS Group, The Open University NI, Innovate UK, Matrix NI, Film Hub NI and Arts and Business NI..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  February 5%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash The Downe Hospital has been identied as the possible site of a new police station in Downpatrick.The Police Authority has expressed an interest in the large site in a move which would pave the way for the construction of a new Downe Hospital, utilising Lecale House and the Maternity Hospital as the core buildings on the Ardglass Road.The present Downe Hospital, medical assessment unit and nurses home would then be completely demolished to make way for a new police base.Police Authority officials toured the hospital complex before Christmas and are reported to be impressed with both the size of the site and its central location.The officials have also held informal discussions with representatives of the Eastern Health Board who are also believed to be attracted to the plan.The revenue generated by the sale of the massive complex would go a long way to paying for the construction of a new hospital which politicians have called for on numerous occasions.A spokeswoman for the Police Authority said it is not normal policy to comment on such matters, and she added that there is still a commitment to build a new police base on the Ballydugan Road.Although the Authority has obtained outline planning permission for the Ballydugan Road site, it is believed that the nature of the land and the potential size of the highly fortied station is causing concern.Publicly the Authority is pressing ahead with plans to build there, but behind the scenes it has continued to look at possible sites in ious town locations.The Downe Hospital has now emerged as the surprise front-runner although evensuch an ambitious plan is approved, it will be many years before a police station is operational on the site.ARDGLASS ndash A special sub-committee has been set up by Down District Council to consider the European Communityrsquos review of the common fisheries policy.The committee is to be empowered to provide a response to the document.Ardglass SDLP councillor, Mr Dermot Curran, said some of the systems that were being introduced by the EC are not very helpful to the people employed in the fishing industry. Others were, such as decommissioning, but are not being put into action.ldquoIn all of these schemes there is nothing to protect the people employed in the industry. Government must do something to help the plight of these people, said Mr Curran.He complained that these workers are treated as casual labour with no claim to redundancy or national assistance.ldquoThe fishing industry plays a very important part in the economy of Northern Ireland and we must protect it and the people who work in it. Government should set up systems to ensure that everybody is treated fairly, he said.Ulster Unionist, Mr Gerry Douglas, said something has to be done to assist and to at least ensure that the processing industry is retained in Down District.KILLINCHY ndash The  new jobs announced by the Northern Ireland Spinners group as part of a pound.m investment will have no direct impact on its Killinchy factory.A spokesman for the company explained following Thursdayrsquos official announcement that the expansion of the firmrsquos sister factory in Newtownards will have no adverse impact on the Killinchy operation.ldquoThey are sister factories, both concentrating on very similar yarns, he said.ldquoWe have already completed major expansions at Killinchy, virtually replacing all the machinery we had. Killinchy is a very modern mill, as modern as Newtownards, he added.Mr Ray Dinsdale, chief executive of Richards Plc, the Aberdeen-based parent company of Northern Ireland Spinners, said: ldquoThis investment will strengthen the position of Northern Ireland Spinners as the largest United Kingdom spinner of semi-worsted yarns for carpet manufacturers.ldquoOur strategy is based on the expansion of the business into Europe, and the investment will mean that Northern Ireland Spinners will be of the size required to enable it to offer the economies of scale and cost reductions which are required to win business from major carpet manufacturers in these competitive markets, added Mr Dinsdale.CROSSGAR ndash Crossgarrsquos loss has been Bangorrsquos gain with a -job factory picking up an important quality certication.The firm of Dunn and CompanyLtd. was set up in Crossgar in , and it has now picked up the BS quality certication.After four years of trading, the company relocated from its premises in Crossgar to a factory unit based in Balloo industrial estate, Bangor.It manufacturers special purpose valves and precision components for industrial application with  per cent of it business going to the export market.It currently employs  people and has plans for further expansion, explained Mr Ron Dunn, managing director.When asked why the company left Crossgar, Mr Ron Dunn, managing director said: ldquoThere was not enough room in Crossgar.ldquoWe occupied part of the premises of my brother, Sam, but there was just nothing available in the Crossgar area at that time when we employed three of four people.His brother continues his own successful firm manufacturing machine tools on the Saintfield Road, Crossgar.BISHOPSCOURT ndash Planning Service officials have been urged to attend next monthrsquos first bike race at the former Bishopscourt base ndash before reaching a decision on a planning application for a permanent circuit.The plea has been made this week by local SDLP councillor, Mr John Ritchie.ldquoI would expect they will understand the necessity to attend to make an informed judgement on the matter, explained Mr Ritchie.ldquoAfter that date I would hope a decision would not be long delayed.Mr Ritchie said he had read the petition against the proposed race track and seen the comments of those members of the Ballyhornan Development Association who support the proposal. He had also read the details given by the two developers.ldquoThere are a number of issues involved. I understand that there can be up to  meetings without planning permission per year the equivalent of one a month and two a month in two summer months. I would have thought this wasnrsquot unreasonable.SAINTFIELD ndash The centre of Saintfield was sealed off for three hours on Friday afternoon after the discovery of a suspicious package in a telephone box.The area around Crossgar Road and Toddrsquos Hill was closed as army bomb disposal experts carried out an examination of the device.The device which consisted of cassettes, a battery pack and wires, was described as an elaborate hoax and was taken away for examination.NEWCASTLE ndash Mentally handicapped people from all over Northern Ireland will soon be benefitting from a remarkable transformation at Newcastlersquos Ruby House.For the past year passers-by have seen the conversion of the Bryansford Road complex from a row of not-so-attractive seaside resort houses into aspacious and modern residential home which now offers accommodation for  mentally handicapped adults.This year the holiday home is expected to provide upwards of  holidays for mentally handicapped people from all over the Province.The Ruby House Group now has three centres in Newcastle, including a converted house in Main Street and the purpose-built Mary Murray House in the Lawnfield.STRANGFORD ndash A single Strangford Lough management committee is to be launched in the spring by the Environment Department.It will consist of about  representatives of lough users, the community around the lough and those with specialist knowledge of the area.This weekrsquos announcement reflects some of the views expressed by the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association the body which was set up a few years ago in protest against restrictive DoE proposals.The new body will have the development of management proposals for the lough area as its main task. It will be consulted on any designations or proposals by government or local government relating to the area, including the marine nature reserve..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2022_Celtic.jpg","title":"Gibney’s Hoops double  ","story":"IT was a case of what could have been for Killough, as Celtic Bhoys capitalised on opportunities to stay in the race for the title on Saturday.From the refereersquos first whistle it was a heated event at Ballyhornan with both sides looking to grab possession.The advantage of the wind was with Celtic Bhoys in the first half, and it was a minor error by Killough goalkeeper, James Crangle, in the fourth minute that gted Jay Gibney his first goal of the game.Cranglersquos kick out went direct to the striker and Gibney made no mistake with his finish.The Killough players looked more driven by this and showed great character supporting their goalkeeper to get his head back into the game. Connor Kelly had a chance for the visitors, but Celtic Bhoysrsquo goalkeeper, Nathan Curran, was on form and saved.It was a balanced game as both sides had their chances with Killoughrsquos Kevin Groves coming close in the th minute and Celtic Bhoysrsquo Jordan McCoubrey pushing forwarding search of an opportunity in front of the net.Killoughrsquos Gareth George had to be subbed due to an injury on his ankle and Declan Looney came on in the rd minute of the game. Jack McLaughlin had a one on one chance facing Curran, but the ball went straight at the lsquokeeper before it was cleared.The visitors were keeping up the pressure to level the score, with a surging run up the left wing from Looney, who passed across to find Connor Kelly, but again Nathan Curran saved.The second goal of the game came from a similar scenario to the first ndash a lacklustre kick out that found the feet of Jay Gibney again and Celtic Bhoys went two up going into half-time.Two errors by Killoughrsquos goalkeeper saw the hosts leading at half-time and all of the play was going down the right side of the field.Killough signalled their intentions that the game was not over, as Declan Looney looped the ball into the danger zone, and Nathan Curran somehow got his hand to it to push over the bar.Jay Gibney was set for his hat-trick in the th minute when the Killough custodian came out to stop him in his tracks. Gibney managed to manoeuvre round him, but the ball was cleared by Sean Burns. Celtic Bhoys had another chance to go three up, as three of their players from a free-kick stood looking at one another and the chance went a miss.Killoughrsquos Declan Burns played a great ball from the middle of the field to Declan Looney, who found team-mate Daniel Taggart. The striker saw his shot saved, but the rebound fell to Kevin Groves, who finished to bring his side back into the game with  minutes to go.Celtic Bhoys made a couple of substitutes in the next ten minutes, with Sean McMahon going up front and Sean Ferris ping back into midfield.As the clock ticked to the th minute, Killoughrsquos McLaughlin fired in a free-kick to the head of Eamon Gargan.However, man of the match Nathan Curran pushed the ball at full stretch over the bar.In the final five minutes of play it was all attack by Killough. Kevin Groves had a chance which was denied with Declan Looney quickly following up, although there was no way to find the leveller. It was in the last minute that the Killough goalkeeper made a clearance mistake that saw Shaun Megahey score to break Killough hearts.Celtic Bhoys will be very happy with the win, while Killough will count their missed chances. Nathan Curran made the dference in a tight game, and Killoughrsquos young Crangle will have learnt a lot from the contest for the remaining matches of the season.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, R Fitzpatrick, M Rice, C Doherty, B Tracey, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: E Kelly for P Casey, S McMahon for J McCoubrey, S Ferris for Conaill Kerr.Killough FC: J Crangle, R Burns, E Gargan, C Burns, S Og Burns, D Burns, C Kelly, G George, D Taggart, K Groves, J McLaughlin.Subs: D Looney for G George, K Tierney, C Doyle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Wave.jpg","title":"It’s like a little  safe haven here%2C somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged  ","story":"TEARS still spring easily to the eyes of Dympna Kerr, the sister of Columba McVeigh, one of the lsquoDisappearedrsquo victims.Once she begins to talk about her  year-old brother, whose body has never been recovered after he was abducted and murdered by the IRA in , after nearly  years of dealing with his loss the pain remains.Last weekend, the Donaghmore woman left her home in St Helenrsquos in Merseyside to travel to a welcoming building in the coastal village of Killough.At the newly named Wave By The Sea centre in Castle Street, Dympna spent precious time speaking with longstanding friends who are also relatives of the Disappeared. The main dference is that they have been fortunate to locate the bodies of their loved one. Several searches have yet toher brotherrsquos remains to the family but they remain hopeful.ldquoItrsquos like a little safe haven here, somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged. The people you are crying to know why you are crying as they understand, explained Dympna about her lasting need to connect with people with shared experience.ldquoGoing to the Wave house in Belfast is like going home. Itrsquos like getting a hug as soon as you go across the door. And itrsquos the same here as Irsquove already been several times.The help and support of the iniduals who make up the Wave Trauma Centre quietly helps thousands of people like Dympna who have been bereaved, injured and or traumatised by the decades of conflict in Northern Ireland.The building has been provided by the local trustees of The Kinder Project, a charitable Dutch organisation that began its association with Northern Ireland in the s for the education and social welfare of disadvantaged children and young adults.The hostel now provides residential breaks for a maximum of  people, providing rooms for families and iniduals, who use the time to break away from their lives still traumatised and dealing with the physical and emotional aftermath.Counselling and complimentary therapy sessions are offered and other courses are provided by Wave to help those who come, many of whom have never sought help before.Itrsquos the sixth centre around the province that Wave has established, along with r satellite projects, with support funding from the Victims and Support Service, NI Executive, Special EU Programmes Body and charitable donations.One of the Troubles survivors who wished the service had been available locally for him and his family is Killough man Peter Heathwood.Peter knows the benefit of support from Wave. In September  he was left paralysed after a Loyalist gun attack in his Belfast home as he played with his youngest daughter in his living room mdash bullets missing the baby by inches.His attack was witnessed by his late we and two eldest children. His father Hubert died from a heart attack at the scene when he saw his apparently dead son.As a member of the Wave Injured Group, he has campaigned for years for a state pension for people left physically or psychologically injured from the conflict.He has yet to receive his pension, even though he applied for it last autumn.ldquoI had to travel to Belfast night and day and only discovered Wave when I went on to the Victimsrsquo Forum years after my shooting, said Peter.ldquoMy we died at  with a diagnosis of PTSD and suffered with flashbacks. If I had found Wave earlier, I reckon it could have saved her as she could have met other women and shared stories and experiences.ldquoWhen I was shot, I passed out but she saw me lying there with blood pumping out of me, children screaming and my father dying. She could never deal with the fact that she opened the door to the gunmen. But I told her thatshe hadnrsquot have shouted a warning to me, I would have been dead as I was able to get up and slam the door.ldquoEven in this village, there are people who moved from Belfast and a lot of them lost relatives in the Troubles, uncles, fathers, grandfathers and many of them never speak about it. I didnrsquot really talk about it to my own children as you didnrsquot want them to be filled with hate.Peter said that even on holiday when people asked what happened to him, he would say he was injured skiing in the French Alps, a more sanitised version of his attack mdash purportedly in mistake for another man mdash as he enjoyed an evening at home with his family.ldquoWave is a fantastic organisation.

Everyone has been hurt by all groups and thatrsquos the great strength of it, said Peter.ldquoI would really encourage anyone who has affected by the Troubles and has never sought help to come along to Wave. Itrsquos never too late to talk.Waversquos chief executive officer, Sandra Peake, says that the new centre will help  people in the immediate area and around  from the district, in addition to providing weekend residential breaks from families across Northern Ireland, Britain and the Irish Republic.ldquoThis wouldnrsquot have been possible without the generosity of the Kinder Project, explained Sandra, who said that the building has been fitted out to reflect a more comfortable family style accommodation.ldquoWe had initially done some work in Downpatrick about  years ago to see what we could have provided but have always been keen to provide a local base, which Kinder has now provided to us.ldquoThe welcome from the people and the shopkeepers of Killough has been brilliant. They seem to know why our visitors are staying here and give them a respectful place and go beyond and above to help them.ldquoSome of the families have enjoyed paddle boarding lessons on the water with children experiencing this type of activity for the first time. One grandmother got to sleep in a bed for the first time in years as she normally sleeps on the couch to let her grandchildren have the bed.Wave By The Sea is much more than a weekend or holiday break.ldquoWe aim to provide a holistic service here for people. It will start with an outreach case worker working with you to establish what your needs are and then that moves us into seeing what we can provide, whether its counselling, physiotherapy, group support and so on, Sandra continued.ldquoSeventy per cent of Waversquos work is service provision, the remainder is trauma education. We have a whole range of short trauma courses now and we hope to run courses her.ldquoThey deal with how trauma affects families, recognising the impact of trauma and how to build resilience, the intergenerational impact and issues such as trauma addiction as we would see people with issues. We also provide trauma education for healthcare professionals and student doctors, nurses, and social workers.She predicts an increase of demand for services as new referrals increased last year in part due to interest in the Injured Pension scheme and the proposed Legacy proposals.ldquoThe majority of people coming to us now have never gone anyway for help. But dferent things are stirring memories. We hope to provide counselling and complementary therapy sessions in Newcastle within a few months.Sandra is recruiting a Health and Wellbeing caseworker who would be based in Killough but would also work in the Newcastle area and stressed that all services were provided on a confidential basis.One of the trustees of the Kinder Project, local man Dr Finbar McCormick, is delighted that the building is being used by Wave.ldquoKinder was a Dutch charity that took children from troubled areas to Holland in the s and then established a local centre in Killough for breaks, he explained. ldquoChildren from other troubled spots like Kosovo and the Balkans were also taken for holidays here over the years.ldquoWith the peace process, the need for the Kinder House just fell away and we were looking for another group to pass it onto so that they could make good use of it.ldquoI happened to meet Peter, who I know, one day while out for a walk and I said to him that we really needed to find another group to use the hostel. Peter said that he would mention it to Wave and that was about  months and Wave has been using it for the last six months.ldquoIt was an excellent choice for us as we really wanted to keep the place going and Wave will continue the same aims that Kinder had.To apply for the caseworker position or to access services, visit Wave www.wavetraumacentre.org.uk or ring   ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2022_Kilcoo.jpg","title":"Kilcoo set for Croker  ","story":"KILCOO are officially back to back All-Ireland Senior Club Championship finalists after a gruelling clash with Cork side, St Finbarrrsquos, was dramatically settled in extra-time on Saturday.In a thoroughly entertaining contest that had twist after twist, Mickey Moranrsquos men eventually booked their place to contend for the Andy Merrigan Cupwhich has agonisingly eluded the local outfit over the last few years.With the headlines seemingly written in the dying seconds of regulation time, Kilcoorsquos Paul Devlin steadied his frame to send the deciding free between the posts.However, a moment of off-the-ball madness from team-mate Aidan Branagan resulted in a sending off and a further  minutes of added drama.Despite this, the Magpies showed their stamina and experience within this competition and managed to finish comfortably five points adrt from their opponents.The scene was set at a mild Portlaoise venue as sunshine attempted to split through the clouds and past the overshadowing OrsquoMoore Park spectator stands where the Ulster and Munster champions prepared to lock horns.Although the local side won referee Brendan Cawleyrsquos throw-in, it would be The Barrrsquos who would open the scoring from a Cillian Myers-Murray effort.Kilcoo replied rapidly through the reliable Ryan Johnston, who navigated his way past the opposing defence to curl one over the bar to level the tie.The Magpies would soon be soaring when they immediately turned over possession and saw an opportunity for the first goal of the match.Jerome Johnston cleverly spotted his brother, Ryan, and played a quick hand pass into his path where he made no mistake in burying his effort into the top left corner of the net beyond the ing Barrrsquosrsquo custodian, John Kerins.Despite this early blow, the Cork-based outfit remained determined and went on the offensive.Eoin McGreevy took the mark and kicked over before receiving a yellow card for a high tackle on Ryan Johnston.Kilcoorsquos Conor Laverty was rewarded for his tireless work ethic in the form of winning a free, although team-mate Paul Devlin saw his effort uncharacteristically drt wide from what was a very straightforward chance.Colin Lyons was the latest to enter Cawleyrsquos book with  minutes played following a late tackle on Niall Branagan that left the Kilcoo number two worse for wear.Steven Sherlock successfully converted his first of ten frees for The Barrrsquos to bring his side to within a point, but Laverty answered this with a score from play to widen the winning margin once more.St Finbarrrsquos were notably the physically bigger side and it was clear they were initiating a rougher style of play.This was evident after Sherlock again split the posts from a free, when Kilcoorsquos Ceilum Doherty looked to reply and instead was clattered by defender Sam Ryan.This time, Devlin made no mistake with his attempt which would have helped settle his nerves from his earlier miss.Sherlock pointed his third free of the match in retaliation in what was now a tit for tat contest.However, The Barrrsquos managed to swing the tie hugely in their favour when Kilcoorsquos Daryl Branagan forfeited possession close to his goal and the onrushing Eoin Comyns took full advantage.The Barrrsquos number nine quickly passed to team-mate Sherlock, who set up McGreevy for their sidersquos first goal of the match.Despite the efforts of Kilcoo lsquokeeper Niall Kane, McGreevy managed to creep his shot round the custodian to fire his team into the lead minutes before half-time.With seconds to the interval, Denis OrsquoBrien received a yellow to join the growing list of his St Finbarrrsquos team-mates to go into the refereersquos book.As the whistle sounded, both sides engaged in some roughhousing as tensions reached fever pitch.Half time: St Finbarrrsquos - Kilcoo -.The Barrrsquos won the second half throw-in and went on the attack through a surging Sherlock run that resulted in a free - which he duly converted.This sprung The Magpies into action with rising star Shealan Johnston running past three defenders before kicking over the bar for a magnicent solo point. Team-mate Devlin then converted a free to pile on the pressure.Opposing number eights, Dylan Ward and Ian Maguire, were having a notable midfield battle which drew attention fromboth sets of supporters on numerous occasions but often it was the Kilcoo man coming out on top.lsquoKeeper Kane kicked an effort off the ground and over the bar on the rd minute before Eugene Branagan scored a point from play to give The Magpies the lead.As was the theme of the contest, Sherlock knocked over a brace of frees for the Munster champions and the score line swayed once more.Daryl Branagan curled two points from play over the bar before Ryan McEvoy was shown the yellow card for a foul on the opposition. Sherlock duly converted the resulting free and now the game was in its last ten minutes of regulation time.Ward received a yellow card for more off the ball antics with Maguire but Kilcoo kept on scoring through the left boot of Devlin, who split the posts after receiving a neat pass from Daryl Branagan.As the officials indicated four additional minutes, The Magpies held a narrow one point lead with the scores reading - to -.On the rd minute, The Barrrsquos were afforded the chance to draw level from a long ranged free which Sherlock made no mistake in doing.With seemingly one lastthrow of the dice, Kilcoo launched the ball forward to the experienced Devlin, who drew the foul as he attempted to pick up the pass.With what everyone thought was the final kick of the game, Devlin prepared to knock over his free and send his side through to a second successive All-Ireland final.However, there would be one last twist before the whistle.To everyone in attendance and those watching at homersquos disbelief, Kilcoo joint-captain Aidan Branagan, who was only on the pitch for a matter of minutes, needlessly collided with Barrrsquos replacement Adam Lyne off-the-ball.After brief deliberation, referee Cawley gave Branagan his marching orders in the form of a red card and reversed his decision from a free to a throw ball.The full-time whistle sounded seconds later and the game headed to extra-time.Despite the high drama, Kilcoo would not be denied and dominated the following duration of the contest.Custodian Kane was first to kick over, before Anthony Morgan doubled the deficit. Sherlock pulled one back for The Barrrsquos from a free but Micheal Rooney quickly cancelled this out at the other end.Devlin extended the lead to three and yet again Sherlock proved reliable for The Barrrsquos through a converted free.However, Kilcoo clearly had prepared for these extraminutes and scoring opportunities looked to be seldom for their opposition, although Colm Barrett did split the posts after Devlin curled over another point.lsquoKeeper Kane saw his rsquo sail over the bar to restore a two point lead and from here St Finbarrrsquos ran out of gas.Jamie Burns saw red for the Cork side after punching out at Doherty, and Kilcoo were now afforded the extra space to stamp their authority in the closing minutes.Despite Ward picking up a late black card, a brace of Doherty points rounded off the scoring as the match finally reached its climax at - to -.After the contest, Kilcoo lsquokeeper Niall Kane spoke about his sidersquos performance and reaching yet another All-Ireland final.ldquoWe knew it was going to be tough when you get to the last four in Ireland, he said.ldquoYes everybody was saying Kilcoo were going to be red hot favourites, but deep down we knew St Finbarrrsquos are no walkover and they proved that.ldquoItrsquos only a semi-final, therersquos nothing won yet so we are back at it in the morning, get our recovery and training Monday night.St Finbarrrsquos: J Kerins S Ryan, J Burns, C Scully C Lyons, B Hennessy, A OrsquoConnor I Maguire, Eoin Comyms D OrsquoBrien, S Sherlock , B Hayes C Myers-Murray , E McGreevy , C McCrickard.Subs: E Dennehy for C Myers-Murray, C Barrettfor D OrsquoBrien, M Shields for E McGreevy, A Lyne for C McCrickard.Kilcoo: N KaneN Branagan, R McEvoy, Aaron BranaganM Rooney, D Branagan , E BranaganD Ward, Aaron Morgan C Doherty , J Johnston, S JohnstonC Laverty, R Johnston , P Devlin .Subs: Anthony Morganfor Laverty, Aidan Branagan for Aaron Morgan, C Laverty for Aidan Branagan, T Fettes for R Johnston, J Clarke for M Rooney.Referee: Brendan Cawley ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Death.jpg","title":"Marc (18) remembered as ‘an unassuming and polite young man’  ","story":"THE funeral of a teenager who died in a road accident near Castlewellan at the weekend takes place later today.Marc Quinn died after being struck by a car on the Newcastle Road in the early hours of Sunday morning.It is believed that Marc, who celebrated his th birthday last Wednesday, was walking home when the accident occurred shortly before .am.He was treated at the scene before being taken to hospital, but sadly died a short time later.Police are appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident to contact them.The funeral cortege will leave Marcrsquos home in Annsborough today at .pm for Requiem Mass in St Malachyrsquos Church in Castlewellan at pm, to be followed by interment at St Maryrsquos Cemetery, Aughlisnafin.Marc was a talented Gaelic footballer who was a senior player for Aughlisnafin GAC.His mother, Jenny, is the club secretary, and his father, Garry, is a former player.

The tactic looked like paying off, but at the post So Ladylike, with Caoimhe OrsquoBrien in the saddle, got up to provide the rider with her second success, her first coming on this Alana McGuinness-owned runner back in October. Ballinasilla finished a close third.The winner is trained by Ian Donoghue, a brother of top Northern Ireland jockey Keith, who is no longer with Gordon Elliott.Only six of the  entries took part in the Dennison JCB Maiden Race for five year-old geldings, but the race provided spectators with a close finish.The Aaron Sinnott-ridden Song For My Father, owned and trained in Co Cavan by Shane Donohoe, just passed the judge ahead of Time For A Pint, ridden by Tom Hamilton for Co Carlow trainer Shark Hanlon, with Hapy La Vie back in third ahead of Old Style Humor.It was not long before a stewardsrsquo enquiry was called with the result that the winner was disqualied for failing to draw the correct weight. Time For A Pint was placed first ahead of Hapy La Vie and Old Style Humor .Four set out in the Kingsfield Stud five year-old Mares Maiden Race, but only three remained after the fourth fence, after Paddy Cleary lost his irons and was unseated.This left Born Famous to win from Famous Function and local hope Social Distancing. For trainer Claire OrsquoConnell it was a welcome winner. Paul Bannon was the successful rider.The Cosy Roof Open Race saw the grey Creadan Grae make most of the running but in the end had to be content with second to the ex-English trained Brain Power mdash a rare open horse for Warren Ewing, who is best known for producing top four year-olds.The successful rider was Maghera-based Oran McGill who was replacing his injured younger brother Dara. Warren is part of the well known fish merchant family. Third home was Bajan Excell, ridden by Ben OrsquoBrien.The connections of the runner-up in this race, Broughshane owner Philip McBurney, rider Noel McParlan and trainer Gerry Quinn, also based at Broughshane, had better fortune in the Armstrong Auctions  year-old and Upwards Mares Maiden when Tamlaght Eyes, pulled up in her previous three races, proved to be the smooth winner from the Lee Shawagen-ridden Any Time with Castle Arms Casa a very close third.The final race on the card was the G Curran  Co Ltd Maiden Race for  year-old and Upwards Geldings. Ask Charlie was the easy winner from Kilmoganny, ridden by Tiernan Power-Roche, and Robbie Armstrongrsquos ex-English trained Carolersquos Templer, ridden by Deckie Lavery.Good to see the long established Denis Reddan colours in the winning enclosure. Ridden by Ben Harvey, the winner is trained by his father, William.Perhaps the result may have been dferent had Paul Bannon not become unseated at the final fence of his mount Butcher Barry.Best turned out in all races as usual was courtesy of Glencairn Stables.Acting stewards: Rev Colin Hall-Thompson, Max and Margaret Evine and David Aiken.Ballee jockey Toni Quail, out of action with a broken ankle as a result of a schooling accident, was helping with declarations at the meeting.A tribute was paid to the late Maurice King who for many years was a vet at the meeting.The next meeting at Tyrella is on Saturday, March . Prior to that, the North Down meeting at Kirkistown will take place on February . First race is at pm. The same evening the East Down Hunt Ball will take place at Ballydugan Mill.Victor Reid, a long time owner and breeder along with his late we Margaret, sadly passed away suddenly at hospital on Friday. His son, Neville, still has horses in training. The late Drew Reid also from Banbridge, rode many of Victorrsquos horses in point-to-points.A notable absentee at the entrance on Saturday was William McDowell, although he was present.

Tourism currently represents a considerable percentage of Northern Ireland’s GDP, but unsightly rural roads and hedgerows are unlikely to inspire atrip and can damage the perception of our region.”David Brown, Deputy President of Ulster Farmers’ Union said illegal dumping is an increasing issue in rural areas: “Fly-tipping is a scourge on the countryside and one that too many of our farmers have experienced first-hand. Dumping unwanted waste in rural areas is dangerous to human health and harmful to livestock and wildle. In the past, there have been issues where fly-tipping waste polluted watercourses and contaminated land.“When unwanted content is dumped on a farmer’s land, it becomes the responsibility of the landowner to dispose of, while local councils are left to take ownership of waste on public land and highways. This is both costly and time consuming for farmers and ratepayers.“Since the pandemic began, the amount of litter being dumped on farmers’ land has increased, with many rediscovering the outdoors for recreation. I urge all countryside visitors to be more considerate of those living locally, and of animals and to commit to taking their waste home with them.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

After waiting for three golfers to complete the hole they moved on locating their first stile in woodland which led into fields containing sheep as the sun put in an appearance.A descent led them to the ruined buildings and old stable block at Cefncarnau-fawr along with a mysterious ivy clad ruined building, where they deviated along a narrow muddy track in woodland to enter fields, where boots crunched over frozen uneven mud as they approached a stile leading into Coed-y-wenallt.A wide wet and muddy pathway populated with dog walkers led them to a wooden footbridge and across the fast flowing Nant Cwm Nofydd for the climb up to Rhiwbina Hill and a short road walk before turning into Fforestganol.A steep climb past water gushing down the bare hillside in small waterfalls led them through Heol y Forest and along a rough track carpeted with autumnal leaves with shadows of the surrounding bare trees silhouetted on the ground. Then downhill through part of Fforest-fawr where natural resources like limestone, coal and haematite, an iron rich mineral which were abundant in this area were mined. So many of the hollows and mounds to be found within the woodland are the result of shallow workings and spoil tips, many of which are now hidden beneath vegetation.The path eventually brought them out at the bottom of the main driveway leading uphill to Castell Coch, or the red castle and stopping to utilise fallen tree trunks for seating, they enjoyed morning refreshments whilst gazing at the fairy tale castle. Actually built on the remains of a th century castle this th century Gothic style folly, standing above the steep Taff gorge was built by William Burgess for the rd Marquis of Bute, although sadly Burgess died ten years before the project was complete..removeRefreshed, another climb led them uphill and further into Fforest-fawr where they descended a wide pathway to the valley bottom to join part of the Taff Trail along the flat disused railway line. Then another climb, this time on narrow muddy pathways through bracken to zig zag gradually uphill to the open hillside overlooking Taffs Well and Gwaelod y Garth in the valley below and up through the Taff valley towards Rhydfelin and Pontypridd.The last haul brought them to the summit of Craig yr Allt with its panoramic views including towards its sister hill the Garth and the reward of a sit down for lunch under overcast skies, whilst gazing towards the coast at Penarth Head and out across the misty Bristol Channel. Continuing along the ridge and making their descent to a road, a short journey led them back into fields containing passive horses as they trekked through mud to Waun-waelod.One last climb up through a waterlogged narrow track between bramble bushes led them out onto Caerphilly Common as the sun ed, for the short climb to the trig point at m on Caerphilly Mountain to enjoy the views over Caerphilly in the valley below with its ruined castle clearly visible.All that was left was the short descent passing many other people who were out with dogs and children enjoying the afternoon sunshine and views, to make their way back to their start point after a lovely . mile undulating tramp.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

She came in in September, then she had to leave.“When she came out of the winter break, she played well, but still now she needs a little more time to get fit again.🚨 Here we go! 🚨Your #Lionesses squad for the @ArnoldClarkCup… 🏆 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿— LionessesFebruary , “She was really disappointed of course but you need to do smart things, andyou need more time to get fit you have to take that time, otherwise you’ll be out for a longer period and that’s what we don’t want.“She needs time and then hopefully she’ll recover good and in a short while and she can build up some playing minutes with her club first.”Cha forward Beth England is another out with injury, but there is a trio of fit-again players back in the England fold.Houghton’s City team-mates Lucy Bronze and Ellie Roebuck are included for the first time under Wiegman having recovered from knee and calf issues respectively, and Arsenal’s Leah Williamson is recalled after missing the last camp in November because of an ankle injury.In Houghton’s absence, Wiegman had Williamson captaining the team before Millie Bright took over in November. vw,vw,px, px\"England manager Sarina Wiegman has to choose a new captain .removeAskedfull-back Bronze was a potential captain this time around, Wiegman said: “I haven’t talked to the players yet. I first do this discussion with the players when they come in, and after that I’ll tell you.”Since Wiegman took charge last September England have played six World Cup qualiers, winning them all with  goals scored and none conceded, the most recent being a - thrashing of Latvia.The inaugural Arnold Clark Cup tournament will see them host three fellow sides from the top  of FIFA’s world rankings – Olympic champions Canada at the Riverside Stadium on February , Spain at Carrow Road three days later and then Germany at Molineux another three days on from that.Wiegman has emphasised the importance of the fixtures for the team to “really know where we stand” with less than six months to go to the Euros, which England also host.The Dutchwoman added: “I thinkthe toughest . I also think this is what we need.“We had a very good autumn with these three camps, and now we need these games to really know where we are.“This is a tournament where we can really have a starting point for the preparations for the Euros – we’ve already done that, but now with these world-class opponents we’ll really know where we stand and from there, we will continue preparing for the Euros.

Patience, it is said, brings its own rewards, and for me it did. It’s how I received my limited knowledge of cooking, like stew. I learned that a pinch of salt enhanced its flavour. Salt has many uses, medicinal, preserving food etc. It was its preservative qualities that made it such a sought-after commodity thousands of years ago. Wars have been fought over salt and some Roman soldiers would have even receive salt as their wages.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Alan MIllarBasically, He was telling them that they were the means whereby the world would be flavoured by God’s love, grace, mercy, compassion, kindness, and forgiveness. In other words, they were to be just like Him. That is how they would add flavour to the lives of people with whom they shared the gospel. The fruits of the spirit, according to the apostle Paul, emanates from God’s love, which we read about in  Corinthians :-b, where he explains how the love of God affects us, and others. First, he tells us that love ‘is patient, love is kind’. Then he tells us what it is not – ‘it is not proud, boastful, doesn’t lie’, and much, much more. What Paul is describing is God’s pure love and it is that kind of love we are to show to the world, to add flavour to the lives of others, to be the salt of the earth. But its preserving qualities are perhaps what the church is all about, because the soul of mankind is rotting through sin and depravity. The quality of salt, spiritually speaking, can ensure that the corruption of the world does not contaminate the church, and the church, while it remains, ensures that society will not decay until Christ comes again. Christians, as the salt of the earth, are vitally important in God’s plans for mankind’s redemption. May all who follow Christ be salt in our homes, communities, places of work, wherever we meet others, and let others taste and see that the Lord is good.Jesus  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularCookstown teacher driving Mercedes caught for speeding...NewsWoman passes away after Glengormley collision...NewsProposed Carn petrol station could attract more than , v...NewsMasked men set home and car on fire in Carnlough...NewsDual language street sign request fails...NewsMost PopularSofas UK: best sofas and couches to furnish your home, whate...RecommendedValentine’s flower delivery UK : roses, Lego, MS - best...RecommendedBest baby car seats UK : best toddler car seats from bir...Recommended best backpacking tents UK : lightweight, one-person te...RecommendedValentine’s Day meals: the best supermarket meal deals UK ...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

In addition, I learnt on my very first business conference I attended in London over  years ago when I speak I am doing so through the filters of my understanding, and you hear it through the filters of your understanding. Adam Harbinson.Maybe not a great example, but I heard a very funny story the other day, which demonstrates. Old Jimmy overheard a conversation between a young couple as they dined in a restaurant. The man gazed lovingly into the young lady and said, ‘Darling, when I look into your eyes, time stands still’. Well, Jimmy thought that would really impress his Maggie, so later that evening as they feasted on a hastily purchased fish supper, he decided to repeat what he had heard the young man say, and so he looked into Maggie’s bloodshot eyes and whispered:‘Maggie, your face would stop a clock’.Like me, Jimmy knew exactly what he meant, but in the words of the Jim Croce song, ‘Every time I tried to tell you the words just came out wrong...’There’s a much misunderstood quotation in the New Testament where Jesus gave his disciples a ‘new commandment’. It was not another commandment, but properly understood it was to replace all the other  that had morphed out of Moses’ . He said, ‘I am giving you a new commandment: Love each other, just as I have loved you.’So how do we love each other  Is it just by words that can be so easily misunderstood  I don’t think so, I like to think of the word ‘love’ as a verb and not a noun, it’s an action word, reminiscent of the words attributed to Francis of Assisi. ‘Preach at all times, andyou have to, use words’.Actions always speak louder.Read More Read MoreRead more newsJesusLondon  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularCookstown teacher driving Mercedes caught for speeding...NewsWoman passes away after Glengormley collision...NewsProposed Carn petrol station could attract more than , v...NewsMasked men set home and car on fire in Carnlough...NewsDual language street sign request fails...NewsMost PopularSofas UK: best sofas and couches to furnish your home, whate...RecommendedHow to choose a dining table, and our favourite dining table...Recommended Valentine’s flower delivery UK : roses, Lego, MS - best...RecommendedBest baby car seats UK : best toddler car seats from bir...Recommended best backpacking tents UK : lightweight, one-person te...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Currently the Northern Ireland Executive can’t meet following the resignation of First Minister, Paul Givan, last week. The last remaining restrictions were due to be discussed at an Executive meeting on Thursday. However, Mr Swann said he was not prepared to allow a failure of politics to get in the way of lting now unnecessary restrictions. I am now seeking that legal guidance on how I myself can replace the bulk of the remaining restrictions,not all of them, with clear guidance and advice, he said on Monday afternoon. When we had an executive, ministers always said we wouldnt retain restrictions for a day longer than necessary, so that same logic should still apply. While we must move forward carefully, we cant stay locked in emergency restrictions forever. We need to start getting normal back. His comments come astwo Covid--related deaths were reported in Northern Ireland on Monday.Another , cases of coronavirus were also reported, up from , on Sunday.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eedfaefbbffa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_abafecbbdcaefab   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
