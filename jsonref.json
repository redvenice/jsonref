But there are no active discussions around it at the moment.\u0027Officials fear charging drivers by the mile would act as a major disincentive to people considering buying an electric vehicle.The Prime Minister is also said to be concerned the Government would face a public backlash if it introduced road charging. Number 10 has also vetoed plans for a comprehensive carbon tax because of concerns voters would resist higher prices for everyday items like meat.Some ministers fear the prime minister\u0027s reluctance to grasp the nettle of higher costs will undermine the Government\u0027s ability to deliver on its commitments to cut carbon emissions to zero by 2050. One senior minister said: \u0027We have set ourselves some eye-watering commitments but we have had virtually no discussion with the public about the costs of achieving them. That does not amount to a strategy.\u0027Research yesterday by the Social Market Foundation think-tank suggested public attitudes towards road pricing might be shifting. Polling of 3,000 people found 38 per cent now support using pricing as a replacement to existing road and fuel duties – while only 26 per cent said they were opposed and 36 do not have a view either way.Focus group work conducted suggest support was driven by a \u0027strong public perception that the current tax system is unfair\u0027."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2709e6ad0f41f4c31422877947d208a25c8f763f/0_129_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=d570254083d2a2fa388fdb9beba7c994","title":"from succession to the last duel a complete guide to this weeks entertainment","story":"ear for eyeWriter-director debbie tucker green brings her affecting play to the big screen at the London film festival.

Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose. Anyone over the age of 12 can\u0026nbsp now register for a vaccine.

Photograph: Nick BradshawFormer Stormont first minister Peter Robinson has accused the EU of “irrational political prejudice” and warned that it must “go back to the drawing board” over the Northern Ireland Protocol. The ex-DUP leader described reforms to the post-Brexit arrangements outlined by European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic on Wednesday as an “upgrade” but insisted “much more movement will be required” to bring unionists on board.He suggested triggering the contentious Article 16 of the protocol - which allows the EU or UK to unilaterally suspend aspects of its operations if either side considers them to be causing “economic, societal or environmental difficulties” - may be necessary “to achieve that goal”. Mr Robinson also accuses the SDLP, Alliance and Sinn Féin of a “grovelling endorsement” of the EU’s proposed reforms, which would scrap most checks on goods moving between Britain and the North.The de facto Irish Sea border was erected under the protocol, agreed by London and Brussels, to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and protect the EU single market after the UK pulled out of the bloc. “What gets me most is the irrational political prejudice and overbearing haughtiness of the EU, who think that it is a greater priority to ensure there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland than between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom of which we are part,” Mr Robinson wrote in his weekly column for The Newsletter. Favoured by nationalistsHe alleged that Mr Sefcovic was only interested in protecting gains from the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement which are favoured by nationalists. The 1998 peace deal was “damaging” and “it is heresy for any unionist, especially with the benefit of hindsight, to praise” it, he wrote. Mr Robinson said the agreement “threw the jail gates open for terrorists to flood out, destroyed the RUC, allowed Sinn Féin into government while republicans held on to their bombs and guns, continued murdering, relentlessly persisted with their criminality, while refusing to support the police or recognise the authority of the courts”.He said he was “unimpressed” by the SDLP, Sinn Féin and the Alliance party offering a “grovelling endorsement of the EU proposals”. “These parties welcomed the protocol in its original form and there would have been no change if it had been left to them,” he wrote. “They are content to maintain the denial of democratic accountability for laws that will be made by the EU and imposed in Northern Ireland. They accept that the EU should be both advocate and judge in its own cause when there is a dispute about trading matters.‘Sleight of hand’“They endorse the constitutional sleight of hand that declares Great Britain to be a ‘third country’ in relation to Northern Ireland trade and they applaud maintaining checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.”Mr Robinson said the EU was also completely ignoring “ the constitutional, legal, and democratic implications of the protocol and seems to think it is only the trading element of the protocol that needs to be considered.”“Even in that narrow perspective they fall short. If the problem was limited to the costly compliance requirements and time-consuming checking of goods within the United Kingdom the answer is the removal of those checks, not a reduction in their number,” he wrote. Reacting to Mr Robinson’s comments about the Belfast Agreement, Taoiseach Micheál Martin on Friday said: “I am surprised at that language but I haven’t heard that sentiment. “I met with all of the political parties last Friday, all of them articulated to me a desire to maintain the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, the Assembly and the Executive to ensure the continuation of political stability.”Mr Martin also defended the latest set of proposals from Mr Sefcovic and the EU, pointing out that Mr Sefcovic had very carefully and very deliberately gone to Northern Ireland to hear from all shades of political opinion there before coming up with his latest proposals.“First of all,Maros Sefcovic went to the North, he met with all the political parties and he met with all of the representatives of business and industry in Northern Ireland and he listened at first hand. I would have met him before he went to the North, his objectives are genuine and sincere in trying to make the protocol work for all of the people of Northern Ireland,” said Mr Martin.Mr Martin said he recalled a conversation with Mr Robinson some years ago when Mr Robinson lamented the fact that Northern Ireland did not have the equivalent of the IDA to attract in foreign investment as the agency was doing in the Republic.“I believe having access to the Single European Market is a huge advantage to jobs and to business and to industry in Northern Ireland and the measures brought forward by the commission this week through Maros Sefcovic really advance that agenda in terms of inward investment into the North but also allowing businesses in the North to grow through exports to the European Union market,” said Mr Martin.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"abolish tv licence fee use exchequer funding for rt%C3%A9 report says","story":"RTÉ gets some €200m a year in licence fee income, though the station has long complained that the rate of fee evasion costs it about €50m annually.A report on the future of the media has recommended the TV licence fee should be abolished and replaced by some form of exchequer funding for RTÉ, but there is strong resistance to the proposal in Government.The report by the Future of Media Commission, an independent body set up last year by the Government, is understood to have concluded that the RTÉ licence fee should be scrapped, according to several sources with knowledge of its contents.It proposes that the licence fee income – which costs television owners €160 annually and is the primary source of funding for RTÉ – should be replaced by funding directly sourced from the exchequer. One source described it as “a new public funding model... based on exchequer funding”.However, senior Government figures are strongly opposed to the proposal. The issue was discussed at a recent Cabinet committee meeting, where it is understood that it encountered significant opposition from a number of people present, including Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath and Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe. They objected to taking on the burden of funding RTÉ on the exchequer.OppositionThere is especially strong opposition to the proposals in the Department of Finance, it is understood.“The licence fee is the least worst option,” said one person familiar with discussions on the subject. “I think it will be with us for some years yet.”RTÉ gets some €200 million a year in licence fee income, though the station has long complained that the rate of licence fee evasion costs it about €50 million a year. An additional €140 million of its €340 million annual budget comes from commercial activities, principally advertising.The station has complained it is underfunded for several years and has lobbied successive governments for additional cash. The commission, chaired by Prof Brian MacCraith, was set up a year ago to examine the future of the media sector, including broadcasting and newspapers.Broadcasting levyThere has been widespread speculation that a previous proposal for a “broadcasting levy” applied to every household – rather than only those with a television – would be resurrected. However, there are fears this would arouse significant public opposition akin to the water charges experience. The report is expected to be published in the coming weeks.“The commission has completed its work and submitted their report to the Taoiseach and the Minister,” a spokesman for the Minister for Media and Culture Catherine Martin said. “They are considering the contents and intend to bring it to Government after this. The report will then be published after being considered by the Government.”"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus vaccine boosters expected to be approved for over 60s","story":"Over-60s would receive shots in their GP surgeries, while mass-vaccination centres could be restarted before the end of the month. Photograph: Narong SangnakEPAThe Government expects to begin an expanded Covid-19 vaccine booster campaign targeting hundreds of thousands of people within days of receiving advice on which additional groups should be given another dose.Senior Government sources anticipate that the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac), which is to meet on Monday, will give the go ahead for people aged over 60 to receive a booster dose, as well as frontline healthcare workers.“As soon as advice is given, it’s Thunderbirds are go,” a Government source said on Friday.Coalition leaders are anxious to receive the Niac advice as soon as possible, with the HSE confident that currently reduced deliveries of vaccine will resume in line with demand.Over-60s would receive shots in their GP surgeries, while mass-vaccination centres could be restarted before the end of the month. Staff from the centres are currently vaccinating workers and residents in nursing homes, while the over-80s are being given boosters at GP surgeries .The coalition is anxious to push ahead with an extensive booster campaign in the face of a deteriorating Covid situation, which is putting increasing pressure on hospitals already dealing with winter illness and backlogs, as well as regular, scheduled care.However, while a mass booster campaign would help suppress the virus in the medium term, there are also concerns that it would not be fast-acting enough, nor address the issue of the 370,000 unvaccinated and partially vaccinated cohorts where infection is currently building.There is increasing concern in Government circles that the virus will force a rethink or a pause of the planned reopening scheduled for October 22nd. The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) meets on Monday to discuss its advice for cabinet.Government sources said they believe that the situation is “definitely trending in the wrong direction” as they were updated with new data on Friday, but that a transient increase in cases should not be a surprise given restrictions have been eased in recent weeks and months.Ministers are waiting for the State’s public health team to give their advice on Monday but some were fearful Nphet would recommend pausing the next phase of easing of restrictions out of an “abundance of caution”. There is a fear this pause could last longer than is intended if the prevalence of the disease remains stubbornly high.Taoiseach Micheál Martin said on Friday the Government will not be “pushing the panic button” but will be watching the situation closely.“There is not a whole lot left to reopen and behaviour is now a factor. I think we will be looking at vaccination certs, for example.”There is ongoing uncertainty over precisely what measures will be recommended by Nphet next week.Alongside an outright pause of planned easings of restrictions , it is thought options to be considered by Nphet will include the retention of distancing measures in indoor settings such as bars and restaurants across winter, allied to some increases in capacity in theatres and cinemas. Meanwhile, a structured reopening of still-closed sectors may be favoured, again with retention of vaccination certs.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord leo needed a wake up call for his post budget interview","story":"Leo Varadkar: Needs to set his alarm. Photograph: Cyril ByrneFine Gael TD Jennifer Carroll MacNeill: Bad connection in Dún Laoghaire. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillWhen he became Fine Gael leader and taoiseach in 2017, Leo Varadkar promised to represent the “people who get up early in the morning”. He was immediately attacked for ignoring the people who may not get up early in the morning but work hard in their lives too. At the time he defended the comment, insisting his party would “never apologise for standing up for people who get up early in the morning, who work nights and weekends, who aspire for something better for themselves and their families”.Leo’s political opponents have developed a fondness for the phrase, dredging it up every now and then so they can beat him around the ears with it. In his line of work, the Tánaiste gets up early in the morning all the time. At the top level in politics, days are gruelling and very long for all party leaders, but they relish the job. Budget day, which starts with an early morning Cabinet meeting, is particularly demanding for Government Ministers. After the budget announcements in the Dáil, they have their departmental press conferences in the evening. Meanwhile, a schedule of local and national media appearances kicks in. On the morning after Budget 2022, Leo was scheduled to do the big interview on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland. His appearance after 8am was trailed on social media and during the first hour of the broadcast. The item immediately after the 8am bulletin is the box-office slot, the one which pulls in most listeners and is reserved for the big hitters and the big stories.“We will be hearing from Tánaiste Leo Varadkar shortly, reacting to yesterday’s budget,” said presenter Aengus Cox, before cutting to the news. Jon Williams, Head of News and Current Affairs, went to the foyer to greet the Tánaiste and escort him to the studio. But there was no sign of him.The bulletin came and went. The programme’s second hour opened with a lengthy interview on the Northern Ireland protocol with Queens University professor Katie Hayward. “And we’ll be talking later with Tánaiste Leo Varadkar,” promised presenter Justin Treacy, before Verona Murphy, the Independent TD for Wexford, was wheeled out to give Opposition reaction to the budget. An item on the death of musician Paddy Moloney came next. The 8.30 headlines and sports news followed. There was a suspiciously long interview with former Irish international Ray Houghton. “It is 8.41 and we are joined in studio now by the Tánaiste and Minister for Trade and Employment, Leo Varadkar . . .” announced Justin, finally about to get stuck in. Apparently Leo was hugely apologetic when he arrived in RTÉ for his “early in the morning” interview. He made a full confession. “I slept it out.” Senator ’s plan bee The Seanad will be buzzing on Wednesday when Senator Vincent P Martin (or Vincent B Martin) introduces his Bill to save the Irish honeybee from extinction. “The Protection of the Native Irish Honey Bee Bill” has the support of all parties and groupings in the Upper House as the future of Apis mellifera mellifera hangs in the balance, threatened by non-native imports which are hybridising and diluting the species.The Native Irish Honeybee Society, along with beekeeping associations throughout the island, is fully behind the move and points to compelling scientific evidence for a ban on the importation of non-native bees. “That’s another species gone if we don’t act now,” says the Green Party Senator and senior counsel, who describes himself as a keen amateur beekeeper with “four hives on the go” at his home in Kildare. When preparing the legislation he got expert legal opinion from the Climate Bar Association to guard against the Bill contravening EU law.Vincent B tells us that non-native bees are more prone to swarming, are more aggressive and they don’t appreciate our climate. They can also bring in dangerous diseases and pathogens. But the Irish honey bee produces good, dependable honey as they fly in low temperatures and light rain, they are placid, have low swarming tendencies and are frugal with winter stores.“Ireland is fortunate to have a pure population of its own native Irish honey bees which is perfectly adapted to this island, this climate and this flora,” wrote Senator Martin in a letter to Seanad colleagues. However, it is under severe threat due to the “continued, increasing and unnecessary” importation of non-native varieties.“Ireland is the envy of much of Northern Europe where this same bee originally reigned but, due to hybridisation, pure Apis mellifera mellifera is now only found in a few pockets.”Vincent sent a jar of his pure Kildare honey with his letter. His “Honeywood” crop is sold in Swans on the Green in Naas.He contacted the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission recently and asked about the possibility of putting some hives on the roof of Leinster House. The Ceann Comhairle, a great supporter of local food initiatives, wrote back saying the authorities will certainly investigate if this is possible.Busy bee Vincent P is also in the middle of a project to get his small vineyard into production. He has been “trialling and shortlisting” mildew-resistant grape varieties for the last few years and hopes to have his first vintage in around five years time. “The Welsh are beating the French in wine-tastings on white sparkling. I am on a mission to bring champagne to Kildare.” Cuvée Vin de P from Chateau Martin, with a native bee on the label. Stick us down for a magnum.Bad for the optics How is the rollout of the National Broadband Plan (NBP)going?Let’s get the National Development Plan (NDP) programme manager before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) to explain all. That sounds like a good idea. The PAC met top officials from the Department of Communications on Thursday morning and broadband was one of the main topics for discussion. Fortunately the department’s high-speed supremo, Fergal Mulligan, was on hand, albeit remotely, to answer questions.When Fine Gael’s Jennifer Carroll MacNeill asked general secretary Mark Griffin about broadband in schools, he deferred to his colleague. “Fergal, I don’t know if you want to come in on that . . .”“I can do that,” replied the NDP man, headphones on and microphone attached, sitting in a leather office chair in what appeared to be his attic. Something like a mini-satellite dish was on his desk, partially in the shot. The scene was well lit because of the Velux window above, but the picture was fuzzy and then Fergal’s voice began breaking up just as he was getting into the detail. “I’m not trying to be funny, but I’m not sure your broadband connection is the strongest there,” said Jennifer, showing great discipline under the circumstances. Later, she asked sec gen Griffin about problems in the Dublin city network and in her own constituency of Dún Laoghaire. Was there a plan to improve that situation? “I’m going to ask Fergal to come in on this.” The programme manager for the National Development Plan reappeared on another stuttery, low-resolution link and began by setting out in sequence what will be done. “So all the ducks, all the du-”And he froze before he was able to get them in a row. “You’re losing your sound there.” And Jennifer, who had given up on trying not to be funny, quipped: “Maybe you’re in Dún Laoghaire, are you?”Mark Griffin chipped in: “He’s not. Actually, deputy, he’s in Wicklow and he’s a man stuck in an amber area who badly needs a connection.”Amber areas in the NBP map are those identified for the rollout of high-speed fibre. Eventually, Fergal resurfaced, to everyone’s relief. “Apologies everybody for my connection. You’ll be glad to hear that National Broadband Ireland will be getting me fibre hopefully in the next few months. I’m part of the 60,000 by the end of the year so next time around I should have a much better connection.”Later, when discussing committee business, chairman Stanley suggested the PAC should insist “at the very least” that senior officials attend meetings either in person or contribute from their department headquarters. He said it wasn’t good enough to have the manager of the National Broadband Plan trying to address the meeting over a dodgy line. “His broadband actually went down, his connection collapsed in the middle of the meeting . . . that’s not okay,” said Stanley. “It’s not a good look, one way or the other,” agreed Verona Murphy. “It’s awful. It’s awful,” sighed the chairman.Des res We note with some sadness that Des and Pat O’Malley’s apartment in Ballsbridge is up for sale. Des, the former Fianna Fáil minister and founder and first leader of the now-defunct Progressive Democrats, died in July. His beloved wife, Pat, died in 2017. The three-bed, two-bath top-floor apartment in Lynton Court is located on the corner of Merrion Road and Sandymount Avenue and is on the market with Sherry Fitzgerald with an asking price of €675,000. It’s a fine property, judging by the envy-inducing photographs on the auctioneer’s website. We were struck by the image of Des’s study – a small, bright room with a sturdy chair, compact mahogany desk and anglepoise lamp in the corner near the window. And, along the wall, a large shredder. O’Malley had a long, distinguished and often controversial political career. His celebrated clashes with Charles J Haughey are part of history now.

But the future heir’s tart response to Jeff Bezos flying William Shatner to space this week – “We need some of the world’s greatest brains and minds fixed on trying to repair this planet, not trying to find the next place to go and live,” the Duke of Cambridge said – had echoes of Scott-Heron’s influential 1970 spoken-word track, Whitey on the Moon.Over clattering percussion, Scott-Heron pretty much nailed the disinterested shrug of people at the hard end of the world’s problems at seeing Neil Armstrong’s landmark 1969 moon walk: “A rat done bit my sister Nell, with Whitey on the moon. Her face and arms began to swell, and Whitey’s on the moon,” his languid vocals proclaim.Certainly, at first sight, the regular transport of wealthy people into low Earth orbit – a prospect now closer than ever – seems like the answer to a question the planet wasn’t asking.SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket burns kerosene and Virgin’s VSS Unity uses a solid carbon-based fuel, hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene and liquid nitrous oxide. Which, Eloise Marais, associate professor of physical geography at University College London, estimates burn 200-300 tonnes of carbon dioxide per launch. Split between four or so passengers, this compares highly unfavourably with the one to three tonnes of carbon dioxide per passenger for long-haul flights. While there were only 114 rocket launches in the whole of 2020, Sir Richard Branson’s ambition alone is for 400 flights per year.But might such forays have their uses for the whole of mankind after all?Space travel and the environmental movement have been strange bedfellows ever since the Pioneer 1 satellite used the first practical solar panels in 1958. Satellites have been driving innovation in solar panels ever since, and have proven crucial in determining crop health, forest fires, glacier coverage, the spread of urban development and damage to the rainforests.Indeed, space travel has been a rich source of new green tech. The hydrogen and fuel cell technologies invented to take Apollo astronauts into space are now touted as a clean, reliable (albeit achingly expensive) alternative to batteries that can power anything from aeroplanes, such as the Pathfinder and Helio prototypes, to warships. Home insulation – hello there, Insulate Britain – owes much to spacesuit design.Meanwhile, NASA is a leader in green engineering. By necessity, all human space travel involves recycling practically everything – water, air and food – so the space agency has been responsible for breakthroughs in water filtration, waste water treatment and soil cleaning agents. It is also one of the world’s biggest researchers into the science of hydroponics – growing crops without using land resources.“Space-based technologies and space-derived information are central to climate knowledge, science, monitoring and early warning,” says Nick Shave, chair of UKspace, the trade association of the British space industry. “In the future, new applications of satellite data, combined with satellite positioning and communications technologies, will help drive down carbon emissions as well as providing key capabilities required to manage the devastating effects of the climate emergency to countries and communities around the world.”The link between the environment and space travel is even more far-out than that. Bill Anders, crew member of the Apollo 8 mission, became the first human to witness the Earth peeking over the Moon’s horizon in 1968. Anders had been snapping the Moon’s surface on a scouting mission for future landings when he took the photograph later known as Earthrise. That single snap is credited with inspiring the first Earth Day in 1970, about which Anders later said: “We came all this way to explore the Moon, and the most important thing is that we discovered the Earth.”California’s environmental movement of the early 1970s gave birth to the Whole Earth Catalogue, a compendium of product listings, how-to diagrams and educational ephemera intended for the back-to-the-land movement, which featured Earthrise on its first cover. Published quarterly in 1971 and sporadically thereafter, its biggest influence was on Silicon Valley: founders of Airbnb, Stripe and Facebook, early-internet architects including Larry Brilliant, Lee Felsenstein, Ted Nelson and Steve Jobs, described the Catalog as “Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along”.This freak-powerbillionaire crossover means that while SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy emits more CO2 in a few minutes than the average car would in more than two centuries, in 2019 it carried a NASA-funded test satellite known as the Green Propellant Infusion Mission, to replace the outrageously polluting and ferociously lethal hydrazine. The new hydroxyl ammonium nitrate fueloxidizer blend – called AF-M315E for short – can be carried around without wearing a hazmat suit, is more efficient and emits more water than CO2.By comparison, Bezos’s rocket, Blue Origin, is powered by a mix of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, meaning its carbon footprint – in flight, if not in construction – is zero. Given Blue Origin’s reusable launch vehicle, the project’s biggest overall source of CO2 is likely to be the crew and passengers’ flights to its Texas launch site. Just don’t mention the CO2 given off by Amazon’s server farms…And then there’s the real out-there thinking of Elon Musk. Musk has credited his drive to many things – including growing up in apartheid South Africa and leaving aged 17, rather than serve in what he called “a fascist army” – but the man’s absolute conviction that the Earth is doomed explains his unsettling desire to move to Mars.“A lot of my motivation comes from looking at things that don’t work well and feeling a bit sad about how it would manifest in the future,” he has said. “If that would result in an unhappy future, then it makes me unhappy, so I want to fix it.”Alongside the Tesla, the car that made electric vehicles cool at last, he’s proposed ‘Hyperloop’ high-speed transportation systems, using reduced pressure tubes to reach speeds around 600mph – which Branson has neatly whipped from under his nose with the all-electric Virgin Hyperloop’s first successful test earlier this year. Musk has put up $100 million for carbon capture technology, and given up on cryptocurrencies due to their voracious dependency on electricity.The UK is clinging on to the edge of all this. British rocket maker Orbex is pioneering bio-propane fuel that chief executive Chris Larmour says can cut CO2 emissions by 90 per cent, compared with traditional launch fuel. “Climate change is real, and we don’t want to make it worse,” he explains.After Brexit, the UK is no longer part of Galileo and EGNOS, the EU-owned satnav systems, but we’re hustling to get involved in its Copernicus Earth Observation programme, and we’ve still got a role in the soon-to-be carbon-neutral European Space Agency. “The UK has already taken a lead in committing to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,” says Shave. “The next step should be properly investing in our space industry to help us become a world leader in action as well as words.”If we start to dream of space again, perhaps we can start to get a genuinely global perspective. If we can solve problems down here by trying to put someone on the Moon, what could we achieve if we all got a chance to see Earth rise?More from NewsSir David Amess latest: Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer pay respects at scene of murderBig tech censorship threatens our democracyExclusive: Uyghur jailbreak complicates Taliban\u0026#39s ties with ChinaDespite the tough rhetoric, ministers are handing Britain\u0026#39s electric car production to ChinaNasa sends Lucy probe on 12-year mission to explore asteroids around JupiterMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"another winter discontent wouldnt good unions labour","story":"Is there a danger that the trade union Unite has learned all the wrong lessons from the Winter of Discontent of 197879?I vaguely recall that famous dispute of more than four decades ago because my father was, at the time, a shop steward for the (now defunct) Transport and General Workers’ Union and our house was littered with trade union literature, including posters and information leaflets detailing HGV drivers’ grievances.I wonder if, in the years afterwards, Dad looked back on that strike with the same enthusiasm with which he distributed those leaflets and posters to his fellow tanker drivers at the time? He certainly regarded the subsequent triumph of Margaret Thatcher’s Conservatives as one of the worst things that had ever happened to the country did he acknowledge his own role in undermining Jim Callaghan’s already beleaguered Labour government? Not to me, he didn’t.It might be useful to gain some sort of insight into the minds of Unite officials who, it seems, yearn to recreate that dreadful winter by encouraging their members to strike in support of better pay and working conditions, just at the point when Britons are gearing up to enjoy Christmas. Of course, unions’ job is to fight for better conditions for their members, and staging strikes in the run-up to the festive season gives their cause extra leverage.But after last year’s somewhat flat celebrations in pandemic Britain, this year was supposed to be the time when families could get together again and have a proper celebration. Christmas 2021 could be the cathartic event that finally draws a line under nearly two years of dreadful doubt, fear and chaos.Alternatively it could provide a chance for Unite to throw its weight around and prove to the country that it’s not, after all, a steadily diminishing industrial force of increasing irrelevance to modern day workers.That’s an interesting phrase of choice: “We will not hesitate.” So at a time when driver shortages have given existing drivers – including those who are not members of any trade union – more industrial heft than at any recent point in history, the biggest transport union “will not hesitate” to go from nought to sixty, from park to fifth gear, to call its members out on strike.As a lifelong watcher of the labour and trade union movement, this all feels like a tired, cumbersome old institution seeking vainly to attract some attention by pretending to be relevant, and perhaps attracting some much-needed new members while it does so. And who is to suffer as a consequence of its belligerence? Ordinary working people trying to celebrate Christmas with their families. Yeah, job done there, comrades.And where is the Labour Party in all of this? Have we heard any of Keir Starmer’s front benchers even raise a quizzical eyebrow in response to the sabre rattling from their party’s biggest donor? Have MPs, as well as Unite, forgotten that 40 years ago it was the Labour Party, not their political opponents, who suffered the most catastrophic damage as a result of the widespread industrial action that made Britain an international laughing stock?It would, however, be foolish to expect any Labour MP to criticise, even obliquely, Unite or any other affiliated trade union too many of them, having left university and then secured a comfortable desk job as a trade union official or as an MP’s researcher, proudly added their union membership to their CVs in order to win their union’s endorsement when they put themselves forward for a Labour seat in parliament. Now is not the time to bite the hand that feeds them.And yet, if public anger turns on the trade unions who are needlessly making life even more difficult than it needs to be, will there be a re-examination of the dysfunctional relationship between Labour and its trade union paymasters? “No,” the MPs will say (and some of them will even mean it), “the unions provide a crucial link between the party and ordinary working people. It’s what keeps us grounded.”So here’s a question: given that Labour has just lost four general elections in a row, given that the party has won a total of just five working majorities in its entire 120-year-long existence (and three of those were while it was being led by a man who most trade union leaders, and especially the leadership of Unite, despise), how has that trade union link actually helped the party? If Labour needs its trade union link to stay in touch with the priorities of ordinary working people, how come most working class voters support Boris Johnson’s Conservatives?Yes, the unions founded the Labour Party. But so what? Life moves on. The main opposition party should be free, if necessary, to raise genuine doubts it might have about the wisdom of a powerful trade union making life unnecessarily difficult for shoppers in the run up to Christmas. But so long as the Labour-trade union link exists, that will never happen. More from NewsSir David Amess latest: Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer pay respects at scene of murderBig tech censorship threatens our democracyExclusive: Uyghur jailbreak complicates Taliban\u0026#39s ties with ChinaDespite the tough rhetoric, ministers are handing Britain\u0026#39s electric car production to ChinaNasa sends Lucy probe on 12-year mission to explore asteroids around JupiterMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cant go forcing children self isolate","story":"I have gained a newfound respect for the Oxford-AstraZeneca nerds after my Covid-addled eight-year-old breathed directly into my face on Monday to prove she had brushed her teeth before bedtime.Well, you could hardly blame the kid for forgetting she has a highly infectious disease spread by airborne transmission since she has had no symptoms whatsoever.Thanks to the miracles worked by those men and women in white coats, my double-jabbed husband and I have stayed negative despite spending the past two weeks living in a den of plague.First our eldest got it. At 12 going on 21, she happily ensconced herself in her room with an Amazon Fire TV Stick and a stash of Pot Noodles and we barely saw her for the obligatory 10 days. Indeed, we hardly noticed the difference between her being in self-isolation and what used to be known as “family time”.Being the sort of people who separate their recycling, we diligently followed the Government (and school) advice to lateral flow-test our other two children daily, as well as ourselves. Lo and behold our youngest, Little Miss Mentadent, got the dreaded double line less than a week later, swiftly followed by our 11-year-old son.We did try to separate the blighters, honest, but how the hell are you supposed to self-isolate an eight year old? Since coronavirus is now ripping through secondary schools, what’s to say they didn’t get it from an asymptomatic classmate or a child whose parents don’t separate their recycling? We will never know.What is certain, however, is that they have now lost another month of school between them, despite there being nothing seriously wrong with any of them. The eldest had a mild sore throat, the boy has had a bit of a cough – but under normal circumstances they would have been sent on their way with an Ultrabalm pocket pack, and possibly some Tunes if I was feeling really generous. (As a doctor’s daughter I practically had to be decapitated to miss a day of school – and even then my father would probably have applied Steri-Strips while insisting “you absolutely don’t need stitches”.)The sheer ridiculousness of having to homeschool three otherwise healthy children could not have been better demonstrated than by the repeated calls I had to field from NHS T and T (Test and trace? Track and trace? Don’t test me on it, I’ve lost track) – even though, again, being responsible citizens, we had already told anyone who needed to know.As well as discovering that “T and T” cannot actually test, track or trace school contacts (eh?), I was also informed that “for safeguarding reasons”, I could not report all of my children’s “other” close contacts at the same time, even though they solely comprised my husband and me (and possibly the cat, although “close” is probably overstating it). Apparently, I could only do it separately. Three times. For a minimum of 25 minutes per call. “For safeguarding reasons”, I refused.How much is this service still costing the taxpayer? And why are we still testing asymptomatic children at all? My husband and I are far from the only parents not to have caught coronavirus from their infected offspring.According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, the percentage of people currently testing positive is highest in secondary school pupils at around 7 per cent but just 1.2 per cent in those aged 35 to 49. The infection rate in the over-50s is half that, at 0.6 per cent.So even though Covid-19 is seemingly spreading like wildfire through the Snapchat generation – old Facebooker farts like us aren’t catching it anywhere near the same rate thanks to the success of the vaccination rollout. I accept that the Year 7 to 11-ers may be overrepresented in the charts because we are testing them more – but that in itself begs the question: why?Why, when children are at far less risk of being hospitalised and dying from coronavirus, are we treating them like we are still in peak pandemic mode? Adults aren’t being obliged to take two lateral flow tests a week, so why are children?All of this also raises the bigger question of what the point of continued mass testing really is when the only route back to normality is to treat Covid as we would any other endemic disease.The revelation that 43,000 people are thought to have been given incorrect negative PCR results by an NHS-sanctioned laboratory in Wolverhampton rather suggests that the whole system is not fit for purpose.What we can say for certain is that almost two years on from the March 2020 lockdown, children continue to carry the burden of a disease that doesn’t even affect them – when nearly 80 per cent of the population over 12 have been double-jabbed. It makes no sense.Children obviously shouldn’t be in school if they are actually ill. But rather than keeping healthy children at home, we should be entering a phase where we accept that Covid is here to stay, that unvaccinated children are predominantly going to catch and spread it but that it’s okay because the success of the vaccine rollout means we have protected not just the vulnerable and the immuno-suppressed but the overwhelming majority of teachers and parents.Even the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health thinks mass testing in schools should end, arguing that it is causing unnecessary chaos, spreading needless fear and adversely affecting children’s mental health.Miriam Cates, the MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, has rightly argued that mass testing in schools is “utterly pointless” and “just another example of treating children as second class citizens”. A number of health experts have also quite reasonably asked what evidence there is to show that this sledgehammer to crack a nut approach is actually stopping transmission and infection.This week, Nadhim Zahawi, the Education Secretary, highlighted another problem with the status quo – ongoing unexplained absence in schools.With one in 40 pupils missing school due to Covid last week, up from around one in 80 at the start of the school term, Mr Zahawi has warned headteachers that extended coronavirus absences must be curbed. Clearly recognising that a lack of schooling has a more significant negative impact on children than Covid itself, he said attending school was “a national priority” and essential for children’s “well-being and long-term development”.Well, if that is the case, minister, why are you actively continuing to keep children away from the classroom?The long-term knock-on effect of all this absenteeism should not be overlooked.According to the Centre for Social Justice think tank, nearly 100,000 children failed to return to schools full-time after they reopened. These pupils remain unaccounted for. They are the lost children of lockdown. I shudder to think how many of them have become vulnerable to local gangs or dangerous home environments.Meanwhile, the pandemic has caused a surge of kids to vanish from the school roll. Officials do not know how many pupils are home-schooled, or why. No register is kept. But the best guess is 75,000 pupils, a figure that surged by almost 40 per cent last year.So we have at least 175,000 children who can’t be tracked or traced, which rather makes a mockery of every single infuriating phone call I have received this week. More from NewsSir David Amess latest: Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer pay respects at scene of murderBig tech censorship threatens our democracyExclusive: Uyghur jailbreak complicates Taliban\u0026#39s ties with ChinaDespite the tough rhetoric, ministers are handing Britain\u0026#39s electric car production to ChinaNasa sends Lucy probe on 12-year mission to explore asteroids around JupiterMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"could west do deal putin keep lights winter","story":"The message was delivered with the kind of knowing shrug that only a long and successful career in the KGB can really train you for. Speaking at an energy conference in Moscow on Wednesday, alongside the chief executives of Exxon Mobil, BP, and Total, the Russian President Vladimir Putin was quick to deny that his country was using its control of Europe’s gas supplies to advance his nation’s own interests. “We’re not using any weapons,” he said, a trademark steely glint in his eye, dismissing talk of geo-strategic blackmail as “politically motivated blather”. On the contrary, he was, the President insisted, making sure gas supplies were stepped up. If there were any problems, they were all the fault of someone else. Russia was here to help its neighbours.Well, up to a point. There is no question that Europe is gripped by an energy crisis as severe as any it has faced since the 1970s, and that the UK is right in the thick of it. Prices are soaring. Energy firms are going bust. There is talk of factory closures, three day weeks, and rolling blackouts. In the background, and whatever his denials, Putin, a political leader well versed in the dark arts of manipulation and great power politics, has levers at his disposal and won’t hesitate to pull them. When he denies using gas supplies as a weapon, one thing is for certain. That is precisely what he is doing. They are as much of an instrument of war as his country’s tanks, mortars and missiles ever were. And they are pointed at precisely the same place – the heart of the West.In truth, we are in the middle of a ‘gas shock’ that is likely to be as profound as the ‘oil shock’ that reshaped the world in the 1970s. For the Government, as for governments across the continent, the questions are about to come thick and fast. How did we get into this mess? How can we get out of it? And perhaps most of all, what price are we willing to pay to keep our lights turned on, our homes and public buildings warm and factories open?The UK and Europe’s energy crisis has been years in the making. Over the course of the past year, wholesale gas prices have risen more than fivefold. On some days of frantic trading, prices have been soaring by 20 or 30 per cent in a single session, a sign of a market under severe stress. The reason? The switch to cleaner, renewable energy, while welcome in itself, has meant that demand for gas, viewed by policy-makers as a reliable, not-too-dirty transitional fuel, has been steadily increasing. The massive size of stimulus programmes around the world as we recover from the Covid pandemic has translated into vast and unexpected increases in demand. A lack of wind has meant that renewable energy has not been as plentiful as expected, and gas is being used as a back-up. Meanwhile, China, along with much of the developing world, has been absorbing huge  quantities of gas to fuel its constantly expanding industrial machine. The development of liquified natural gas (LNG) transported around the world on huge container ships has created a global market very similar to oil. Most of the demand comes from Asia, with Europe largely an afterthought, but the trouble with being an afterthought is you don’t have much security of supply. And in the background, Russia, the only country with sufficient reserves to make a real difference to the market, is widely believed to have been holding back supplies, both to maximise its leverage with the West, and to remind everyone just how much the continent still relies on plentiful supplies of its energy. The result? A supply crunch, with soaring prices and bottlenecks throughout the system.  Britain has been hit especially hard. We have run down our reserves of gas to a mere four-five days of supply, far less than most of our continental rivals. “Pathetic really for a nation as important as the UK,” said Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the billionaire industrialist, tersely in a television interview this week. When we closed down storage facilities we still had back-up supplies from the North Sea we could buy extra gas relatively easily on the world market whenever we needed it and we had rising alternative energy sources that could be ramped up if necessary. At the same time, we ran down nuclear capacity, while France was still ramping it up, and our commitment to combating climate change made it virtually impossible to reopen coal mines. The British state has been caught out as hopelessly unprepared as this crisis deepens.  Granted, there is some bad luck in the process. No one could have predicted so many factors all coming together to put pressure on supplies at the same time, but a crisis is always at least in part bad luck. The point is to be prepared for the worst, not simply to hope for the best. The UK failed to do that. “Everything will depend on the weather,” says Laurent Ruseckas, executive director of analyst firm IHS Markit. “When it is really cold Russia needs a lot more gas, and that impacts on its ability to supply Europe.”There are plenty of big producers of gas. The US, Norway, and Qatar are all major exporters. But it is Russia that holds a quarter of the world’s entire proven supply and a network of pipelines that makes it the crucial player. In private, ministers and officials concede that since Russia is the world’s largest exporter, the amount it puts onto the market affects the global wholesale price, and some already believe that that is being turned into political leverage. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told The  last week that energy was being used as a “weapon” by foreign states, although he was careful not to point the finger directly at the Kremlin, while the Tory frontbencher Lord Agnew of Oulton this week went further, arguing outright that soaring energy costs were the result of a “geopolitical move” by Russia to put pressure on Europe. We are less vulnerable to that than some of our neighbours. Unlike mainland Europe, Britain does not rely on Russia for physical supplies of gas. The vast majority in the UK comes from British territorial waters, with the rest from reliable import partners such as Norway, Qatar and other nations in the Middle East, while less than 3 per cent comes from Russia. “Very little physical Russian gas comes to the UK because it makes no sense to transport these molecules all the way from Russia to the UK in the absence of certainty provided by medium or long-term contracts,” Katja Yafimava, senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, told The . Officials agree. “We are not dependent on Russian oil or gas whatsoever. There is no concern about security of supply. This is a question of high global gas prices,” a senior government source told The . “Europe gets about 41 per cent of its gas from Russia. They are massively exposed to the threat of leverage from Moscow. The UK is fortunate enough to have sovereign access to gas reserves in the North Sea in the way that many European countries don’t, so we are far more insulated than our European partners.”Officials may be breezily optimistic, but that is not the whole story. While the UK imports relatively little gas from Russia right now, the latter’s decisions to a large extent determine the global price, and that in turn determines whether Britain can buy the supplies it needs from anywhere. Even worse, right now, there is very little that anyone can do to get out of the situation. “On the supply side, there is not much Europe can do,” argues Simone Tagliapietra, a senior fellow at the Brussels-based Bruegel Institute. How bad will it get? “We expect the price to rise as a consequence of tight supply,’’ says Tom Marzec-Manser of the energy consultancy ICIS. “And that will be the main way that the market copes with the issue. We have already seen some industrial shutdowns in Europe as prices rise and we could see more of that. Once that happens, demand will start to fall.” And yet if that doesn’t work, then no one really knows for sure right now what will happen. It is easy to start sketching out doomsday scenarios. We could see shutdowns, with heating and gas stoves turned off pensioners could die of the cold, while the rest of us put on extra coats, and heat up our dinner in the microwave, assuming the electricity network is still running. In reality, it probably won’t get to that point. As a first option, the Government could start restricting supply to industrial users, which accounts for up to 20 per cent of overall demand. Industries such as chemicals, paper, packaging and building materials, all big energy users, could see factories put on three-day weeks. After that, schools and offices could also be put on a three-day week to save energy, and so could retailers (a shopping mall takes a lot of heating in winter), and then possibly closed completely. That would take a huge amount of pressure off the system. After that, there could be the kind of staggered blackouts we saw in the 1970s, designed to eke out meagre supplies through the winter. It wouldn’t be great. But it would mean the heating would keep running for most families. But this would still be a catastrophe for the government. The last Prime Minister to put the country on a three-day week amid an energy crisis was the man who took us into the European Union, Sir Edward Heath. Historians might see a certain irony in the symmetry of the one who took us out of the EU, Boris Johnson, repeating that humiliation. But few people would find it funny and it would destroy any reputation of basic competence. In these circumstances, could Johnson be tempted to ever strike a deal with Putin to keep the lights on? It is already not hard to detect a certain thawing in Britain’s relations with Russia. Roman Abramovich, the billionaire owner of Chelsea Football Club, has been seen at the team’s games again, after an 18-month gap amid visa issues. We have heard less and less about the outrageous poisonings on British soil. Is the ground being softened up for an ‘arrangement’, to put it politely, that sees Russia ship extra gas to the UK? “Everyone talks about the potential political lever,” says Ruseckas. “But the idea is preposterous. Who do you sit down and talk to, and what do you demand? It is just not how things work.” Well, perhaps. But if it came to not having a choice, having exhausted our supplies and not being in a fit state of preparedness what would a deal look like?  As it happens, the UK might have a few cards up its sleeve. We could quietly back off condemnation for Russia’s military and strategic adventures in the Crimea and Ukraine. Regulators have been trying to wash suspicious Russian money out of the City for years, with ‘unexplained wealth orders’, with Russian companies quietly blocked from listing their shares on the London market, and with the banks forced to be a lot more circumspect about accepting even the largest deposits. A Russian economy that is booming on the back of soaring energy prices – the Moscow stock market, not very surprisingly, hit all-time highs this week – will need a major financial centre to process all the money it is raking in. London would be the obvious candidate, if regulators could be persuaded to back off a little. That would be worth something to the enormously wealthy Putin and even more to his cronies. Even leaving aside the concessions that sound like a sub-plot from a John Le Carré novel, there is still plenty Britain could do to persuade the Russians to sell us more gas. Russia has very few trade deals around the world, and Britain has backed off from negotiating one, in part because of Russia’s poor reputation, but mainly because we have been too busy working on post-Brexit deals with Australia, Japan and the US. But Russia would desperately like one, if only to help integrate its economy into the Western world it could set a precedent for other deals. What  would really convince Russia would be long-term gas supply contracts, with the fossil fuel guaranteed a place among the mix of energy resources for years to come. Some of Gazprom’s gas arrives in the UK as LNG, and there are capacities at British gas terminals for additional supply, while some of it comes as piped gas, which travels in pipelines from the continent. Gazprom, the largest Russian energy supplier, typically signs take-or-pay long-term contracts with its customers in Europe, meaning that the buyer commits to purchase a certain amount of gas every year even if it realises later that it doesn’t need that much, while Russia offers a stable price less dependent on market fluctuations.“If the UK buyers were to sign medium to long-term contracts with Russia, that would provide them with some insulation against extreme price volatility,” says Yafimava. It would be a risky gambit. “No one is going to want to sign one of those deals right at the top of the market,” cautions one energy market insider. “But if you were willing to commit to four or five years, the Russian suppliers would probably find you some gas even though it would be expensive.” Put it all together, and Britain might be able to put together a package that is attractive enough to persuade Russia to sell us just enough gas to keep the country running. Of course, we are still a long way from that point. Ministers are not even considering it right now. It would leave us dangerously exposed and the UK is determined to make a success of the Cop26 climate summit later this month. “Russia’s main priority will be Russian consumers,” says Marzec-Manser. “As they meet that, and as they refill their own storage, will they increase supply onto the global spot market? We may start to see that as we head into November and that will help the market calm down.” That will certainly be a relief to everyone. The weather may well be mild throughout the winter, which, as Kwasi Kwarteng told business leaders this week, would ease demand. Extra supply may turn up if factories in Europe close simply because energy prices are ridiculously high. A recession in China, by no means impossible with its property market wobbling, would reduce demand even further. Something may turn up at the last minute, as it often does. If it doesn’t, however, the British economy will be in real trouble, and the Government with it.  Additional reporting by Lucy Fisher and Nataliya VasilyevaMore from NewsSir David Amess latest: Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer pay respects at scene of murderBig tech censorship threatens our democracyExclusive: Uyghur jailbreak complicates Taliban\u0026#39s ties with ChinaDespite the tough rhetoric, ministers are handing Britain\u0026#39s electric car production to ChinaNasa sends Lucy probe on 12-year mission to explore asteroids around JupiterMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"melbourne embraced zero covid now remains isolated world bounces","story":"It’s a bright cold day in October and the clocks are striking nine. That’s the time when residents of my home town of Melbourne, Australia, must obey a curfew or face crushing fines for breaching health orders. It’s not quite Orwell’s Oceania, but Australia’s second city shares some alarming similarities with the totalitarian regime from Nineteen Eighty-Four.Melbourne holds the dubious record of being the most locked-down city in the world – 260 days and counting. Watching television footage from Italy, India, New York and even London at the peak of their outbreaks terrified many Australians into relinquishing all their civil liberties.Unlike in the UK, where advice is formulated by Sage, Australian state health officers issue restrictions without explaining the science underpinning them. Many experts doubt that rules like curfews curb Covid at all. As cases in locked-down Melbourne reached a record high of 2,300 per day, officials in Sydney ended lockdown early after a vaccination drive. The reason for the spike is that Melbourne’s lockdown-fatigued citizens are secretly breaking all the rules, even those that actually work.Democracy has crumbled under zero Covid, with parliaments shut for months under health orders. The twitching curtain brigade, encouraged by government campaigns urging them to inform on their neighbours, watch for rule-breakers and use special hotlines to summon the police. Melbourne police were recently ordered to patrol playgrounds until a public outcry forced a U-turn. In a park near me, children on scooters flee as a police car pulls up. It’s like a scene from RoboCop.Masks are mandatory outdoors even if walking on a windswept beach or a deserted street. Those caught disobeying may be fined, handcuffed, forcibly masked and arrested if they refuse to comply. In another Orwellian twist, health orders banning protests are issued by bureaucrats reporting to the very leaders the protesters are demonstrating against. Protest organisers, including a pregnant woman, have been arrested in their homes and hit with conspiracy charges. Religious worship, even in small groups outdoors, has been banned.Getting into Australia has been near-impossible. Getting out requires a North Korea-style exit permit. Border closures have separated families and caused untold hardship. Babies have died, unable to access urgent medical attention at the nearest hospital across a locked state border. Thousands of holiday-makers who were travelling when border closures were imposed have been made homeless, some having to sleep in cars or live for months in refugee-style campsites, unable to return home even if they are double vaccinated. Some have been prevented from visiting dying relatives in other cities. Yet state leaders have held firm, only lifting interstate bans for celebrities and sports stars.Many abroad envy Australians, believing we have escaped the worst of the pandemic, but the true cost of our lockdown policy is yet to be fully understood. While deaths have remained low, other metrics paint a disastrous picture. Psychologists and GPs report a surge in substance abuse, eating disorders, domestic and child abuse, truancy, depression, anxiety and self-harm. Even high vaccine uptake may not protect the most vulnerable from Covid let alone the other illnesses that could ravage Australia due to the “immunity debt” caused by much lower exposure to other viruses.While Sydney opens up, some states are still pursuing doomed zero-Covid policies. The irony is that flights between Sydney and London will resume long before Australians can travel freely within their own country.Megan Goldin is the author of ‘The Night Swim’ and ‘Stay Awake’More from NewsSir David Amess latest: Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer pay respects at scene of murderBig tech censorship threatens our democracyExclusive: Uyghur jailbreak complicates Taliban\u0026#39s ties with ChinaDespite the tough rhetoric, ministers are handing Britain\u0026#39s electric car production to ChinaNasa sends Lucy probe on 12-year mission to explore asteroids around JupiterMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed schools get pupils every russell group university","story":"When parents are deciding which school to send their child to, there are a number of factors they will want to consider.

A PCR has been put on this pedestal and thought to be always better than lateral flow.It will lead to a spike in cases, and we’re already seeing that in places like Stroud. Currently we’re seeing rising cases in children, but that is now starting to bleed through to older age ranges - so this will impact on hospitalisations and deaths a few weeks down the line.The errors relate to test results given to people between September 8 and October 12, mainly in the South West of England, but with some cases in the South East and Wales.In early September, scientists and data analysts pointed out that case numbers in the south west seemed artificially low, and noticed that unusually high numbers of positive lateral flow tests were coming back negative when checked against the gold-standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR).The Office for National Statistics (ONS) infection survey had also recorded surging cases in the south west, even though it was not apparent from the Government\u0027s daily coronavirus dashboard.It is the first crisis for the UKHSA, which has recently replaced Public Health England (PHE) after the organisation was criticised for its early handling of mass testing,Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UKHSA, told the BBC that feedback and queries about testing issues had been coming through over the last two or three weeks from public health directors in the south west.But she admitted it was only in the past few days that they had dug right down into the geography and discovered testing discrepancies.She said it was not clear yet what went wrong in the private laboratory, adding that it was accredited to all of the appropriate standards.The Government awarded Immensa a £119 million contract in October 2020 to urgently develop volume for PCR testing for Covid in line with test and trace requirements, the contract shows.However, in January, an investigation by The Sun newspaper showed workers fighting, drinking alcohol, playing football and sleeping in the Wolverhampton lab.Andrea Riposati, chief executive of Immensa, is also chief executive of Dante labs, which is under investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for issues including not delivering PCR tests or results on time.Adam Finn, Professor of Paediatrics, University of Bristol and a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said that his team had flagged the issue to the director of public health in Bristol several weeks ago.This was not an invisible problem, he said. A number of people have been puzzled by getting positive lateral flow tests and then getting negative PCR.This has been around for two or three weeks. We have been aware of it and warned about it. How did it take a month to notice? In my lab, we would notice immediately if there was a problem.There are questions that need to be answered. We need reassurance that it won’t happen again.NHS Test and Trace is contacting people who could still be infectious to advise them to take another test, while close contacts who are symptomatic will also be advised to take a test, as is already recommended.However, because of the delay, it was likely only a few thousand of the 43,000 affected were still infectious, Dr Harries said.Tim Barton, 48, said he and his family received positive lateral flow tests after falling ill with coronavirus symptoms earlier this month, but their PCR tests came back negative.Mr Barton, a client relationship director, said: My son, daughter and myself all had positive lateral flow tests - we then had PCR tests done at the test site in Swindon all of which came back negative.This will undoubtedly impact people\u0027s confidence in the accuracy of these types of tests. They could have cost lives.Graham Loader, from Newbury, also said his family had three positive lateral flow tests, all followed by negative PCR tests taken at the testing site at Newbury Showground, in West Berkshire.His wife, a schoolteacher, returned to work after a negative PCR test.Mr Loader, who coaches a boy\u0027s football team, said: I completely trusted the PCR, so I feel bad for all the people I\u0027ve been in contact with.The issue was first noticed in early September, when scientists and data analysts on social media noticed that cases in the South West had started to plummet.Local authorities that had been experiencing worrying hotspots, suddenly saw case rates drop to a tenth of the previous number in just a fortnight.Experts said it was unusual, because such dramatic falls did not even happen in areas of self-limiting outbreaks, such as in factories or prisons.Dave McNally, who was watching the data closely, pointed out the strange numbers on Twitter, posting a graph which showed that PCR testing had pretty much halved in the space of seven days between September 9 and September 16.He told The : A few of us noticed on September 10 that something wasn’t right in the number from September 8.By September 20, it looked clear to me that PCR samples were going wrong in some way.While the west of the country had been responsible for roughly six per cent of England’s daily case numbers since the start of August, overnight it dropped below three per cent during mid to late September.Although case rates rose back to normal level towards the end of September, by the beginning of October the numbers were falling suspiciously again.In early October, members of the public began to report that despite having symptoms of Covid and multiple positive lateral flow tests, they were still being told they did not have the virus.Professor Adam Finn, Professor of Paediatrics at the University of Bristol, said: We have a regular meeting to discuss the condition of the pandemic in Bristol every month, adding that it was at least two weeks ago, if not more, that this was first brought up.He said: A number of people have been puzzled by getting positive lateral flow tests and then getting negative PCR. This has been around for two or three weeks. We have been aware of it and warned about it.The director of public health in Bristol knew about it. I would have expected that there would have been some communication about it. This was not an invisible problem.It was around this time that news of a ‘super cold’ emerged, with people claiming to feel dreadful, yet testing negative for coronavirus.When the social media analysts began looking at the test results more closely, they realised something very odd was happening.Normally, because of the delay in PCR test data coming back from labs, the daily specimen count is revised up as more results are returned. It is usually completed five days later.But in nine areas of the south west, the opposite was happening. The figures were being revised down.What became clear was that large numbers of lateral flow positives were being removed from the figures.Latest data from the infection survey shows that the south west is now one of the worst areas in the country for Covid cases, most likely driven by the cases that were not picked up.More from NewsSir David Amess latest: Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer pay respects at scene of murderBig tech censorship threatens our democracyExclusive: Uyghur jailbreak complicates Taliban\u0026#39s ties with ChinaDespite the tough rhetoric, ministers are handing Britain\u0026#39s electric car production to ChinaNasa sends Lucy probe on 12-year mission to explore asteroids around JupiterMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"vice admiral led kabul evacuation named new head royal navy","story":"The Vice Admiral who led the evacuation of 15,000 people from Kabul has been appointed the new head of the Royal Navy.On Friday, the Government announced that Sir Ben Key would become the First Sea Lord, succeeding Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, who was promoted to Chief of the Defence Staff last week.As Chief of Joint Operations, Vice Adml Key was said to have impressed many with his role in the Operation Pitting rescue mission, which Navy sources described as a “recent highlight” in his esteemed career. They added that the non-combatant evacuation, which was carried out against a backdrop of a rapid Taliban offensive in Afghanistan, was executed “in pretty extraordinary circumstances and that would be largely recognised”.Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, said Vice Adml Key, who will be promoted to Admiral, was “an exceptional military officer”.“As the current Chief of Joint Operations, Vice Admiral Sir Ben was one of the key architects of the incredible Op Pitting rescue mission, which weeks ago saw the successful evacuation of over 15,000 British nationals and Afghans from Kabul,” he added.Mr Wallace added that each day threats at home and abroad “multiply” and that the Armed Forces will continue to modernise to counter such threats directly.“Under Vice Admiral Key’s leadership, the Royal Navy and Royal Marines are in excellent hands,” he said.Admiral Radakin also said that in his new role, Vice Adml Key would continue “the modernisation of the Royal Navy to help ensure we can meet future threats and deliver for the nation”.“We live in a period of enormous change and I am delighted to be working with Sir Ben in my new role as Chief of the Defence Staff to ensure the Royal Navy and the rest of defence are a global force delivering for Global Britain,” he added.Vice Adml Key described the promotion as an “honour and privilege”, adding: “I am excited at the prospect of leading the exceptional sailors and marines of the Royal Navy through the exciting challenges we have ahead.”Vice Adml Key pledged to build on the “transformation work” of the Navy that was undergone by his predecessor and would endeavour to continue the “ambitious modernisation” set out in last year’s integrated review of defence. He said: “I have seen close up, as the Chief of Joint Operations, the impact our increasingly globally deployed Navy has had. I am determined we continue to deliver on these opportunities, working with allies and partners around the world in support of the Government objectives.”Vice Adml Key, who has also held the position of Fleet Commander, joined the Navy in 1984 as a university cadet, where he graduated with a degree in physics from Royal Holloway, University of London.He qualified as both helicopter aircrew and as a Principal Warfare Officer, and has seen service around the world in a variety of frigates and destroyers.Throughout his career, he has commanded four ships, including the mine hunter HMS Sandown, the frigates HMS Iron Duke and HMS Lancaster, and the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious.Defence sources added that while the recent Operation Pitting raised Vice Adml Key’s profile, in his two-and-a-half years as Chief of Joint Operations he had worked through “many crises and enduring operations around the world”.They said: “What he’s done during that time is understand in much more detail how defence needs to adapt and change, and better integrate to meet the threats in the future. He’s certainly got a much clearer idea now of how the Navy can better contribute to defence’s challenges, so I think that that would have been very compelling to the Defence Secretary.” Vice Adml Key, who lives with his wife Elly and three children in Dorset, is a Freeman of the City of London and a Younger Brother of Trinity House. He is also the president of Royal Navy Rugby Union, UK Armed Forces Rugby and UK Armed Forces Golf.More from NewsSir David Amess latest: Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer pay respects at scene of murderBig tech censorship threatens our democracyExclusive: Uyghur jailbreak complicates Taliban\u0026#39s ties with ChinaDespite the tough rhetoric, ministers are handing Britain\u0026#39s electric car production to ChinaNasa sends Lucy probe on 12-year mission to explore asteroids around JupiterMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"wanted national trust leader can trusted love heritage","story":"The National Trust will hold its Annual General Meeting two weeks tomorrow, in Harrogate. It will be its first real (as opposed to virtual) AGM since Covid. The intervening period has been the most troubled in the Trust’s history, so the meeting ought to be an occasion for frank self-examination at the top.The current signs are that it will not be. The Trust management has decided to bristle angrily against critics rather than trying to improve good will. This week, an NT spokesman told the  that it was under attack by “paid-for campaigns that back candidates with ideologies opposed to our values”.This was a pointlessly aggressive way to refer to the new grass-roots organisation, Restore Trust. Restore Trust (RT) is explicitly committed to restoring the values which founded the National Trust – the conservation, for the public, of “places of historic interest or natural beauty” – hence its name. To this end, it is endorsing some candidates for the NT’s Council and advancing some resolutions for the AGM. (Voting by members not attending the AGM closes on 22 October: all you need to vote online is your membership number.) RT would not exist at all if there were not widespread disillusionment with the way the NT is being run.The plague from Wuhan created genuine, enormous problems for the NT: what do you do if the public are not allowed to visit the houses and gardens you hold in trust for them? But instead of simply getting on with a programme of necessary retrenchment, the Trust allowed ideology to run riot.First, an internal report was leaked attacking the “outdated mansion experience” (what you or I would call the careful conservation of beautiful country houses). Next, the “interim” report of NT properties’ links with slavery and “colonialism” was published, creating controversy by its poor scholarship and its judgemental character. Winston Churchill was one of its prominent victims. It also emerged that a “Colonial Countryside Project” was in progress. This took parties of young schoolchildren round NT properties to tell them how wicked the former owners (often donors, too) had been, inviting them to write poems denouncing them.As public anxiety spread, many related discontents surfaced. The redundancy programme, partly inevitable because of Covid, seemed to many members of staff to be targeted against older, more knowledgeable employees who did not conform to “ersity” criteria. Curators, the traditional mainstay of conservation scholarship about Trust properties, were cut. The Trust denies this, pointing out that curator numbers have increased. The RT response is that this is largely a sleight of hand, since employees previously called “Visitor Experience Consultants” have been rebranded as “Experiences and Partnerships Curators”, with no increase in expertise.As for the far more numerous NT volunteers – the unpaid labour whom the visiting public meet much more often than the staff – these have been fiercely reduced and, some of them claim, rudely treated by management. One of the RT-backed resolutions at the AGM complains that volunteers have not been properly consulted before changes take place. The NT’s legalistic defence is that consultation would create obligations to them under employment law. Surely, if there were a will, the NT could find a way through that one.The unease echoes in the membership, which has fallen markedly (despite renewal discounts) since Covid. The phrase “National Trust” has in the past been taken to mean what it says. Members have trusted the organisation. Less so now. Interpretations, gimmicks and “experiences” seem to have taken over from faithful care of the original houses, gardens, landscapes and farms. Respect for the spirit of place, so essential for such a erse heritage, seems to have been replaced by that of a cross between a didactic museum and a kiddies’ theme-park.Stourhead in Wiltshire, for example, is a world-famous example of 18th-century classical style and craftsmanship, in furniture as well as architecture. Yet if you enter its hall today, the first thing that confronts you, blocking the vista to the next room, is a large white cube. One of its faces asks, “Why do objects matter?” Another lists possible objects which the Trust thinks might matter to the visitor, such as “the apron he cooks in” and “That magnet you bought in Barcelona”. On top of the cube lie several objects, including a globe, a teapot and a quill pen. Even if I had ever bought a magnet in Barcelona, or worn a cook’s apron, how would this intrusive display enhance my understanding of Stourhead?Something similar happens in gardens, often crowded with instructions saying, “Catch your breath” (Glendurgan, Cornwall), “How has Nature helped you connect?” (also Stourhead) or “Slow your pace and enjoy the place” (generic).The interventions can be magnificently unhistorical. At Croome Court, Worcestershire, a mansion with a Capability Brown garden, some Trust showman heard recently that in 1760, the then owner, Lord Coventry, had demolished the cottages of his tenants next to his new house, and evicted them. A pretend 18th-century protest was organised for the edification of visitors: NT employees marched with placards saying, “Down with Lord Coventry!” Coming across this parade by chance, the Coventry family archivist felt compelled to point out that Lord C had actually knocked down his tenants’ houses to build them better ones. The NT pageant revealed the prejudices – and the ignorance – of those involved.Amidst assorted troubles, the NT chairman, Tim Parker, resigned this summer, embroiled in the scandal of the unjust imprisonment of sub-postmasters at the behest of the Post Office, of which he is also chairman. So now there is a vacancy. Applications closed this week.The appointment process for a new NT chairman makes the election of the Pope look transparent. Britain’s largest membership organisation gives no say whatever to the members, welcoming their money but not their opinions. Its Nominations Committee selects, in secret, one candidate and the Council then approves whoever that may be. There is little chance, therefore, that the existing establishment will cede power to any challenger. Rumour suggests Sandy Nairne, a member of the NT Council and former director of the National Portrait Gallery, and the current (two-term) deputy chairman Orna NiChionna, a businesswoman, as candidates. Both are able people, but both are implicated in what has gone wrong.A prominent outsider candidate has come forward at the last minute. Rory Stewart, the writer, traveller, and former government minister, is a dark horse and a lone wolf – if one can be two animals at once – so I cannot place him in any faction. But his commitment to our country’s built heritage and land stewardship (the Trust owns 600,000 acres) is real. I have direct experience of his conservation skills because I visited him in Afghanistan. There, against every possible disadvantage of war, filth and poverty, he had cleared the rubbish which had buried the old city of Kabul, restoring eight acres of old buildings, streets and courtyards and filling them, via his Turquoise Mountain charity, with revived Afghan crafts and workshops. It was about the only Western initiative in that country which succeeded. Rory seemed to love conservation and to know how it can enhance modern life.I fear it is the lack of love for the NT’s historic collections, buildings and gardens which is most disheartening about the current leadership. The members feel that love, though, and will respond warmly to leaders who share it. Restoration and reconciliation can be accomplished, but only with urgent change.More from NewsSir David Amess latest: Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer pay respects at scene of murderBig tech censorship threatens our democracyExclusive: Uyghur jailbreak complicates Taliban\u0026#39s ties with ChinaDespite the tough rhetoric, ministers are handing Britain\u0026#39s electric car production to ChinaNasa sends Lucy probe on 12-year mission to explore asteroids around JupiterMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"after david amess jo cox","story":"After David Amess, as with Jo Cox killing, we must never allow violence and hate to winMy friend Jo Cox was murdered in  and since then her family and friends have made an extraordinary effort to bring communities together – David Amess was known for his personal kindness and that must be at the heart of the legacy of this latest horrorthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video david-amess-kim-leadbeater-says-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:fTliOg,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

An MP killed in his constituency. A father-of-three this time, popular amongst MPs of all parties and known for his kindness in the House, murdered just doing his job. All good MPs understand that constituency work is why they are in office. It’s where they see the mum with the disabled child who needs to be rehoused, or the dad whose benefits have been cut, and where elderly folk come to chat over tea and a hobnob. It’s where MPs meet ‘real people’, unfiltered by aides or interest groups. It’s where democracy is enacted.  But it’s more than that too. Constituency work is where our representative democracy is seen to happen, the human interface between an anonymous ‘X’ on a ballot paper and actual power. New safety measures are needed to keep MPs safe, but they must fall short of locking MPs behind glass. Not only would this allow violence to triumph, it would also heighten the growing distance and disdain ordinary people feel for politicians.

On social media, in our everyday interactions, in what we publish or say in Parliament. We have to learn to disagree better. For a moment, watching the news break, like many others who knew Jo Cox better than me, I was back watching the England-Wales game in , seeing a text message that an MP had been shot and stabbed in Birstall. I knew that meant only one thing, my friend Jo.  What has happened since has been an extraordinary effort by her family and friends to work to bring communities together – including our own project Britain Talks. Even among those who, like me, disagreed with David’s views, he was known for his personal kindness. I know that those who loved David will want, in the coming months, to build a positive legacy in his name. Kindness must be at the heart of that legacy.

She became an internet sensation in February over a leaked video of her trying to referee a fractious gathering of Handforth Parish Council in Cheshire. One member told her: “You have no authority here, Jackie Weaver” - prompting web mirth during the third national lockdown. Now, Ms Weaver has thrown her support behind a Compassion in Politics petition to ban lying in politics. The think-tank’s plan, revealed by the Mirror earlier this year, would overhaul existing laws governing the marketing of goods and apply them to statements made by politicians. What do you think of the petition  Have your say in the comment section  A ,-signature petition will be handed to the Government on Wednesday. Ms Weaver said: “Working in politics, I’ve seen just how much damage dishonesty can do. “It makes it impossible to create policies based on evidence, it creates toxicity and ision, it destroys trust in the political process. “We don’t tolerate it in any other places of work - why should we tolerate it in politics   “This new law would create a very clear line in the sand - stating once and for all that lies and misrepresentation will not be tolerated in a decent, democratic society.” In a video message, she adds: “You have the power. Dare I say it  You have the authority.” Compassion in Politics co-director Jenner Nadel said: “Any political system which allows politicians to lie with impunity is not fit for purpose.  “There are laws against lying in other areas of le but none in politics - and that needs to change. “You can’t lie when selling a car so why should anyone be allowed to lie when presenting policies or reporting on government activity ” Green MP Caroline Lucas, who is backing the bid, said a “healthy democracy needs honest leaders”. She added: “We cannot hold politicians to account when they lie, misrepresent and spin the facts, we cannot have open and honest debates based on fake news and  information, we cannot hope to make good policy from bad facts.”  The Mirror told in May how % of voters would back the introduction of a new law to make it a crime for politicians to deliberately lie. Support for the move was weakest among Lib Dem supporters, with % giving it their approval.Backing was highest among Labour voters, % of whom wanted new legislation creating the offence, while % of Tory voters were supportive. Just three per cent of , people quizzed online by Opinium opposed the idea – the same proportion who believed politicians routinely tell the truth. Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru have drafted legislation which the party plans to table in Parliament later this year. Under the proposal, which is unlikely to become law without Government support, offenders found guilty could face an unlimited fine or two-year jail terms. Plaid’s Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts said: “This law is urgently needed to ensure rogue politicians are held to account.” She added: “Accountability lies at the heart of democracy, it is the foundation of trust in government. “But current rules allow politicians to undermine that trust by running fast and loose with the truth, with no consequences.” Comment MORE ON Liberal DemocratsConservative PartyJackie WeaverCaroline LucasViralPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Is the Queen a secret radical Leftie Her Majestys long reign has probably produced more carbon dioxide than any of her subjects, says Fleet Street Fox. But shes turning into a bit of a hippy in her old ageopinionByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | commentsIn general, any -year-old dripping in jewellery that costs more than the average house will, when discussing climate change, state that it is someone aposs problem. And so it was when the Queen attended the opening of the Welsh Senedd, wearing pearl earrings the size of a mint humbug, shortly before stepping into a Kevlar-plated limousine to drive a single, solitary mile to the station where her personal train awaited her.She was caught on a livestream discussing the upcoming COP climate change summit, saying: Extraordinary isnapost it... still donapost know whoaposs coming, no idea... we only know about people who are not coming and itaposs really irritating when they talk, but donapost do.She might have meant it was irritating when guests donapost reply to invitations, but most people have taken it as a broad criticism of world leaders failing to save the planet.   Seeing as this is a woman whose homes contain a large amount of the planet that was mined, carved, shot, skinned, robbed or stolen before it was squirrelled away for her and her family, you might reasonably conclude itaposs a bit rich for her to criticise. But she has done rather more than most of her Prime Ministers to de-carbonise the country. Buckingham Palace has heat and hot water produced by a combined heat and power plant, with solar  in the offing. Windsor Castle boasts hydroelectric power fed by the River Thames, while Balmoral produces  tonnes of compost every year from its organic waste. She also sends old staff computers to be recycled, and redistributed by charities in the developing world.A quarter of the UKaposs power comes from wind turbines, a vast number of which are on offshore farms she technically owns, and which are leased from the Crown Estate. Sheaposs patron of  environmental charities, her husband had more than , and their eldest son has a -year-old car which has an engine converted to run on wine and cheese.Aside from the fact thataposs the automobile version of Boris Johnson, itaposs more than anyoneaposs done to make  Downing Street any greener. In fact, the real-time website displaying the PMaposs energy use is currently kaput. On the same day she was caught making a snfy remark about the Chinese refusal to come to the environmental party, climate activist Greta Thunberg said COP would involve many pledges that -you look into the details - are more or less meaningless but they just say them in order to have something to say, in order for media to have something to report about.And so there are two uncomfortable things to consider. The first is that,the Chinese donapost turn up, there is no chance the rest of the world could limit global warming to an extra . degrees. Islands will be lost to melted ice caps, species will go extinct, and mass immigrations will take place, all because Xi Jinping is too much of a capitalist.The second is that Her Majesty might be a secret hippy. An unco-operative crusty. A friend of Swampy. A hippy-dippy, namby-pamby, ooh-itaposs-all-got-to-be-a-bit-green, woke old greenhouse whinger.Read more The evidence for: . Sells own chutney outside house . Always carrying a bunch of flowers . Finds money unnecessary And against: OH COME ON.The woman has  gas-guzzling limousines,  private homes, another  she uses for work, two jets, three helicopters, a train, and had to have her diesel-powered yacht prised out of her hands. In , it was calculated she had travelled more than a million miles, equivalent to going around the world  times, in the course of her reign. And thataposs before you calculate the cost to the planet of  children,  grandchildren, and  great-grandchildren, not one of whom is ever going to catch the bus.Throw in the fact sheaposs a widow living in single-glazed, drafty palaces, with hundreds of bedrooms, and thousands of staff, all consuming water and electricity just because she canapost find her own cornflakes in the morning, and Queen Elizabeth II has a bigger carbon footprint than a T-Rex in a coal mine. Itaposs no good saying but she goes around switching the lights off. Thereaposd be a lot more light to go round,she hadnapost bothered to give us Prince Andrew.  But you canapost be a totally green Queen, whatever Meghan Markle might think. A Royal simply isnapost royal any morethey ditch the palaces, staff, and multiple forms of transport. Brenda from down the road might be able to hop on the bus to get to Sainsburyaposs, but Brenda from SWA is going to struggle with it. The Royal travel, state visits, and constant wardrobe changes are part of a job no-one wants to say is surplus to requirements. Staff, security, consumption, and the problems of maintaining ,-year-old castles are something she cannot do much about.Itaposs not like sheaposs about to live in a tunnel under Finsbury Square, or block the M in rush hour while daring a lorry driver to drag her onto the hard shoulder, and shouting SOD THE AMBULANCES!But one of the benefits of a Queen is being able to get her to say or do things that are accidentally overheard but entirely intended, like when David Cameron asked her to intervene in the Scottish independence referendum, or a politician not a million miles from Michael Gove lied that she was pro-Leave, and next chance she got the Queen dressed up as the EU flag to put him back in his box.  Thataposs why it was her name on the COP invitations. Itaposs why her being irritated will be reported worldwide. Itaposs why, perhaps, shamefaced world leaders will suddenly respond to a summit invitation they had hitherto ignored. Queens have power, and old ladies can tickle even the least-guilty conscience with just the tiniest hint of disapproval. Anyone who thinks they havenapost been naughty will start to wonderin fact they have. Those who think the world has forgotten what they did, will be reminded the world should remember what theyaposll do next. The most ardent republican feels the knee creak into a curtsey, when this particular woman asks how far youaposve come. Whether her words were planned or accidental, they will do more than all the Prime Ministeraposs windbaggery to actually move world leaders closer to common sense. That she can do that is the reason we let her get away with everything .Hopefully at the summit sheaposll get the chance to say well, one SHOULD insulate Britain, shouldnapost one  Seeing as she loathed Margaret Thatcher, married a refugee and is literally the head of a union, sheaposs probably more of a radical Leftie than anyone will ever realise.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Xi JinpingThe QueenBoris JohnsonBuckingham PalaceCrown EstateEnergyRoyal FamilyClimate changeJewelleryPoliticsSolar power\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Alex reckons each takeaway would cost between £ and £ and sheaposd buy six per week - on top of £ already spent on her food shop.

My mum is a chef so she used to feed us really healthy food, but the portions would always be quite large, and I donapost knowthataposs where the weight spanned from. I started to become really uncomfortable with myself and walking up the stairs became a daily struggle.

But at most, I only managed to lose two or three stones and I couldnapost seem to lose any more than that. After seemingly trying everything, Alex realised weight loss surgery was the best option for her and opted to have a gastric sleeve operation. The procedure cuts away about % of the stomach to drastically reduce how much a person can eat before feeling full.

The -year-old monarch described the situation as irritating when talking about the leadersapos seemingly laissez-faire attitude to the summit.

The royals normally stay clear of political opinions, but many people have praised Her Majesty for expressing her frustration. Her comment is far from the first time a member of The Firm has been caught making a comment that has raised eyebrows. Charlesaposs jibe at BBC reporter While on holiday in the Swiss Alps with sons William and Harry in , Prince Charles accidentally let slip his true feelings for BBC royal reporter, Nicholas Witchell. Surrounded by reporters asking questions about Charlesaposs upcoming wedding to Camilla Parker Bowles, Charles appeared to lose his patience. After the reporter asked him how he felt about his nuptials, Charles said: Iaposm very glad you heard of it anyway. Then, under his breath and with a grimace, he said: Bloody people. I canapost bear that man. Heaposs so awful. He really is. Although said in a quieter tone, itaposs impossible to knowCharles intended for his comment to be heard - he did have dozens of microphones on him, after all. Row with Russia On a trip to Canada in , Prince Charles ruffled feathers once more when he compared Russian president Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler. The comment came about while he chatted to a -year-old Jewish woman who had fled from Poland during World War Two The Daily Mail reported the heir to the throne said: “Putin is doing just about the same as Hitler.” The alleged comments sparked a furious response from Moscow, with a spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry accusing him and the British press of a smear campaign. The spokesman said: “We view the use of the Western press by members of the British royal family to spread the propaganda campaign against Russia on a pressing issue - that is, the situation in Ukraine - as unacceptable, outrageous and low.” Anneaposs Olympics gaffe Princess Anne made history when she became the first British royal to compete in the Olympic games in Montreal, .  After her equestrian success, she was an integral part of Londonaposs bid to host the  Olympics and is said to have put everything into making sure it was named host city for that year. But she made a serious error in the lead up to the games, which could have landed her in hot water. Sebastian Coe revealed in a documentary about Anneaposs le that she made a rude comment about a fellow committee member, forgetting her microphone was still switched on. Lord Coe said: I do remember, after a rather long-winded interjection by one of the committee members, she had actually forgotten to turn her microphone off. She managed to mutter the immortal words: ‘I think this person is probably the most stupid person in world sport.’  He added she managed to style out her comment in the best way, by simply pretending nothing had happened and moving on with the conversation. Willsapos Covid blunderOn March , , just weeks before the UK went into a strict lockdown as the first peak of the coronavirus pandemic swept the country, Prince William made an ill-fated joke about the virus.Visiting the Guinness Storehouse in Dublin, he said: I bet everyone’s like, aposI’ve got coronavirus, I’m dyingapos, and you’re like, aposNo, you’ve just got a coughapos.

Her pink ambitions began with a kettle and toaster that her stepdad, Michael Heslop, , gave to her as an engagement present. They were, you guessed it, both pink. It all went from there as Maria began choosing other pink objects for her home. So much so that her love of pink even rubbed off on her fiancé, Aaron Mordey, , who got himself a pink motorbike.  Even Mariaaposs pooches have a pink paradise. The coupleaposs second bedroom has been transformed into a room for Jeff and Bow, both huskies.

Despite one leading scientist casting doubt on the existing evidence - with only grainy photographs in existence - many locals remain convinced it is real. It has been described at ious points as like a large snake, a hideous hump-backed creature a long-necked sea monster and an elephant waving its trunk.Have you got pictures of Morgawr, Nessie or another mysterious beastie  Get in touch at webnews@mirrorAnd with the number of dferent descriptions, some have now even suggested there might even be more than one strange creature stalking the Cornish waters.Cornish local Joan Hawthorne wrote: It seems crazy to many I know, but there has been so many sightings that how can they rule out for sure whether it exists  Scotland has cashed in for years on the Loch Ness monster - maybe we should start doing the same in Cornwall. Other suggested the sightings may have even been the Loch Ness Monster visiting Cornwall on holiday - or joked he could have a second home here. Sarah Barnes wrote: Thataposs why I didnapost see Nessie while in Scotland. Sheaposs on her Hollibobs down in Cornwall. Timon Hewlett added: Bet Nessie has a second home down here somewhere. Residents and visitors have recorded many sightings of aposMorgawrapos over the years since the first long-necked beast was allegedly caught by a fisherman  years ago.  This included the most credible yet by a former employee of the Natural History Museum, who claimed to capture the reptile on camera around  years ago. John Holmes, who worked as a higher scientic officer at the Natural History Museum, released strange footage which he had filmed three years prior in Gerrans Bay, off the Roseland Peninsula. He said at the time: My pet theory is that it was a living fossil. I think that there is a group of plesiosaurs going around in the oceans of the world. All around Britain there have been sightings of sea serpents.Despite the claims, a palaeontologist at Nottingham Natural History Adam S. Smith, said they almost certainly didnapost exist.He added: Unfortunately, living- plesiosaurs almost certainly do not exist today.In an extensive article on his website aposPlesiosauriaapos, he wrote: Even a good photograph of a clearly plesiosaur-like organism would not provide conclusive proof for the existence of living plesiosaurs. It is too easy to hoax photographs, increasingly so with the advent of Photoshop, etc. A compelling photograph, or preferably a good series of photographs taken in quick succession, would certainly warrant further investigation.

The home secretary has asked all police forces to review security arrangements for MPs with immediate effect and will provide updates in due course, the spokesman said. Earlier, Patel said she was devastated by the loss of Sir David in what she described as an attack on democracy itself.  She said in a series of tweets: That he was killed while going about his constituency duties is heartbreaking beyond words. It represents a senseless attack on democracy itself. Questions are rightly being asked about the safety of our countryaposs elected representatives and I will provide updates in due course. The attack on Sir David death came just five-and-a-half years after Labour MP Jo Cox was killed by a far right extremist in her Batley and Spen constituency in West Yorkshire. Sir Lindsay said that while it was right that security was reviewed following the latest incident, it was important to avoid knee-jerk reactions. He said MPs needed to be able to carry on meeting their constituents which was an essential part of the democratic process.  I am doing my surgery tonight. I recognise some MPs are not doing theirs. What we canapost do is give in to these people, people who donapost believe in our values, donapost believe in what we do, he told BBC Radio aposs PM programme. I believe the electorate needs to be able to communicate with the people who have been elected. It is part of our democratic process. We donapost want knee-jerk reaction. What we want to do is make sure MPs can carry out their duties. We have got to make sure MPs are safe. What we canapost have is people trying to stop MPs carrying out their duties. We will not and must not tolerate intimidation, threat, violence and at worst somebody being murdered again. His sentiments were echoed by the the Father of the House - the longest-serving sitting MP - Sir Peter Bottomley. I predict all over the country this weekend, next weekend and in the months to come MPs will hold advice sessions. That is what we do, he said. There is no perfect security for anybody. My view has always been that in many other walks of le you are at far greater risk than a Member of Parliament. MPs may get exceptional publicity. We are not exceptional people. Weaposre ordinary people trying to an ordinary job as well as we. We accept the risks. The question is should MPs stop meeting their constituents face-to-face. The answer is we will go on meeting our constituents face-to-face.  Often were are the last people who can help them when they are facing desperate troubles. Their needs, their interests come first.As well as the murder of Ms Cox in June  in the days before the Brexit referendum, the attack on Sir David carried echoes of two earlier incidents when MPs were attacked in their constituencies.In May , East Ham MP Stephen Timms was stabbed twice in the abdomen by Roshonara Choudhry, an Islamic extremist who claimed she had wanted to get revenge for the people of Iraq. Mr Timms suffered serious injuries and according to police was extremely fortunate not to have been killed. He remains an MP. Nigel Jones, then MP for Cheltenham, was severely injured in January  when he was attacked in his offices by a man with a sword. Andrew Pennington, a Gloucestershire county councillor, was killed in the same attack while trying to defend him.

Early years Prince Andrew and Sarah had been friends since they were children but it wasnapost until  that they started dating after being seated together at Royal Ascot that year.They got engaged nine months later on February ,  - his th birthday - and Andrew gave his we-to-be a ruby engagement ring. Their wedding was a grand affair at Westminster Abbey and they shared a kiss on the balcony of Buckingham Palace like Prince Charles and Princess Diana before them. In the early days of their romance, Fergie bonded with the Queen over their shared love of horses, according to Vanity Fair.It was also reported that she won over Prince Philip with her sharp sense of humour and the interest she showed in her father-in-lawaposs favourite sport of carriage driving.Split from Andrew Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.After their wedding, the couple welcomed two daughters - Princess Beatrice in  and Princess Eugenie in .But cracks had begun to appear in their relationship as Andrewaposs naval career saw him away from the family for long periods of time. And in  they split with their orce finalised in . Speaking to US TV host Ernie Manouse in , Sarah spoke about palace courtiers, who she said made her le dficult. She explained: “My deal was that I was marrying my man, who happened to be a prince and a naval officer. “But what I got was not the man, I got the palace and didn’t get him... and the courtiers told me I had to go to Buckingham Palace and he had to go to sea. “For our marriage, I saw him  days a year.” Livid royals  Despite splitting from Andrew, Fergie was still invited to join the family for their traditional summer holiday in Balmoral in . However, the politeness disappeared on one excruciatingly embarrassing moment when intimate photos of her appeared on the front pages. She had been snapped having her toes sucked by her financial advisor, Texan millionaire John Bryan. Other photos in the set also showed the couple kissing, embracing and frolicking in the pool and they appeared in newspapers.And while at Balmoral, Fergie had to walk into breakfast that morning while the family all looked at the pictures. Speaking on Channel aposs documentary, Fergie Vs Diana: Royal Wives at War, royal expert Jennie Bond said: There she was, with all the members of the royal family, who traditionally have all the papers laid out on the breakfast table. The scene when she went into the dining room was horrendous because there were her brothers-in-law turning over the pages and staring at her naked top half of her body. It was excruciatingly embarrassing and she went to the Queen, and the Queen was livid. She was absolutely furious with Sarah. Prince Philip rt  One royal who was said to be especially furious with the toe sucking pictures was the late Prince Philip.His biographer Gyles Brandreth once said Philip thought Sarah was simply beyond the pale and gave her a wide berthBrandreth claimed the Duke of Edinburgh decided that aposenough was enoughapos and that he didnapost want anything more to do with her.He told MailOnline : When I asked him [Prince Philip] why he wouldn’t see Sarah, he said: ‘I am not vindictive.’Then, looking at me directly, he added emphatically: ‘I am not vindictive, but I don’t see the point.’ The pair are said to have not met for  years, with Fergie banished from ­Balmoral each summer before Philip arrived. Diana feud It wasnapost just Prince Philip that Sarah stopped talking to - she also had a falling out with her friend Princess Diana.In the early years of their marriages, Diana and Fergie had a close bond. They were often pictured chatting at events, such as Ascot, and took their children on skiing holidays together with Fergie frequently describing Diana as her best friend. But itaposs thought that in  the pairaposs relationship became strained and at the time of Dianaaposs tragic death a year later, they were not on speaking terms.According to the Daily Mail, the reason stemmed back to Sarahaposs autobiography, My Story, released in .Before it was published, Diana is reported to have told her former sister-in-law not to include any gossip about her in it. But Sarah included an unflattering anecdote, saying she got a verruca after wearing a pair of shoes she borrowed from Diana - causing the rt. William wedding snub In , Fergie was snubbed from the royal wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge after being unceremoniously left off the guest list.The wedding came a year after she was caught up in a sting set up by a journalist in which she appeared to ask for and accept , in cash in exchange for access to her ex-husband Prince Andrew.Speaking to Town and Country Magazine she said: I didn’t think I was probably worthy to go to their wedding. I took myself to Thailand, actually, to be far away from it so that I could try and heal.”But she bore no ill will towards her nephew William and said previously: I think Diana would be so proud of her son... I really love the feeling that Diana and I both werenapost there. Harryaposs invitationHowever, by the time Williamaposs younger brother Prince Harry married Meghan Markle in , the tide had begun to turn.And Fergie did bag an invite to the big day - marking ato the royal fold. In later years, she of course took her place alongside he royals at the weddings of Beatrice and Eugenie. Balmoral Despite Fergieaposs frosty relationship with Prince Philip, she is said to have remained on good terms with the Queen. And this year she appeared to be back in the royal inner circle by spending time with Her Majesty and other royals at Balmoral. According to royal expert Angela Levin, this made Fergie happy and feel assheaposs back in the crowd. Praise for the Queen And showing her gratitude to the Queen, Sarah has given her some high praise indeed. Speaking on the Tea with Twiggy podcast earlier this year, she said she admires the way Her Majesty is so modern and flexible. She said: I think to myself that honestly my mother-in-law has been more of a mother to me than my mother. I absolutely think there is no greater mentor because from a little girl to now, the consistency of Her Majesty has been a great honour and makes me want to cry.

Le is tough on Unst, Britain’s most northerly inhabited island, but it could soon become the site of Britain’s first venture into space from its own territory. Ready for blast-off...Mirrorman Martin Fricker stands on the proposed launch site area Image: Jonathan BuckmasterByMartin Fricker:,  Oct | commentsWise-crackers on a remote Scottish island set to be the new Cape Canaveral have already come up with a slogan: “One wee step for man, one giant leap for McMankind”. Unst, Britain’s most northerly inhabited island, is closer to Norway than Aberdeen and home to fewer than . It has one pub, one hotel, one school, three shops, a lone bus route and no police station or hospital. Located further north than Moscow, sheep outnumber locals and the nearest railway station is in Bergen, Norway. Here le is tough, with an average temperature of C, near-constant gales and just five hours of winter daylight. Yet Unst could soon become the site of Britain’s first venture into space from its own territory. Have your say on this story in the comment section Edinburgh rocket company Skyrora announced this week it had signed a deal to launch satellites from the former Saxa Vord radar base on the island. It wants to send its -metre -ton XL rocket into space from  with up to  launches a year by . Crucially, the SaxaVord Spaceport is expected to create  jobs locally. Not surprisingly it is the talk of the island. At its peak in , during the herring boom, Unst had a population of , but its fortunes declined with the closure of the radar early warning station in .  Hundreds lost their jobs and left the island, creating a knock-on effect for the local economy.In the “capital”, Baltasound, two miles from Saxa Vord, Victoria Mouat, , runs Victoria’s VintageTea Rooms.She moved to Unst  years ago from her native Devon and hopes the spaceport will bring in much-needed trade. She said: “When I first arrived here the island was thriving, thanks to the RAF. “There were social events and re- gattas. There was even an Oktoberfest. “But when the base shut people left in droves, especially young families. “We have an ageing population so I’m really willing the spaceport to succeed because it should bring in new families.”  The mum of four went on: “In summer this is the greatest place on earth. We have hardly any crime and most of us leave our doors unlocked. I genuinely don’t know where my door key is. “But it’s a dferent story in winter. After October we hardly see any visitors.“The weather is bad and it’s only light from am to pm. I just hope it doesn’t put people off coming to work here.“Our northerly location is our claim to fame now but being home to the UK spaceport is even bigger. It’s so exciting.”  Unst, which measures  miles by three, may not boast Cape Canaveral’s tropical climate but it does have one crucial thing in common – its isolation and a “clear run” to space. Rockets must be launched away from urban areas and cannot overfly towns, villages or even oil rigs. From Unst they can head directly north over the Arctic Circle before leaving the earth’s atmosphere. Its northern latitude also means more satellites pass overhead than anywhere  on earth, making it an ideal spot for downloading data from space. At Unst’s only pub, the Balta Light, barmaid Yvonne Thomson, , is confident the spaceport will boost the local economy. She said: “It will bring in the tourists and they will be looking for somewhere to drink. Anything that attracts more visitors is a good thing. “In the longer term, new employees will be bringing their children here which means the school can survive.”  At first sight it is hard to believe Saxa Vord will be launching rockets in a matter of months. New US and Scottish flags fly alongside shiny plastic signs announcing the futuristic site is “under construction”. But just feet away, sheep wander in the howling wind and drizzle through what remains of the RAF base. However, spaceport boss Frank Strang insists plans for a  launch remain on track. The former RAF pilot said: “I’m % confident the first UK orbital launch will take off here next year.” The country-music-loving entrepreneur admits that at first glance Unst is an unlikely frontrunner in the new space race. But plans are in hand for an eco-resort to house visitors and scientists coming to the spaceport.  Get all the latest news straight to your inbox.to one of the Mirroraposs newsletters The -year-old said: “When I first mooted the idea with the local council they thought it was an April Fool. “People of my age think of the old space race but we’re now in the new space race where satellites the size of a teapot cost as little as £,. “On average we all use satellites  times a day in our everyday lives, from cashpoints to mobile phones to GPS. “The UK is ideally placed to be a frontrunner in the new space race and Unst is the perfect spot.” Surprisingly, Frank says there are as many weather windows to launch on the island as there are at sunny Cape Canaveral. “You need a three-hour window of winds under  knots,” he said.“We looked at Met Office data going back a decade and it showed that in spring and autumn we have those windows on % of days. The first rocket is due to be launched from Lamba Ness, a bird-watching spot a mile from the tiny settlement of Haroldswick. Access is via a single-track road where sheep and Shetland ponies wander freely. But plans are under way to build a new road to accommodate the cranes and lorries that carry the rockets. In a reassuring sign of the times, the spaceport is also aiming to be the world’s greenest launch site. Skyrora plans to fuel its rockets with Ecosene, which is made from waste-plastic, preventing more than , tons of un-recyclable plastic going to landfill by . As we leave Unst on the ferry, mph winds howl across the hills and the rain is horizontal as the first early winter storm of  blasts in. It begs the question: Will  really be the year this remote outpost goes up, Unst and away  Just watch this space.

Meghan was a student between  and , finishing one year before Lilyaposs graduation and was a self-confessed theatre nerd before she made her way into television and eventually the Royal Family. Lily - who spent  years playing dferent chilling roles in the award-winning horror series - recently shared memories of her college years and how she first met Meghan. She told Honey : “She was a few years ahead of me but yes, we had I believe the same acting teacher and met sort of early on when I was a freshman.“I was introduced by our acting teacher that she would show me the ropes and show me around campus a little bit, and she was very lovely.” Lily said she has seen Meghan since they first met  years ago - but said not in a while. Meghan earned a joint Bachelor of Arts degree in theatre and international relations at the prestigious college. “I had always been the theatre nerd at Northwestern University, the Duchess told Marie Claire in .  “I knew I wanted to do acting, but I hated the idea of being this cliché: a girl from LA who decides to be an actress. “I wanted more than that, and I had always loved politics, so I ended up changing my major completely, and double-majoring in theatre and international relations. “By my junior year I had finished most of my credits, and I applied for an internship at the US Embassy, so I ended up working in the embassy in Buenos Aires for a few months. “It was during their economic devaluation and our Secretary of the Treasury at the time, Paul OaposNeill, was there. “So Iaposm  years old, in Buenos Aires, in a motorcade, doing that whole thing.  Earlier this year college friend Lindsay Roth, defended Meghan amid accusations of bullying - which the Duchess of Sussex has denied.Lindsay - who now works as a producer and author - posted a defence of Meghan on Instagram in March this year.She claimed that goodwill runs in her bones and branded the royal mum-of-two an altruistic, magnanimous friend. Lindsay and Meghan studied together at Northwestern.  She accompanied the defence of her best pal with a picture of the pair at their graduation, and another on Lindsayaposs wedding day. Megaposs M.O. has always been kindness goodwill runs in her bones, Lindsay wrote. I know this to be true after  years of very close friendship. I have seen firsthand how she treats her friends and their families, and her colleagues. aposSheaposs more than just a cover story,apos Lindsay argued. Her comments came after Meghan hit headlines after accusations of bullying and just before her and Prince Harryaposs tell-all Oprah interview. It comes after Meghan was warned to limit her massively extravagant spending when she joined the Royal Family. Jennie Bond, a former Royal Correspondent at the BBC, has previously warned the Duchess of Sussex over her spending and said the public disliked it. When Meghan became part of The Firm many were hopeful she would help modernise the Royal Family.  Bond appeared to be aware of how Meghanaposs spending habits would translate to the public. In , speaking to Yahoo!Le, she warned the mum-of-two over what she described as her massively extravagant spending.Earlier this week, royal sources revealed the couple will not have daughter Lillibet christened in the UK.There had been suggestions the couple wouldto Britain to have their four-month-old baptised at Windsor Castle like their son Archie, two.  Lilibet Diana, affectionately known as Lili and who is named after the Queen and after Harryaposs mum Diana, was born in a hospital in Santa Barbara, Calornia in June.But a palace insider told the: “There will not be a christening in the UK. It is not happening.Another source said it would be “highly unlikely”. Despite renouncing Royal duties, the couple are still keeping busy. On Tuesday they announced they will be starting ambitious new jobs in the world of finance. They have revealed they have become impact partners and investors of a sustainable investment firm called Ethic based in New York.  The pair announced the move on their Archewell website and said the roles would help them put their values into action.A statement from the couple said: When we invest in each other we change the world… Be it through the investment of time , investment in community , or the investment of funds , our choices—of how and where we put our energy—define us as a global community.

The loving father had been tormented for more than a decade by the horrendous murder of his daughter, Meredith - with key questions surrounding the infamous case remaining unanswered to this day. In January last year, the -year-old died in hospital after being found in the road near his Croydon home with two fractured legs, a broken arm and a head injury.In yet another cruel blow to his family, this week a coroner said he was unable to sayJohn was killed in a hit-and-run - with police unable to establish why he was on the road.In a book about Meredithaposs murder, the grief-stricken dad spoke movingly about the stark possibility the Kerchers may never know what happened in her final hours. This is how the family was rocked by the murder trial and subsequent acquittal that made headlines around the world - and why they have a complicated relationship with Meredithaposs exonerated flatmate, Amanda Knox. aposBeautul, caringapos daughter stabbed  times Described by her father as beautul, intelligent and caring, Meredith - from Coulsdon, Surrey - was murdered on November , , during an exchange trip to Italy. Sickeningly, the -year-oldaposs body was found with  stab wounds on the bedroom floor of her apartment in Perugia. Her throat had been cut and an autopsy revealed evidence of sexual assault. John, who was a national newspaper journalist, later recalled how he first discovered his daughter was dead after ringing up a news desk to find out about reports of a British student killed in Perugia.I drop the phone. I do not believe it, he wrote in the Daily Mail.There has to be a mistake. I refuse to let the facts sink in. I repeat it over and over to myself: ‘Not beautul Meredith... Not beautul Meredith.apos  In a case that became a media storm, Meredithaposs housemate Amanda Knox was twice convicted and twice acquitted of her murder and spent four years in prison along with her former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito. Another man, Rudy Guede, was also convicted of murder and was released in December last year after serving a -year sentence. Explaining the sensational acquittal, court adviser Gennaro Marasca said none of the evidence demonstrated that either Knox or Sollecito was present at the crime scene. He added that no biological traces ... could be attributed to them in the room of the murder or on the body of the victim, where in contrast numerous traces were found attributable to Guede.Familyaposs torment over aposstark possibilityapos of never seeing justiceIn the years since, Knox, , has furiously slammed the handling of the case and her utterly unjustied treatment. The Kerchers, meanwhile, have kept a lower profile as they struggle to get answers over what really happened the night Meredith was murdered.  Speaking on the tenth anniversary of her death, sister Stephanie said the pain and helplessness never ceases.She told MailOnline : It is dficult to come terms with not knowing exactly what happened that night, as whether you believe the guilt or innocence of the accused there are still contradictions and discrepancies in the judgeaposs summary.Nor have we heard anything more of a further investigation into who  they think may have been involved. Rudy Guede ... was convicted on the basis that he did not act alone, however, with no one  on trial or convicted it does of course raise questions for us as a family and anyone following the case. In his memoir, Meredith: Our Daughter’s Murder And The Heartbreaking Quest For The Truth, John revealed his pain that the courtroom drama had overshadowed the le of his little girl. In a moving portrait, he paid tribute to her jokes, her wicked one-liners and her laughter - revealing how following his orce from we Arline in , he was comforted by a voicemail from Meredith singing Whitney Houston’s I Will Always Love You down the phone. Yet the familyaposs torment was still painfully raw. We are still waiting for justice for our daughter and sister, he wrote. [We] have to face up to the stark possibility that we might never have a satisfactory picture of what unfolded in Perugia on that terrible November night. In the summer of , John suffered a stroke which he speculated could have been related to the stress of the criminal investigation and draining trips to Italy. Last January, he was found yards from his front door collapsed on the pavement. Scotland Yard initially said John died in a suspected hit-and-run, but later said he had died of a fall. An inquest into John’s death heard the freelance journalist was found by passers-by near his home in Croydon, south London, on a “dark, wet and windy” night in mid-January last year. He was “conscious but confused” and did not know why he was on the ground, the court heard. A Kercher family spokesman said at the time of John’s death: “We loved him dearly and he is going to be very sorely missed.” Knoxaposs aposcomplicatedapos relationship with Kerchers The Kerchersapos search for answers has at times brought them into conflict with Knox, with relatives slamming her inappropriate behaviour following her acquittal.The American has built up a huge media profile - releasing a memoir that reportedly earned her £.million, taking part in a Netflix documentary about the case and most recently hosting a series of podcasts including The Truth About True Crime. In , she ed to Italy to participate in a conference about wrongful convictions, sparking a rare statement from the Kerchers branding her actions inappropriate and very painful.The Kerchers’ lawyer, Francesco Maresca, told the: “All these insistences and appearances are only ever done to keep the attention on herself.“The murder is a tragic memory for the Kercher family, they lost their daughter and sister in such a terrible way. It’s also an injustice for them as they still don’t know the full truth.” He added of her involvement in the conference: “It’s unjustied because her process was not a classic case of ‘judicial error’. There was a swing in the decisions: some judges decided one way, and others in another way.” Previously Knox has said she would like to meet the Kercher family and visit Meredithaposs grave - but was warned by sister Stephanie to stay away.  She is currently pregnant with her first child with husband Christopher Robinson after suffering a miscarriage in May. Speaking to RTÉ Radio  in August, Knox admitted she has kept her distance from Meredithaposs parents, saying: “To this day, I can’t tell youthey know that I’m innocent or not.”  Given the fact that I don’t know that fact, I also understand that me even approaching them is a potential cause of great distress to their family and a dredging up of terrible memories.”She added: “I understand that the Kerchers have gone through an incredibly traumatic journey, not just from the tragic loss of Meredith but also through the incredibly confusing trial that they had to experience and go through and the feeling of being denied a sense of closure because of the outcome of the case. “Given that understanding, I also know that they have a complicated relationship with me.” Comment MORE ON Meredith KercherAmanda KnoxRudy GuedeRaffaele SollecitoMurder\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Fed up with her teenagersapos excuses for getting down to work, she devised a plan to take away the internet until the room was in a more acceptable state. The -year-old unplugged the familyaposs Wi-Fi extender, locked it away in a box and the key hidden somewhere in Kaceyaposs room.

Have you done something similar  Let us know in the comments With Kacey having cleaned her room, the crafty plan paid off, however she was still unable to find the key with the pesky mum having to reveal its hiding spot under the Xbox.

Ministers have been urged to consider cutting VAT on fuel as petrol prices hit their highest level since September . The RAC said it is only p off the record high that occurred in April of the same year. Prices have now gone up by nearly p a litre in just  months, driven by a doubling in the cost of a barrel of oil to  US dollars. The RAC said the rising cost of oil means drivers are now paying p per litre more in VAT than a year ago.  September’s switch to E petrol – which increased the biofuel content – added around p per litre to average prices. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “Our data shows we haven’t seen the petrol price at this sort of level since September , and we’re now worryingly close to the all-time average UK price high of .p that was hit in the same year. “At a time when households and businesses are facing spiralling prices in other areas, this is a huge concern.” Mr Williams urged ministers to consider reducing VAT on fuel. He said: “We call on the Government to take action and do whatever it can to help ease the burden on drivers. “While the cost of oil has more than doubled in a year, the price drivers pay at the forecourt is compounded by the fact there is nearly p in fuel duty charged on every litre. “And, on top of the delivery cost and the retailer’s margin, you’ve then got VAT which currently accounts for p a litre.” He added: “It might be most effective for the Government to consider temporarily cutting the level of VAT on motor fuel to help hard-pressed drivers.” The RAC does not believe the recent panic buying of fuel contributed to price increases.

And it’s understandable why. The Queen - renowned for staying silent and dressing in impartiality - suddenly having a rather strong opinion on such a political issue is quite the story.And while there’s a blatant sense of hypocrisy about a family preaching about the climate while sitting on mined jewels, flying private jets and running multiple estates the Royal Family’s sudden interest in Mother Nature also feels like a transparent attempt to ert people’s attention.

Vigorously denying the allegations in his infamous  Newsnight interview, Andrew said he had no recollection of ever meeting her and claimed the photo of the two together had been doctored.But the noise surrounding Andrew’s legal battle has quickly been muffled by coverage of William’s Earthshot initiative and the Queen’s rare anger towards Russia and China’s green efforts.The Met also quietly announced it was dropping its probe into Andrew, while the Duke is still laying low, playing on Mummy’s horses.So while the Queen and William are sweating about the planet, Andrew is staying cool.

It’s been a tumultuous couple of years in the palace, with the death of the Queen’s husband and the ongoing legal pursuit of sexual assault charges facing Prince Andrew coming in the wake of the departure of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle from royal duties.The latter two undeniably sent shockwaves through the family when they gave an explosive TV interview to Oprah Winfrey earlier this year, in which they described painful comments about how dark their son Archie’s skin might be before his birth. Royal author Matthew Dennison said the Queen has been turning to her Christian faith to help her to overcome the ongoing drama rocking the palace. She has a strong religious faith, he said. Speaking to Fox News, he added: One of the things that the queen has done is pray throughout all of this. She also has a loyal, supportive group of private secretaries, ladies in waiting and devoted friends who have been a strong system around her. She also has the support of her close-knit family.Dennison went on to say the Queen, , finds it “dficult” to confront dficult issues, but has gotten better over time. The author has recently penned ‘The Queen’, a new biography exploring Elizabeth’s decades-long reign. He has recently spoken to several palace insiders, both past and present, to tell the queen’s story. Faith played a prominent role in the monarch’s le, Dennison said. She has a connection with the ine, he explained. She is a monarch who made a promise before God to fulfill her duty. And it’s a promise she has taken very seriously in her le. Even as a young woman, she has faced an overwhelming expectation on what kind of queen she should be… She has embraced that role. Dennison also spoke of the Queen’s dedication to her role.  There wasn’t ever a real expectation that Philip’s death would prompt her abdication, he said, as she sees the promises she made in her coronation as being “binding”. “These are promises she made to God in the church. These are holy promises. She’s always said she would abdicate onlyshe got Alzheimer’s disease, a stroke, or something that would leave her incapacitated in some way. But this role is for le. Dennison pointed out that despite family drama and tragedy, the queen has chosen to carry on.The Queen is previously spoken out about her faith, in  having delivered a strong defence of faith saying the role of the Church is “commonly under-appreciated” and “occasionally misunderstood”.Accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, at a multi-faith reception at Lambeth Palace in central London, the Queen added that the Church of England has a duty to protect the freedom of all faiths in the country. In her speech, the Queen said: Here at Lambeth Palace we should remind ourselves of the signicant position of the Church of England in our nationaposs le. The concept of our established Church is occasionally misunderstood and, I believe, commonly under-appreciated. Its role is not to defend Anglicanism to the exclusion of other religions. Instead, the Church has a duty to protect the free practice of all faiths in this country.

Charles and Diana got married in a huge fairytale royal wedding in  watched by millions but formally split , and were officially orced four years later. Their years together were rocky and ious reports at the time suggested members of the household believed Diana played a big part in the breakdown of the relationship. Some of the things Diana said appeared to ruffle feathers at the Palace - and it sparked questions about why she would jeopardise the institution that she’d married into. Now a new book touches on the aftermath of the split which rocked the monarchy - and it seems Princess Diana had a highly-placed ally.  The Queen , written by top author Matthew Dennison, explores the le of the monarch in the eyes of royal sources, both past and present.Dennison told Fox News: “There’s no doubt that the Queen was sympathetic to the Princess of Wales. “It is clear that the Queen had a great personal fondness for her. “But you know, people didn’t discuss mental health to the extent that we do today. And people’s knowledge of it was less. “And of course, the Queen, being a generation older than the Princess of Wales, had a very old-fashioned upbringing. It was a late-th-century upbringing where you certainly didn’t talk about those things.  He went on: “I don’t think there was ever any lack of affection. “I think the Queen didn’t understand why the Princess might say or do things that would jeopardise the institution that she’d married into, which was also her own children’s inheritance. Diana had spoken of feelings of failure and “rampant bulimia”, which she claimed the discovery of Charles’ affair had contributed towards. Diana’s infamous interview with Martin Bashir caused ructions within the royal family, when she said “there were three of us in this marriage”.  It comes as the Princess of Wales is the subject of an upcoming biopic called Spencer, which will shed more light on her le. Featuring Kristen Stewart as the People’s Princess, it will focus on the collapse of her marriage to Charles, played by Jack Farthing. It is due for release in UK cinemas on November . But it has been slammed by some royal experts, with one claiming it will cause aposhurtapos within the family.Donapost miss the Mirroraposs regular royal podcast Pod Save The Queen, with royal correspondent Victoria Murphy and host Ann Gripper.Listen on iTunes, Audioboom and your favourite podcast apps.Catch up with Episode  - Royal Wedding Bells for Meghan and Harry.  Ingrid Seward, editor in chief of Majesty Magazine, said it was cruel and totally unnecessary. She said: William and Harry will be very angry and hurt about this. They will find it horrible that their mother is being portrayed in such a huge movie this way. Charles proposed to Diana on February ,  in the nursery at Windsor Castle. Immediately after popping the question, he called the Queen to inform her of the big news.The soon-to-be-married couple sat down for an engagement interview in the lead up to the big day.But Diana later described it as ghastly and said Charlesaposs infamous answer to being askedthey were in love traumatised her.In Diana: In Her Own Words, she said: We had this ghastly interview the day we announced our engagement. And this ridiculous [reporter] said, ‘Are you in love ’ I thought, what a thick question. So I said, ‘Yes, of course, we are,’ and Charles turned round and said, ‘Whatever love means.’ And that threw me completely. I thought, what a strange answer. It traumatised me.With , guests in St Paulaposs Cathedral and another  million people watching around the world, itaposs no surprise Prince Charles and Princess Diana were nervous as they tied the knot. It appears those nerves might have slightly got the better of both of them when it came to the wedding vows - as they both made mistakes. Charles said his vows first and instead of reciting my worldly goods he actually said thy worldly goods. Meanwhile, Diana muddled Charlesapos names - and ended up calling him by the wrong name. His full name is Charles Philip Arthur George but when it came to the vows, Diana called him Philip Charles.Princess Diana received a gt along with the secret note from Prince Charles as she stayed the night at Clarence House - but he also allegedly made a shock confession. In her book about Camilla called The Duchess: The Untold Story, royal author Penny Junor revealed: The night before the wedding, which Diana spent at Clarence House with her sister Jane, he sent her a note, along with a signet ring that bore the Prince of Wales feathers.He wrote: Iaposm so proud of you and when you come up Iaposll be there at the altar for you tomorrow. Just look aposem in the eye and knock aposem deadapos, reports the Express.But despite the note, Charles also reportedly left his bride devastated after making an admission the night before the wedding, because he did not want to go into the marriage on a  promise.

The powder, which reportedly came from a nearby manufacturing plant, baffled locals in Preston Brook, near Runcorn, on October .The road is near the Saint Gobain Isover manufacturing plant, which produces mineral wool insulation, CheshireLive reports. Residents are worried about their pets and wildle ingesting the powder as some fear it contains glass. Dave Espley, , woke up to find his car and the street he lives on covered in the substance and said it looked like it has snowed.  He also said a number of cars have been damaged and residents with vegetable gardens have been told to throw their home-grown produce away. He said: The issue is what it has discharged and whether itaposs safe for wildle and pets, itaposs also very abrasive so itaposs causing all sorts of issues with peopleaposs cars as well. It looked like it snowed when we got up in the morning, literally everything was covered in it and the main concern was wondering what it is.  He added: Weaposve been told it is  per cent glass so apparently it will not dissolve as soon as it rains. Iaposm not quite sure how they are going to fully recty it because itaposs all over the fields as well. I know people have vegetable patches and they have been advised to chuck it all away. You can still see it all over the road outside the plantitself, it looks like frost. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email .The Environment Agency has been round and so has the Isover plant manager and apologised and I think he was having a worse day than anyone . The main concern here is what is in it andit is potentially toxic. Weaposve been told itaposs not harmful and not to eat it, but obviously we are concerned about pets and wildle. Dave also said that due to the abrasive substance, it has damaged a number of cars on the street and valets have been arranged to help remove the powder from peopleaposs cars. He added: Theyaposre trying toand theyaposve booked appointments with car cleaners to come round and clean all the cars, I had to use the hose to get it off of my car. It was absolutely covered, thankfully we didnapost rub it, but I know other people who have taken their car to a car wash and this stuff has caused real damage. I am assuming this is what they use to clean out the chimney as it is real abrasive stuff. A neighbour of mine has said their windscreen is covered in scratches because he took it to a car wash. They have been around valeting peopleaposs cars and doing a big clean up as they can. Itaposs been reported to the environmental agency and there is a big clear-up happening at the minute. A spokesperson for Isover said that the dust is nothing to worry about and apologised to residents over the situation. The statement read: There was a small release of dust from the vent ducting when we restarted the plant after a short planned shutdown. Our Plant Manager has been visiting local residents over the last few days to explain the situation, apologise and to reassure residents that there is nothing to worry about at all. Where needed we have also arranged for professional cleaning to take place and we have been in dialogue with the Environment Agency who are fully aware of the release. We take great care to be a responsible business and take issues like this very seriously indeed.” A spokesperson for the Environment Agency said: We are working with the company to offer advice and guidance under our regulatory role.

The -year-old, who had been an MP for  years, was holding his regular Friday surgery for constituents at the Belfairs Methodist Church, Leigh-on-Sea. Police have arrested a -year-old man on suspicion of murder and a kne was recovered at the scene. His death comes five years after Labour MP Jo Cox was murdered as she arrived to host a surgery in her Batley and Spen constituency in June . As tributes poured in, Downing Street lowered the Union flag to half-mast as a mark of respect to the popular Southend West MP. While Prime Minister Boris Johnsonaposs we Carrie said he was a true gent.Taking to Twitter to express her shock and send her thoughts to Sir Davidaposs we Julia, she said: Absolutely devastating news about Sir David Amess. He was hugely kind and good. An enormous animal lover and a true gent. This is so completely unjust. Thoughts are with his we and their children.Labour leader Keir Starmer said: Horric and deeply shocking news. Thinking of David, his family and his staff.Deemed on of the longest-serving MPs, below is an outline of who Sir David was and where he came from. Who was Sir David Amess  Sir David was born in Plaistow, Essex, now known as Newham in London on March , . As a child he attended St Anthonyaposs Junior and Infant School, then St Bonaventureaposs Catholic School in Forest Gate before moving on to the College of Technology. His higher education took place at the Faculty of Science and Technology of Bournemouth University, where he got a bachelors in economics and government. He taught at a primary school in Bethnal Green and had some experience as underwriter and recruitment consultant but he quickly turned to to public service in politics.  Family le The MP and his we Julia, who worked for him as a part-time caseload worker have four daughters and a son. His daughter, Katie, is an actress based in LA and recently starred in Captain America. Political le The Conservative MP served as an MP for  years, initially in Basildon from  before he took on the role of representing Southend West from . He regarded his main interests and areas of expertise as animal welfare and pro-le issues. But his campaigning efforts in the House of Commons in recent years were most closely associated with his campaign to see Southend awarded city status. A long-term eurosceptic, he was part of the Leave Means Leave pro-Brexit campaign during the EU referendum. He never held a ministerial role and was vocal about a whole range of issues, from animal rights to campaigning against abortion.During his time in parliament he sponsored a string of bills including the AbortionBill , the Protection Against Cruel Tethering Actand the Warm Homes Bill, which passed into law in December  as the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act, according to his website. The two main issues he had at heart were animal rights and pro-le issues. Sir David has not been shy in ensuring questions he asks Government ministers also include his long-running campaign to make Southend a city. In December , he secured an adjournment debate in the Commons specically on the campaign and he told MPs: I am not messing around. We have got it from the Prime Minister that Southend is going to become a city - and it will become a city.  As a strident supporter of the British monarchy, Sir David saw another opportunity in November  as the Commons considered plans for the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee next year. He asked for a new statue of the Queen and for a city status competition to ensure Southend is finally elevated. In March , Sir David repeated his statue calls - insisting the Queen deserved one for being a great monarch.  His campaign for a memorial to Dame Vera Lynn on the White Clfs of Dover also won support from a minister in May this year. He was well known in Southend West for his support for local causes and every year held the aposannual centenariansapos tea partyapos to celebrate constituents who had turned . Away from his campaigning, Sir David announced in December  that he would run to be one of the three deputy speakers in the House of Commons.He ultimately missed out and continued with his support for Brexit and working in his constituency.He recently wrote of how MPs had received security advice about holding surgeries, and how attacks had spoilt the great British tradition of the voters meeting politicians. In Ayes  Ears: A Survivoraposs Guide to Westminster - which was published in November - he wrote about Jo Coxaposs murder and how she had been attacked in the most barbaric fashion imaginable. Sir David also wrote about the machete attack on Nigel Jones MP, which resulted in his aide Andy Penningtonaposs death as he tried to protect him. And the Essex politician mentioned he had experienced nuisance from the odd member of the general public at his own property. He said most MPs had changed the way they interacted with voters, and the Commons authorities took the threats members faced very seriously.  Achievements Sir Amess was knighted in the  New Year Honours for political and public service. He was also given the Animal Welfare and Environment Champion award at the Dods Charity Champion Awards in  for his commitment to animal warfare. Ahead of his death being announced, Councillor John Lamb, who was the scene of the horric attack, heaped praise on the MP, who he called a family man. Heaposs always trying to help people and especially refugees heaposs tried to help. Heaposs a very amicable person and he does stick by his guns, he says what he believes and he sticks by it. Tributes to apostrue gentapos and a aposgreat manapos Tributes from across the political spectrum have flooded in for Sir David. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said all our hearts are filled with shock and sadness. Mr Johnsonaposs we, Carrie, said she was devastated. Absolutely devastating news about Sir David Amess. He was hugely kind and good, she said on Twitter. An enormous animal lover and a true gent. This is so completely unjust. Former Conservative prime minister Theresa May tweeted: Heartbreaking to hear of the death of Sir David Amess. A decent man and respected Parliamentarian, killed in his own community while carrying out his public duties. A tragic day for our democracy. My thoughts and prayers are with Davidaposs family. Former prime minister Tony Blair said he was shocked and horried by the murder of Sir David Amess. David and I came into Parliament together in , he said in a statement. Though on opposite political sides I always found him a courteous, decent and thoroughly likeable colleague who was respected across the House. This is a terrible and sad day for our democracy. Meanwhile, Jo Coxaposs widower Brendan said: My thoughts and love are with Davidaposs family. They are all that matter now. This brings everything back. The pain, the loss, but also how much love the public gave us following the loss of Jo. I hope we can do the same for David now.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Conservative PartyEssex PoliceDavid AmessEU ReferendumHospitalsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Infections remain high in young people, and look to be spilling over into the - year olds. If these increases creep into the over s it could spell disaster for the NHS this winter.

There could also be some dense fog patches first thing Saturday, slowly lting through the morning. It will be milder towards the west, C or C towards the southwest, and colder to the north east, C or C. The first snowfall of the season could hit as early as next week.

Rachel Kennedy, , and Liam McCrohan, , had placed a bet for the numbers , , , , ,  and  for five weeks in a row. They did it the same way — an automatic ticket, with the direct debit coming out each week for their £. go. But back in late February this year, Rachel had brought one too many cups of coffee and her funds dipped below where it needed to be.Have you ever aposalmostapos won the lottery  Email us at webnews@mirror  Her account didnapost quite have enough to process the transaction, so payment for their ticket payment didn’t go through.

Liam and Rachelaposs joy quickly faded as Camelot told the couple they indeed had a match - but Rachel hadnapost had the funds in her account to buy the ticket, so it wasnapost ever actually purchased. Liam said the app really made it look like they had won as it comes up with winning match in orange. After Liam got over the shock of losing, he posted a screenshot of the win to Facebook - incredibly laughing about their loss.He said he’d posted it so his friends can see but it quickly blew up - and the post amassed over , likes and the unlucky lovebirds became worldwide news.

Rachel, a business student at Brighton University, said: I called my boyfriend Liam and my mum into the room and they couldnapost believe it either so I was like, aposoh my god I need to call themapos. I called the number thinking that I had won £million and they said aposyeah youaposve got the right numbers but you didnapost have the funds in your account for the payment of the ticket so it didnapost actually go throughapos.

But she now believes the numbers she had been playing for weeks are unlucky and she has changed them for good. She said: I actually have two sets of numbers that I use. One of them is birthdays of family members and stuff, but the ones that were the winner were just random numbers that I had clicked one day and had been using ever since.

The peculiar scene was discovered on Monday between Great Langdale and Little Langdale, a spot considered one of the most spectacular in the area. The table was set with plates, champagne flutes and water glasses, as well as what appeared to be a two-level stand for cakes and a cheese platter. One plate had been polished off, while the other held remnants of a piece of cake, strawberries and cheese. From a small jar of jam and a bowl of what resembles whipped cream on the cake stand, it appeared likely that scones had featured as part of the meal.Photographer Ashley Cooper told the BBC he had first thought the table and chairs, which were set up a little less than m from the path, were part of an art installation.Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter However, on closer inspection, it appeared the half-eaten food and glasses of fizz had been abandoned by a celebrating couple, he said.Mr Cooper thought it likely that the table had been left by someone from the Instagram generation.The Ambleside local, who works as a climate change photographer, had been walking in the woods when he spotted the odd set up. It looks like a romantic meal in the woods but then they couldnapost clean up after themselves,” he said. He pointed out that the couple had gone to a “lot of trouble” to carry the gear down from wherever they had come from - as it was about half a mile from the nearest road.  Staff at nearby hotels denied having anything to do with the set-up. Mr Cooper said it wasn’t unusual to see abandoned items around the area he said he had seen a number of tents, along with sleeping bags and cooking equipment, over the past  months. The region had proved popular with visitors as lockdown measures he eased, and there had been a type of visitor who had no respect for the place “whatsoever”.

Nova, who is a German shepherd cross border collie puppy, has a rather unique look thanks to her unusual genetics - but she still has the iconic shepherd ears. The gorgeous dog has patchy white and black fur all over her body, making for an unforgettable and signature style. In this clip, viewers get to see Nova’s German shepherd ears appear gradually over time, going from tiny to fully grown in a matter of seconds thanks to this time-lapse video. And itaposs absolutely adorable.The video, which was uploaded by TikTok user @talesofnova, was a huge hit on the app, with almost four million views and over , likes.At the start of the clip, viewers are shown Nova as a tiny puppy, with small ears to match her stature. However, as the video plays, her ears gradually become more and more noticeable with each and every clip. By the end of the video, there is no hiding Nova’s fully developed ears as they stand all by themselves in true German shepherd style. Viewers instantly fell in love with the unique puppy, with one user commenting: “Oh my goodness, what a gorgeous happy fluff ball! Beautul little pup, please give her a treat for me and a little nose boop.” Another commenter wrote: “Sir, this is not a German shepherd, this is clearly stracciatella ice cream.” A third added: “Awwww hahaha went from border collie ears to German shepherd ears! AMAZING! Such a beautul colour as well.” Nova isn’t the only German shepherd to have gone viral on TikTok of late, with the breed proving popular with users. Cleo the German shepherd recently attracted attention after she was caught on camera greeting her golden retriever friend in a rather feline manner.The amusing clip showed Cleo crouching to avoid being spotted by her furry friend, all the while slowly creeping closer and closer.It’s Dog Show week over at TeamDogs - a six-day celebration of what makes our pets special in the style of a virtual village fete without the muddy field and dodgy hotdogs.

The hilarious video showed off Max’s vocal skills as he howled along as soon as he heard the iconic chorus note begin.

Sam Thompson, , was cruising from Rome to Palma de Mallorca when he spotted the incredible sight.He said the tornado happened after a perfectly clear day turned dark and stormy in minutes.The video, filmed on September , shows the tornado - known as a waterspout - making its way across the sea. It can be seen rising up from the middle of the sea in an impressive display, under a mile from the boat where Sam filmed the clip.Did you witness the tornado  Get in touch at webnews@mirror Travel agent Sam, from Bolton, Manchester, said: It was a beautul clear day and then all of a sudden we were in this dark cloud. I went outside and it was lashing it down with rain and there were these huge waves. As soon as the rain stopped, I saw this huge waterspout rise up from nowhere. It looked so cool. I knew I had to film it. Sam recalled the boat rocking in the force of the storm and the waterspout lasting for about three minutes, before vanishing as quickly as it came. After that, the weather ed to a clear blue sky once more, leaving no trace.Sam said: How often do you see something like that less than a mile away from you A waterspout is a column of rotating, cloud-filled wind descending to an ocean or lake, National Geographic explains.They are usually smaller and less intense than a tornado on land.  They are associated with severe thunderstorms and are often accompanied by high winds and seas, large hail, and frequent dangerous lightning, according to the National Ocean Service. Waterspouts are not as destructive as land tornados but could be dangerous for vessels and small craft in their way, All At Sea explains.They can cause havoc to mariners, as well as devastate coral reefs and marine organisms that are close to the wateraposs surface.

preparing to welcome back visitors for the first time in two years this weekend.The Maud Railway Museum will be opening its door on two weekends this month following a series of renovations # and a few upgrades to comply with Covid restrictions.The re-opening has been delayed twice with the Friends of Maud Railway Museum initially hoping to get back on track in April.Des Byrne, from Friends of Maud Railway Museum, said: #It#s a great relief  to see it all come together because we#ve got so many ideas and plans in mind and they#re all starting to drop into place.#It#s been great to see everything come together in the last couple of weeks, it#s very rewarding to see all the effort everybody has put in beginning to show.#The #work crew# has been busy painting the station#s buildings in the British Railway colours of the s and have added a new pathed pathway to make access easier for visitors.Last year, the museum was granted £, from Museum Galleries Scotland to put towards upgrades on its toilet facilities, which were completed by Thistle Windows and Plumbing.Two van bodies have also been bought from a local farm thanks to a grant from the Buchan Initiative Fund. The museum plans to use these to extend its scope and highlight its relationship with the agricultural community of the north-east.There will be lots to explore when the museum re-opens, including the Peterhead Prison railway carriage and a former Royal Navy explosives wagon.The old refreshment rooms have been leased from Aberdeenshire Council to house a display titled #Stations of the Formartine and Buchan Line# featuring historic video footage of local railways.Mr Byrne said: #We#ve got a series of old films that were made by Aberdeenshire Council for schools about the local heritage and history of the railways.#There#s all types of fascinating stuff in there from when they were built in the s right the way through to the two World Wars and after. All together there#s a couple hours of video for people to watch on our lovely new projector.#A new display on the Royal Navy Air Service Lenabo Airship Base has been installed ahead of the re-opening on Saturday. In the past, the base was reached by a short branch line from Longside which was only in action for six years.Mr Byrne added: #This was an airship base used during the First World War where hydrogen was made out of slag from blast furnaces reacting with caustic soda to fill up the airships.#Recently donated to the museum is a railway wagon turntable which can now be viewed in its #very dismantled# state. It was previously used at the former Consolidated Pneumatic Factory is Fraserburgh.Maud Railway Museum will be open October  to  and October  to  between .am and pm.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.25109203-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.25109203-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.25109203-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.25109203-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"revealed plans for 3 5m visitor centre with panoramic views of dunnottar castle","story":"A new £. million visitor centre at Dunnottar Castle could nearly double the historic attraction’s annual worth to the local economy.

hoodie combo for a dress and boots, it’s safe to say that I was more than ready for my first Friday night meal out since the start of the pandemic.After working out how to walkin heels again, I took myself and my rumbling stomach off to the warm, sandy, tropical climes of Turkey.Well Aberdeen beach actually, which may not match the tropical climes of Turkey but is certainly on a par when it comes to scenery.Holiday drinks in hand, delicious spices and aromas in the air and views of the beach, me and my friend felt like we were on holiday as we sat in the Turkish Kitchen.Located on the esplanade, this restaurant is clearly the place to be on a Friday night as to say it was packed is an understatement.Although slightly overwhelmed to see so many people in one place after so long, we both soon relaxed as we soaked up the buzz and marveled at the bustling open kitchen at the back of the restaurant.Like two excited kids, we ordered our “holiday drinks”, an Orange Fanta for me and a Turkish peach juice for my friend.Judging by how busy the restaurant was as staff whizzing up and down the restaurant with plates expertly balanced, I wonderedservice might take a bit longer.How wrong I was as our drinks arrived in the blink of an eye.As far as menus go, Turkish Kitchen’s is something .If like me you’re bad at making decisions, be prepared to sit for a while as this menu has no fewer than  cold starters and  hot starters ranging from vine leaves and hummous to grilled octopus and falafel.Soon after ordering our starters, our friendly and attentive waitress was back with complimentary Turkish bread, salad and traditional Turkish dips.It was such a lovely touch as most restaurants would include that on the bill.Trying and failing to leave room for the main event, I couldn’t get enough of the warm bread that comes fresh out of the oven, soaking it up with the delicious red pomegranate dip while the salad was a fresh and crunchy affair.Our appetites well and truly whetted, it was soon time for our starters, mushroom halloumi for me and king prawns for my friend.“Incredible” declared my friend as she got stuck into the succulent king prawns, sauteed with spring onions, tomato and garlic butter.Nodding my head with each bite , I was also in food paradise with the mushroom halloumi.Lightly pan-fried with garlic and spices, the juicy mushrooms and halloumi cheese were like a match made in heaven and the portion sizes were very generous.Clean plates all round, it wasn’t long before our main courses arrived.After months of getting stuck in a vicious pasta cycle, my cheap and fast meal of choice, I decided to treat my tastebuds to something a bit more exotic so I opted for the fresh calamari fritter.Crisp on the outside and full of flavour on the inside, my head started nodding again as the calamari fritters took me to my extremely happy food place.Served with homemade tartar sauce, mixed leaves and skinny fries, the meal was so tasty that I asked for a doggy bag to take what I’d left over home.Meanwhile, across the table, the lamb ribs , seasoned with herbs and served with rice, also got the thumbs.To take the dish to another level, my friend would’ve loved a sauce to compliment the rice and mouthwatering chunks of lamb.The staff were great though as after asking for a sauce, they quickly brought a garlic mayonaise over which added some richness to the dish.Stuffed to the gunnels, we had to take the painful decision to bypass dessert which is usually unheard of.In hindsight, I wish I’d ordered some baklava to take home to satisfy my eternal sweet tooth.Doggy bags in hand and bellies full, we both left the restaurant on a food high feeling like we’d enjoyed a five-star holiday in the sun.For Turkish Kitchen doesn’t just serve up fresh, authentic and tasty Turkish cuisine, it also takes people on a journey back to happy times on holiday.The icing on the cake was the fact that our bill came to £. which I thought was extremely good value for money.I was so taken by Turkish Kitchen in fact that the next day, I hid my pasta at the back of my cupboard and rushed to Tesco to buy some frozen calamari.Suffice to say it didn’t quite hit the mark but I’m already planning myto Turkish Kitchen for more calamari fritters and I might even push the boat out further next time by trying my first ever proper Turkish kebab!Soyou fancy a slice of foodie sunshine without your feet leaving the ground, head to Turkish Kitchen where wonderful food, friendly staff and a holiday style experience awaits.For more information check out the Turkish Kitchen website.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium

We’re looking to put a run together and we’re now three unbeaten.“We dropped two points last Saturday, but it was important to go to Strathspey and make sure, first and foremost, we got the result.“We need to approach the game in the right manner.

When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

heard that Commander Lucy DrsquoOrsi had been assigned to be Gold Commander of the police operation around the visit.ndash : Scottish independence referendumThe Queen told a well-wisher that Scots

In other words, just % were classed as obstetric patients.In the third wave, from May  to September , there were  female ICU admissions with Covid, but this time  of them - % - were obstetric patients.None of these  women had been vaccinated, even with a single dose, despite appointments having opened to  to -year-olds in early May and  to -year-olds in late May.: What Israel tells us about boosters, waning immunity and Covid deathsUptake has been \"substantially lower\", as PHS put it, among pregnant women compared to the general population: of all the women who gave birth in August, just % had had a single vaccination compared, at the time, to around % of  to -year-olds and more than % of  to -year-olds.Some evidence from around the world has also pointed to increasingly severe illness in pregnant women as the virus has mutated - a pattern which appears to be borne out by the data in Scotland where the Alpha iant dominated during wave two before being overtaken by Delta in wave three.The third wave was associated with a steeper rise in Covid ICU admissions among people aged  to As SICSAG notes there \"were very few critical care admissions\" for obstetric patients during wave one - very probably fewer than five, in fact.By wave three, however, Scotland had seen \"increased numbers of pregnant women being admitted to hospital with moderate to severe Covid- symptoms requiring critical care\".Of these wave three mothers, % were of non-white ethnicityand % came from the most deprived areas.Groups, coincidentally, known to have lower vaccine coverage.On Monday, data for England revealed  of the  most critically ill Covid patients given extra corporeal membrane oxygenationbetween July and September were mothers-to-be, of whom  were unvaccinated and one had had a single dose.ECMO is administered when a patients lungs are so badly damaged that a ventilator cannot maintain oxygen levels.: Almost  fully-vaccinated Scots died from Covid after restrictions ltedAccording to Dr Sarah Stock, a consultant in maternal and foetal medicine who is co-leading a study into Covid- in pregnancy at Edinburgh University, being pregnant affects how the body responds to infections and \"this is probably what were seeing with Covid-\".Thankfully, no pregnant women in Scotland have died from Covid.But it seems clear that they have been let down by a toxic combination of confusion and misinformation which has understandably increased their hesitancy and left them under-protected as Delta - combined with a lting of restrictions - fuelled a surge in infections over summer.At the very least, much more needs to be done now to drive up coverage among expectant mothers, particularly as winter - and flu season - approaches."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12736278.jpg?type=article-full","title":"glasgow-campaign-events-play-major-factor-boosting-wellbeing-says-report","story":"It is just one of the findings of a report commissioned by VisitScotland and the Event Industry Advisory Groupto help to understand and examine how events continue to contribute to Scotlandrsquos wellbeing.The Contribution of Events to Scotlandrsquos Wellbeing report was delivered by Wavehill Social and Economic Research, and led by Dr Bridget McConnell, CBE and Chief Executive of Glasgow Le, which delivers culture and leisure services, as part of her role with the EIAG Health and Wellbeing Economy group.Read more:Glasgow needs an emergency funding deal to lt it out of crisis, say campaignersThe report also highlighted the social aspect of events is recognised as a key driver for supporting mental wellbeing.

It said the association between cultural activities and wellbeing is well-established and that cultural activities provide opportunities for social engagement, enjoyment, learning, capacity building, civic pride, social solidarity and cohesion.The report said providing greater opportunity to access cultural activities will help to safeguard the wellbeing of people and communities, enabling them to cope better in times of stress including during the Covid- recovery.It added that investment in culture and leisure has the potential to stimulate local economic growth and reduce the financial burden on services, for example through improved educational outcomes, reductions in crime and anti-social behaviour and better physical or mental healthPaul Bush OBE, Director of Events, at VisitScotland welcomed the report saying: \"The findings from this research and the recommendations on how to develop the evidence base for measuring the contribution of events to the nationrsquos health and wellbeing, will form an important part of our work going forward including building it in to our National Events Strategy, Scotland the Perfect Stage.\"Jenny Gilruth MSP, Culture Minister, said promoting a Wellbeing Economy was a top priority for the Scottish Government.Ms Gilruth said: \"As this report has highlighted, the erse range of events that take place throughout the country bring social and economic benefits to our communities.

A pupil at New Stevenston Primary School and Bellshill Academy, he did his undergraduate degree at Glasgow University, which was the foundation for ldquoeverything I have become as a scientist and a person.My husband, Professor Sir James Mirrleeswho was born in Minnigaff, Galloway, would have agreed, going to primary school in Newton Stewart and Douglas-Ewart High School. He depended on bursaries and prize money to pursue an undergraduate degree at Edinburgh University.Richard Hendersonhas a similar story ndash attending Newcastleton Primary near Hawick, Hawick High and Boroughmuir High in Edinburgh, before an undergraduate degree at Edinburgh University.To date,  Scots have been awarded Nobel Prizes since they were inaugurated in .According to Richard Henderson, this is  times greater than the world-average per capita, with only Switzerland and Austria coming close.In , a year after the Nobel Prizes were established, Sir Ronald Ross, of Shandwick, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on malaria. He is the grandfather of the current chief of Clan Ross. Since Ross, Scots have been awarded Nobel Prizes in every category except Literature, although the great Gaelic poet Sorley Maclean was nominated for that in .In the past nine years, between  and , there have been eight Scottish Nobel Laureates, an achievement for a country that has a small population of about . million people.In one year alone, , four of the Nobel Laureates were Scottish. All these achievements should have been a cause for national celebration.David MacMillanrsquos award spotlights the fact that Scotland has been very successful in producing Nobel Laureates but has failed in giving them national recognition.Alfred Nobel in Scotland and the  Scottish Nobel Laureates are a valuable part of Scotlandrsquos heritage that has been overlooked for too long. Celebrating Nobelrsquos Scottish connections and our Scottish Nobel Laureates would raise Scotlandrsquos image as a hub of science and discovery and encourage young Scots to realise that everything is possible ndash that there are no limits to their potential.So what can Scotland do to honour its Nobel Laureates  Here are a few suggestions: l create The Scottish Nobel Fund to help finance a series of initiatives to highlight the achievements of the Scottish Nobel Laureates and the le of Alfred Nobel in Scotland l have a permanent display area dedicated to the Scottish Nobel Laureates in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery.In , a portrait of my husband was presented to the Gallery. On show for only a few months, it was put in storage for a decade. It was displayed again in December , after his death that year.Sir Mervyn King, former governor of the Bank of England, at the unveiling of Jimrsquos portrait pointed out: ldquoThis Gallery is the worldrsquos first purpose-built portrait gallery, opened in  and championed by the historian Thomas Carlyle, who wrote that lsquoHistorical Portrait Galleries far transcend in worth all other kinds of National Collections of Pictures whateverrsquo. Scotland led the way and continues to do so.After the death of Scottish Nobel Laureate David Thouless in April , collecting the portraits of all the living Scottish Laureates became a priority.The Gallery had commissioned portraits of some of the Scottish Laureates when the coronavirus pandemic put everything on hold.When Jim received the Nobel Prize in , he said he was both delighted and a little embarrassed at all the attention. Jim had an exceptional mind, and he was also exceptionally modest ndash embodying the values of small-town Scotland where you worked hard and lived without ostentation.Only after Jimrsquos death, I found in an old file box marked ldquoNobel stuff a pile of letters he had received when the Prize was announced. Among the ldquoNobel stuff, was a letter from Margaret Wilson, an old classmate at Douglas-Ewart High. She wrote: ldquoWas it really August  that my mother told me on the evening of my first day at school that you would be the Dux of that yearrsquos intake and added, lsquothat boy will go farrsquo  This bewildered me ndash I did not realise she was talking in terms of what you would achieve academically. I thought she meant you might go to the United States.Another idea would be to have an interactive display in one area of the National Museum of Scotland.Jimrsquos Nobel medal will go to the National Museum, which has been displaying the Nobel medals of Sir Alexander Fleming, Sir James Black and Lord John Boyd-Orr on three dferent floors in glass cases.Instead, feature all the Scottish Laureates in one area using audio visual technology, interactive display boards, photographs and medals,donated. The recent Scottish Laureates could record their stories in their own words. Scottish actors could narrate the history of those deceased. That way, Scottish children and other visitors could learn more about the Laureates and their discoveries.Few of the Scottish Laureates have blue plaques in Scotland. Several, such as Sir Alexander Fleming, are honoured by them in England. Dr David Hannay, chief of Clan Hannay, has organised with the Galloway Preservation Society for a blue plaque to be placed on the cottage where Jim was born in Minnigaff.Letrsquos create an ldquoAlfred Nobel in Scotland Centre with a guided tour of the Ardeer Peninsula in Ayrshire.We should reopen Irvinersquos The Big Idea, closed in , as the Nobel in Scotland Centre, focusing on the le and work of Alfred Nobel and his vast factory at Ardeer ndash which employed , people at its height ndash his le in Scotland, and his legacy of the Nobel Prizes, showcasing all Nobel Laureates and highlighting the Scottish ones.Alfred Nobel took out a British patent for his dynamite in . Failing to start a factory in England, Nobel, in April  ndash  years ago this year ndash established his British Dynamite Company Ltdat Ardeer with the backing of John Downie, the general manager of the Glasgow firm, Fairfield Engineering and Shipbuilding Company. The records are in Glasgow University archives.In a letter to his brother in , Nobel wrote: ldquoPicture to yourself everlasting bleak sand dunes with no buildings. Only rabbits find a little nourishment herehellip It is a sand desert where the wind always blows often howls filling the ears with sand. Between us and America, there is nothing but water ndash a sea whose mighty waves are always raging and foaming. Without work the place would be intolerable.Other parts of Scotland have a connection to Nobel. Some of the rock powder required in the factory process was found in Skye and Aberdeenshire. Nobel bought the Westquarter Chemical Company, near Falkirk, to produce detonators and established another nearby at Redding Moor to supply that with fulminate.He also acquired facilities at Irvine harbour to export his explosives. He bought, as his base in Scotland, Hawthorn Cottage,  Polmont Road, Laurieston, from his chief chemist George McRoberts. It is still standing.As well as the centre, visitors could have a guided tour of the ruined site of the Nobel factory on the Ardeer Peninsula and explore its areas of bioersity.To celebrate this, surely day tours for visitors to the National Museum of Scotland, the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, the Alfred Nobel in Scotland Centre, the site of the old Ardeer factory and the Ardeer Peninsula. This would be a boost to Ayrshire tourism, which already attracts visitors to the Robert Burns Birthplace Museum at Alloway and Culzean Castle.Annual lectures could also be established, one for universities and another for schools, to be given by a Nobel Laureate of any nationality in Scotlandrsquos seven cities in rotation.Finally, why not have a Nobel Laureates woodland  Wangari Maathaiplanted a tree when she learned she had been awarded the prize.The Nobel Laureates should be a source of national pride and all have left a legacy that should be remembered for ever more."},{"url":null,"title":"richie-berrington-ready-test-best-scotland-begin-t20-world-cup","story":"Richie Berrington is certainly grateful to have been given an unexpected opportunity to spend time with his we and son Oliver over the past year due to a lack of cricket opportunities but, ahead of the start of the T World Cup tomorrow, the veteran batter will now be well rested for the challenges ahead.ldquoOne of the positives of the whole lockdown situation was so much special time with the family which obviously you would never normally get, says the  year-old. ldquoGoing from having all that time to now being away again, it takes a bit of time to get used to.

You want to play against the best and you want to try and beat the best so in that sense, itrsquos an exciting opportunity thatrsquos coming up.ldquoIt was a pretty cool experience to be honest, playing in India in . Irsquod maybe played there once or twice before but playing a World Cup there was pretty special.ldquoFor us - as it is now - the goal was to get into that next stage and unfortunately we didnrsquot get there. We did get our first ever win against a team at a World Cup, against Hong Kong, so hopefully this time around we can take that next step.ldquoThe first game is Bangladesh so wersquoll be focused on that one. Theyrsquore a very good team obviously but we have full belief that we can push some of these teams with the confidence we have at the moment and the way the form guys are in a moment.On his own future, the South-African born batter is keeping his options open and has entered no thoughts about this potentially being his final bow on the big stage.ldquoI couldnrsquot put a number on it to be honest. Personally I just take one tour at a time and itrsquos just about trying to keep making sure Irsquom doing what I need to do really from a physical point of view and performing on the pitch.

I thought it might be fitting for the bell to be recommissioned and used again in remembrance of the  lives lost.”Towards the end of , Bill contacted a local craftsman and friend, Richard Wilson, and askedhe could help. It had been hoped to have the clapper made and fitted ready for the anniversary in , however plans had to be delayed due to the pandemic.In the meantime, Richard carried out online research and was eventually able to get inside the Cathedral to measure up, acquiring the bronze for the clapper proved dficult locally so he had to source it online.“It took me around a fortnight to make the clapper in my shed at home mostly using a hobby lathe and a CNC router,# said Richard.#I was a bit taken aback when Bill asked me to do this for him. Obviously, it is a great honour and a privilege for me to be asked considering the history of the ship and the lives lost during the sinking.#Hopefully this clapper will be around for years to come and will be used to commemorate the event each year.”However, this was only half the tale. The clapper needed a tassel — a rope that someone would actually hold to ring the bell.Fran Hollinrake is the visitor services officer and custodian at the cathedral.She said that, having attended several commemorations over the years, her and her husband Andy became friendly with a couple, John and Tracy Welch.John’s father, Stoker Petty Officer John Welch, was on board HMS Royal Oak the night she sank, but he survived.His son, John, was a rigger in the Tyneside dockyards, and spent much of his working le working with ropes, but ill-health prevented John from making the tassel.Instead he passed the job on to his former apprentice and friend Paul New.John and his we Tracy arrived in Orkney this week and were present at the unveiling.John said of his father#s experience on that fateful night: #The night of the sinking he was on deck having a cigarette when the explosion happened. He managed to get off the ship and into the water and was picked up by the Daisy II.#He said he had held on to another chap in the water who was in dficulty,  as he was an excellent swimmer and had medals for le saving and water polo, but when they were both pulled aboard by the crew of the Daisy unfortunately the other chap had died. He was lucky to escape with burns to his hands and face.#After medical attention I think a week or so later he was sent back to Portsmouth to join another ship.“As I far as I can remember he never ed to Orkney, but after the war attended the reunions in Portsmouth on a regular basis. As for his feelings about that night it wasn’t something he went into in great detail, but he did say thathe could get back on the ship he would know exactly where his gold lighter and cigarette case were.#Representing the council, who maintain the Cathedral on behalf of the people of Orkney, Councillor Stephen Clackson also has a personal connection to the Royal Oak, having tragically lost his uncle Ronald George Clackson when the ship went down.He said: “My Uncle Ronny was the closest sibling in age to my dad and his favourite brother. He was very technically minded and joined the Royal Navy on July , , aged ¾, for ‘  ’ years.#After training at the shore establishment HMS Victory, he was posted to the recommissioned HMS Royal Oak as an ordinary seaman on June , , when the ship was expected to be embarking on a -month tour of the Mediterranean.#Looming hostilities set the course of the battleship in another direction, and by August she was in Scapa Flow. My uncle was reported missing presumed killed when the Royal Oak was sunk by torpedoes from the U- in the early hours of October , just a week after his th birthday.#The news was devastating for my grandmother, whose brother had been killed on the Somme in World War I at the same age, and she never really got over it.

Here are a few of those:ndash : Coronavirus vaccineThe Queen said her Covid- jab ldquodidnrsquot hurt at all as she encouraged those hesitant about vaccination to ldquothink about other people rather than themselves.During a video call with health leaders delivering the vaccine across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, she said her own inoculation in January was ldquovery quick.ldquoOnce yoursquove had the vaccine you have a feeling of, you know, yoursquore protected, which is, I think, very important, she said. vw,vw,px, px\"The Queen called on people hesitant about vaccination to think about others ndash : BrexitThe Queen spoke in favour of iniduals seeking ldquocommon ground and ldquonever losing sight of the bigger picture in what was interpreted as a veiled reference to the toxic mood of the public debate around Britain leaving the EU.During a speech at the Sandringham Womenrsquos Institute, she also extolled the virtues of ldquorespecting the other personrsquos point of view.ndash : Chinese officialsThe Queen was caught on camera describing Chinese officials as ldquovery rude.She was overheard making the uncharacteristically unguarded comments during a discussion with a politan Police chief, who had spoken of dficulties in organising the State Visit of Chinese premier Xi Jinping.The Queen quipped that it had been ldquobad luck when she heard that Commander Lucy DrsquoOrsi had been assigned to be Gold Commander of the police operation around the visit.ndash : Scottish independence referendumThe Queen told a well-wisher that Scots should ldquothink very carefully about the future in the run-up to the independence referendum.She reportedly made the remark while meeting a member of the public outside Crathie Kirk, near her Balmoral estate in Aberdeenshire.Later, former prime minister David Cameron had to apologise to the Queen for revealing that she ldquopurred down the line when he informed her of the result of the referendum.He let slip her relief at the No vote in a conversation with former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg which was picked up by TV microphones. vw,vw,px, px\"The Queen meets Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon at Buckingham Palace ndash : Abu HamzaThe BBC apologised to the Queen for revealing that she had raised concerns with the Government about why radical cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri had not been arrested.Security correspondent Frank Gardner told the Radio  Today programme about the private conversation he had had with the monarch some years earlier, and the BBC said it and Gardner were sorry for the ldquobreach of confidence.Gardner had told Today: ldquoThis is a conversation we had a little while ago and she did say that she had mentioned to ndash I donrsquot know which home secretary it was at the time ndash that was there not some law he had broken ldquoI wouldnrsquot say she was necessarily lobbying, thatrsquos not for me to say, but, like anybody, she was upset that her country and her subjects had been denigrated by this man who was using this country as a  for his very violent, hateful views.ndash : Apartheid regimeA political storm blew up when the Queen was reported to be dismayed by then Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcherrsquos ldquouncaring style of leadership and fearful that her opposition to sanctions on South Africarsquos apartheid regime would destroy the Commonwealth.The reports were described as ldquowithout foundation by Buckingham Palace.There were rumours of a strained relationship with the Queen throughout Mrs Thatcherrsquos premiership. vw,vw,px, px\"The Queen and Margaret Thatcher at the former prime ministerrsquos th birthday in  ndash : American coloniesDuring a visit to the US for the bicentennial celebrations of American independence, the Queen commented on the separation of the American colonies from the British crown, saying the founding fathers taught Britain a ldquovery valuable lesson.ldquoWe lost the American colonies because we lacked that statesmanship to know the right time, and the manner of yielding what is impossible to keep, she said during a speech in Philadelphia.That lesson, she said, helped Britain transform ldquoan Empire into a Commonwealth.ndash : Polio vaccineThe Queen made public her decision to have her children, Prince Charles and Princess Anne, then aged eight and six, inoculated against polio in order to allay public fears about the potential side-effects of the new vaccine.ndash : Suez CrisisA biography of the Queen by historian Ben Pimlott quoted a senior courtier as saying the Queen thought then premier Sir Anthony Eden ldquomad for invading Egypt in the  Suez Crisis.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

He gave an alcohol reading or  microgrammes per ml of breath, which is more than six times the limit.Just a week later, in the early hours of th August, officers on patrol noticed Willmottrsquos car with its lights on in a layby of the A near Voe,Willmott was in the driving seat, with the keys in the ignition. Although the engine was off at the time, officers noticed a rear brake disk was still warm.Willmott was again arrested and taken to the police station. This time he gave a reading of  microgrammes per ml of breath, which is almost four times the legal limit.Mr MacKenzie said the test readings were ldquoextremely high.He applied for the sherf to forfeit Willmottrsquos car, valued at between pound,, and pound,, as part of sentencing.He said the fact Willmott was caught twice in a week showed he was potentially a ldquosignicant risk to the public, which could be ldquomitigated by depriving him of access to his motor vehicle.ldquoHe may well be someone whose judgement is so impaired by his addiction that the risk remains very high, Mr MacKenzie said.ldquoHe has simply not been able to cope, he said.ldquoHe is terried about going to jail,# he added.Mr Allan appealed for the sherf not to forfeit Willmottrsquos car, which he was still paying off to a finance company.He said even at the cheapest estimates it was a ldquosignicant penalty to someone who is at the moment going through the process of applying for universal credit.Sherf Cruickshank agreed not to forfeit the car, saying the financial impact on Willmott would be ldquodisproportionate.He said the community payback order, requiring supervision for  months, was an alternative to custodial sentence.Willmott was ordered to carry out  hours of unpaid work over a year.He was disqualied from driving for  months for each of the two charges, although the period of the ban can be reduced by a quarterhe takes a drink driving awareness course.A man who crashed into the front of a house after a high speed police chase while almost five times over the drink drive limitPupils’ artwork has been damaged by vandals.A dangerous driver almost caused a crash near Lerwick last week.

But were it not for Murdo Dan’s job as a joiner and Chrissie Mary doing a few shts as a carer, their economic ‘situation’ would be very dficult indeed.To supplement their income, they have decided to use their meagre savings, borrow a not insignicant sum from their local bank, and apply to stick a couple of pods on the croft.Meanwhile, Nigel and Pippa saw a croft for sale in the Sunday Times Property Section for what they thought was a snip at £k and decided to use part of a trust fund to purchase it as a commercial investment.They thought that they could also capitalise on the local tourist ‘boom’ and have applied to turn the derelict croft house into a vegan cafe and craft shop and also to stick several pods on their newly acquired croft to offer a ‘holistic getaway’ for their jet-set pals.Do you, and I certainly don’t mean to pre-judge anyone who reads this paperthink that their ‘cases’ should be treated any dferently by the local planning authorities If the answer is “yes”, then think again.Too dficult a scenario to judge Try this one.Should an application to build a couple of pods on a croft, which is basically  per cent bog, in the middle of Ranish and has no view of anywhere except adjacent croft bog, be given any additional merit over a similar application in beautul Scaristavore or Ardroil where ‘breathtaking scenery’ will be the selling tagline Wrong again.As a member of the local planning board here in the Western Isles, I’m more than well aware of what my responsibilities are and it’s certainly not to pre-judge any applications based on my own preconceptions, or prejudicesof what should or shouldn’t be allowed.I’ve to stick to the guidelines and the training I’ve been given, understand what’s expected of meand to base my decision without emotion or bias. across the front pages of this paper and others, on social media and the television news, can influence any of my our decisions.The capitalist playground which crofting tenure has now become, and the seismic change in the scale of speculation on ‘marketable’ properties available, is in danger of knocking the fragile socio-economic balance of the west of Scotland even further off its already very shoogly axis.Crofts have now become the equivalent of crypto-currency the ‘Bitcoins’ which can provide financial security for those fortunate enough to be sitting on ‘gold’.What’s being done to stabilise and bring a dose of reality to a market which threatens to get completely out of control How can single iniduals be able to own several crofts with not an intention to ‘work’ or develop any single one of them I believe that a crofting historian once said that this form of land tenure has become ‘the single biggest impediment to sustainable development in Western Scotland and the Highlands and Islands’.That wasn’t yesterday.‘Things’ are already well out of control.But who should intervene I’m not the only one who keeps asking the question.Apparently ‘we’ should legislate to address.We need, it has been suggested, to become Jersey or Guernsey.That people shouldn’t be allowed to buy homes here unless they intend to be used as a primary residence .Second homes taxation needs to increase signicantly and the additional income be used to support tourism infrastructure.From the Butt to Bodmin there have been ious proposals as to how to legislate to prevent the worst effects of tourism from destroying fragile local economies.Have any worked, andso, could they be implemented here to make any dference Let me be very clear.Tourism is hugely important to our rural economy.More so since Brexit and Covid.But I’ll say this again, at the risk of boring you all: it needs to be carefully nurtured and sustainably developed.We cannot survivewe turn our villages into ‘ghost-towns’#yes, I know…..for the winter months.We need a balance, we need the ‘tools’ with which to legislate properly and we need those charged with ‘oversight’ to take better ownership.We need, and I’ve yet to see any evidence of this, these same people to begin to take this seriously.For our future generations.They are the ones who will be impacted mostwe don’t sit up and pay attention.Now."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CATTLE-SALES-SEP-21-2-scaled.jpg","title":"remember your roots skye plan is urged to recognise","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThose were the comments of Roddy Murray, former Western Isles councillor and now the grazings clerk for Tarskavaig in Sleat, who this week voiced his concern that there was no mention of crofting at all in the ‘Skye and Raasay Future’ plan published in August with the full backing of all four local councillors.He told the Free Press: “There are  projects listed in the plan but not a single mention of crofting. Crofting is the basis for so many of the settlements on Skye outwith Portree, Broadford and Kyleakin and this should have been acknowledged.“There is quite a signicant impact from crofting on the economic and social well-being of Skye and Raasay. You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4157474.jpg--.jpg?1634222796000\n","title":"nipsa wants stormont department to take over management of council","story":"NIPSA has confirmed that it has written to the Minister for Communities asking that the Department takes over the managementat Mid and East Antrim Borough Council.

Together with its plans for Christmas  and beyond, the events provided delegates with an opportunity to meet Mary Waide who was elected Regional President for the North Region at the beginning of the pandemic.Following opening prayers and a welcome by Mary Waide, regional board members of SVP took to the stage to present ious aspects of the Society’s work to assembled guests representing their local SVP Conferences.Following a thought provoking spiritual reflection, board members presented the Society’s retail strategy for its  Vincent’s shops in Northern Ireland, a report of the outreach into prisons, details of how each Conference should report on its finances and new ways of adhering to policies and procedures for those being assisted by the charity and those providing the assistance.An interactive element encouraged guests to engage in a healthy discussion with board members before closing prayers. Mary Waide, Regional President of SVP North Region, said: “I am absolutely delighted with the success of this series of SVP Member Roadshows and the feedback from those who were able to attend.It was important for the SVP regional board to get out into our local communities having had such a long time apart from our members face to face. The focus of the roadshows were to primarily express our gratitude to our members for the sterling work they have been continuing to do on the ground to help those who have needed it most, during the most trying of times, and to share with them our SVP vision for the longer term. “The dedication of members of SVP has never been more important than it has been in the past  months. I know from experience how daunting it has been trying to help the vulnerable in our community without compromising or risking the health of those who are supporting those in need. As we move forward, it is my hope that our Conferences in County Antrim continue to go from strength to strength under the guidance of Frederic Ozanam who founded SVP almost  years ago.”SVP is an international charity and the largest voluntary charity in Ireland. SVP members in Northern Ireland work in all communities to support people whatever their background, who are experiencing poverty and social exclusion, promoting self-sufficiency and working for social justice. Every year SVP spends approximately pound million to help those experiencing poverty in Northern Ireland. Last year, SVP responded to tens of thousands of calls for assistance from members of the public.

Credit: Images By Tang Ming TungLisa SmythTwitterOctober   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailMore women than men are being tested and becoming infected with coronavirus, despite men being more likely to die from coronavirus in the first year of the pandemic.According to figures on the Department of Health’s dashboard, there were , Covid- related deaths in females and , in males throughout the pandemic. One was ‘not known’.While more men have died from Covid- compared to women, official figures suggest more women are being tested for the virus.Statistics released yesterday show , women had been tested for Covid- over the previous week, compared to , men.There isn’t evidence to suggest that females are more susceptible to the infection or that they are more likely to experience symptoms, which would obviously result in more women and girls being tested.However, we do know that women are generally more likely to go to the doctor when they have a health concern.Professor Ian Young, Northern Ireland’s chief scientic adviser, said: “We know that women are generally more likely to seek medical attention when unwell, and they are certainly more likely to get tested for Covid when compared with men.”Another possible explanation — it is believed that some people are deliberately avoiding being tested so they don’t have to isolate and, with men the chief breadwinner in many households, it could be they simply can’t afford to take time off work.Looking to the number of people testing positive, females more than males are becoming infected.While the figures are likely to be influenced by the fact more females are being tested, therefore more infections are being picked up in females than males, it is believed this isn’t the only contributing factor.Looking at the dashboard, the disparity according to gender is starker depending on the age of the person.For example, more women aged  to  are testing positive than the males in the same age cohorts.It is believed lestyle, workplace and traditional gender roles mean women in that age group are more likely to come into contact with Covid-.Prof Young explained: “Many women work in roles where they are exposed to multiple contacts, such as healthcare, retail and hospitality, and where it is not possible to work from home.“Women also remain more likely to be the primary carer for children, and will often have closer exposure to children when they are unwell.”Mark Tully, a professor in public health at Ulster University, said: “Some of the data that isn’t yet in the public domain suggests that there’s a dference in the contact profile of males and females.“Men have contacts with larger groups outdoors, so sporting contacts where they might meet up with  other lads to play football outside, whereas females tend to have smaller contact groups, but they spend a longer period together inside.”The biggest disparity on the dashboard is the huge spike in positive cases in children aged between  and , where gender does not appear to be a factor.Over the past week, , girls and  boys have tested positive, so while more girls than boys have been infected, the dference isn’t signicant.Yet the infection rate is considerably higher than in younger children.Prof Young explained: “The reasons for dferences between older and younger children are partly related to dferences in behaviour in dferent age groups, but there is also likely to be a biological component related to changes in hormones which occur around puberty.“In particular, female hormones have a number of beneficial effects on the immune system which help to protect women against the more severe effects of Covid, while male hormones may have some effects which make severe Covid more common.”But Belfast GP Dr Ursula Brennan cautioned that while more women are surviving Covid-, her experience is that they are worse affected by long Covid.Prof Tully added: “It’s important that everyone get a PCR test when they have symptoms and use lateral flow tests regularly as wellthey know they’re going to be in close contact with people.“Regular testing, the vaccines, keeping windows open, face coverings, they will all play an important part in getting us out of this.”Most ReadMagnicent Mourne home is massive, but the heating bills might not be as big as you’d expectPSNI detective got £k overtime on top of salary as

Here is one extract from her soon to be released work.Sir Anthony McCoy, known as ‘AP’, is a former Northern Irish National Hunt jockey. McCoy recorded a phenomenal , winners during his career and was crowned Champion Jockey for  consecutive years, every year that he was a professional. He lives in England with his we and two children.I grew up in the small Catholic village of Moneyglass in County Antrim, one of two counties in Ireland with a Protestant majority.In Moneyglass we thought of ourselves as Irish. Our culture was self-contained. I went to mass I attended a Catholic school and I played Gaelic football for the local GAA club. I considered myself Irish then, still do and always will.That is not to say that we were sectarian or hostile to the unionists of the surrounding area. In fact, one of the most influential people in my young le and career as a jockey was a local Protestant horse trainer, Billy Rock. He bought a horse from my father, and the two became close friends. It was through Billy that my love of horses began and was nourished. I was so obsessed with horses that Billy’s religion didn’t matter to me at all. What Billy told me about horses was more important to me at that time than what I heard at mass on Sundays. Billy was someone who had a huge impact on me and moulded me as a person. He used to wind my parents up that he was going to dress me like an Orangeman and bring me to the Twelfth of July march.Years later, I went to work for Jim Bolger, horse trainer, in Kilkenny. It was New Year , and I invited my two workmates to come home with me to Moneyglass for New Year. They were  years old, and one came from Kildare and the other from Mayo. ‘No f**king way I’m going up there’, was the colourful reply. They were talking about the North of Ireland asit was on the other side of the world. At that time, it may as well have been.Northern Ireland’s history has been sad, in so many ways, yet now most visitors that come to the North don’t think twice about it with the buzz of Belfast city, beautul scenery, our coastline and world class golf courses in places such as Portrush. We have a lot to be proud of, and yet we could do better in promoting it, and retaining our talented young people rather than them having to move away.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up During my career, I had the privilege of being invited to Stormont, in which I had a long chat with Martin McGuinness about the past, future and even about his meeting with the Queen. I believe that the arrangement and interaction between himself and Ian Paisley changed the North of Ireland for the better, and it would be a better place todaythey had a longer time working together in power.Recently, the North has undergone a period of great change, especially with Brexit. Yet perhaps this could be a time for creating a plan to bring all the people together. A plan that would create optimism and a new energy for everyone, and make the North a place where more people would want to live and work and invest in.I’ve lived in England since , have cemented roots and have raised my family here, yet there is no place in the world like Ireland. Our friendliness makes us unique. I’ve been used to people saying hello as you walk down a street all my le, even strangers, which is something you don’t see in other places. My children hold Irish passports, yet my daughter show jumps for Great Britain, with the Union Jack flag on her jacket. I would never have imagined that being a possibility when I was growing up.In , I passed Gordon Richards’ total of race wins and afterwards I received an invitation from the Home Office to receive an MBE at Buckingham Palace. I rang my mother and talked it over with her. She was a woman who had strong Republican views, and she understood the complexities of the invitation.Having thought it over, she eventually advised me to accept it, saying that I had lived in England a long time, was rearing my family there and that it was the right thing to do.But on every invitation date that was sent to me for going to Buckingham Palace I was busy racing. So, after many rearranged invitations, the Mayor of Oxford had to hand deliver it to me at home. I’m sure he wasn’t too pleased!Then in  I won the Grand National and received another letter from the Home Office to award me an OBE. So, I said to myself, I had better attend this time. I went up and stood in front of the Queen and my jaw dropped when she said, ‘it’s nice of you to show up this time’. I made an apology about my racing schedule, and she smiled and said, ‘You don’t have to apologise to me. I read the Racing Post every day, I knew exactly where you were’.When I retired in , I got the news that I had been awarded a Knighthood. I rang my mother who, upon hearing this, said: ‘I’m going to have to go into hiding around here now!’.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadMagnicent Mourne home is massive, but the heating bills might not be as big as you’d expectDonaldson’s threat to collapse Stormont spooks rally bossesPoliticians pay tribute to Sir David Amess after ‘frightening’ stabbing incidentPSNI detective got £k overtime on top of salary as force’s bill hits £k a dayAm I going to die tonight  Singer Brian Kennedy grateful to be alive after heart attackTop VideosPlayKatrina Rainey Knockloughrim killing: Mancharged with murder of womanPlayFuneral held for Chieftains founder Paddy MoloneyPlayVideo: Garfield Beattie found guilty of sending threat signed by UVFLatest Northern IrelandJoe Gormley: Cltonville have faith in me so I don’t have to prove doubters wrong...

Credit: Europa Press via Getty ImagesOctober   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA long time ago in a town not far away, my great grandparents, James and Annie Murphy, opened a petrol station.Murphy’s Garage, where the Pond Park Road meets the Antrim Road in Lisburn, was a trendsetter of its day. At the dawn of the motor age, they had the foresight to see the future. There was business to be had. It could well have been the first of its kind in the Co Antrim town .They passed on almost a letime ago now. They probably didn’t look far enough into the future to see the billion-dollar industry that petroleum would become.Read MoreNI fuel prices: postcode lottery for motorists as UK average per litre risesFuel, they likely figured all those years ago, would become a necessity. Sadly, those behind the big businesses that power the world around us know it’s a necessity too.I can’t survive without a car. There’s a limited bus service where I live, so any thought of getting to the office in Belfast without a car doesn’t even get off the starting grid.Take a train  You’re having a laugh.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up I’m a prisoner to my car and captive to whatever price companies want to charge me to keep it moving in the direction I need it to go.I remember a few years ago being rather excited when the price of a litre of diesel fell under £.The common person is but a plaything for the multi-billionaire tycoons who have the world in a vice-like grip.Over the past few weeks, we have seen the chaos that can be caused when we are held to ransom as petrol shortage fears spread across forecourts in England, with motorists appearing on TV news stations bemoaning the fact they had been driving all day just to fill up their tanks We need petrol. The suppliers know we need petrol. One plus the other equals a captive market — and we will pay whatever it takes to get what we need.I loathe paying for fuel. It’s not something I particularly want.I watch the miles-to-go dial on the instrument  of my car drip inexorably downwards. Sometimes I try and make it home without having to stop, my own little dare.These past two weeks, the world’s TV has been dominated by a new Korean phenomenon. Squid Game plays the rich against the rest. The have-nots, drained of all their money, no more than toys to amuse the haves. Squids produce oil. It might not be the sort that powers our world, but the link is there.The majority of us don our teal-green tracksuits and try to survive in the lopsided world of the few lording it over the many in a playground for the mega-rich paid for by those who can’t afford it.You wonder how they survived during lockdown.Like many, I worked from home. I didn’t line their silk pockets with an average of £ a month to get myself from A to B and back again.There was always a fear that we’d pay for it in the long run.It might not get to the stage when people go to work to earn the money to allow them to get to work, but it edges closer with every passing price hike.Cars will never be eliminated.

They will receive a National Trust voucher to the value of pound. Aine and John began growing their own food this year after signing up to the National Lottery funded Acorn FarmI can growproject which involves  local families being mentored by a horticulturalist in growing their own fruit and vegetables over an-monthperiod. googletag.cmd.push Participants have received raised beds, seedlings and guidance on how to nurture their plants. Primary one teacher, Aine Kivlehan, said: Weve never won anything before, so this is a lovely surprise. Its incredibly satisfying eating a meal with ingredients grown in your garden. My son John really enjoys it too and we both find its a great way to relax. Im hoping to set up a little gardening club for some local children in the coming months to pass on some of the lessons weve learned as part of the wonderful Acorn Farm I can grow project. We are just so delighted to be part of this and to be given the opportunity to do something so positive for our environment. Having done a little bit of growing in the past, Aine was excited to see the Acorn FarmI can growprojects call out for interest to people in the Derry City and Strabane District area and signed up to be part of it. John really loves checking on the veg and watering the plants and Ive enjoyed getting some tips from the horticulturalist which Ive passed onto friends. Its lovely being able to lt something from your back garden and bring it into the kitchen to cook for dinner. It has been catching too with neighbours popping over to have a look and being inspired to give growing a go themselves.     Mayor Warke congratulated the pair, saying, It fills me with pride to see a local family like the Kivlehans doing their bit for the environment and turning their hand to growing their own food. Not only is this a lovely bonding activity for families, but it saves money and helps our environment too, reducing our reliance on importing fruit and vegetables from farther afield. This helps cut carbon emissions and eases the pressures on nature. One of the positive things about the pandemic is how it has prompted people to connect to nature and start thinking about the journey of food and how we can become more self-sufficient and sustainable.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man disqualied after witnesses followed him home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCity of Derry airport welcomes a new route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have urged the public in Derry to be vigilant towards scammersLocal NewsPolice warn Derry smartphone users of scammers overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Nadine, second from left, ACA fellow Last Singer Standing judges, Joey Fatone andSamantha Mumba, and series presenter Nicky Byrne, right.

Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man disqualied after witnesses followed him home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCity of Derry airport welcomes a new route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have urged the public in Derry to be vigilant towards scammersLocal NewsPolice warn Derry smartphone users of scammers overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Nadine, second from left, ACA fellow Last Singer Standing judges, Joey Fatone andSamantha Mumba, and series presenter Nicky Byrne, right.

Rory Conway, of Roshure Road, Magherafelt, contested a charge of driving with excess alcohol on his breath at Magherafelt Magistrates Court last week. The court heard from a police constable who had attended a call from two female witnesses who had followed the defendant home along the Draperstown Road and Roshure Road on September  . googletag.cmd.push The constable told the court he spoke to the witnesses outside the property who said they had seen the defendant at a petrol station in Draperstown and observing he was driving all over the road, had followed him and called the police. After speaking with the witnesses, the constable located a car in the driveway of the house on Roshure Road, and noted the bonnet was still warm. Conways partner answered the door, and when askedthe owner of the vehicle was home, the defendant, who had been in bed, appeared downstairs. The constable noted a smell of intoxicating liquor from Conway and conducted a preliminary breath test, where a reading of mg was recorded. The defendant was then arrested and taken to custody and on leaving after police interview, said: “Boys, it would have been worseyoud got me in the car.” Defence for Conway argued that as the comment had not been taken down in the constables notebook and read and signed by the defendant, it was inadmissible in court. They also said there was no evidence of the defendant driving the car, as both his partner and father had access to it.     The constable said he was not aware of anyone  inside the property at the time, and that the witnesses had described a male suspect. Statements given by the witnesses were then partially read out in court by Judge Mullan. One witness said she had observed Conway getting out of the car and urinating against the garage, before she asked him: “What do you think youre doing ” The statement said the defendant replied “What ” and moved towards the car, prompting the witness to ask: “Where are you going  You nearly caused an accident there.” Conway replied “Im sorry, Im going to my bed,” before the witness went round the back of the house and observed him at the side window with no shirt on, looking out at them. Counsel for the defence said the details in the statement meant that the witnesses should have been able to identy the defendant as part of the Viper procedure, which they were unable to do. Summing up, they told the court the defendant had not been detected driving the vehicle, that his unsolicited comment had been inadmissible and that he had not been identied by witnesses. The prosecution submitted that Conway was the owner of the vehicle and that there were two witnesses to his driving who were so concerned they had followed him home. Police had found the bonnet of the car to be warm, had spoken to the defendant and noted there didnt appear to be anyone  in the house. It was also noted Conway did not deny the charge at interview. Judge Mullan found the defendant guilty of driving with excess alcohol on his breath, and said the failure of the defence to call Conway to give evidence was a factor in the decision. She disqualied the defendant from driving for a period of  months, and issued a fine of pound, alongside an offenders levy of pound.

Ryanair have confirmed they will operate three weekly flights between Derry and Manchester, England, from Winter . The airline have launched a seat sale to celebrate the announcement of the new route, and their Director of Commercial, Jason McGuinness, said they remain committed to growing their passenger network. googletag.cmd.push Ryanair remains committed to re-building Europe’s aviation and tourism industry by restoring connectivity and growing its network of passengers to over  million by , he said. As Ryanair takes delivery of  additional Boeing - ‘Gamechanger’ aircraft this winter, we are delighted to add this new route from Derry to Manchester. Local MLA for Foyle, Sinead McLaughlin, welcomed news of the new service. This route has long been an ambition of the airport and I congratulate the airports leadership, and Derry City and Strabane District Council as the owners, for getting this over the line, she said. Connections with Manchester are really important for our local economy, as well as being a key destination for study and social reasons. Manchester is a vibrant and dynamic city, which is becoming increasingly signicant within Britain as an economic hub. Creating business links between the two cities could be extremely beneficial for Derry. The City of Derry Airport provides important economic benefits for Derry, as well as the wider region on both sides of the border. It is essential that the Executive and the British and Irish governments provide the ongoing financial support it needs, not just to survive but to expand.

The SDLP leader said that the proposals presented by the Commission this week demonstrate generous flexibility and has called on the British Government to show the same willingness to reach an accommodation. Following the call, Colum Eastwood called on DUP Leader Jeffrey Donaldson to withdraw his threat to collapse the devolved institutions in light of the signicant movement made by EU leaders. googletag.cmd.push Colum Eastwood MP said: “We have had further useful dialogue with Maroš Šefčovič this afternoon. The SDLP is very pleased with the flexibility that the European Commission has shown and the proposals that are now on the table. It is time that we see a similar willingness to reach an honourable accommodation from the British Government. “There will now be a period of intense negotiation. That should be a constructive and relentlessly positive engagement aimed at securing a resolution. I hope that the briefing and counter briefing that has characterised previous talks, particularly in the British Press, will not come to define this negotiation. “In the spirit of seeking accommodation, Jeffrey Donaldson should now withdraw his threat to collapse devolved government in Northern Ireland. Unionism has achieved its goals, there is no further price to be extracted. Continuing to make undeliverable demands around the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice is a hiding to nothing.”     ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man disqualied after witnesses followed him home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCity of Derry airport welcomes a new route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have urged the public in Derry to be vigilant towards scammersLocal NewsPolice warn Derry smartphone users of scammers overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Nadine, second from left, ACA fellow Last Singer Standing judges, Joey Fatone andSamantha Mumba, and series presenter Nicky Byrne, right.

Doherty, was a French teacher at Oakgrove College, before a combination of ill-health and redundancy left him twiddling his thumbs at home. Being an aficionado of words, he decided to put those thumbs – and fingers – to artistic use and create the spoonerism series. googletag.cmd.push Spoonerisms derive from error in speech in which corresponding letters are switched between two words in a phrase. The label takes its name from Oxford Don and cleric, William Archibald Spooner who would regularly do this. Sean, who is of the same family that own the citys famous Doherty Meats, said: “I would always do crosswords in the newspapers and I do love words. Sometimes I would spoonerise stuff in my head.  Spooner tries his luck at running a coffee shop. Pic: Sean Doherty “I started noting them down andthey amused me, I would then create wee scenarios for them. “To be honest, I couldnt draw to save myself and I am aware that the cartoons are less than professional. “I was running around trying to get quotes from people to have my cartoons done professionally but the cheapest quote I got was fty pounds a frame. “The wolves are not at the door, but I am on benefits at the minute. The house is paid for and my we is still working, but I still have two children at university so I cant be paying out that much for a professional cartoonist.     “I have a couple of hundred of drawings already created. Even to produce a set of ten would set me back five hundred quid. “I did a google search and came across a teach-yourself-how-to-do-cartoons programme. I went on there and used that to create my spoonerism characters. “The original Spooner was a nineteenth century cleric so naturally, I made one of my main protagonists a cleric as well – a bit like the Father Brown character on TV. “The we character is the one who interprets the spoonerisms, the mistakes with a for flips sake what are you at  and so on. “The cartoons Ive done are very rudimentary but I think as Ive been bouncing along, I got slightly better at it.” As mentioned earlier, Doherty has suffered with ill-health over the last few years with two bouts of Non-Hodgkins Lymphona leading him to take a redundancy offer from Oakfield College and take a break from teaching. He added: “I have had a colourful health history. I have had a number of things over the last ten years. “Im a teacher by trade having taught French at Oakgrove College. I dont do that anymore having had to take my redundancy. “I had my large bowel removed and a stoma bag installed. I recovered from that and went back to work. A couple of years after that, I had massive seizures and was diagnosed with osteoporosis. I broke a dozen bones – including my hip and backbone. “I was in hospital for a month after that. I recovered, went back to work and then I was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma cancer. That was around three or four years ago. “I was successfully treated for it. I was within a few days of being officially declared as being two years clear when I took ill again and found the Non-Hodgkins had ed. “When you get cancer once, your chances of survival are good. When you get it a second time, it can be bleak. “I was lucky enough to have a doctor who was fantastic. He got me onto a thing called Car T Cell Treatment in London. “Its a radical, new treatment, What happens there is they take a sample of your bone marrow and have it sent away to a facility the Netherlands, They convert the bone marrow to fight the cancer internally. “Unfortunately it makes you sick as a pig as you have no immune system. I was in hospital for quite a long time in London. But it was successful – so far, so good, touch wood. “I got sent back to Derry literally just before the pandemic. Im still classied as being clinically extremely vulnerable. “In the middle of all that, I was offered a redundancy from teaching. Being extremely clinically vulnerable and going into eight or nine classrooms a day with dferent sets of pupils is not recommended. “My plan A had been to work as a substitute teacher – and I would have got plenty of work being a language teacher. “But the doctor in London said to leave it until next April and then we could revisit that. For now, I was told that I was not to work as a teacher.”  Spooners Quadrophenia party takes a wrong turn. Pic: Sean Doherty While Doherty awaits for the doctors to give him the green light to resume his teaching career, the Spooner cartoons keep him busy and hopefully someone somewhere might offer him the chance to showcase his material to a wider audience. He said: “I do not claim to be some sort of great artist, but what I have managed to start doing is to give them a character, give them a continued presence and to visually represent a joke. “You might not go oh that is a wonderful cartoon there, but you might see the joke. If youre a wordy sort of a person, you will get the joke. “Of course some might not get the joke and find it funny but I do think there is a niche for spoonerism cartoons.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man disqualied after witnesses followed him home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCity of Derry airport welcomes a new route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have urged the public in Derry to be vigilant towards scammersLocal NewsPolice warn Derry smartphone users of scammers overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Nadine, second from left, ACA fellow Last Singer Standing judges, Joey Fatone andSamantha Mumba, and series presenter Nicky Byrne, right.

The scheme is a recycling initiative which he had championed during his time as Environment Minister and has worked to progress in recent years. In response to an Assembly Question tabled by Mr Durkan, the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , Edwin Poots reaffirmed his commitment to introduce the scheme, following the department’s joint consultation with DAERA and the Welsh Government. googletag.cmd.push The Foyle MLA said: “I’m pleased that work is continuing to progress a depositscheme for Northern Ireland. “This is a scheme which began work on during my time as Environment Minister, having seen their benefits in other countries. “Unfortunately, at that time my attempts were met with some resistance, both politically and commercially. “In February , the Executive supported my calls for the introduction of a depositscheme and committed to the North’s participation in a proposed UK-wide rollout. I welcome that the consultation process has been completed and welcome Minister Poots commitment to delivering this scheme and move towards a circular economy. “While awareness in recent years has improved where recycling is concerned, we are still not at the level we need to be. “A cash incentive under a Deposit Return Scheme, in my opinion, is the best way forward and will encourage an uptake in recycling. “Our throw-away culture is completely unsustainable and our planet is bearing the brunt of it. “In recent years, we have witnessed a growing realisation that action must be taken by governments, businesses and iniduals to address the damage being done to our environment.     “I would like to see this scheme expanded to include cans and plastic bottles, building on the success of the carrier bag levy, to tackle the scourge of single use plastic on our communities. “I hope the Minister will revisit an all-island approach for this initiative but for now it is crucial that we push forward on implementing this environmentally transformative scheme without further delay. “ ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man disqualied after witnesses followed him home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCity of Derry airport welcomes a new route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have urged the public in Derry to be vigilant towards scammersLocal NewsPolice warn Derry smartphone users of scammers overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Nadine, second from left, ACA fellow Last Singer Standing judges, Joey Fatone andSamantha Mumba, and series presenter Nicky Byrne, right.

The scheme is a recycling initiative which he had championed during his time as Environment Minister and has worked to progress in recent years. In response to an Assembly Question tabled by Mr Durkan, the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , Edwin Poots reaffirmed his commitment to introduce the scheme, following the department’s joint consultation with DAERA and the Welsh Government. googletag.cmd.push The Foyle MLA said: “I’m pleased that work is continuing to progress a depositscheme for Northern Ireland. “This is a scheme which began work on during my time as Environment Minister, having seen their benefits in other countries. “Unfortunately, at that time my attempts were met with some resistance, both politically and commercially. “In February , the Executive supported my calls for the introduction of a depositscheme and committed to the North’s participation in a proposed UK-wide rollout. I welcome that the consultation process has been completed and welcome Minister Poots commitment to delivering this scheme and move towards a circular economy. “While awareness in recent years has improved where recycling is concerned, we are still not at the level we need to be. “A cash incentive under a Deposit Return Scheme, in my opinion, is the best way forward and will encourage an uptake in recycling. “Our throw-away culture is completely unsustainable and our planet is bearing the brunt of it. “In recent years, we have witnessed a growing realisation that action must be taken by governments, businesses and iniduals to address the damage being done to our environment.     “I would like to see this scheme expanded to include cans and plastic bottles, building on the success of the carrier bag levy, to tackle the scourge of single use plastic on our communities. “I hope the Minister will revisit an all-island approach for this initiative but for now it is crucial that we push forward on implementing this environmentally transformative scheme without further delay. “ ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man disqualied after witnesses followed him home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCity of Derry airport welcomes a new route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have urged the public in Derry to be vigilant towards scammersLocal NewsPolice warn Derry smartphone users of scammers overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Nadine, second from left, ACA fellow Last Singer Standing judges, Joey Fatone andSamantha Mumba, and series presenter Nicky Byrne, right.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.         Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.         Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

Picture: Nicola Coyle, Irish Whale and Dolphin Group Reporter: Declan Magee Oct Email: declan.magee@iconicnews.ie  addthis, A live pilot whale has been washed up on a Donegal beach. The six-metre whale was found on Rossnowlagh beach on Thursday morning. The live stranding was reported to the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group at around am. The organisation has sent a stranding volunteer to the scene. Stephanie Levesque, stranding officer with the group, said indications are that the whale has become stranded due to illness. googletag.cmd.push “Pilot whales are s relatively common sights but live strandings don’t happen that often but, but they are not extremely rare,” she said. She said consultations with a vet about the condition of the whale suggest that it is ill. “It seems that it has washed up because it is sick.” She said it is important that any strandings of live or dead whales, dolphins or porpoises are reported to the group.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.”     For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man disqualied after witnesses followed him home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCity of Derry airport welcomes a new route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have urged the public in Derry to be vigilant towards scammersLocal NewsPolice warn Derry smartphone users of scammers overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Nadine, second from left, ACA fellow Last Singer Standing judges, Joey Fatone andSamantha Mumba, and series presenter Nicky Byrne, right.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Oct Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Derry City  St. Patrick’s Athletic  Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe’s second half header was enough to earn Derry City their first win over St. Patrick’s Athletic at the fourth attempt this season. The striker struck midway through the second half to earn a big three points for the Candystripes in a dramatic encounter which saw both teams finish with  men. googletag.cmd.push Pat’s were on top for most of the game up until Junior’s goal, missing a series of chances in the first half alone. The visitors started the game on the front foot and almost got their reward when Sam Bone’s cross found Matty Smith, and his header beat Nathan Gartside but came back off the post. Matty Smith then missed when one on one with Gartside, before Chris Forrester hit the crossbar. It was City though who took the lead on  minutes. There seemed little on when substitute Jack Malone’s pass sent Jamie McGonigle racing down the right, but the striker produced a sensational cross right into the heart of the area for Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe, who simply had to nod City into a lead they had not been threatening. The game exploded into drama on  minutes when Ronan Coughlan, on the pitch just  minutes, was red carded for elbowing Ciaran Coll. Danny Lafferty, already on a yellow card, was also sent off for his part in the melee which followed the elbow, with both team playing the final five minutes down to  men.     Pat’s, still searching for an equaliser, came so close to a goal in the aftermath, but were denied by a brilliant double save from Gartside, who parried Matty Smith’s shot and then reacted to save from Benson as Derry survived again.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Oct Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Derry City  St. Patrick’s Athletic  Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe’s second half header was enough to earn Derry City their first win over St. Patrick’s Athletic at the fourth attempt this season. The striker struck midway through the second half to earn a big three points for the Candystripes in a dramatic encounter which saw both teams finish with  men. googletag.cmd.push Pat’s were on top for most of the game up until Junior’s goal, missing a series of chances in the first half alone. The visitors started the game on the front foot and almost got their reward when Sam Bone’s cross found Matty Smith, and his header beat Nathan Gartside but came back off the post. Matty Smith then missed when one on one with Gartside, before Chris Forrester hit the crossbar. It was City though who took the lead on  minutes. There seemed little on when substitute Jack Malone’s pass sent Jamie McGonigle racing down the right, but the striker produced a sensational cross right into the heart of the area for Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe, who simply had to nod City into a lead they had not been threatening. The game exploded into drama on  minutes when Ronan Coughlan, on the pitch just  minutes, was red carded for elbowing Ciaran Coll. Danny Lafferty, already on a yellow card, was also sent off for his part in the melee which followed the elbow, with both team playing the final five minutes down to  men.     Pat’s, still searching for an equaliser, came so close to a goal in the aftermath, but were denied by a brilliant double save from Gartside, who parried Matty Smith’s shot and then reacted to save from Benson as Derry survived again.

at half time.Downpatrick were desperately unlucky not to find the back of the net just minutes into the second half,as McGrady ran clear of the defenders after a looping ball over the topseemed to have caught Clonduff napping.With lsquokeeper Gribben already off his line, he made the decision to challenge McGrady in an aerial dual that the Downpatrick number  managed to win.However, his slapped effort over the head of the Clonduff custodian clipped back off the post and backinto the possession of the grateful Yellas.A minute later and the Hoops were back threatening the opposition defence, but Clonduff held firm when Branniganrsquos lsquorsquo effort dropped into the danger zone.Barry OrsquoHagan punished the Hoops for not taking their chances as his free sailed over the bar, before Downpatrickrsquos Oran Cunningham saw his effort drt wide at the other end.Charlie Carr extended his sidersquos lead with his second point of the game, although Tim Prenter managed to keep the RGU in touch with a no-nonsense score.McConville restored the margin with a left footed strike before his free pushed his side further in front.Darren OrsquoHagan showed no signs of slowing down as he began bossing play with piercing runs and cute passing, allowing the Yellas to put a foothold on the game.Doherty saw his free drt wide off the mark before Close punished the Hoops with a finely taken point to close out the action before the second water-break.Downpatrick knew the clock was against them, but they werenrsquot quite at panic station yet, as Brannigan converted yet another free after teammate Sean Bell was fouled.Clonduff midfielder Ross Carr pointed immediately after before Brannigan once more replied with a free.However, Darren OrsquoHagan began the move that would decide the match, after a string of neat passes and clever off the ball movement allowed his brother Barry to nip in behind the Downpatrick defence before calmly slotting home into the bottom right corner.The now six-point advantage truly seemed to deflate the Downpatrick side who now knew it would take something very special to force extra-time.Despite a Brannigan free, McConville wrapped up the scoring with a lovely left footed strike to ensure it was his Clonduff outfit who would enter the semi-final draw.This signalled the end of the road for the Downpatrick men, who gave a great account of themselves in this yearrsquos competition.Downpatrick: J Deeny, E Rooney , A Doherty, R Murphy, S Bell, J Bell, C Doherty , D Turley, C McCarron, T Prenter , G Collins, C McGrady , J Brannigan , O Cunningham, C Mooney.Subs: T Smyth, P Turley, A Og Robinson, M Fitzpatrick, T Louden, T McNeill, N Cunningham, D Brannf, T Savage, C Boyd, R Og Quinn, C Farrell, G Trainor.Clonduff: P Gribben, J OrsquoHagan, D OrsquoHagan, T McEvoy, L Branagan, C Carr , J Gribben, R Carr, A Carr , T Close , P OrsquoHagan, B OrsquoHagan , A McConville , S McConville, E Brown.Subs: N Trainor, C Brown, R Brannigan, S McGreevy, P Lively, R Lively, T McGreevy, B McConville, P Wilson, J Boden, M McPolin, K OrsquoHagan, F McConville..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Co.jpg","title":"Co Down Rural Community opens new hub in Newcastle  ","story":"THE Co Down Rural Community Network has opened a new wellbeing hub in Newcastle.The new facility is intended to be a central point in the resort to make it easier for people to access information, advice and support and participate in activities to improve their mental and physical health and wellbeing.It will work with iniduals, community members, local groups, and multi-disciplinary teamsto identy community needs and facilitate better access to mental health and wellbeing training and resources.The opening of the new hub is the culmination of the Community Network working with local GPs and primary care teams and the wider community for over  years.Over the past three years, the network has linked up with the MDTs in the local primary care practices.The network has a team of social prescribers and an MDT coordinator who take referrals from GP practices, pharmacists and from other sources and find solutions for people who may be affected by physical limitations or mental health issues or who simply feel isolated in their own homes.This work has intensied during the Covid pandemic, making the opening of the hub even more timely.A total of  people have been referred by the local GPs and their teams to the Community Network since January this year in addition to the  clients that the Social Prescribing team have been working with since .Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairwoman Cathy Mason, who officially opened the news hub on Monday, has described it as a ldquogreat asset for the Community Network team and those who formerly operated a connect and chat service.ldquoGroups of all sorts now have a base to operate from in a beautul and peaceful location.

The project manager Mr Mike Gibb, said Delamont had always been his first option but he could no longer afford to wait on the council.Mr Gibbrsquos announcement dashes hopes that the centre, which is destined to become the largest owl and birds of prey rescue facility in Europe, would come to Killyleagh.Mr Gibb had entered negotiations with Down Council last year regarding the possible construction of the sanctuary at Delamont.But the project became the subject of controversial debates within the council chamber earlier this year amid accusations that council officials were dragging their heels about the proposal, leading Mr Gibb to look for alternative locations.CLOUGH ndash Residents opposing plans for the erection of a BT Cellnet mobile telephone mast in Clough have formed an action group to try and block the plan.At a meeting in the village on Monday, residents got together after they heard local environmentalist, Walter Graham, outlined the drawbacks and health risks associated with these masts.Plans for the -metre mast which,approved, will be sited within the Watsonrsquos filling station complex, were published several weeks ago andaccepted could be operating within months.Up to  residents gathered in the Old School House, just a stonersquos throw from the proposed site, to hear of the risks and implications these masts are believed to cause.Villagers heard how the transmitter could dominate the skyline, towering over homes, a primary school, petrol station and an old peoplersquos home.Claiming that scientists believed the growth of cancers were ldquospurred on by the transmitters, he said. ldquoIf this mast goes up my children are coming out of school, there is no way they will study in the shadow of that mast.

The Trust told us recently that the urgent care centre is lsquomeeting the needs of the publicrsquo but one really has to wonder how this opinion has been formed, said Mrs Trainor.Appealing for increased investment at the Downe site, health campaigners say that the hospital has the capability to do much more.The say the hospitalrsquos bed capacity must be extended to help meet the needs of local communities but also to help address the regional beds shortage caused by the large cut in capacity across Northern Ireland ldquowhich has been brutally exposed during the Covid crisis.The campaigners added: ldquoThe South Eastern Trust should now be looking at a large extension to the hospital, creating new capacity, away from over congested centralised sites, levelling up rural inequality in healthcare provision.

Villa had half chances too at the opposite end with Jake Wilson going close to an equaliser.Then came that dramatic finale. Wilson was presented with a second chance in the box after his initial effort was saved and he produced a stunning finish high into the net from a tight angle.Cue th minute pandemonium and it seemed the tie was set for extra time.But when the game was restarted Killyleagh won a corner and after two blocks at close range the ball was eventually scrambled over the line by Jon Joe Sharvin in the th minute.The huge crowd contained several former players from the first Killyleagh team to win the Border Cup in  and now Paul Sharvin will be hoping his team get a chance to match that Christmas glory.To reach the semi-finals, however, they must beat Crumlin United on November  ndash a chance to avenge an incredible - defeat when the teams last met in this competition exactly two yearsrsquo ago when Killyleagh tossed away a - half-time lead in the last nine minutes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Slieve.jpg","title":"Slieve Donard sold for £40m  ","story":"NEWCASTLErsquoS iconic Slieve Donard Resort and Spa has been sold in a poundm deal to American investors.Owned by the Hastings family since , the world famous five-star hotel has been acquired by US-based AJ Capital Partners which is planning a major upgrade.After weeks of speculation that the hotel had been sold, the news was finally confirmed last Thursday with the new owner a Nashville-headquartered real estate developer and hotel operator with more than  hotels across the US and Britain, including St Andrews in Scotland.Announcing that the Newcastle hotel has been acquired, AJ Capital also confirmed that renovation work is planned to start in October next year, with the work completed by the following spring.During the planned upgrade, the hotel will remain closed.Howard Hastings mdash the managing director of Hastings Hotels mdash described AJ Capital Partnersrsquos acquisition of the Slieve Donard Resort and Spa as ldquoencouraging news for hospitality and tourism in Northern Ireland.He said it also represented a boost for the burgeoning golf tourism industry which ldquohas been an important driver of local tourism in recent years and shows signicant growth potential in the future.Mr Hastings added: ldquoI have every confidence that AJ Capital Partners will be sympathetic to the heritage of the hotel and that, under their leadership, it will continue to flourish and maintain its reputation as an iconic destination in Northern Ireland.ldquoThis investment is a strong sign of confidence in the local market by a major international hotel operator with exciting ambitions for the Slieve Donard in the coming years.

I have a particular problem with butter balls. They are horrible, liable to crack your jaw and I remember a now long dearly departed aunt repeatedly sucking on them at church, and offering me one to sweeten a tedium I knew could only be endured with stony faced compliance.There is no amount of sexy or stylish or slick advertising, not even a nationwide campaign with Kate Moss sporting one between her teeth, that could bring back the butter ball in any way that would ever make it fashionable or appealing again to those beneath octogenarian status.

The author and teacher regards motherhood as her proudest achievementNot that Erskine doesn’t do humour, she does with gusto, but she also “wants people to be moved” by her precise rendering of all the absurd tragicomedy of le as it is lived every day.Erskine, an avid fan of “s girl groups, New Wave and psychedelic music” who gets a glowing . out of  on the Rate My Teacher website for her role at the prestigious east Belfast institution that boasts alumni such as Margaret Mumfordand novelist Lucy Caldwell, dismisses the notion that the ordinary lives of the people of her native city are somehow not rich enough to make appropriate thematic material for fiction.“Somebody might say ‘Oh, you write stories about ordinary people.’ And my response is, yes, but who are these extraordinary people you are talking about  “Because strip away status and artice and we are all ordinary people. Plus, once you get to know ordinary people and understand their lives, they become extraordinary, inidual, special and just as worthy of literary analysis as some powerful hero or heroine.”Erskine, who has a massively high score on the Rate My Teacher website, has just been appointed a fellow of the Seamus Heaney Centre at Queens University Belfast. She is delighted by the opportunity to help fledgling writers improve their creative effortsShe continues: “People ask of my writing, “Is everything going to be set in East Belfast ’ As though people who live in London have lives that are more complex or more exciting, by virtue of the fact that they live in a big metropolis, whereas I really do think I could write collection after collection about people who live on streets here similar to the one I live on. I think their lives are just as rich as any.”So too does she deride the notion that local fiction has some kind of moral imperative to focus on the  years of conflict that so disturbed our peace. Erskine believes that the literary imagination should have unbridled permission to roam free through whatever territory it is intent on exploring: “If you come from Northern Ireland you have an absolute prerogative to write about whatever you wish, whether that is the Troubles, the post-Troubles landscape or novels about turtles or about people playing the guitar or about landscape gardeners. “There shouldn’t be any expectation about what you decide to write about. ANGEL FACE: Wendy as a baby, long, long before literary fame beckoned“With me, what I’m thinking about is that there is no sort of homogenous Northern Ireland le where you live or whatever social class you come from doesn’t mean that your experience is any less worthy of exploration or any less profound.”She is interested in characters on the margins navigating lives that may seem nondescript from the outside, but are charged with an emotional valence, poignancy and levity so that, as Erskine intends, “people may laugh, but I also very much want them to be moved. I could write a story that is simply funny ha-ha, but that would not be true to the complexity of human experience. “In the same way to centre my literary focus solely on melancholy would also be to deny that le is an absurd tragicomedy composed of darkness and light. To go back to Blake, “joy and woe are woven fine”.“That is very much the philosophy behind the fiction I try to write.”‘QUIET STOICISM OF ULSTER PEOPLE COMPELLS ME’Erskine’s first foray into creative writing began when she was offered an afternoon off amidst her hectic schedule as head of the English department at Strathearn Grammar.Though tempted to “join the gym, volunteer in an art gallery or mooch around coffee shops reading magazines or watching make-up tutorial videos on YouTube which I endlessly love,”, she saw a Facebook ad for a six-month writing course at the Irish Writers Centre, a lofty Georgian edice on Dublin’s Parnell Square, run by The Stinging Fly magazine. She committed to it in  after submitting a story named Locksmiths, the idea for which came to her while regrouting her bathroom floor and stripping away the layers of paint and wallpaper left by previous owners of her home.It is about a woman engaged in the optimism of a DIY project while the Troubles rage on her doorstep: “I’m interested in people on the side-lines, those who aren’t the centre of attention, the lives quietly lived. There are plenty of characters like that in the collection. Quiet stoicism compells me.” ‘I LOVE THE CITY, CONCRETE, TOWER BLOCKS, STREETS, BOOKSHOPS AND MARGARITAS’Wendy had a happy childhood, and with her brother would be taken to the library once a week by their mother,who kept “random” books in the family home in Jordanstown.She inherited her mother’s love of reading, and delighted in creative writing exercises at Belfast High School, situated between Whiteabbey and Greenisland: “We used to be given a Mars bar at the end of the classwe did well, which was absolutely blissful for me.”She went on to study English at university in Glasgow before going into teaching there and then in Newcastle Upon Tyne before relocating to home, sweet home.“I always wanted to study English, because reading was my thing more than anything . I think Hemingway said that ‘the good parts of a book may be only something a writer is lucky enough to overhear, or it may be the wreck of his le, and one is as good as the other.’”Though she is a dedicated teacher who delights in her colleagues, pupils, the discussion of literature and a school she loves so much she has stayed for over two decades, as well as a much feted writer of short stories, Wendy considers her greatest achievement to date as being mum to her two children Mathilda,  and son Bobby, , whom she shares with art teacher Paul, whom she met on herto Belfast in .“I’ve never found parenting stressful, it’s been more like this joyous voyage into uncharted territory and I am very proud of the fact that my children have grown up to become two lovely human beings,” she confides.The secret to her longevity with husband Paul “Spending substantial time apart and having separate interests as well as being able to totally enjoy each other’s company. You need to be self-sufficient iniduals as well as a couple.”And despite being an enormous bookworm, who especially adores the Russian master of the short story Anton Chekov, Wendy is also something of a fashionista who stocks clobber by The Vampire’s We, Isabel Marant and western shirts in her wardrobe as well as a panoply of finds she bought on Ebay for next to nothing. Then too, when not looking cooler than any teacher has a right to in pencil leather skirts with choppy-cut silvery hair and flicky eyeliner, she loves nothing better than wandering through her native Belfast: “I love concrete. I love tower blocks and streets, browsing in bookshops and going to a nice old bar with lots of red velvet for margaritas.”QA: ‘I’D HAVE MARY SHELLY, GENE CLARK AND LOU REED TO DINNER’Tell us some of your earliest childhood memories Hearing my Mum and Dad have a conversation about how they didn’t think The Beatles were that good. Also, trying to bang an Ormeau Easter egg on the side of a chair to break it open to get the little fluffy plastic chick that was inside.School days - what subjects did you excel at and were you ever in trouble Not surprisingly, English was my favourite subject and I always loved it. I don’t think I was a real goodie-goodie though, I always liked make-up, eyeliner, back combing my hair and wearing a lipstick I remember that used to change colour. So I would have got into trouble sometimes because of my attempts at aesthetic improvement, for sure.Who in your le makes you laugh the most Probably my Mum who is . She’s very funny and has a very particular wit and original way of looking at the world. She’s very aware of the ridiculousness of things.Who is your best friend My husband of over  years, Paul.Some of your favourite books The Sound and The Fury by William Faulkner, Sea State by Tabitha Lasley and The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison.Favourite film Once Upon A Time in the West, directed by Sergio Leone.If you could invite anyone from history to an ideal dinner party who would you bring and what would you serve them I would % have Mary Shelley. Then Gene Clark from The Byrds and The Velvet Underground’s Lou Reed. I’d serve a great big plate of nice breads and cheeses and meats so that I could sit and enjoy their company with minimal effort, although I think Mary Shelley was vegetarian, so no meat for her.Can you describe yourself in three words Disciplined, frivolous, observant.How much do you enjoy teaching I’ve worked at Strathearn since  and that is an indicator of how much I love the place. It’s the kind of job where every day is dferent, and there is always something interesting going on. I love the discussion of literature above all.You’ve recently been made a fellow of the Seamus Heaney Centre at Queen’s. What does this mean to you Before I began to write I’d always loved reading other people’s writing, first as a student, then as a teacher. Being a writer can be lonely, so what I really look forward to is being able to help writers, whatever their age or background, find a way to improve their creative endeavours. To collaborate with somebody on making a piece of creative writing as powerful as it can be will be a huge privilege for me.Love is...Essential.The meaning of le is...Not always apparent.Dance Moves by Wendy Erskine will be published by Stinging Fly and Picador in February ."},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/resources/images/13109186.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

The Queen quipped that it had been ldquobad luck when she heard that Commander Lucy DrsquoOrsi had been assigned to be Gold Commander of the police operation around the visit.ndash : Scottish independence referendumThe Queen told a well-wisher that Scots should ldquothink very carefully about the future in the run-up to the independence referendum.She reportedly made the remark while meeting a member of the public outside Crathie Kirk, near her Balmoral estate in Aberdeenshire.Later, former prime minister David Cameron had to apologise to the Queen for revealing that she ldquopurred down the line when he informed her of the result of the referendum.He let slip her relief at the No vote in a conversation with former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg which was picked up by TV microphones. vw,vw,px, px\"The Queen meets Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon at Buckingham Palace ndash : Abu HamzaThe BBC apologised to the Queen for revealing that she had raised concerns with the Government about why radical cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri had not been arrested.Security correspondent Frank Gardner told the Radio  Today programme about the private conversation he had had with the monarch some years earlier, and the BBC said it and Gardner were sorry for the ldquobreach of confidence.Gardner had told Today: ldquoThis is a conversation we had a little while ago and she did say that she had mentioned to ndash I donrsquot know which home secretary it was at the time ndash that was there not some law he had broken ldquoI wouldnrsquot say she was necessarily lobbying, thatrsquos not for me to say, but, like anybody, she was upset that her country and her subjects had been denigrated by this man who was using this country as a  for his very violent, hateful views.ndash : Apartheid regimeA political storm blew up when the Queen was reported to be dismayed by then Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcherrsquos ldquouncaring style of leadership and fearful that her opposition to sanctions on South Africarsquos apartheid regime would destroy the Commonwealth.The reports were described as ldquowithout foundation by Buckingham Palace.There were rumours of a strained relationship with the Queen throughout Mrs Thatcherrsquos premiership. vw,vw,px, px\"The Queen and Margaret Thatcher at the former prime ministerrsquos th birthday in  ndash : American coloniesDuring a visit to the US for the bicentennial celebrations of American independence, the Queen commented on the separation of the American colonies from the British crown, saying the founding fathers taught Britain a ldquovery valuable lesson.ldquoWe lost the American colonies because we lacked that statesmanship to know the right time, and the manner of yielding what is impossible to keep, she said during a speech in Philadelphia.That lesson, she said, helped Britain transform ldquoan Empire into a Commonwealth.ndash : Polio vaccineThe Queen made public her decision to have her children, Prince Charles and Princess Anne, then aged eight and six, inoculated against polio in order to allay public fears about the potential side-effects of the new vaccine.ndash : Suez CrisisA biography of the Queen by historian Ben Pimlott quoted a senior courtier as saying the Queen thought then premier Sir Anthony Eden ldquomad for invading Egypt in the  Suez Crisis..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Queen us comments on climate inaction one of few interventions during long reign article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

With all things considered, officers recommended the delivery of option two.The rural towns officers included in the report are Donaghcloney, Keady, Richhill, Tandragee and Waringstown.DUP group leader, Councillor Mark Baxter proposed the officers’ recommendation to go with the festive drive in experience and said “it would be very welcome, especially in those rural communities”.Councillor Paul Berry welcomed the proposal but noted Markethill was not included in the list of towns mentioned and proposed it was included.Council’s head of economic development services, Nicola Wilson confirmed Markethill could be includedcouncillors want.Noting Council has a duty of care to the general public, Councillor Kyle Savage seconded the proposal to accept the recommendation and praised council officersfor “taking and showing true leadership” with this recommendation.Noting he was happy to go with the proposal for the festive drive-in, despite public health regulations relaxing further at the end of October, Councillor Sam Nicholson said he would second Cllr Berry’s proposal to include Markethill in the proposal.“I support Cllr Berry’s call to include Markethill. It is one of our most thriving and vibrant market towns,” he said.“If Councillor Berry is making a proposal to include it, I am happy to second it.”Alderman Ian Burns said he was fully supportive of the proposal but called for the towns of Gilford and Rathfriland to also be recognised.Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon said he would prefer to see twilight markets in the rural towns but with the movie night proposal he would want to ensure that “providing it can be worked into costs, it is run in as many of our rural towns as possible”.Alderman Jim Speers said he had discussed this issue “at ” with Council officers and acknowledged the need for as many places as possible to get an event like this.“I am very supportive of the need to have this event in Markethill butwe do that in one place other towns will feel they have been short-changed.“I have already had that conversation with officers and I would like to see us get to the point where this is rolled out across the area.”The committee then voiced its approval for Councillor Baxter’s proposal to recommend the movie night and free Christmas Eve car parking is approved and Cllr Berry’s proposal to incorporate as many smaller towns as budgets will allow.Read this:- Driving tests ‘crisis’Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

freshers week around the corner and thousands of young people in Northern Ireland set to start University or new career paths, many will be on the hunt for rented accommodation. Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
